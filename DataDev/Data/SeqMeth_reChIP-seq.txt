Linear amplification of DNA (LinDA) by T7 polymerase is a versatile and robust method for generating sufficient amounts of DNA for genome-wide studies with minute amounts of cells. LinDA can be coupled to a great number of global profiling technologies. Indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) has been achieved for transcription factors and epigenetic modification of chromatin histones with 1,000 to 5,000 cells. LinDA largely simplifies reChIP-seq experiments to monitor co-binding at chromatin target sites. The single-tube design of LinDA is ideal for handling ultrasmall amounts of DNA (&lt;30 pg) and is compatible with automation. The actual hands-on working time is less than 6 h with one overnight reaction. The present protocol describes all materials and critical steps, and provides examples and controls for LinDA. Applications of LinDA for genome-wide analyses of biobank samples and for the study of chromatin conformation and nuclear architecture are in progress.

Genome-wide profiling of transcription factors based on massive parallel sequencing of immunoprecipitated chromatin (ChIP-seq) requires nanogram amounts of DNA. Here we describe a high-fidelity, single-tube linear DNA amplification method (LinDA) for ChIP-seq and reChIP-seq with picogram DNA amounts obtained from a few thousand cells. This amplification technology will facilitate global analyses of transcription-factor binding and chromatin with very small cell populations, such as stem or cancer-initiating cells.
