25686389,3,2015,Nat Methods,Improved data analysis for the MinION nanopore sequencer.,Speed, single-base sensitivity and long read lengths make nanopores a promising technology for high-throughput sequencing. We evaluated and optimized the performance of the MinION nanopore sequencer using M13 genomic DNA and used expectation maximization to obtain robust maximum-likelihood estimates for insertion, deletion and substitution error rates (4.9%, 7.8% and 5.1%, respectively). Over 99% of high-quality 2D MinION reads mapped to the reference at a mean identity of 85%. We present a single-nucleotide-variant detection tool that uses maximum-likelihood parameter estimates and marginalization over many possible read alignments to achieve precision and recall of up to 99%. By pairing our high-confidence alignment strategy with long MinION reads, we resolved the copy number for a cancer-testis gene family (CT47) within an unresolved region of human chromosome Xq24.
26076426,1,2015,Nat Methods,A complete bacterial genome assembled de novo using only nanopore sequencing data.,We have assembled de novo the Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 chromosome in a single 4.6-Mb contig using only nanopore data. Our method has three stages: (i) overlaps are detected between reads and then corrected by a multiple-alignment process; (ii) corrected reads are assembled using the Celera Assembler; and (iii) the assembly is polished using a probabilistic model of the signal-level data. The assembly reconstructs gene order and has 99.5% nucleotide identity.
25648336,1,2015,Nanotechnology,Kinetics of nanopore fabrication during controlled breakdown of dielectric membranes in solution.,Nanopore fabrication by controlled breakdown (CBD) overcomes many of the challenges of traditional nanofabrication techniques, by reliably forming solid-state nanopores sub-2 nm in size in a low-cost and scalable way for nucleic acid analysis applications. Herein, the breakdown kinetics of thin dielectric membranes immersed in a liquid environment are investigated in order to gain deeper insights into the mechanism of solid-state nanopore formation by high electric fields. For various fabrication conditions, we demonstrate that nanopore fabrication time is Weibull-distributed, in support of the hypothesis that the fabrication mechanism is a stochastic process governed by the probability of forming a connected path across the membrane (i.e. a weakest-link problem). Additionally, we explore the roles that various ions and solvents play in breakdown kinetics, revealing that asymmetric pH conditions across the membrane can significantly affect nanopore fabrication time for a given voltage polarity. These results, characterizing the stochasticity of the nanopore fabrication process and highlighting the parameters affecting it, should assist researchers interested in exploiting the potential of CBD for nanofluidic channel fabrication, while also offering guidance towards the conceivable manufacturing of solid-state nanopore-based technologies for DNA sequencing applications.
25648138,1,2015,Nanotechnology,DNA stretching and optimization of nucleobase recognition in enzymatic nanopore sequencing.,In nanopore sequencing, where single DNA strands are electrophoretically translocated through a nanopore and the resulting ionic signal is used to identify the four DNA bases, an enzyme has been used to ratchet the nucleic acid stepwise through the pore at a controlled speed. In this work, we investigated the ability of alpha-hemolysin nanopores to distinguish the four DNA bases under conditions that are compatible with the activity of DNA-handling enzymes. Our findings suggest that in immobilized strands, the applied potential exerts a force on DNA (∼10 pN at +160 mV) that increases the distance between nucleobases by about 2.2 Å V(-1). The four nucleobases can be resolved over wide ranges of applied potentials (from +60 to +220 mV in 1 m KCl) and ionic strengths (from 200 mM KCl to 1 M KCl at +160 mV) and nucleobase recognition can be improved when the ionic strength on the side of the DNA-handling enzyme is low, while the ionic strength on the opposite side is high.
25629930,1,2015,Nanotechnology,1/f noise in graphene nanopores.,Graphene nanopores are receiving great attention due to their atomically thin membranes and intrinsic electrical properties that appear greatly beneficial for biosensing and DNA sequencing. Here, we present an extensive study of the low-frequency 1/f noise in the ionic current through graphene nanopores and compare it to noise levels in silicon nitride pore currents. We find that the 1/f noise magnitude is very high for graphene nanopores: typically two orders of magnitude higher than for silicon nitride pores. This is a drawback as it significantly lowers the signal-to-noise ratio in DNA translocation experiments. We evaluate possible explanations for these exceptionally high noise levels in graphene pores. From examining the noise for pores of different diameters and at various salt concentrations, we find that in contrast to silicon nitride pores, the 1/f noise in graphene pores does not follow Hooge's relation. In addition, from studying the dependence on the buffer pH, we show that the increased noise cannot be explained by charge fluctuations of chemical groups on the pore rim. Finally, we compare single and bilayer graphene to few-layer and multi-layer graphene and boron nitride (h-BN), and we find that the noise reduces with layer thickness for both materials, which suggests that mechanical fluctuations may be the underlying cause of the high 1/f noise levels in monolayer graphene nanopore devices.
25610451,1,2015,Front Genet,The evolution of nanopore sequencing.,The &quot;$1000 Genome&quot; project has been drawing increasing attention since its launch a decade ago. Nanopore sequencing, the third-generation, is believed to be one of the most promising sequencing technologies to reach four gold standards set for the &quot;$1000 Genome&quot; while the second-generation sequencing technologies are bringing about a revolution in life sciences, particularly in genome sequencing-based personalized medicine. Both of protein and solid-state nanopores have been extensively investigated for a series of issues, from detection of ionic current blockage to field-effect-transistor (FET) sensors. A newly released protein nanopore sequencer has shown encouraging potential that nanopore sequencing will ultimately fulfill the gold standards. In this review, we address advances, challenges, and possible solutions of nanopore sequencing according to these standards.
26180050,0,2015,Nanotechnology,Nanopore arrays in a silicon membrane for parallel single-molecule detection: DNA translocation.,Optical nanopore sensing offers great potential in single-molecule detection, genotyping, or DNA sequencing for high-throughput applications. However, one of the bottle-necks for fluorophore-based biomolecule sensing is the lack of an optically optimized membrane with a large array of nanopores, which has large pore-to-pore distance, small variation in pore size and low background photoluminescence (PL). Here, we demonstrate parallel detection of single-fluorophore-labeled DNA strands (450 bps) translocating through an array of silicon nanopores that fulfills the above-mentioned requirements for optical sensing. The nanopore array was fabricated using electron beam lithography and anisotropic etching followed by electrochemical etching resulting in pore diameters down to ∼7 nm. The DNA translocation measurements were performed in a conventional wide-field microscope tailored for effective background PL control. The individual nanopore diameter was found to have a substantial effect on the translocation velocity, where smaller openings slow the translocation enough for the event to be clearly detectable in the fluorescence. Our results demonstrate that a uniform silicon nanopore array combined with wide-field optical detection is a promising alternative with which to realize massively-parallel single-molecule detection.
26180043,0,2015,Nanotechnology,Nanopore arrays in a silicon membrane for parallel single-molecule detection: fabrication.,Solid state nanopores enable translocation and detection of single bio-molecules such as DNA in buffer solutions. Here, sub-10 nm nanopore arrays in silicon membranes were fabricated by using electron-beam lithography to define etch pits and by using a subsequent electrochemical etching step. This approach effectively decouples positioning of the pores and the control of their size, where the pore size essentially results from the anodizing current and time in the etching cell. Nanopores with diameters as small as 7 nm, fully penetrating 300 nm thick membranes, were obtained. The presented fabrication scheme to form large arrays of nanopores is attractive for parallel bio-molecule sensing and DNA sequencing using optical techniques. In particular the signal-to-noise ratio is improved compared to other alternatives such as nitride membranes suffering from a high-luminescence background.
26179356,0,2015,Nat Rev Microbiol,Techniques &amp;applications: A first genome assembly for nanopore sequencing.,
26170241,0,2015,Lab Chip,Research highlights: nanopore protein detection and analysis.,In this article we highlight recent work using nanopores to detect and study proteins. Nanopores are excellent single molecule sensors, capable of rapidly characterizing small molecules with relatively modest instrumentation requirements. Although the vast majority of recent effort and attention surrounding nanopores has centered on detection and sequencing of nucleic acids, proteins represent a more difficult and diverse analyte population, with a wide range of sizes, structures, charges, among other characteristics. Nanopores can be used to detect the presence of proteins of interest as well as to study their enzymatic activity, binding to ligands, and secondary structure. We highlight new work describing detection of specific protein species in solution by coupling them to a strand of carrier DNA that is used to electrophoretically transport the proteins through conical glass nanopores. Additionally, we spotlight another approach for nanopore detection of protein and other analytes through detection of their binding to aptamers-measurements which were quantitative to pM concentrations. Finally, we highlight studies in which protein secondary structure and folding energetics were studied through the use of an unfoldase enzyme coupled to a protein nanopore, a technique capable of detecting the effects of single amino acid mutations on the stability of the folded protein.
26157798,0,2015,Front Bioeng Biotechnol,Capture, Unfolding, and Detection of Individual tRNA Molecules Using a Nanopore Device.,Transfer RNAs (tRNA) are the most common RNA molecules in cells and have critical roles as both translators of the genetic code and regulators of protein synthesis. As such, numerous methods have focused on studying tRNA abundance and regulation, with the most widely used methods being RNA-seq and microarrays. Though revolutionary to transcriptomics, these assays are limited by an inability to encode tRNA modifications in the requisite cDNA. These modifications are abundant in tRNA and critical to their function. Here, we describe proof-of-concept experiments where individual tRNA molecules are examined as linear strands using a biological nanopore. This method utilizes an enzymatically ligated synthetic DNA adapter to concentrate tRNA at the lipid bilayer of the nanopore device and efficiently denature individual tRNA molecules, as they are pulled through the α-hemolysin (α-HL) nanopore. Additionally, the DNA adapter provides a loading site for ϕ29 DNA polymerase (ϕ29 DNAP), which acts as a brake on the translocating tRNA. This increases the dwell time of adapted tRNA in the nanopore, allowing us to identify the region of the nanopore signal that is produced by the translocating tRNA itself. Using adapter-modified Escherichia coli tRNA(fMet) and tRNA(Lys), we show that the nanopore signal during controlled translocation is dependent on the identity of the tRNA. This confirms that adapter-modified tRNA can translocate end-to-end through nanopores and provide the foundation for future work in direct sequencing of individual transfer RNA with a nanopore-based device.
26150827,0,2015,Front Genet,DNA/RNA transverse current sequencing: intrinsic structural noise from neighboring bases.,Nanopore DNA sequencing via transverse current has emerged as a promising candidate for third-generation sequencing technology. It produces long read lengths which could alleviate problems with assembly errors inherent in current technologies. However, the high error rates of nanopore sequencing have to be addressed. A very important source of the error is the intrinsic noise in the current arising from carrier dispersion along the chain of the molecule, i.e., from the influence of neighboring bases. In this work we perform calculations of the transverse current within an effective multi-orbital tight-binding model derived from first-principles calculations of the DNA/RNA molecules, to study the effect of this structural noise on the error rates in DNA/RNA sequencing via transverse current in nanopores. We demonstrate that a statistical technique, utilizing not only the currents through the nucleotides but also the correlations in the currents, can in principle reduce the error rate below any desired precision.
26149338,0,2015,Sci Rep,Scaffolding of a bacterial genome using MinION nanopore sequencing.,Second generation sequencing has revolutionized genomic studies. However, most genomes contain repeated DNA elements that are longer than the read lengths achievable with typical sequencers, so the genomic order of several generated contigs cannot be easily resolved. A new generation of sequencers offering substantially longer reads is emerging, notably the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RS II system and the MinION system, released in early 2014 by Oxford Nanopore Technologies through an early access program. The latter has highly advantageous portability and sequences samples by measuring changes in ionic current when single-stranded DNA molecules are translocated through nanopores. We show that the MinION system produces long reads with high mapability that can be used for scaffolding bacterial genomes, despite currently producing substantially higher error rates than PacBio reads. With further development we anticipate that MinION will be useful not only for assembling genomes, but also for rapid detection of organisms, potentially in the field.
26114210,0,2015,ACS Nano,Nucleobase Recognition by Truncated α-Hemolysin Pores.,The α-hemolysin (αHL) protein nanopore has been investigated previously as a base detector for the strand sequencing of DNA and RNA. Recent findings have suggested that shorter pores might provide improved base discrimination. New work has also shown that truncated-barrel mutants (TBM) of αHL form functional pores in lipid bilayers. Therefore, we tested TBM pores for the ability to recognize bases in DNA strands immobilized within them. In the case of TBMΔ6, in which the barrel is shortened by ~16 Å, one of the three recognition sites found in the wild-type pore, R1, was almost eliminated. With further mutagenesis (Met113→Gly), R1 was completely removed, demonstrating that TBM pores can mediate sharpened recognition. Remarkably, a second mutant of TBMΔ6 (Met113→Phe) was able to bind the positively charged β-cyclodextrin, am7βCD, unusually tightly permitting the continuous recognition of individual nucleoside monophosphates, which would be required for exonuclease sequencing mediated by nanopore base identification.
26088477,0,2015,Nanoscale,Controlled formation of closed-edge nanopores in graphene.,Dangling bonds at the edge of a nanopore in monolayer graphene make it susceptible to back-filling at low temperatures from atmospheric hydrocarbons, leading to potential instability for nanopore applications, such as DNA sequencing. We show that closed edge nanopores in bilayer graphene are robust to back-filling under atmospheric conditions for days. A controlled method for closed edge nanopore formation starting from monolayer graphene is reported using an in situ heating holder and electron beam irradiation within an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. Tailoring of closed-edge nanopore sizes is demonstrated from 1.4-7.4 nm. These results should provide mechanisms for improving the stability of nanopores in graphene for a wide range of applications involving mass transport.
26061408,0,2015,J Phys Condens Matter,Threading DNA through nanopores for biosensing applications.,This review outlines the recent achievements in the field of nanopore research. Nanopores are typically used in single-molecule experiments and are believed to have a high potential to realize an ultra-fast and very cheap genome sequencer. Here, the various types of nanopore materials, ranging from biological to 2D nanopores are discussed together with their advantages and disadvantages. These nanopores can utilize different protocols to read out the DNA nucleobases. Although, the first nanopore devices have reached the market, many still have issues which do not allow a full realization of a nanopore sequencer able to sequence the human genome in about a day. Ways to control the DNA, its dynamics and speed as the biomolecule translocates the nanopore in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in the reading-out process are examined in this review. Finally, the advantages, as well as the drawbacks in distinguishing the DNA nucleotides, i.e., the genetic information, are presented in view of their importance in the field of nanopore sequencing.
26035079,0,2015,ACS Nano,DNA Translocation in Nanometer Thick Silicon Nanopores.,Solid-state nanopores are single-molecule sensors that detect changes in ionic conductance (ΔG) when individual molecules pass through them. Producing high signal-to-noise ratio for the measurement of molecular structure in applications such as DNA sequencing requires low noise and large ΔG. The latter is achieved by reducing the nanopore diameter and membrane thickness. While the minimum diameter is limited by the molecule size, the membrane thickness is constrained by material properties. We use molecular dynamics simulations to determine the theoretical thickness limit of amorphous Si membranes to be ∼1 nm, and we designed an electron-irradiation-based thinning method to reach that limit and drill nanopores in the thinned regions. Double-stranded DNA translocations through these nanopores (down to 1.4 nm in thickness and 2.5 nm in diameter) provide the intrinsic ionic conductance detection limit in Si-based nanopores. In this regime, where the access resistance is comparable to the nanopore resistance, we observe the appearance of two conductance levels during molecule translocation. Considering the overall performance of Si-based nanopores, our work highlights their potential as a leading material for sequencing applications.
26026159,0,2015,Brief Bioinform,Denoising DNA deep sequencing data-high-throughput sequencing errors and their correction.,Characterizing the errors generated by common high-throughput sequencing platforms and telling true genetic variation from technical artefacts are two interdependent steps, essential to many analyses such as single nucleotide variant calling, haplotype inference, sequence assembly and evolutionary studies. Both random and systematic errors can show a specific occurrence profile for each of the six prominent sequencing platforms surveyed here: 454 pyrosequencing, Complete Genomics DNA nanoball sequencing, Illumina sequencing by synthesis, Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing, Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time sequencing and Oxford Nanopore sequencing. There is a large variety of programs available for error removal in sequencing read data, which differ in the error models and statistical techniques they use, the features of the data they analyse, the parameters they determine from them and the data structures and algorithms they use. We highlight the assumptions they make and for which data types these hold, providing guidance which tools to consider for benchmarking with regard to the data properties. While no benchmarking results are included here, such specific benchmarks would greatly inform tool choices and future software development. The development of stand-alone error correctors, as well as single nucleotide variant and haplotype callers, could also benefit from using more of the knowledge about error profiles and from (re)combining ideas from the existing approaches presented here.
26025440,0,2015,Genome Biol,Rapid draft sequencing and real-time nanopore sequencing in a hospital outbreak of Salmonella.,BACKGROUND: Foodborne outbreaks of Salmonella remain a pressing public health concern. We recently detected a large outbreak of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 14b affecting more than 30 patients in our hospital. This outbreak was linked to community, national and European-wide cases. Hospital patients with Salmonella are at high risk, and require a rapid response. We initially investigated this outbreak by whole-genome sequencing using a novel rapid protocol on the Illumina MiSeq; we then integrated these data with whole-genome data from surveillance sequencing, thereby placing the outbreak in a national context. Additionally, we investigated the potential of a newly released sequencing technology, the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, in the management of a hospital outbreak of Salmonella.RESULTS: We demonstrate that rapid MiSeq sequencing can reduce the time to answer compared to the standard sequencing protocol with no impact on the results. We show, for the first time, that the MinION can acquire clinically relevant information in real-time and within minutes of a DNA library being loaded. MinION sequencing permits confident assignment to species level within 20 minutes. Using a novel streaming phylogenetic placement method samples can be assigned to a serotype in 40 minutes and determined to be part of the outbreak in less than 2 h.CONCLUSIONS: Both approaches yielded reliable and actionable clinical information on the Salmonella outbreak in less than half a day. The rapid availability of such information may facilitate more informed epidemiological investigations and influence infection control practices.
25965338,0,2015,J Phys Chem B,Journey of poly-nucleotides through OmpF porin.,OmpF is an abundant porin in many bacteria which attracts attention as a promising biological nanopore for DNA sequencing. We study the interactions of OmpF with pentameric poly-nucleotides (poly-Ns) in silico. The poly-N molecule is forced to translocate through the lumen of OmpF. Subsequently, the structural and dynamical effects of translocation steps on protein and poly-N molecules are explored in detail. The external loops of OmpF are introduced as the main region for discrimination of poly-Ns based on their organic bases. Structural network analyses of OmpF in the presence or absence of poly-Ns characterize special residues in the structural network of porin. These residues pave the way for engineering OmpF protein. The poly-N-specific pattern of OmpF's local conductance is detected in the current study. Computing the potential of mean force for translocation steps, we define the energetic barrier ahead of poly-N to move through OmpF's lumen. We suggest that fast translocation of the examined poly-N molecules through OmpF seems unattainable by small external driving forces. Our computational results suggest some abilities for OmpF porin like OmpF's potential for being used in poly-N sequencing.
25929480,0,2015,Electrophoresis,Interfacing solid-state nanopores with gel media to slow DNA translocations.,We demonstrate the ability to slow DNA translocations through solid-state nanopores by interfacing the trans side of the membrane with gel media. In this work, we focus on two reptation regimes: when the DNA molecule is flexible on the length scale of a gel pore, and when the DNA behaves as persistent segments in tight gel pores. The first regime is investigated using agarose gels, which produce a very wide distribution of translocation times for 5 kbp dsDNA fragments, spanning over three orders of magnitude. The second regime is attained with polyacrylamide gels, which can maintain a tight spread and produce a shift in the distribution of the translocation times by an order of magnitude for 100 bp dsDNA fragments, if intermolecular crowding on the trans side is avoided. While previous approaches have proven successful at slowing DNA passage, they have generally been detrimental to the S/N, capture rate, or experimental simplicity. These results establish that by controlling the regime of DNA movement exiting a nanopore interfaced with a gel medium, it is possible to address the issue of rapid biomolecule translocations through nanopores-presently one of the largest hurdles facing nanopore-based analysis-without affecting the signal quality or capture efficiency.
25928894,0,2015,Nano Lett,Electrochemical Reaction in Single Layer MoS2: Nanopores Opened Atom by Atom.,Ultrathin nanopore membranes based on 2D materials have demonstrated ultimate resolution toward DNA sequencing. Among them, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) shows long-term stability as well as superior sensitivity enabling high throughput performance. The traditional method of fabricating nanopores with nanometer precision is based on the use of focused electron beams in transmission electron microscope (TEM). This nanopore fabrication process is time-consuming, expensive, not scalable, and hard to control below 1 nm. Here, we exploited the electrochemical activity of MoS2 and developed a convenient and scalable method to controllably make nanopores in single-layer MoS2 with subnanometer precision using electrochemical reaction (ECR). The electrochemical reaction on the surface of single-layer MoS2 is initiated at the location of defects or single atom vacancy, followed by the successive removals of individual atoms or unit cells from single-layer MoS2 lattice and finally formation of a nanopore. Step-like features in the ionic current through the growing nanopore provide direct feedback on the nanopore size inferred from a widely used conductance vs pore size model. Furthermore, DNA translocations can be detected in situ when as-fabricated MoS2 nanopores are used. The atomic resolution and accessibility of this approach paves the way for mass production of nanopores in 2D membranes for potential solid-state nanopore sequencing.
25927464,0,2015,BMC Genomics,Genome assembly using Nanopore-guided long and error-free DNA reads.,BACKGROUND: Long-read sequencing technologies were launched a few years ago, and in contrast with short-read sequencing technologies, they offered a promise of solving assembly problems for large and complex genomes. Moreover by providing long-range information, it could also solve haplotype phasing. However, existing long-read technologies still have several limitations that complicate their use for most research laboratories, as well as in large and/or complex genome projects. In 2014, Oxford Nanopore released the MinION® device, a small and low-cost single-molecule nanopore sequencer, which offers the possibility of sequencing long DNA fragments.RESULTS: The assembly of long reads generated using the Oxford Nanopore MinION® instrument is challenging as existing assemblers were not implemented to deal with long reads exhibiting close to 30% of errors. Here, we presented a hybrid approach developed to take advantage of data generated using MinION® device. We sequenced a well-known bacterium, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 and applied our method to obtain a highly contiguous (one single contig) and accurate genome assembly even in repetitive regions, in contrast to an Illumina-only assembly. Our hybrid strategy was able to generate NaS (Nanopore Synthetic-long) reads up to 60 kb that aligned entirely and with no error to the reference genome and that spanned highly conserved repetitive regions. The average accuracy of NaS reads reached 99.99% without losing the initial size of the input MinION® reads.CONCLUSIONS: We described NaS tool, a hybrid approach allowing the sequencing of microbial genomes using the MinION® device. Our method, based ideally on 20x and 50x of NaS and Illumina reads respectively, provides an efficient and cost-effective way of sequencing microbial or small eukaryotic genomes in a very short time even in small facilities. Moreover, we demonstrated that although the Oxford Nanopore technology is a relatively new sequencing technology, currently with a high error rate, it is already useful in the generation of high-quality genome assemblies.
25902425,0,2015,Biophys J,Statistical inference for nanopore sequencing with a biased random walk model.,Nanopore sequencing promises long read-lengths and single-molecule resolution, but the stochastic motion of the DNA molecule inside the pore is, as of this writing, a barrier to high accuracy reads. We develop a method of statistical inference that explicitly accounts for this error, and demonstrate that high accuracy (&gt;99%) sequence inference is feasible even under highly diffusive motion by using a hidden Markov model to jointly analyze multiple stochastic reads. Using this model, we place bounds on achievable inference accuracy under a range of experimental parameters.
25901276,0,2015,F1000Res,Long read nanopore sequencing for detection of HLA and CYP2D6 variants and haplotypes.,Haplotypes are often critical for the interpretation of genetic laboratory observations into medically actionable findings. Current massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies produce short sequence reads that are often unable to resolve haplotype information. Phasing short read data typically requires supplemental statistical phasing based on known haplotype structure in the population or parental genotypic data. Here we demonstrate that the MinION nanopore sequencer is capable of producing very long reads to resolve both variants and haplotypes of HLA-A, HLA-B and CYP2D6 genes important in determining patient drug response in sample NA12878 of CEPH/UTAH pedigree 1463, without the need for statistical phasing. Long read data from a single 24-hour nanopore sequencing run was used to reconstruct haplotypes, which were confirmed by HapMap data and statistically phased Complete Genomics and Sequenom genotypes. Our results demonstrate that nanopore sequencing is an emerging standalone technology with potential utility in a clinical environment to aid in medical decision-making.
25875197,0,2015,Nanotechnology,Label-free screening of single biomolecules through resistive pulse sensing technology for precision medicine applications.,Employing integrated nano- and microfluidic circuits for detecting and characterizing biological compounds through resistive pulse sensing technology is a vibrant area of research at the interface of biotechnology and nanotechnology. Resistive pulse sensing platforms can be customized to study virtually any particle of choice which can be threaded through a fluidic channel and enable label-free single-particle interrogation with the primary read-out signal being an electric current fingerprint. The ability to perform label-free molecular screening with single-molecule and even single binding site resolution makes resistive pulse sensing technology a powerful tool for analyzing the smallest units of biological systems and how they interact with each other on a molecular level. This task is at the core of experimental systems biology and in particular 'omics research which in combination with next-generation DNA-sequencing and next-generation drug discovery and design forms the foundation of a novel disruptive medical paradigm commonly referred to as personalized medicine or precision medicine. DNA-sequencing has approached the 1000-Dollar-Genome milestone allowing for decoding a complete human genome with unmatched speed and at low cost. Increased sequencing efficiency yields massive amounts of genomic data. Analyzing this data in combination with medical and biometric health data eventually enables understanding the pathways from individual genes to physiological functions. Access to this information triggers fundamental questions for doctors and patients alike: what are the chances of an outbreak for a specific disease? Can individual risks be managed and if so how? Which drugs are available and how should they be applied? Could a new drug be tailored to an individual's genetic predisposition fast and in an affordable way? In order to provide answers and real-life value to patients, the rapid evolvement of novel computing approaches for analyzing big data in systems genomics has to be accompanied by an equally strong effort to develop next-generation DNA-sequencing and next-generation drug screening and design platforms. In that context lab-on-a-chip devices utilizing nanopore- and nanochannel based resistive pulse-sensing technology for DNA-sequencing and protein screening applications occupy a key role. This paper describes the status quo of resistive pulse sensing technology for these two application areas with a special focus on current technology trends and challenges ahead.
25825834,0,2015,Nat Methods,Successful test launch for nanopore sequencing.,
25815165,0,2015,Gigascience,Bacterial and viral identification and differentiation by amplicon sequencing on the MinION nanopore sequencer.,BACKGROUND: The MinION™ nanopore sequencer was recently released to a community of alpha-testers for evaluation using a variety of sequencing applications. Recent reports have tested the ability of the MinION™ to act as a whole genome sequencer and have demonstrated that nanopore sequencing has tremendous potential utility. However, the current nanopore technology still has limitations with respect to error-rate, and this is problematic when attempting to assemble whole genomes without secondary rounds of sequencing to correct errors. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION™ nanopore sequencer to accurately identify and differentiate bacterial and viral samples via directed sequencing of characteristic genes shared broadly across a target clade.RESULTS: Using a 6 hour sequencing run time, sufficient data were generated to identify an E. coli sample down to the species level from 16S rDNA amplicons. Three poxviruses (cowpox, vaccinia-MVA, and vaccinia-Lister) were identified and differentiated down to the strain level, despite over 98% identity between the vaccinia strains. The ability to differentiate strains by amplicon sequencing on the MinION™ was accomplished despite an observed per-base error rate of approximately 30%.CONCLUSIONS: While nanopore sequencing, using the MinION™ platform from Oxford Nanopore in particular, continues to mature into a commercially available technology, practical uses are sought for the current versions of the technology. This study offers evidence of the utility of amplicon sequencing by demonstrating that the current versions of MinION™ technology can accurately identify and differentiate both viral and bacterial species present within biological samples via amplicon sequencing.
25787000,0,2015,Yi Chuan,[The principle and application of the single-molecule real-time sequencing technology].,Last decade witnessed the explosive development of the third-generation sequencing strategy, including single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT), true single-molecule sequencing (tSMSTM) and the single-molecule nanopore DNA sequencing. In this review, we summarize the principle, performance and application of the SMRT sequencing technology. Compared with the traditional Sanger method and the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the SMRT approach has several advantages, including long read length, high speed, PCR-free and the capability of direct detection of epigenetic modiﬁcations. However, the disadvantage of its low accuracy, most of which resulted from insertions and deletions, is also notable. So, the raw sequence data need to be corrected before assembly. Up to now, the SMRT is a good fit for applications in the de novo genomic sequencing and the high-quality assemblies of small genomes. In the future, it is expected to play an important role in epigenetics, transcriptomic sequencing, and assemblies of large genomes.
25760070,0,2015,Nanotechnology,Osmylated DNA, a novel concept for sequencing DNA using nanopores.,Saenger sequencing has led the advances in molecular biology, while faster and cheaper next generation technologies are urgently needed. A newer approach exploits nanopores, natural or solid-state, set in an electrical field, and obtains base sequence information from current variations due to the passage of a ssDNA molecule through the pore. A hurdle in this approach is the fact that the four bases are chemically comparable to each other which leads to small differences in current obstruction. 'Base calling' becomes even more challenging because most nanopores sense a short sequence and not individual bases. Perhaps sequencing DNA via nanopores would be more manageable, if only the bases were two, and chemically very different from each other; a sequence of 1s and 0s comes to mind. Osmylated DNA comes close to such a sequence of 1s and 0s. Osmylation is the addition of osmium tetroxide bipyridine across the C5-C6 double bond of the pyrimidines. Osmylation adds almost 400% mass to the reactive base, creates a sterically and electronically notably different molecule, labeled 1, compared to the unreactive purines, labeled 0. If osmylated DNA were successfully sequenced, the result would be a sequence of osmylated pyrimidines (1), and purines (0), and not of the actual nucleobases. To solve this problem we studied the osmylation reaction with short oligos and with M13mp18, a long ssDNA, developed a UV-vis assay to measure extent of osmylation, and designed two protocols. Protocol A uses mild conditions and yields osmylated thymidines (1), while leaving the other three bases (0) practically intact. Protocol B uses harsher conditions and effectively osmylates both pyrimidines, but not the purines. Applying these two protocols also to the complementary of the target polynucleotide yields a total of four osmylated strands that collectively could define the actual base sequence of the target DNA.
25744599,0,2015,Biosens Bioelectron,Recent progress in atomistic simulation of electrical current DNA sequencing.,We review recent advances in the DNA sequencing method based on measurements of transverse electrical currents. Device configurations proposed in the literature are classified according to whether the molecular fingerprints appear as the major (Mode I) or perturbing (Mode II) current signals. Scanning tunneling microscope and tunneling electrode gap configurations belong to the former category, while the nanochannels with or without an embedded nanopore belong to the latter. The molecular sensing mechanisms of Modes I and II roughly correspond to the electron tunneling and electrochemical gating, respectively. Special emphasis will be given on the computer simulation studies, which have been playing a critical role in the initiation and development of the field. We also highlight low-dimensional nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and graphene nanoribbons that allow the novel Mode II approach. Finally, several issues in previous computational studies are discussed, which points to future research directions toward more reliable simulation of electrical current DNA sequencing devices.
25743089,0,2015,Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics,Nanopore-based fourth-generation DNA sequencing technology.,Nanopore-based sequencers, as the fourth-generation DNA sequencing technology, have the potential to quickly and reliably sequence the entire human genome for less than $1000, and possibly for even less than $100. The single-molecule techniques used by this technology allow us to further study the interaction between DNA and protein, as well as between protein and protein. Nanopore analysis opens a new door to molecular biology investigation at the single-molecule scale. In this article, we have reviewed academic achievements in nanopore technology from the past as well as the latest advances, including both biological and solid-state nanopores, and discussed their recent and potential applications.
25725751,0,2015,J Chem Phys,Dynamics of polymer translocation through kinked nanopores.,Polymer translocation through nanopore has potential technological applications for DNA sequencing, where one challenge problem is to slow down translocation speed. Inspired by experimental findings that kinked nanopores exhibit a large reduction in translocation velocity compared with their straight counterparts, we investigate the dynamics of polymer translocation through kinked nanopores in two dimensions under an applied external field. With increasing the tortuosity of an array of nanopores, our analytical results show that the translocation probability decreases. Langevin dynamics simulation results support this prediction and further indicate that with increasing the tortuosity, translocation time shows a slow increase followed by a rapid increase after a critical tortuosity. This behavior demonstrates that kinked nanopores can effectively reduce translocation speed. These results are interpreted by the roles of the tortuosity for decreasing the effective nanopore diameter, increasing effective nanopore length, and greatly increasing the DNA-pore friction.
25684652,0,2015,Analyst,Optical sensing and analyte manipulation in solid-state nanopores.,The field of nanopore sensing has been gaining increasing attention. Much progress has been made towards biotechnological applications that involve electrical measurements of temporal changes in the ionic current flowing through the pore. But in many cases the electrical signal is restricted by the non-ideal noise components, limited throughput, and insufficient temporal or spatial resolutions. To address these limitations, high-sensitivity optical detection techniques that complement the electrical measurements have been developed. The optical techniques involve high-bandwidth, multicolor and high-throughput measurements. Here we review the recent advancements and developments that have been taking place in the field of optical sensing in solid-state nanopores. We describe the main optical methods used in this field involving total internal reflection and confocal microscopy in addition to sophisticated background suppression strategies. We further present the phenomenon of light induced analyte manipulation at the pore and the contribution of the optical sensing approach to possible nanopore sensing applications such as optical based DNA sequencing using nanopores.
25649617,0,2015,Bioinformatics,Analysis of nanopore data using hidden Markov models.,MOTIVATION: Nanopore-based sequencing techniques can reconstruct properties of biosequences by analyzing the sequence-dependent ionic current steps produced as biomolecules pass through a pore. Typically this involves alignment of new data to a reference, where both reference construction and alignment have been performed by hand.RESULTS: We propose an automated method for aligning nanopore data to a reference through the use of hidden Markov models. Several features that arise from prior processing steps and from the class of enzyme used can be simply incorporated into the model. Previously, the M2MspA nanopore was shown to be sensitive enough to distinguish between cytosine, methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine. We validated our automated methodology on a subset of that data by automatically calculating an error rate for the distinction between the three cytosine variants and show that the automated methodology produces a 2-3% error rate, lower than the 10% error rate from previous manual segmentation and alignment.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The data, output, scripts and tutorials replicating the analysis are available at https://github.com/UCSCNanopore/Data/tree/master/Automation.CONTACT: karplus@soe.ucsc.edu or jmschreiber91@gmail.comSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available from Bioinformatics online.
25643284,0,2015,Nanotechnology,The emergence of nanopores in next-generation sequencing.,Next-generation sequencing methods based on nanopore technology have recently gained considerable attention, mainly because they promise affordable and fast genome sequencing by providing long read lengths (5 kbp) and do not require additional DNA amplification or enzymatic incorporation of modified nucleotides. This permits health care providers and research facilities to decode a genome within hours for less than $1000. This review summarizes past, present, and future DNA sequencing techniques, which are realized by nanopore approaches such as those pursued by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
25642629,0,2015,Nanotechnology,Challenges in DNA motion control and sequence readout using nanopore devices.,Nanopores are being hailed as a potential next-generation DNA sequencer that could provide cheap, high-throughput DNA analysis. In this review we present a detailed summary of the various sensing techniques being investigated for use in DNA sequencing and mapping applications. A crucial impasse to the success of nanopores as a reliable DNA analysis tool is the fast and stochastic nature of DNA translocation. We discuss the incorporation of biological motors to step DNA through a pore base-by-base, as well as the many experimental modifications attempted for the purpose of slowing and controlling DNA transport.
25629967,0,2015,Nanotechnology,Detection of benzo[a]pyrene-guanine adducts in single-stranded DNA using the α-hemolysin nanopore.,The carcinogenic precursor benzo[a]pyrene (BP), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is released into the environment through the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Metabolism of BP in the human body yields a potent alkylating agent (benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide, BPDE) that reacts with guanine (G) in DNA to form an adduct implicated in cancer initiation. We report that the α-hemolysin (αHL) nanopore platform can be used to detect a BPDE adduct to G in synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. Translocation of a 41-mer poly-2'-deoxycytidine strand with a centrally located BPDE adduct to G through αHL in 1 M KCl produces a unique multi-level current signature allowing the adduct to be detected. This readily distinguishable current modulation was observed when the BPDE-adducted DNA strand translocated from either the 5' or 3' directions. This study suggests that BPDE adducts and other large aromatic biomarkers can be detected with αHL, presenting opportunities for the monitoring, quantification, and sequencing of mutagenic compounds from cellular DNA samples.
25623807,0,2015,ACS Nano,Ionic conductivity, structural deformation, and programmable anisotropy of DNA origami in electric field.,The DNA origami technique can enable functionalization of inorganic structures for single-molecule electric current recordings. Experiments have shown that several layers of DNA molecules, a DNA origami plate, placed on top of a solid-state nanopore is permeable to ions. Here, we report a comprehensive characterization of the ionic conductivity of DNA origami plates by means of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and nanocapillary electric current recordings. Using the MD method, we characterize the ionic conductivity of several origami constructs, revealing the local distribution of ions, the distribution of the electrostatic potential and contribution of different molecular species to the current. The simulations determine the dependence of the ionic conductivity on the applied voltage, the number of DNA layers, the nucleotide content and the lattice type of the plates. We demonstrate that increasing the concentration of Mg(2+) ions makes the origami plates more compact, reducing their conductivity. The conductance of a DNA origami plate on top of a solid-state nanopore is determined by the two competing effects: bending of the DNA origami plate that reduces the current and separation of the DNA origami layers that increases the current. The latter is produced by the electro-osmotic flow and is reversible at the time scale of a hundred nanoseconds. The conductance of a DNA origami object is found to depend on its orientation, reaching maximum when the electric field aligns with the direction of the DNA helices. Our work demonstrates feasibility of programming the electrical properties of a self-assembled nanoscale object using DNA.
25570269,0,2015,Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,CMOS-based high-speed nanopore recording: Signals and systems.,This paper considers the potential of CMOS-based nanopore measurement systems for high-speed molecular recording and DNA sequencing in particular. As such it approximates the signal fidelity limitations of a CMOS-based nanopore readout channel and discusses the means by which throughput could be increased through the use of a parallel CMOS readout system.
24964173,11,2014,Nat Biotechnol,Decoding long nanopore sequencing reads of natural DNA.,Nanopore sequencing of DNA is a single-molecule technique that may achieve long reads, low cost and high speed with minimal sample preparation and instrumentation. Here, we build on recent progress with respect to nanopore resolution and DNA control to interpret the procession of ion current levels observed during the translocation of DNA through the pore MspA. As approximately four nucleotides affect the ion current of each level, we measured the ion current corresponding to all 256 four-nucleotide combinations (quadromers). This quadromer map is highly predictive of ion current levels of previously unmeasured sequences derived from the bacteriophage phi X 174 genome. Furthermore, we show nanopore sequencing reads of phi X 174 up to 4,500 bases in length, which can be unambiguously aligned to the phi X 174 reference genome, and demonstrate proof-of-concept utility with respect to hybrid genome assembly and polymorphism detection. This work provides a foundation for nanopore sequencing of long, natural DNA strands.
25386338,10,2014,Gigascience,A reference bacterial genome dataset generated on the MinION™ portable single-molecule nanopore sequencer.,BACKGROUND: The MinION™ is a new, portable single-molecule sequencer developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It measures four inches in length and is powered from the USB 3.0 port of a laptop computer. The MinION™ measures the change in current resulting from DNA strands interacting with a charged protein nanopore. These measurements can then be used to deduce the underlying nucleotide sequence.FINDINGS: We present a read dataset from whole-genome shotgun sequencing of the model organism Escherichia coli K-12 substr. MG1655 generated on a MinION™ device during the early-access MinION™ Access Program (MAP). Sequencing runs of the MinION™ are presented, one generated using R7 chemistry (released in July 2014) and one using R7.3 (released in September 2014).CONCLUSIONS: Base-called sequence data are provided to demonstrate the nature of data produced by the MinION™ platform and to encourage the development of customised methods for alignment, consensus and variant calling, de novo assembly and scaffolding.

24995601,9,2014,Biochim Biophys Acta,Next generation sequencing technology: Advances and applications.,Impressive progress has been made in the field of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Through advancements in the fields of molecular biology and technical engineering, parallelization of the sequencing reaction has profoundly increased the total number of produced sequence reads per run. Current sequencing platforms allow for a previously unprecedented view into complex mixtures of RNA and DNA samples. NGS is currently evolving into a molecular microscope finding its way into virtually every fields of biomedical research. In this chapter we review the technical background of the different commercially available NGS platforms with respect to template generation and the sequencing reaction and take a small step towards what the upcoming NGS technologies will bring. We close with an overview of different implementations of NGS into biomedical research. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: From Genome to Function.
25187008,7,2014,Mol Ecol Resour,A first look at the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer.,Oxford Nanopore's third-generation single-molecule sequencing platform promises to decrease costs for reagents and instrumentation. After a 2-year hiatus following the initial announcement, the first devices have been released as part of an early access program. We explore the performance of this platform by resequencing the lambda phage genome, and amplicons from a snake venom gland transcriptome. Although the handheld MinION sequencer can generate more than 150 megabases of raw data in one run, at most a quarter of the resulting reads map to the reference, with less than average 10% identity. Much of the sequence consists of insertion/deletion errors, or is seemingly without similarity to the template. Using the lambda phage data as an example, although the reads are long, averaging 5 kb, at best 890 ± 1932 bases per mapped read could be matched to the reference without soft clipping. In the course of a 36 h run on the MinION, it was possible to resequence the 48 kb lambda phage reference at 16× coverage. Currently, substantially larger projects would not be feasible using the MinION. Without increases in accuracy, which would be required for applications such as genome scaffolding and phasing, the current utility of the MinION appears limited. Library preparation requires access to a molecular laboratory, and is of similar complexity and cost to that of other next-generation sequencing platforms. The MinION is an exciting step in a new direction for single-molecule sequencing, though it will require dramatic decreases in error rates before it lives up to its promise.
24705512,7,2014,Nat Nanotechnol,Single-molecule spectroscopy of amino acids and peptides by recognition tunnelling.,The human proteome has millions of protein variants due to alternative RNA splicing and post-translational modifications, and variants that are related to diseases are frequently present in minute concentrations. For DNA and RNA, low concentrations can be amplified using the polymerase chain reaction, but there is no such reaction for proteins. Therefore, the development of single-molecule protein sequencing is a critical step in the search for protein biomarkers. Here, we show that single amino acids can be identified by trapping the molecules between two electrodes that are coated with a layer of recognition molecules, then measuring the electron tunnelling current across the junction. A given molecule can bind in more than one way in the junction, and we therefore use a machine-learning algorithm to distinguish between the sets of electronic 'fingerprints' associated with each binding motif. With this recognition tunnelling technique, we are able to identify D and L enantiomers, a methylated amino acid, isobaric isomers and short peptides. The results suggest that direct electronic sequencing of single proteins could be possible by sequentially measuring the products of processive exopeptidase digestion, or by using a molecular motor to pull proteins through a tunnel junction integrated with a nanopore.
25485618,6,2014,Nat Biotechnol,MinION nanopore sequencing identifies the position and structure of a bacterial antibiotic resistance island.,Short-read, high-throughput sequencing technology cannot identify the chromosomal position of repetitive insertion sequences that typically flank horizontally acquired genes such as bacterial virulence genes and antibiotic resistance genes. The MinION nanopore sequencer can produce long sequencing reads on a device similar in size to a USB memory stick. Here we apply a MinION sequencer to resolve the structure and chromosomal insertion site of a composite antibiotic resistance island in Salmonella Typhi Haplotype 58. Nanopore sequencing data from a single 18-h run was used to create a scaffold for an assembly generated from short-read Illumina data. Our results demonstrate the potential of the MinION device in clinical laboratories to fully characterize the epidemic spread of bacterial pathogens.
24547924,4,2014,ACS Nano,Atomically thin molybdenum disulfide nanopores with high sensitivity for DNA translocation.,Atomically thin nanopore membranes are considered to be a promising approach to achieve single base resolution with the ultimate aim of rapid and cheap DNA sequencing. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is newly emerging as a material complementary to graphene due to its semiconductive nature and other interesting physical properties that can enable a wide range of potential sensing and nanoelectronics applications. Here, we demonstrate that monolayer or few-layer thick exfoliated MoS2 with subnanometer thickness can be transferred and suspended on a predesigned location on the 20 nm thick SiNx membranes. Nanopores in MoS2 are further sculpted with variable sizes using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to drill through suspended portions of the MoS2 membrane. Various types of double-stranded (ds) DNA with different lengths and conformations are translocated through such a novel architecture, showing improved sensitivity (signal-to-noise ratio&gt;10) compared to the conventional silicon nitride (SiNx) nanopores with tens of nanometers thickness. Unlike graphene nanopores, no special surface treatment is needed to avoid hydrophobic interaction between DNA and the surface. Our results imply that MoS2 membranes with nanopore can complement graphene nanopore membranes and offer potentially better performance in transverse detection.
25143291,3,2014,Bioinformatics,Poretools: a toolkit for analyzing nanopore sequence data.,MOTIVATION: Nanopore sequencing may be the next disruptive technology in genomics, owing to its ability to detect single DNA molecules without prior amplification, lack of reliance on expensive optical components, and the ability to sequence long fragments. The MinION™ from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) is the first nanopore sequencer to be commercialized and is now available to early-access users. The MinION™ is a USB-connected, portable nanopore sequencer that permits real-time analysis of streaming event data. Currently, the research community lacks a standardized toolkit for the analysis of nanopore datasets.RESULTS: We introduce poretools, a flexible toolkit for exploring datasets generated by nanopore sequencing devices from MinION™ for the purposes of quality control and downstream analysis. Poretools operates directly on the native FAST5 (an application of the HDF5 standard) file format produced by ONT and provides a wealth of format conversion utilities and data exploration and visualization tools.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Poretools is an open-source software and is written in Python as both a suite of command line utilities and a Python application programming interface. Source code is freely available in Github at https://www.github.com/arq5x/poretools.
25009536,3,2014,Front Microbiol,DNA polymerases drive DNA sequencing-by-synthesis technologies: both past and present.,Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized modern biological and biomedical research. The engines responsible for this innovation are DNA polymerases; they catalyze the biochemical reaction for deriving template sequence information. In fact, DNA polymerase has been a cornerstone of DNA sequencing from the very beginning. Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I proteolytic (Klenow) fragment was originally utilized in Sanger's dideoxy chain-terminating DNA sequencing chemistry. From these humble beginnings followed an explosion of organism-specific, genome sequence information accessible via public database. Family A/B DNA polymerases from mesophilic/thermophilic bacteria/archaea were modified and tested in today's standard capillary electrophoresis (CE) and NGS sequencing platforms. These enzymes were selected for their efficient incorporation of bulky dye-terminator and reversible dye-terminator nucleotides respectively. Third generation, real-time single molecule sequencing platform requires slightly different enzyme properties. Enterobacterial phage ϕ29 DNA polymerase copies long stretches of DNA and possesses a unique capability to efficiently incorporate terminal phosphate-labeled nucleoside polyphosphates. Furthermore, ϕ29 enzyme has also been utilized in emerging DNA sequencing technologies including nanopore-, and protein-transistor-based sequencing. DNA polymerase is, and will continue to be, a crucial component of sequencing technologies.
24463372,3,2014,Sci Rep,Slowing down single-molecule trafficking through a protein nanopore reveals intermediates for peptide translocation.,The microscopic details of how peptides translocate one at a time through nanopores are crucial determinants for transport through membrane pores and important in developing nano-technologies. To date, the translocation process has been too fast relative to the resolution of the single molecule techniques that sought to detect its milestones. Using pH-tuned single-molecule electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate how peptide passage through the α-hemolysin protein can be sufficiently slowed down to observe intermediate single-peptide sub-states associated to distinct structural milestones along the pore, and how to control residence time, direction and the sequence of spatio-temporal state-to-state dynamics of a single peptide. Molecular dynamics simulations of peptide translocation reveal the time- dependent ordering of intermediate structures of the translocating peptide inside the pore at atomic resolution. Calculations of the expected current ratios of the different pore-blocking microstates and their time sequencing are in accord with the recorded current traces.
25496458,2,2014,Nano Lett,Velocity of DNA during translocation through a solid-state nanopore.,While understanding translocation of DNA through a solid-state nanopore is vital for exploiting its potential for sensing and sequencing at the single-molecule level, surprisingly little is known about the dynamics of the propagation of DNA through the nanopore. Here we use linear double-stranded DNA molecules, assembled by the DNA origami technique, with markers at known positions in order to determine for the first time the local velocity of different segments along the length of the molecule. We observe large intramolecular velocity fluctuations, likely related to changes in the drag force as the DNA blob unfolds. Furthermore, we observe an increase in the local translocation velocity toward the end of the translocation process, consistent with a speeding up due to unfolding of the last part of the DNA blob. We use the velocity profile to estimate the uncertainty in determining the position of a feature along the DNA given its temporal location and demonstrate the error introduced by assuming a constant translocation velocity.
25477535,2,2014,Clin Chem,Nanopore sequencing: from imagination to reality.,
25464141,2,2014,Anaerobe,Identification of antimicrobial resistance genes in multidrug-resistant clinical Bacteroides fragilis isolates by whole genome shotgun sequencing.,Bacteroides fragilis constitutes the most frequent anaerobic bacterium causing bacteremia in humans. The genetic background for antimicrobial resistance in B. fragilis is diverse with some genes requiring insertion sequence (IS) elements inserted upstream for increased expression. To evaluate whole genome shotgun sequencing as a method for predicting antimicrobial resistance properties, one meropenem resistant and five multidrug-resistant blood culture isolates were sequenced and antimicrobial resistance genes and IS elements identified using ResFinder 2.1 (http://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ResFinder/) and a custom BLAST database. Combinations of cfxA, cepA, cfiA, nimA, nimD, nimE, nimJ, tetQ, ermB, ermF, bexB, linAn2 and mefEn2 genes were identified in the six isolates. blaOXA-347, an open reading frame predicted to be a β-lactamase (Cheng et al., 2012), was identified in one strain. Full length IS elements were identified directly upstream of four genes, but in most cases contigs terminated 100-150 bases upstream of the gene in question. Even though partial IS elements were identified in these short sequences, certain identification could not be ascertained. Full antiobiograms for B. fragilis from genetic data will most likely require complete or nearly complete genomes. Current approaches to this are laborious and/or costly. Emerging technologies such as nanopore based single DNA strand sensing could perhaps provide a solution in the future.
25296960,2,2014,Nat Commun,Conformational transitions and stop-and-go nanopore transport of single-stranded DNA on charged graphene.,Control over interactions with biomolecules holds the key to applications of graphene in biotechnology. One such application is nanopore sequencing, where a DNA molecule is electrophoretically driven through a graphene nanopore. Here we investigate how interactions of single-stranded DNA and a graphene membrane can be controlled by electrically biasing the membrane. The results of our molecular dynamics simulations suggest that electric charge on graphene can force a DNA homopolymer to adopt a range of strikingly different conformations. The conformational response is sensitive to even very subtle nucleotide modifications, such as DNA methylation. The speed of DNA motion through a graphene nanopore is strongly affected by the graphene charge: a positive charge accelerates the motion, whereas a negative charge arrests it. As a possible application of the effect, we demonstrate stop-and-go transport of DNA controlled by the charge of graphene. Such on-demand transport of DNA is essential for realizing nanopore sequencing.
25209321,2,2014,Nano Lett,Reversible positioning of single molecules inside zero-mode waveguides.,We have developed a hybrid nanopore/zero-mode waveguide device for single-molecule fluorescence and DNA sequencing applications. The device is a freestanding solid-state membrane with sub-5 nm nanopores that reversibly delivers individual biomolecules to the base of 70 nm diameter waveguides for interrogation. Rapid and reversible molecular loading is achieved by controlling the voltage across the device. Using this device we demonstrate protein and DNA loading with efficiency that is orders of magnitude higher than diffusion-based molecular loading.
24849015,2,2014,J Phys Chem B,Graphene sculpturene nanopores for DNA nucleobase sensing.,To demonstrate the potential of nanopores in bilayer graphene for DNA sequencing, we computed the current-voltage characteristics of a bilayer graphene junction containing a nanopore and found that they change significantly when nucleobases are transported through the pore. To demonstrate the sensitivity and selectivity of example devices, we computed the probability distribution PX(β) of the quantity β representing the change in the logarithmic current through the pore due to the presence of a nucleobase X (X = adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine). We quantified the selectivity of the bilayer-graphene nanopores by showing that PX(β) exhibits distinct peaks for each base X. To demonstrate that such discriminating sensing is a general feature of bilayer nanopores, the well-separated positions of these peaks were shown to be present for different pores, with alternative examples of electrical contacts.
24840912,2,2014,ACS Nano,Direct, concurrent measurements of the forces and currents affecting DNA in a nanopore with comparable topography.,We report direct, concurrent measurements of the forces and currents associated with the translocation of a single-stranded DNA molecule tethered to the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever through synthetic pores with topagraphies comparable to the DNA. These measurements were performed to gauge the signal available for sequencing and the electric force required to impel a single molecule through synthetic nanopores ranging from 1.0 to 3.5 nm in diameter in silicon nitride membranes 6-10 nm thick. The measurements revealed that a molecule can slide relatively frictionlessly through a pore, but regular fluctuations are observed intermittently in the force (and the current) every 0.35-0.72 nm, which are attributed to individual nucleotides translating through the nanopore in a turnstile-like motion.
24688432,2,2014,ScientificWorldJournal,Next generation sequencing: potential and application in drug discovery.,The world has now entered into a new era of genomics because of the continued advancements in the next generation high throughput sequencing technologies, which includes sequencing by synthesis-fluorescent in situ sequencing (FISSEQ), pyrosequencing, sequencing by ligation using polony amplification, supported oligonucleotide detection (SOLiD), sequencing by hybridization along with sequencing by ligation, and nanopore technology. Great impacts of these methods can be seen for solving the genome related problems of plant and animal kingdom that will open the door of a new era of genomics. This may ultimately overcome the Sanger sequencing that ruled for 30 years. NGS is expected to advance and make the drug discovery process more rapid.
24581087,2,2014,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,Graphene nanopore support system for simultaneous high-resolution AFM imaging and conductance measurements.,Accurately defining the nanoporous structure and sensing the ionic flow across nanoscale pores in thin films and membranes has a wide range of applications, including characterization of biological ion channels and receptors, DNA sequencing, molecule separation by nanoparticle films, sensing by block co-polymers films, and catalysis through metal-organic frameworks. Ionic conductance through nanopores is often regulated by their 3D structures, a relationship that can be accurately determined only by their simultaneous measurements. However, defining their structure-function relationships directly by any existing techniques is still not possible. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can image the structures of these pores at high resolution in an aqueous environment, and electrophysiological techniques can measure ion flow through individual nanoscale pores. Combining these techniques is limited by the lack of nanoscale interfaces. We have designed a graphene-based single-nanopore support (∼5 nm thick with ∼20 nm pore diameter) and have integrated AFM imaging and ionic conductance recording using our newly designed double-chamber recording system to study an overlaid thin film. The functionality of this integrated system is demonstrated by electrical recording (&lt;10 pS conductance) of suspended lipid bilayers spanning a nanopore and simultaneous AFM imaging of the bilayer.
24496378,2,2014,Sci Rep,Regulating the transport of DNA through biofriendly nanochannels in a thin solid membrane.,Channels formed by membrane proteins regulate the transport of water, ions or nutrients that are essential to cells' metabolism. Recent advances in nanotechnology allow us to fabricate solid-state nanopores for transporting and analyzing biomolecules. However, uncontrollable surface properties of a fabricated nanopore cause irregular transport of biomolecules, limiting potential biomimetic applications. Here we show that a nanopore functionalized with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) can potentially regulate the transport of a DNA molecule by changing functional groups of the SAM. We found that an enhanced interaction between DNA and a SAM-coated nanopore can slow down the translocation speed of DNA molecules and increase the DNA capture-rate. Our results demonstrate that the transport of DNA molecules inside nanopores could be modulated by coating a SAM on the pore surface. Our method to control the DNA motion inside a nanopore may find its applications in nanopore-based DNA sequencing devices.
24496266,2,2014,Sens Actuators B Chem,Detecting single-abasic residues within a DNA strand immobilized in a biological nanopore using an integrated CMOS sensor.,In this paper, we demonstrate the application of a novel current-measuring sensor (CMS) customized for nanopore applications. The low-noise CMS is fabricated in a 0.35μm CMOS process and is implemented in experiments involving DNA captured in an α-hemolysin (α-HL) nanopore. Specifically, the CMS is used to build a current amplitude map as a function of varying positions of a single-abasic residue within a homopolymer cytosine single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is captured and held in the pore. Each ssDNA is immobilized using a biotin-streptavidin linkage. Five different DNA templates are measured and compared: one all-cytosine ssDNA, and four with a single-abasic residue substitution that resides in or near the ~1.5nm aperture of the α-HL channel when the strand is immobilized. The CMOS CMS is shown to resolves the ~5Å displacements of the abasic residue within the varying templates. The demonstration represents an advance in application-specific circuitry that is optimized for small-footprint nanopore applications, including genomic sequencing.
25522780,1,2014,Nano Lett,Two color DNA barcode detection in photoluminescence suppressed silicon nitride nanopores.,Optical sensing of solid-state nanopores is a relatively new approach that can enable high-throughput, multicolor readout from a collection of nanopores. It is therefore highly attractive for applications such as nanopore-based DNA sequencing and genotyping using DNA barcodes. However, to date optical readout has been plagued by the need to achieve sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for single fluorophore sensing, while still maintaining millisecond resolution. One of the main factors degrading the optical SNR in solid-state nanopores is the high photoluminescence (PL) background emanating from the silicon nitride (SiNx) membrane in which pores are commonly fabricated. Focusing on the optical properties of SiNx nanopores we show that the local membrane PL intensity is substantially reduced, and its spectrum is shifted toward shorter wavelengths with increasing e-beam dose. This phenomenon, which is correlated with a marked photocurrent enhancement in these nanopores, is utilized to perform for the first time single molecule fluorescence detection using both green and red laser excitations. Specifically, the reduction in PL and the concurrent measurement of the nanopore photocurrent enhancement allow us to maximize the background suppression and to detect a dual color, five-unit DNA barcode with high SNR levels.
25418589,1,2014,Nano Lett,Improving signal-to-noise performance for DNA translocation in solid-state nanopores at MHz bandwidths.,DNA sequencing using solid-state nanopores is, in part, impeded by the relatively high noise and low bandwidth of the current state-of-the-art translocation measurements. In this Letter, we measure the ion current noise through sub 10 nm thick Si3N4 nanopores at bandwidths up to 1 MHz. At these bandwidths, the input-referred current noise is dominated by the amplifier's voltage noise acting across the total capacitance at the amplifier input. By reducing the nanopore chip capacitance to the 1-5 pF range by adding thick insulating layers to the chip surface, we are able to transition to a regime in which input-referred current noise (∼ 117-150 pArms at 1 MHz in 1 M KCl solution) is dominated by the effects of the input capacitance of the amplifier itself. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) reported here range from 15 to 20 at 1 MHz for dsDNA translocations through nanopores with diameters from 4 to 8 nm with applied voltages from 200 to 800 mV. Further advances in bandwidth and SNR will require new amplifier designs that reduce both input capacitance and input-referred amplifier noise.
25402970,1,2014,ACS Nano,Discrimination among protein variants using an unfoldase-coupled nanopore.,Previously we showed that the protein unfoldase ClpX could facilitate translocation of individual proteins through the α-hemolysin nanopore. This results in ionic current fluctuations that correlate with unfolding and passage of intact protein strands through the pore lumen. It is plausible that this technology could be used to identify protein domains and structural modifications at the single-molecule level that arise from subtle changes in primary amino acid sequence (e.g., point mutations). As a test, we engineered proteins bearing well-characterized domains connected in series along an ∼700 amino acid strand. Point mutations in a titin immunoglobulin domain (titin I27) and point mutations, proteolytic cleavage, and rearrangement of beta-strands in green fluorescent protein (GFP), caused ionic current pattern changes for single strands predicted by bulk phase and force spectroscopy experiments. Among these variants, individual proteins could be classified at 86-99% accuracy using standard machine learning tools. We conclude that a ClpXP-nanopore device can discriminate among distinct protein domains, and that sequence-dependent variations within those domains are detectable.
25380310,1,2014,ACS Nano,Evidence of unfolded protein translocation through a protein nanopore.,Protein nanopores are mainly used to study transport, unfolding, intrinsically disordered proteins, protein-pore interactions, and protein-ligand complexes. This single-molecule sensor for biomedical and biotechnological applications is promising but until now direct proof of protein translocation through a narrow channel is lacking. Here, we report the translocation of a chimera molecule through the aerolysin nanopore in the presence of a denaturing agent, guanidium chloride (1.5 M) and KCl (1 M). The chimera molecule is composed of the recombinant MalE protein with a unique cysteine residue at the C-terminal position covalently linked to a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the presence of chimera molecules that have been effectively translocated from the cis to trans chamber of the set up. Comparing the electrical signature of the chimera related to the protein or oligonucleotide alone demonstrates that each type of molecule displays different dynamics in term of transport time, event frequency, and current blockade. This original approach provides the possibility to study protein translocation through different biological, artificial, and biomimetic nanopores or nanotubes. New future applications are now conceivable such as protein refolding at the nanopore exit, peptides and protein sequencing, and peptide characterization for diagnostics.

25007098,1,2014,ACS Nano,DNA base detection using a single-layer MoS2.,Nanopore-based DNA sequencing has led to fast and high-resolution recognition and detection of DNA bases. Solid-state and biological nanopores have low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (&lt; 10) and are generally too thick (&gt; 5 nm) to be able to read at single-base resolution. A nanopore in graphene, a 2-D material with sub-nanometer thickness, has a SNR of ∼3 under DNA ionic current. In this report, using atomistic and quantum simulations, we find that a single-layer MoS2 is an extraordinary material (with a SNR &gt; 15) for DNA sequencing by two competing technologies (i.e., nanopore and nanochannel). A MoS2 nanopore shows four distinct ionic current signals for single-nucleobase detection with low noise. In addition, a single-layer MoS2 shows a characteristic change/response in the total density of states for each base. The band gap of MoS2 is significantly changed compared to other nanomaterials (e.g., graphene, h-BN, and silicon nanowire) when bases are placed on top of the pristine MoS2 and armchair MoS2 nanoribbon, thus making MoS2 a promising material for base detection via transverse current tunneling measurement. MoS2 nanopore benefits from a craftable pore architecture (combination of Mo and S atoms at the edge) which can be engineered to obtain the optimum sequencing signals.
24968858,1,2014,Nanoscale,Effect of confinement on DNA, solvent and counterion dynamics in a model biological nanopore.,The application of recent advances in nanopore technology to high-throughput DNA sequencing requires a more detailed understanding of solvent, ion and DNA interactions occurring within these pores. Here we present a combination of atomistic and coarse-grained modeling studies of the dynamics of short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) homopolymers within the alpha-hemolysin pore, for the two single-stranded homopolymers poly(dA)40 and poly(dC)40. Analysis of atomistic simulations along with the per-residue decomposition of protein-DNA interactions in these simulations gives new insight into the very complex issues that have yet to be fully addressed with detailed MD simulations. We discuss a modification of the solvent properties and ion distribution around DNA within nanopore confinement and put it into the general framework of counterion condensation theory. There is a reasonable agreement in computed properties from our all-atom simulations and the resulting predictions from analytical theories with experimental data, and our equilibrium results here support the conclusions from our previous non-equilibrium Brownian dynamics studies with a recently developed BROMOC protocol that cations are the primary charge carriers through alpha-hemolysin nanopores under an applied voltage in the presence of ssDNA. Clustering analysis led to an identification of distinct conformational states of captured polymer and depth of the current blockade. Therefore, our data suggest that confined polymer may act as a flickering gate, thus contributing to excess noise phenomena. We also discuss the extent of water structuring due to nanopore confinement and the relationship between the conformational dynamics of a captured polymer and the distribution of blocked current.
24932700,1,2014,Nat Commun,Stiff filamentous virus translocations through solid-state nanopores.,The ionic conductance through a nanometer-sized pore in a membrane changes when a biopolymer slides through it, making nanopores sensitive to single molecules in solution. Their possible use for sequencing has motivated numerous studies on how DNA, a semi-flexible polymer, translocates nanopores. Here we study voltage-driven dynamics of the stiff filamentous virus fd with experiments and simulations to investigate the basic physics of polymer translocations. We find that the electric field distribution aligns an approaching fd with the nanopore, promoting its capture, but it also pulls fd sideways against the membrane after failed translocation attempts until thermal fluctuations reorient the virus for translocation. fd is too stiff to translocate in folded configurations. It therefore translocates linearly, exhibiting a voltage-independent mobility and obeying first-passage-time statistics. Surprisingly, lengthwise Brownian motion only partially accounts for the translocation velocity fluctuations. We also observe a voltage-dependent contribution whose origin is only partially determined.
24821802,1,2014,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Stabilization of graphene nanopore.,Graphene is an ultrathin, impervious membrane. The controlled introduction of nanoscale pores in graphene would lead to applications that involve water purification, chemical separation, and DNA sequencing. However, graphene nanopores are unstable against filling by carbon adatoms. Here, using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and density-functional calculations, we report that Si atoms stabilize graphene nanopores by bridging the dangling bonds around the perimeter of the hole. Si-passivated pores remain intact even under intense electron beam irradiation, and they were observed several months after the sample fabrication, demonstrating that these structures are intrinsically robust and stable against carbon filling. Theoretical calculations reveal the underlying mechanism for this stabilization effect: Si atoms bond strongly to the graphene edge, and their preference for tetrahedral coordination forces C adatoms to form dendrites sticking out of the graphene plane, instead of filling the nanopore. Our results provide a novel way to develop stable nanopores, which is a major step toward reliable graphene-based molecular translocation devices.
24777684,1,2014,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,Control of the conductance of engineered protein nanopores through concerted loop motions.,Protein nanopores have attracted much interest for nucleic acid sequencing, chemical sensing, and protein folding at the single molecule level. The outer membrane protein OmpG from E. coli stands out because it forms a nanopore from a single polypeptide chain. This property allows the separate engineering of each of the seven extracellular loops that control access to the pore. The longest of these loops, loop 6, has been recognized as the main gating loop that closes the pore at low pH values and opens it at high pH values. A method was devised to pin each of the loops to the embedding membrane and measure the single-pore conductances of the resulting constructs. The electrophysiological and complementary NMR measurements show that the pinning of individual loops alters the structure and dynamics of neighboring and distant loops in a correlated fashion. Pinning loop 6 generates a constitutively open pore and patterns of concerted loop motions control access to the OmpG nanopore.
24678449,1,2014,Bionanoscience,Creating a Single Sensing Zone within an Alpha-Hemolysin Pore Via Site Directed Mutagenesis.,Although significant progress has recently been made towards realizing the goal of direct nanopore based DNA sequencing [1], there are still numerous hurdles that need to be overcome. One such hurdle associated with the use of the biological nanopore α-hemolysin (αHL) is the fact that the wild type channel contains three very distinct recognition or sensing regions within the β-barrel [2, 3], making identification of the bases residing within or moving through the pore very difficult. Through site directed mutagenesis, we have been able to selectively remove one of two sensing regions while simultaneously enhancing the third. Our approach has led to the creation of αHL pores containing single sensing zones and provides the basis for engineering αHL pores suitable for direct DNA sequencing.
24577191,1,2014,Nanotechnology,Correlation dynamics and enhanced signals for the identification of serial biomolecules and DNA bases.,Nanopore-based sequencing has demonstrated a significant potential for the development of fast, accurate, and cost-efficient fingerprinting techniques for next generation molecular detection and sequencing. We propose a specific multilayered graphene-based nanopore device architecture for the recognition of single biomolecules. Molecular detection and analysis can be accomplished through the detection of transverse currents as the molecule or DNA base translocates through the nanopore. To increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio and the accuracy, we implement a new 'multi-point cross-correlation' technique for identification of DNA bases or other molecules on the single molecular level. We demonstrate that the cross-correlations between each nanopore will greatly enhance the transverse current signal for each molecule. We implement first-principles transport calculations for DNA bases surveyed across a multilayered graphene nanopore system to illustrate the advantages of the proposed geometry. A time-series analysis of the cross-correlation functions illustrates the potential of this method for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio. This work constitutes a significant step forward in facilitating fingerprinting of single biomolecules using solid state technology.
24459097,1,2014,Electrophoresis,Spatial blockage of ionic current for electrophoretic translocation of DNA through a graphene nanopore.,Graphene nanopore has been promising the ultra-high resolution for DNA sequencing due to the atomic thickness and excellent electronic properties of the graphene monolayer. The dynamical translocation phenomena and/or behaviors underneath the blocked ionic current, however, have not been well unveiled to date for the translocation of DNA electrophoretically through a graphene nanopore. In this report, the assessment on the sensitivity of ionic current to instantaneous statuses of DNA in a 2.4 nm graphene nanopore was carried out based on the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. By filtering out the thermal noise of ionic current, the instantaneous conformational variations of DNA in a graphene nanopore have been unveiled from the fluctuations of ionic current, because of the spatial blockage effect of DNA against ionic current. Interestingly, the neighborhood effect of DNA against ionic current was also observed within a distance of 1.5 nm nearby the graphene nanopore, suggesting the further precise control for DNA translocation through a graphene nanopore in gene sequencing. Moreover, the sensitivity of the blocked ionic current toward the instantaneous conformations of DNA in a graphene nanopore demonstrates the great potential of graphene nanopores in the dynamics analysis of single molecules.
25502887,0,2014,Nat Protoc,Genome-scale RNAi screens for high-throughput phenotyping in bloodstream-form African trypanosomes.,The ability to simultaneously assess every gene in a genome for a role in a particular process has obvious appeal. This protocol describes how to perform genome-scale RNAi library screens in bloodstream-form African trypanosomes, a family of parasites that causes lethal human and animal diseases and also serves as a model for studies on basic aspects of eukaryotic biology and evolution. We discuss strain assembly, screen design and implementation, the RNAi target sequencing approach and hit validation, and we provide a step-by-step protocol. A screen can yield from one to thousands of 'hits' associated with the phenotype of interest. The screening protocol itself takes 2 weeks or less to be completed, and high-throughput sequencing may also be completed within weeks. Pre- and post-screen strain assembly, validation and follow-up can take several months, depending on the type of screen and the number of hits analyzed.
25461428,0,2014,Electrophoresis,Translocation of a polymer through a nanopore starting from a confining nanotube.,In this manuscript, Langevin Dynamics simulations and Tension-Propagation theory are used to investigate the forced translocation of a polymer from a confining tube through a nanopore situated at one of the tube's ends. The diameter of the tube allows for a control over the polymer conformations: decreasing the tube diameter reduces the number of conformations available to the polymer chain both before and during translocation. As the tube diameter is decreased, the translocation time is observed to increase. Interestingly, while the width of the distribution of translocation times is reduced if the chain starts in a tube, it reaches a maximum for weakly confining tubes. A Tension-Propagation approach is developed for the tube-nanopore setup in the strongly driven limit. Good agreement between the simulations and the theory allows for an exploration of the underlying physical mechanisms, including the calculation of an effective pore friction and the assessing of the impact of monomer crowding on the trans side.
25429504,0,2014,IET Nanobiotechnol,Theoretical and experimental studies on ionic currents in nanopore-based biosensors.,Novel generation of analytical technology based on nanopores has provided possibilities to fabricate nanofluidic devices for low-cost DNA sequencing or rapid biosensing. In this paper, a simplified model was suggested to describe DNA molecule's translocation through a nanopore, and the internal potential, ion concentration, ionic flowing speed and ionic current in nanopores with different sizes were theoretically calculated and discussed on the basis of Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Navier-Stokes equation and Nernst-Planck equation by considering several important parameters, such as the applied voltage, the thickness and the electric potential distributions in nanopores. In this way, the basic ionic currents, the modulated ionic currents and the current drops induced by translocation were obtained, and the size effects of the nanopores were carefully compared and discussed based on the calculated results and experimental data, which indicated that nanopores with a size of 10 nm or so are more advantageous to achieve high quality ionic current signals in DNA sensing.
25380436,0,2014,Nat Biotechnol,Technology comes to typing.,As mass spectrometry makes inroads into pathogen identification in the clinical laboratory, deep sequencing - even nanopore sequencing - is waiting in the wings. Jeffrey L. Fox investigates.
25340457,0,2014,Faraday Discuss,Visual analysis for space-time aggregation of biomolecular simulations.,Conducting a current through a nanopore allows for the analysis of molecules inside the pore because a current modulation caused by the electrostatic properties of the passing molecules can be measured. This mechanism shows great potential for DNA sequencing, as the four different nucleotide bases induce different current modulations. We present a visualisation approach to investigate this phenomenon in our simulations of DNA within a nanopore by combining state-of-the-art molecular visualisation with vector field illustration. By spatial and temporal aggregation of the ions transported through the pore, we construct a velocity field which exhibits the induced current modulations caused by ion flux. In our interactive analysis using parametrisable three-dimensional visualisations, we encountered regions where the ion motion unexpectedly opposes the direction of the applied electric field.
25310861,0,2014,Langmuir,Controlling polymer translocation and ion transport via charge correlations.,We develop a correlation-corrected transport theory in order to predict ionic and polymer transport properties of membrane nanopores under physical conditions where mean-field electrostatics breaks down. The experimentally observed low KCl conductivity of open α-hemolysin pores is quantitatively explained by the presence of surface polarization effects. Upon the penetration of a DNA molecule into the pore, these polarization forces combined with the electroneutrality of DNA sets a lower boundary for the ionic current, explaining the weak salt dependence of blocked pore conductivities at dilute ion concentrations. The addition of multivalent counterions to the solution results in the reversal of the polymer charge and the direction of the electroosmotic flow. With trivalent spermidine or quadrivalent spermine molecules, the charge inversion is strong enough to stop the translocation of the polymer and to reverse its motion. This mechanism can be used efficiently in translocation experiments in order to improve the accuracy of DNA sequencing by minimizing the translocation velocity of the polymer.
25236988,0,2014,Small,Programmed synthesis of freestanding graphene nanomembrane arrays.,Freestanding graphene membranes are unique materials. The combination of atomically thin dimensions, remarkable mechanical robustness, and chemical stability make porous and non-porous graphene membranes attractive for water purification and various sensing applications. Nanopores in graphene and other 2D materials have been identified as promising devices for next-generation DNA sequencing based on readout of either transverse DNA base-gated current or through-pore ion current. While several ground breaking studies of graphene-based nanopores for DNA analysis have been reported, all methods to date require a physical transfer of the graphene from its source of production onto an aperture support. The transfer process is slow and often leads to tears in the graphene that render many devices useless for nanopore measurements. In this work, we report a novel scalable approach for site-directed fabrication of pinhole-free graphene nanomembranes. Our approach yields high quality few-layer graphene nanomembranes produced in less than a day using a few steps that do not involve transfer. We highlight the functionality of these graphene devices by measuring DNA translocation through electron-beam fabricated nanopores in such membranes.
25154639,0,2014,Nanoscale,Controlled transport of DNA through a Y-shaped carbon nanotube in a solid membrane.,We investigate the possible ratcheting dynamics of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) driven through a Y-shaped carbon nanotube (Y-CNT) in a solid membrane, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. By applying constant or alternating biasing voltages, we found that the dsDNA molecule can be unzipped at the junction of the Y-CNT. Because of the energy barrier (a few kBT per base-pair), the motion of the entire DNA molecule was alternatively in a trapped state or a transiting state. We show that during each transiting state the same number of nucleotides were transported (DNA ratcheting). An analytical theory that is mathematically equivalent to the one for Josephson junctions was then proposed to quantitatively describe the simulation results. The controlled motion of DNA in the Y-CNT is expected to enhance the accuracy of nanopore-based DNA sequencing.
25147426,0,2014,J Phys Org Chem,Single-molecule detection of a guanine(C8) - thymine(N3) cross-link using ion channel recording.,The capability to identify and sequence DNA damage within the context of the genome is an important goal for medical diagnostics. However, currently available methods are not suitable for this purpose. Ion channel nanopore analysis shows promise as a potential single-molecule method to sequence genomic DNA in such a way that also allows detection of base or backbone modifications. Recent studies in human cell lines demonstrated the occurrence of a new DNA cross-link between guanine(C8) and thymine(N3) (5'-G*CT*-3'). The current work presents immobilization and translocation studies of the 5'-G*CT*-3' cross-link in a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide using the α-hemolysin (α-HL) ion channel. A 3'-biotinylated DNA strand containing the 5'-G*CT*-3' cross-link was incubated with streptavidin that allowed immobilization of the DNA in the β-barrel of α-HL. In this experiment, the 5'-G*CT*-3' cross-link was placed near the sensitive constriction zone of α-HL, yielding a 2.5% deeper blockage to the ion current level when compared to the unmodified strand. Next, free translocation of a cross-link-containing strand was studied, and an inverse relationship of the time constant with respect to an increase in the applied voltage was found, indicating that the cross-link can easily fit into the β-barrel and traverse through the ion channel. However, a modulation in the ion current level was not observed. These studies suggest that higher resolution ion channels or mechanisms to slow the translocation process, or both, might ultimately provide a mechanism for single-molecule sequencing for G-T cross-links.
25116147,0,2014,Nanotechnology,Oxidation of nanopores in a silicon membrane: self-limiting formation of sub-10 nm circular openings.,We describe a simple but reliable approach to shrink silicon nanopores with nanometer precision for potential high throughput biomolecular sensing and parallel DNA sequencing. Here, nanopore arrays on silicon membranes were fabricated by a self-limiting shrinkage of inverted pyramidal pores using dry thermal oxidation at 850 °C. The shrinkage rate of the pores with various initial sizes saturated after 4 h of oxidation. In the saturation regime, the shrinkage rate is within ± 2 nm h(-1). Oxidized pores with an average diameter of 32 nm were obtained with perfect circular shape. By careful design of the initial pore size, nanopores with diameters as small as 8 nm have been observed. Statistics of the pore width show that the shrinkage process did not broaden the pore size distribution; in most cases the distribution even decreased slightly. The progression of the oxidation and the deformation of the oxide around the pores were characterized by focused ion beam and electron microscopy. Cross-sectional imaging of the pores suggests that the initial inverted pyramidal geometry is most likely the determining factor for the self-limiting shrinkage.
25044955,0,2014,Small,Surface modification of solid-state nanopores for sticky-free translocation of single-stranded DNA.,Nanopore technology is one of the most promising approaches for fast and low-cost DNA sequencing application. Single-stranded DNA detection is primary objective in such device, while solid-state nanopores remain less explored than their biological counterparts due to bio-molecule clogging issue caused by surface interaction between DNA and nanopore wall. By surface coating a layer of polyethylene glycol (PEG), solid-state nanopore can achieve long lifetime for single-stranded DNA sticky-free translocation at pH 11.5. Associated with elimination of non-specific binding of molecule, PEG coated nanopore presents new surface characteristic as less hydrophility, lower 1/f noise, and passivated surface charge responsiveness on pH. Meanwhile, conductance blockage of single-stranded DNA is found to be deeper than double-stranded DNA, which can be well described by a string of blobs model for a quasi-equilibrium state polymer in constraint space.
25029683,0,2014,IEEE Pulse,The promise of nanopore technology: Nanopore DNA sequencing represents a fundamental change in the way that genomic information is read, with potentially big savings.,
24994487,0,2014,World Neurosurg,Biomimetic nanopores: a new age of DNA sequencing?,
24991734,0,2014,Analyst,Single molecule analysis by biological nanopore sensors.,Nanopore sensors provide a highly innovative technique for a rapid and label-free single molecule analysis, which holds a great potential in routing applications. Biological nanopores have been used as ultra-sensitive sensors over a wide range of single molecule analysis including DNA sequencing, disease diagnosis, drug screening, environment monitoring and the construction of molecule machines. This mini review will focus on the current strategies for the identification and characterization of an individual analyte, especially based on our recent achievements in biological nanopore biosensors.
24960034,0,2014,Nanotechnology,Slowing single-stranded DNA translocation through a solid-state nanopore by decreasing the nanopore diameter.,To slow the translocation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) through a solid-state nanopore, a nanopore was narrowed, and the effect of the narrowing on the DNA translocation speed was investigated. In order to accurately measure the speed, long (5.3 kb) ssDNA (namely, ss-poly(dA)) with uniform length (±0.4 kb) was synthesized. The diameters of nanopores fabricated by a transmission electron microscope were controlled by atomic-layer deposition. Reducing the nanopore diameter from 4.5 to 2.3 nm slowed down the translocation of ssDNA by more than 16 times (to 0.18 μs base(-1)) when 300 mV was applied across the nanopore. It is speculated that the interaction between the nanopore and the ssDNA dominates the translocation speed. Unexpectedly, the translocation speed of ssDNA through the 4.5 nm nanopore is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) through a nanopore of almost the same size. The cause of such a faster translocation of ssDNA can be explained by the weaker drag force inside the nanopore. Moreover, the measured translocation speeds of ssDNA and dsDNA agree well with those calculated by molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation. The MD simulation predicted that reducing the nanopore diameter to almost the same as that of ssDNA (i.e. 1.4 nm) decreases the translocation speed (to 1.4 μs base(-1)). Narrowing the nanopore is thus an effective approach for accomplishing nanopore DNA sequencing.
24790974,0,2014,Front Chem,Computational studies of DNA sequencing with solid-state nanopores: key issues and future prospects.,Owing to the potential use for real personalized genome sequencing, DNA sequencing with solid-state nanopores has been investigated intensively in recent time. However, the area still confronts problems and challenges. In this work, we present a brief overview of computational studies of key issues in DNA sequencing with solid-state nanopores by addressing the progress made in the last few years. We also highlight future challenges and prospects for DNA sequencing using this technology.
24738152,0,2014,J Comput Chem,Microsecond simulations of DNA and ion transport in nanopores with novel ion-ion and ion-nucleotides effective potentials.,We developed a novel scheme based on the grand-canonical Monte Carlo/Brownian dynamics simulations and have extended it to studies of ion currents across three nanopores with the potential for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequencing: solid-state nanopore Si₃N₄, α-hemolysin, and E111N/M113Y/K147N mutant. To describe nucleotide-specific ion dynamics compatible with ssDNA coarse-grained model, we used the inverse Monte Carlo protocol, which maps the relevant ion-nucleotide distribution functions from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Combined with the previously developed simulation platform for Brownian dynamics simulations of ion transport, it allows for microsecond- and millisecond-long simulations of ssDNA dynamics in the nanopore with a conductance computation accuracy that equals or exceeds that of all-atom MD simulations. In spite of the simplifications, the protocol produces results that agree with the results of previous studies on ion conductance across open channels and provide direct correlations with experimentally measured blockade currents and ion conductances that have been estimated from all-atom MD simulations.
24608602,0,2014,Nanoscale,Chemically modified diamondoids as biosensors for DNA.,Understanding the interaction of biological molecules with materials is essential in view of the novel potential applications arising when these two are combined. To this end, we investigate the interaction of DNA with diamondoids, a broad family of tiny hydrogen-terminated diamond clusters with high technological potential. We model this interaction through quantum-mechanical computer simulations and focus on the hydrogen bonding possibilities of the different DNA nucleobases to the lower amine-modified diamondoids with respect to their relative distance and orientation. Our aim is to promote the binding between these two units, and probe this through the association energy, the electronic structure of the nucleobase-diamondoid system, and the specific role of their frontier orbitals. We discuss the relevance of our results in view of biosensing applications and specifically nanopore sequencing of DNA.
24403093,0,2014,J Comput Chem,Comparative analysis of nucleotide translocation through protein nanopores using steered molecular dynamics and an adaptive biasing force.,The translocation of nucleotide molecules across biological and synthetic nanopores has attracted attention as a next generation technique for sequencing DNA. Computer simulations have the ability to provide atomistic-level insight into important states and processes, delivering a means to develop a fundamental understanding of the translocation event, for example, by extracting the free energy of the process. Even with current supercomputing facilities, the simulation of many-atom systems in fine detail is limited to shorter timescales than the real events they attempt to recreate. This imposes the need for enhanced simulation techniques that expand the scope of investigation in a given timeframe. There are numerous free energy calculation and translocation methodologies available, and it is by no means clear which method is best applied to a particular problem. This article explores the use of two popular free energy calculation methodologies in a nucleotide-nanopore translocation system, using the α-hemolysin nanopore. The first uses constant velocity-steered molecular dynamics (cv-SMD) in conjunction with Jarzynski's equality. The second applies an adaptive biasing force (ABF), which has not previously been applied to the nucleotide-nanpore system. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive comparison of these methodologies, allowing for a detailed comparative assessment of the scientific merits, the computational cost, and the statistical quality of the data obtained from each technique. We find that the ABF method produces results that are closer to experimental measurements than those from cv-SMD, whereas the net errors are smaller for the same computational cost.
23376966,21,2013,Nat Biotechnol,Unfoldase-mediated protein translocation through an α-hemolysin nanopore.,Using nanopores to sequence biopolymers was proposed more than a decade ago. Recent advances in enzyme-based control of DNA translocation and in DNA nucleotide resolution using modified biological pores have satisfied two technical requirements of a functional nanopore DNA sequencing device. Nanopore sequencing of proteins was also envisioned. Although proteins have been shown to move through nanopores, a technique to unfold proteins for processive translocation has yet to be demonstrated. Here we describe controlled unfolding and translocation of proteins through the α-hemolysin (α-HL) pore using the AAA+ unfoldase ClpX. Sequence-dependent features of individual engineered proteins were detected during translocation. These results demonstrate that molecular motors can reproducibly drive proteins through a model nanopore--a feature required for protein sequence analysis using this single-molecule technology.
24167255,13,2013,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Detection and mapping of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine with nanopore MspA.,Precise and efficient mapping of epigenetic markers on DNA may become an important clinical tool for prediction and identification of ailments. Methylated CpG sites are involved in gene expression and are biomarkers for diseases such as cancer. Here, we use the engineered biological protein pore Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) to detect and map 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine within single strands of DNA. In this unique single-molecule tool, a phi29 DNA polymerase draws ssDNA through the pore in single-nucleotide steps, and the ion current through the pore is recorded. Comparing current levels generated with DNA containing methylated CpG sites to current levels obtained with unmethylated copies of the DNA reveals the precise location of methylated CpG sites. Hydroxymethylation is distinct from methylation and can also be mapped. With a single read, the detection efficiency in a quasirandom DNA strand is 97.5 ± 0.7% for methylation and 97 ± 0.9% for hydroxymethylation.
24240429,10,2013,Nat Nanotechnol,Detecting the translocation of DNA through a nanopore using graphene nanoribbons.,Solid-state nanopores can act as single-molecule sensors and could potentially be used to rapidly sequence DNA molecules. However, nanopores are typically fabricated in insulating membranes that are as thick as 15 bases, which makes it difficult for the devices to read individual bases. Graphene is only 0.335 nm thick (equivalent to the spacing between two bases in a DNA chain) and could therefore provide a suitable membrane for sequencing applications. Here, we show that a solid-state nanopore can be integrated with a graphene nanoribbon transistor to create a sensor for DNA translocation. As DNA molecules move through the pore, the device can simultaneously measure drops in ionic current and changes in local voltage in the transistor, which can both be used to detect the molecules. We examine the correlation between these two signals and use the ionic current measurements as a real-time control of the graphene-based sensing device.
24171554,10,2013,Nano Lett,Nanopore-based identification of individual nucleotides for direct RNA sequencing.,We describe a label-free ribobase identification method, which uses ionic current measurement to resolve ribonucleoside monophosphates or diphosphates in α-hemolysin protein nanopores containing amino-cyclodextrin adapters. The accuracy of base identification is further investigated through the use of a guanidino-modified adapter. On the basis of these findings, an exosequencing approach is envisioned in which a processive exoribonuclease (polynucleotide phosphorylase) presents sequentially cleaved ribonucleoside diphosphates to a nanopore.
23678965,9,2013,Nano Lett,Translocating kilobase RNA through the Staphylococcal α-hemolysin nanopore.,The electrophoretic translocation of polynucleotides through nanopores may permit direct single-molecule nucleic acid sequencing. Here we describe the translocation of ssRNA heteropolymers (91-6083 bases) through the α-hemolysin nanopore. Translocation of these long ssRNAs is characterized by surprisingly long, almost complete ionic current blockades with durations averaging milliseconds per base (at +180 mV). The event durations decrease exponentially with increased transmembrane potential but are largely unaffected by the presence of urea. When the ssRNA is coupled at the 3' end to streptavidin, which cannot translocate through the pore, permanent blockades are observed, supporting our conclusion that the transient blockades arise from ssRNA translocation.
23586585,9,2013,Nano Lett,Dynamic and electronic transport properties of DNA translocation through graphene nanopores.,Graphene layers have been targeted in the last years as excellent host materials for sensing a remarkable variety of gases and molecules. Such sensing abilities can also benefit other important scientific fields such as medicine and biology. This has automatically led scientists to probe graphene as a potential platform for sequencing DNA strands. In this work, we use robust numerical tools to model the dynamic and electronic properties of molecular sensor devices composed of a graphene nanopore through which DNA molecules are driven by external electric fields. We performed molecular dynamic simulations to determine the relation between the intensity of the electric field and the translocation time spent by the DNA to pass through the pore. Our results reveal that one can have extra control on the DNA passage when four additional graphene layers are deposited on the top of the main graphene platform containing the pore in a 2 × 2 grid arrangement. In addition to the dynamic analysis, we carried electronic transport calculations on realistic pore structures with diameters reaching nanometer scales. The transmission obtained along the graphene sensor at the Fermi level is affected by the presence of the DNA. However, it is rather hard to distinguish the respective nucleobases. This scenario can be significantly altered when the transport is conducted away from the Fermi level of the graphene platform. Under an energy shift, we observed that the graphene pore manifests selectiveness toward DNA nucleobases.
23504223,9,2013,Nano Today,Solid-State and Biological Nanopore for Real-Time Sensing of Single Chemical and Sequencing of DNA.,Sensitivity and specificity are two most important factors to take into account for molecule sensing, chemical detection and disease diagnosis. A perfect sensitivity is to reach the level where a single molecule can be detected. An ideal specificity is to reach the level where the substance can be detected in the presence of many contaminants. The rapidly progressing nanopore technology is approaching this threshold. A wide assortment of biomotors and cellular pores in living organisms perform diverse biological functions. The elegant design of these transportation machineries has inspired the development of single molecule detection based on modulations of the individual current blockage events. The dynamic growth of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology has stimulated rapid advances in the study of nanopore based instrumentation over the last decade, and inspired great interest in sensing of single molecules including ions, nucleotides, enantiomers, drugs, and polymers such as PEG, RNA, DNA, and polypeptides. This sensing technology has been extended to medical diagnostics and third generation high throughput DNA sequencing. This review covers current nanopore detection platforms including both biological pores and solid state counterparts. Several biological nanopores have been studied over the years, but this review will focus on the three best characterized systems including α-hemolysin and MspA, both containing a smaller channel for the detection of single-strand DNA, as well as bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor connector that contains a larger channel for the passing of double stranded DNA. The advantage and disadvantage of each system are compared; their current and potential applications in nanomedicine, biotechnology, and nanotechnology are discussed.
23758046,6,2013,ACS Nano,Threading immobilized DNA molecules through a solid-state nanopore at &gt;100 μs per base rate.,In pursuit of developing solid-state nanopore-based DNA sequencing technology, we have designed and constructed an apparatus that can place a DNA-tethered probe tip near a solid-state nanopore, control the DNA moving speed, and measure the ionic current change when a DNA molecule is captured and released from a nanopore. The probe tip's position is sensed and controlled by a tuning fork based feedback force sensor and a nanopositioning system. Using this newly constructed apparatus, a DNA strand moving rate of &gt;100 μs/base or &lt;1 nm/ms in silicon nitride nanopores has been accomplished. This rate is 10 times slower than by manipulating DNA-tethered beads using optical tweezers and 1000 times slower than free DNA translocation through solid-state nanopores reported previously, which provides enough temporal resolution to read each base on a tethered DNA molecule using available single-channel recording electronics on the market today. This apparatus can measure three signals simultaneously: ionic current through a nanopore, tip position, and tip vibrational amplitude during the process of a DNA molecule's capture and release by a nanopore. We show results of this apparatus for measuring λ DNA's capture and release distances and for current blockage signals of λ DNA molecules biotinylated with one end and with both ends tethered to a tip.
24224888,5,2013,ACS Nano,Toward sensitive graphene nanoribbon-nanopore devices by preventing electron beam-induced damage.,Graphene-based nanopore devices are promising candidates for next-generation DNA sequencing. Here we fabricated graphene nanoribbon-nanopore (GNR-NP) sensors for DNA detection. Nanopores with diameters in the range 2-10 nm were formed at the edge or in the center of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), with widths between 20 and 250 nm and lengths of 600 nm, on 40 nm thick silicon nitride (SiN(x)) membranes. GNR conductance was monitored in situ during electron irradiation-induced nanopore formation inside a transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 200 kV. We show that GNR resistance increases linearly with electron dose and that GNR conductance and mobility decrease by a factor of 10 or more when GNRs are imaged at relatively high magnification with a broad beam prior to making a nanopore. By operating the TEM in scanning TEM (STEM) mode, in which the position of the converged electron beam can be controlled with high spatial precision via automated feedback, we were able to prevent electron beam-induced damage and make nanopores in highly conducting GNR sensors. This method minimizes the exposure of the GNRs to the beam before and during nanopore formation. The resulting GNRs with unchanged resistances after nanopore formation can sustain microampere currents at low voltages (∼50 mV) in buffered electrolyte solution and exhibit high sensitivity, with a large relative change of resistance upon changes of gate voltage, similar to pristine GNRs without nanopores.
23488809,5,2013,ACS Nano,Channel size conversion of Phi29 DNA-packaging nanomotor for discrimination of single- and double-stranded nucleic acids.,Nanopores have been utilized to detect the conformation and dynamics of polymers, including DNA and RNA. Biological pores are extremely reproducible at the atomic level with uniform channel sizes. The channel of the bacterial virus phi29 DNA-packaging motor is a natural conduit for the transportation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and has the largest diameter among the well-studied biological channels. The larger channel facilitates translocation of dsDNA and offers more space for further channel modification and conjugation. Interestingly, the relatively large wild-type channel, which translocates dsDNA, cannot detect single-stranded nucleic acids (ssDNA or ssRNA) under the current experimental conditions. Herein, we reengineered this motor channel by removing the internal loop segment of the channel. The modification resulted in two classes of channels. One class was the same size as the wild-type channel, while the other class had a cross-sectional area about 60% of the wild-type. This smaller channel was able to detect the real-time translocation of single-stranded nucleic acids at single-molecule level. While the wild-type connector exhibited a one-way traffic property with respect to dsDNA translocation, the loop-deleted connector was able to translocate ssDNA and ssRNA with equal competencies from both termini. This finding of size alterations in reengineered motor channels expands the potential application of the phi29 DNA-packaging motor in nanomedicine, nanobiotechnology, and high-throughput single-pore DNA sequencing.

23876013,4,2013,ACS Nano,Stretching and controlled motion of single-stranded DNA in locally heated solid-state nanopores.,Practical applications of solid-state nanopores for DNA detection and sequencing require the electrophoretic motion of DNA through the nanopores to be precisely controlled. Controlling the motion of single-stranded DNA presents a particular challenge, in part because of the multitude of conformations that a DNA strand can adopt in a nanopore. Through continuum, coarse-grained and atomistic modeling, we demonstrate that local heating of the nanopore volume can be used to alter the electrophoretic mobility and conformation of single-stranded DNA. In the nanopore systems considered, the temperature near the nanopore is modulated via a nanometer-size heater element that can be radiatively switched on and off. The local enhancement of temperature produces considerable stretching of the DNA fragment confined within the nanopore. Such stretching is reversible, so that the conformation of DNA can be toggled between compact (local heating is off) and extended (local heating is on) states. The effective thermophoretic force acting on single-stranded DNA in the vicinity of the nanopore is found to be sufficiently large (4-8 pN) to affect such changes in the DNA conformation. The local heating of the nanopore volume is observed to promote single-file translocation of DNA strands at transmembrane biases as low as 10 mV, which opens new avenues for using solid-state nanopores for detection and sequencing of DNA.
23300324,4,2013,Poult Sci,Next-generation sequencing: the future of molecular genetics in poultry production and food safety.,The era of molecular biology and automation of the Sanger chain-terminator sequencing method has led to discovery and advances in diagnostics and biotechnology. The Sanger methodology dominated research for over 2 decades, leading to significant accomplishments and technological improvements in DNA sequencing. Next-generation high-throughput sequencing (HT-NGS) technologies were developed subsequently to overcome the limitations of this first generation technology that include higher speed, less labor, and lowered cost. Various platforms developed include sequencing-by-synthesis 454 Life Sciences, Illumina (Solexa) sequencing, SOLiD sequencing (among others), and the Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing technologies that use different detection principles. As technology advances, progress made toward third generation sequencing technologies are being reported, which include Nanopore Sequencing and real-time monitoring of PCR activity through fluorescent resonant energy transfer. The advantages of these technologies include scalability, simplicity, with increasing DNA polymerase performance and yields, being less error prone, and even more economically feasible with the eventual goal of obtaining real-time results. These technologies can be directly applied to improve poultry production and enhance food safety. For example, sequence-based (determination of the gut microbial community, genes for metabolic pathways, or presence of plasmids) and function-based (screening for function such as antibiotic resistance, or vitamin production) metagenomic analysis can be carried out. Gut microbialflora/communities of poultry can be sequenced to determine the changes that affect health and disease along with efficacy of methods to control pathogenic growth. Thus, the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the principles of these current technologies and their potential application to improve poultry production and food safety as well as public health.
24308689,3,2013,Nano Lett,Nanopore integrated nanogaps for DNA detection.,A high-throughput fabrication of sub-10 nm nanogap electrodes combined with solid-state nanopores is described. These devices should allow concomitant tunneling and ionic current detection of translocating DNA molecules. We report the optimal fabrication parameters in terms of dose, resist thickness, and gap shape that allow easy reproduction of the fabrication process at wafer scale. The device noise and current voltage characterizations performed and the influence of the nanoelectrodes on the ionic current noise is identified. In some cases, ionic current rectification for connected or biased nanogap electrodes is also observed. In order to increase the extremely low translocation rates, several experimental strategies were tested and modeled using finite element analysis. Our findings are useful for future device designs of nanopore integrated electrodes for DNA sequencing.
24057036,3,2013,Nanoscale,Slow translocation of polynucleotides and their discrimination by α-hemolysin inside a single track-etched nanopore designed by atomic layer deposition.,We report the formation of a hybrid biological/artificial nanopore by the direct insertion of non-modified α-hemolysin at the entrance of a high aspect ratio (length/diameter) biomimetic nanopore. In this robust hybrid system, the protein exhibits the same polynucleotide discrimination properties as in the biological membrane and the polynucleotide dwell time is strongly increased. This nanopore is very promising for DNA sequencing applications where the high DNA translocation velocity and the fragility of the support are the main bottlenecks.
23963318,3,2013,J Phys Condens Matter,On the distribution of DNA translocation times in solid-state nanopores: an analysis using Schrödinger's first-passage-time theory.,In this short paper, a correction is made to the recently proposed solution of Li and Talaga to a 1D biased diffusion model for linear DNA translocation, and a new analysis will be given to their data. It was pointed out by us recently that this 1D linear translocation model is equivalent to the one that was considered by Schrödinger for the Ehrenhaft–Millikan measurements on electron charge. Here, we apply Schrödinger’s first-passage-time distribution formula to the data set in Li and Talaga. It is found that Schrödinger’s formula can be used to describe the time distribution of DNA translocation in solid-state nanopores. These fittings yield two useful parameters: the drift velocity of DNA translocation and the diffusion constant of DNA inside the nanopore. The results suggest two regimes of DNA translocation: (I) at low voltages, there are clear deviations from Smoluchowski’s linear law of electrophoresis, which we attribute to the entropic barrier effects; (II) at high voltages, the translocation velocity is a linear function of the applied electric field. In regime II, the apparent diffusion constant exhibits a quadratic dependence on the applied electric field, suggesting a mechanism of Taylor-dispersion effect likely due the electro-osmotic flow field in the nanopore channel. This analysis yields a dispersion-free diffusion constant value of 11.2 nm2 µs-1 for the segment of DNA inside the nanopore, which is in quantitative agreement with the Stokes–Einstein theory. The implication of Schrödinger’s formula for DNA sequencing is discussed.
23484881,3,2013,ACS Nano,DNA manipulation and separation in sublithographic-scale nanowire array.,Electrokinetic manipulations of biomolecules using artificial nanostructures within microchannels have proven capability for controlling the dynamics of biomolecules. Because there is an inherent spatial size limitation to lithographic technology, especially for nanostructures with a small diameter and high aspect ratio, manipulating a single small biomolecule such as in DNA elongation before nanopore sequencing is still troublesome. Here we show the feasibility for self-assembly of a nanowire array embedded in a microchannel on a fused silica substrate as a means to manipulate the dynamics of a single long T4-DNA molecule and also separate DNA molecules. High-resolution optical microscopy measurements are used to clarify the presence of fully elongated T4-DNA molecules in the nanowire array. The spatial controllability of sublithographic-scale nanowires within microchannels offers a flexible platform not only for manipulating and separating long DNA molecules but also for integrating with other nanostructures to detect biomolecules in methods such as nanopore sequencing.
23348364,3,2013,Nat Protoc,Incorporation of a viral DNA-packaging motor channel in lipid bilayers for real-time, single-molecule sensing of chemicals and double-stranded DNA.,Over the past decade, nanopores have rapidly emerged as stochastic biosensors. This protocol describes the cloning, expression and purification of the channel of the bacteriophage phi29 DNA-packaging nanomotor and its subsequent incorporation into lipid membranes for single-pore sensing of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and chemicals. The membrane-embedded phi29 nanochannel remains functional and structurally intact under a range of conditions. When ions and macromolecules translocate through this nanochannel, reliable fingerprint changes in conductance are observed. Compared with other well-studied biological pores, the phi29 nanochannel has a larger cross-sectional area, which enables the translocation of dsDNA. Furthermore, specific amino acids can be introduced by site-directed mutagenesis within the large cavity of the channel to conjugate receptors that are able to bind specific ligands or analytes for desired applications. The lipid membrane-embedded nanochannel system has immense potential nanotechnological and biomedical applications in bioreactors, environmental sensing, drug monitoring, controlled drug delivery, early disease diagnosis and high-throughput DNA sequencing. The total time required for completing one round of this protocol is around 1 month.
23347165,3,2013,Anal Chem,Integration of solid-state nanopores in microfluidic networks via transfer printing of suspended membranes.,Solid-state nanopores have emerged as versatile single-molecule sensors for applications including DNA sequencing, protein unfolding, micro-RNA detection, label-free detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms, and mapping of DNA-binding proteins involved in homologous recombination. While machining nanopores in dielectric membranes provides nanometer-scale precision, the rigid silicon support for the membrane contributes capacitive noise and limits integration with microfluidic networks for sample preprocessing. Herein, we demonstrate a technique to directly transfer solid-state nanopores machined in dielectric membranes from a silicon support into a microfluidic network. The resulting microfluidic-addressable nanopores can sense single DNA molecules at high bandwidths and with low noise, owing to significant reductions in membrane capacitance. This strategy will enable large-scale integration of solid-state nanopores with microfluidic upstream and downstream processing and permit new functions with nanopores such as complex manipulations for multidimensional analysis and parallel sensing in two and three-dimensional architectures.
24256703,2,2013,Sci Rep,DNA translocation through hydrophilic nanopore in hexagonal boron nitride.,Ultra-thin solid-state nanopore with good wetting property is strongly desired to achieve high spatial resolution for DNA sequencing applications. Atomic thick hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) layer provides a promising two-dimensional material for fabricating solid-state nanopores. Due to its good oxidation resistance, the hydrophilicity of h-BN nanopore device can be significantly improved by UV-Ozone treatment. The contact angle of a KCl-TE droplet on h-BN layer can be reduced from 57° to 26° after the treatment. Abundant DNA translocation events have been observed in such devices, and strong DNA-nanopore interaction has been revealed in pores smaller than 10 nm in diameter. The 1/f noise level is closely related to the area of suspended h-BN layer, and it is significantly reduced in smaller supporting window. The demonstrated performance in h-BN nanopore paves the way towards base discrimination in a single DNA molecule.
23991282,2,2013,Chem Sci,Resistive-pulse measurements with nanopipettes: detection of Au nanoparticles and nanoparticle-bound anti-peanut IgY.,Solid-state nanopores have been widely employed in sensing applications from Coulter counters to DNA sequencing devices. The analytical signal in such experiments is the change in ionic current flowing through the orifice caused by the large molecule or nanoparticle translocation through the pore. Conceptually similar nanopipette-based sensors can offer several advantages including the ease of fabrication and small physical size essential for local measurements and experiments in small spaces. This paper describes the first evaluation of nanopipettes with well characterized geometry for resistive-pulse sensing of Au nanoparticles (AuNP), nanoparticles coated with an allergen epitope peptide layer, and AuNP-peptide particles with bound antipeanut antibodies (IgY) on the peptide layer. The label-free signal produced by IgY-conjugated particles was strikingly different from those obtained with other analytes, thus suggesting the possibility of selective and sensitive resistive-pulse sensing of antibodies.
23931325,2,2013,Biophys J,Mechanism of how salt-gradient-induced charges affect the translocation of DNA molecules through a nanopore.,Experiments using nanopores demonstrated that a salt gradient enhances the capture rate of DNA and reduces its translocation speed. These two effects can help to enable electrical DNA sequencing with nanopores. Here, we provide a quantitative theoretical evaluation that shows the positive net charges, which accumulate around the pore entrance due to the salt gradient, are responsible for the two observed effects: they reinforce the electric capture field, resulting in promoted molecule capture rate; and they induce cationic electroosmotic flow through the nanopore, thus significantly retarding the motion of the anionic DNA through the nanopore. Our multiphysical simulation results show that, during the polymer trapping stage, the former effect plays the major role, thus resulting in promoted DNA capture rate, while during the nanopore-penetrating stage the latter effect dominates and consequently reduces the DNA translocation speed significantly. Quantitative agreement with experimental results has been reached by further taking nanopore wall surface charges into account.
23901471,2,2013,J Nanosci Nanotechnol,Advances in nanopore sequencing technology.,Much tremendous break through have been obtained in recent years for nanopore sequencing to achieve the goal of $1000 genome. As a method of single molecule sequencing, nanopore sequencing can discriminate the individual molecules of the target DNA strand rapidly due to the current blockages by translocating the nucleotides through a nano-scale pore. Both the protein-pores and solid-state nanopore channels which called single nanopore sequencing have been studied widely for the application of nanopore sequencing technology. This review will give a detail representation to protein nanopore and solid-state nanopore sequencing. For protein nanopore sequencing technology, we will introduce different nanopore types, device assembly and some challenges still exist at present. We will focus on more research fields for solid-state nanopore sequencing in terms of materials, device assembly, fabricated methods, translocation process and some specific challenges. The review also covers some of the technical advances in the union nanopore sequencing, which include nanopore sequencing combine with exonuclease, hybridization, synthesis and design polymer.
23670195,2,2013,Lab Chip,Lab-on-a-chip technologies for single-molecule studies.,Recent developments on various lab-on-a-chip techniques allow miniaturized and integrated devices to perform on-chip single-molecule studies. Fluidic-based platforms that utilize unique microscale fluidic behavior are capable of conducting single-molecule experiments with high sensitivities and throughputs, while biomolecular systems can be studied on-chip using techniques such as DNA curtains, magnetic tweezers, and solid-state nanopores. The advances of these on-chip single-molecule techniques lead to next-generation lab-on-a-chip devices, such as DNA transistors, and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) technology for rapid and low-cost whole genome DNA sequencing. In this Focus article, we will discuss some recent successes in the development of lab-on-a-chip techniques for single-molecule studies and expound our thoughts on the near future of on-chip single-molecule studies.
23644569,2,2013,Nat Nanotechnol,DNA sequencing using electrical conductance measurements of a DNA polymerase.,The development of personalized medicine-in which medical treatment is customized to an individual on the basis of genetic information-requires techniques that can sequence DNA quickly and cheaply. Single-molecule sequencing technologies, such as nanopores, can potentially be used to sequence long strands of DNA without labels or amplification, but a viable technique has yet to be established. Here, we show that single DNA molecules can be sequenced by monitoring the electrical conductance of a phi29 DNA polymerase as it incorporates unlabelled nucleotides into a template strand of DNA. The conductance of the polymerase is measured by attaching it to a protein transistor that consists of an antibody molecule (immunoglobulin G) bound to two gold nanoparticles, which are in turn connected to source and drain electrodes. The electrical conductance of the DNA polymerase exhibits well-separated plateaux that are ~3 pA in height. Each plateau corresponds to an individual base and is formed at a rate of ~22 nucleotides per second. Additional spikes appear on top of the plateaux and can be used to discriminate between the four different nucleotides. We also show that the sequencing platform works with a variety of DNA polymerases and can sequence difficult templates such as homopolymers.
24352224,1,2013,Nat Commun,Ultrashort single-walled carbon nanotubes in a lipid bilayer as a new nanopore sensor.,An important issue in nanopore sensing is to construct stable and versatile sensors that can discriminate analytes with minute differences. Here we report a means of creating nanopores that comprise ultrashort single-walled carbon nanotubes inserted into a lipid bilayer. We investigate the ion transport and DNA translocation through single-walled carbon nanotube nanopores and find that our results are fundamentally different from previous studies using much longer single-walled carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, we utilize the new single-walled carbon nanotube nanopores to selectively detect modified 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in single-stranded DNA, which may have implications in screening specific genomic DNA sequences. This new nanopore platform can be integrated with many unique properties of carbon nanotubes and might be useful in molecular sensing such as DNA-damage detection, nanopore DNA sequencing and other nanopore-based applications.
24261484,1,2013,Nanoscale Res Lett,Detecting a single molecule using a micropore-nanopore hybrid chip.,Nanopore-based DNA sequencing and biomolecule sensing have attracted more and more attention. In this work, novel sensing devices were built on the basis of the chips containing nanopore arrays in polycarbonate (PC) membranes and micropores in Si3N4 films. Using the integrated chips, the transmembrane ionic current induced by biomolecule's translocation was recorded and analyzed, which suggested that the detected current did not change linearly as commonly expected with increasing biomolecule concentration. On the other hand, detailed translocation information (such as translocation gesture) was also extracted from the discrete current blockages in basic current curves. These results indicated that the nanofluidic device based on the chips integrated by micropores and nanopores possessed comparative potentials in biomolecule sensing.
24231385,1,2013,Nanotechnology,Surface modification of graphene nanopores for protein translocation.,Studies of DNA translocation through graphene nanopores have revealed their potential for DNA sequencing. Here we report a study of protein translocation through chemically modified graphene nanopores. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to cut nanopores with diameters between 5 and 20 nm in multilayer graphene prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). After oxygen plasma treatment, the dependence of the measured ionic current on salt concentration and pH was consistent with a small surface charge induced by the formation of carboxyl groups. While translocation of gold nanoparticles (10 nm) was readily detected through such treated pores of a larger diameter, translocation of the protein ferritin was not observed either for oxygen plasma treated pores, or for pores modified with mercaptohexadecanoic acid. Ferritin translocation events were reliably observed after the pores were modified with the phospholipid-PEG (DPPE-PEG750) amphiphile. The ion current signature of translocation events was complex, suggesting that a series of interactions between the protein and pores occurs during the process.
24052667,1,2013,Isr J Chem,Electrical Current Signatures of DNA Base Modifications in Single Molecules Immobilized in the α-Hemolysin Ion Channel.,Nanopore technology holds high potential for next-generation DNA sequencing. This method operates by drawing an individual single-stranded DNA molecule through a nanoscale pore while monitoring the current deflections that occur as the DNA passes through. Individual current levels for the four DNA nucleotides have been established by immobilization of an end biotinylated strand in the pore in which the nucleotide of interest is suspended at the most sensitive region of the ion channel. Due to the inherent reactivity of the DNA bases, many modified nucleotides in the genome exist resulting from oxidative and UV insults, among others. Herein, the current levels for the common DNA damages 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (OG), spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp), guanidinohydantoin (Gh), uridine (U), abasic sites (AP), thymine dimers (T=T), thymine glycol (Tg) and 5-iodocytosine (5-I-C) were assessed via immobilization experiments. In some cases, the current difference between the damaged and canonical nucleotides was not well resolved; therefore, we took advantage of the chemical reactivity of the new functional groups present to make amine adducts that shifted the current levels outside the range of the native nucleotides. Among adducts studied, only the 2-aminomethyl-18-crown-6 adduct was able to give a large current shift in the immobilization experiment, as well as to be observed in a translocation experiment. The results show potential in providing current level modulators for identification of some types of DNA damage. In principle, any DNA base modification that can be converted chemically or enzymatically to an abasic site could be identified in this way.
23846243,1,2013,Clin Transl Oncol,New sequencing technologies.,Nucleic acid sequencing is one of the most important tools of biological research with very broad application. Four generations of DNA sequencing technologies can be distinguished by their nature and the kind of output they provide. Sanger sequencing dominated for 30 years and was the workhorse of the Human Genome Project. In 2005 the first 2nd generation sequencer was presented with an output orders of magnitude higher than Sanger sequencing and dramatically reduced cost per base. Currently, we are at the dawn of third generation with nanopore systems that are being developed for DNA sequencing. Meanwhile, the field is broadening applications that complement first, second and third generation sequencing systems to get high-resolution genetic information and fourth generation sequencing is on the horizon. Second generation nucleic acid sequencers are systematically applied in many large-scale international projects such as the International Cancer Genome Consortium and the International Human Epigenome Project.
23744714,1,2013,Electrophoresis,Error analysis of idealized nanopore sequencing.,This numerical study provides an error analysis of an idealized nanopore sequencing method in which ionic current measurements are used to sequence intact single-stranded DNA in the pore, while an enzyme controls DNA motion. Examples of systematic channel errors when more than one nucleotide affects the current amplitude are detailed, which if present will persist regardless of coverage. Absent such errors, random errors associated with tracking through homopolymer regions are shown to necessitate reading known sequences (Escherichia coli K-12) at least 140 times to achieve 99.99% accuracy (Q40). By exploiting the ability to reread each strand at each pore in an array, arbitrary positioning on an error rate versus throughput tradeoff curve is possible if systematic errors are absent, with throughput governed by the number of pores in the array and the enzyme turnover rate.
23688283,1,2013,Nanoscale Res Lett,Nanopore detection of DNA molecules in magnesium chloride solutions.,High translocation speed of a DNA strand through a nanopore is a major bottleneck for nanopore detection of DNA molecules. Here, we choose MgCl2 electrolyte as salt solution to control DNA mobility. Experimental results demonstrate that the duration time for straight state translocation events in 1 M MgCl2 solution is about 1.3 ms which is about three times longer than that for the same DNA in 1 M KCl solution. This is because Mg(2+) ions can effectively reduce the surface charge density of the negative DNA strands and then lead to the decrease of the DNA electrophoretic speed. It is also found that the Mg(2+) ions can induce the DNA molecules binding together and reduce the probability of straight DNA translocation events. The nanopore with small diameter can break off the bound DNA strands and increase the occurrence probability of straight DNA translocation events.
24356374,0,2013,Nanotechnology,A FIB induced boiling mechanism for rapid nanopore formation.,Focused ion beam (FIB) technology is widely used to fabricate nanopores in solid-state membranes. These nanopores have desirable thermomechanical properties for applications such as high-throughput DNA sequencing. Using large scale molecular dynamics simulations of the FIB nanopore formation process, we show that there is a threshold ion delivery rate above which the mechanism underlying nanopore formation changes. At low rates nanopore formation is slow, with the rate proportional to the ion flux and therefore limited by the sputter rate of the target material. However, at higher fluxes nanopores form via a thermally dominated process, consistent with an explosive boiling mechanism. In this case, mass is rapidly rearranged via bubble growth and coalescence, much more quickly than would occur during sputtering. This mechanism has the potential to greatly speed up nanopore formation.
24214738,0,2013,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,Nanopore-based sequencing and detection of nucleic acids.,Nanopore-based techniques, which mimic the functions of natural ion channels, have attracted increasing attention as unique methods for single-molecule detection. The technology allows the real-time, selective, high-throughput analysis of nucleic acids through both biological and solid-state nanopores. In this Minireview, the background and latest progress in nanopore-based sequencing and detection of nucleic acids are summarized, and light is shed on a novel platform for nanopore-based detection.
24196315,0,2013,Adv Biochem Eng Biotechnol,Future of biosensors: a personal view.,Biosensors representing the technological counterpart of living senses have found routine application in amperometric enzyme electrodes for decentralized blood glucose measurement, interaction analysis by surface plasmon resonance in drug development, and to some extent DNA chips for expression analysis and enzyme polymorphisms. These technologies have already reached a highly advanced level and need minor improvement at most. The dream of the &quot;100-dollar&quot; personal genome may come true in the next few years provided that the technological hurdles of nanopore technology or of polymerase-based single molecule sequencing can be overcome. Tailor-made recognition elements for biosensors including membrane-bound enzymes and receptors will be prepared by cell-free protein synthesis. As alternatives for biological recognition elements, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have been created. They have the potential to substitute antibodies in biosensors and biochips for the measurement of low-molecular-weight substances, proteins, viruses, and living cells. They are more stable than proteins and can be produced in large amounts by chemical synthesis. Integration of nanomaterials, especially of graphene, could lead to new miniaturized biosensors with high sensitivity and ultrafast response. In the future individual therapy will include genetic profiling of isoenzymes and polymorphic forms of drug-metabolizing enzymes especially of the cytochrome P450 family. For defining the pharmacokinetics including the clearance of a given genotype enzyme electrodes will be a useful tool. For decentralized online patient control or the integration into everyday &quot;consumables&quot; such as drinking water, foods, hygienic articles, clothing, or for control of air conditioners in buildings and cars and swimming pools, a new generation of &quot;autonomous&quot; biosensors will emerge.
24111311,0,2013,Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,Nanopore single-molecule dielectrophoretic detection of cancer-derived microRNA biomarkers.,The nanopore-based single-molecule biosensor has been extensively investigated for various biomedical detections. It has demonstrated the potential in gene sequencing and diagnosis-oriented biomarker detection such as microRNAs. In real-time detection, however, samples extracted from bio-fluids contain various non-target nucleic acids components. These components can cause severely influence the target detection accuracy. We have discovered that a polycationic probe can solve this issue. The polycationic peptide domain of the probe can separate the target probe complex from free nucleic acids, and only lead the complex into the pore, therefore realizing simultaneous enrichment and detection of target microRNAs. This study establishs a universal approach to detecting any short pathogenic nucleic acids fragment in complex samples.
24070669,0,2013,J Colloid Interface Sci,Electrokinetic behavior of a pH-regulated, zwitterionic nanocylinder in a cylindrical nanopore filled with multiple ionic species.,Recent advances in fabrication techniques make nano-sized pores as promising platforms for both detection and sequencing of individual biopolymers such as DNA. To simulate the electrokinetic behavior of a particle in this case, we consider the electrophoresis of a soft nanocylinder comprising a rigid core and a pH-regulated, zwitterionic polyelectrolyte layer along the axis of a rigid cylindrical nanopore. Extending the conventional electrophoresis analysis, where the liquid phase contains only one kind each of cations and anions, we assume that it contains multiple ionic species, as is usually the case in practice. The key parameters are examined for their influences on the electrokinetic behavior of a particle. These include pH, the thickness of the polyelectrolyte layer and the density of its functional groups, and the pore size. The results gathered provide necessary information for the design of an electrokinetic apparatus.
23862441,0,2013,J Nanosci Nanotechnol,Silicon nitride nanopores for nanoparticle sensing.,In recent years, nanopore has attracted broad attention as an essential technique for DNA sequencing and nanoparticle sensing. This work presented a fundamental study of nanoparticle translocation through silicon nitride nanopores. Since particles with rather high charge to mass ratio, such as DNA and proteins, have been widely studied, there was still little information about the translocation behavior of nanoparticles with low charge/mass ratio. However, these nanoparticles include viruses and colloids are important potential sample for nanopore sensing technique. In order to screen nanoparticles' size, concentration, surface property by apply silicon nitride nanopores, and fulfill specific recognition which could be applied in laboratory medicine and environmental monitoring, optimal experimental conditions needed to be confirmed. In this paper, polystyrene (PS) bead was used as an example to provide reference towards this condition. The effects of nanopore/nanoparticle diameter ratio and bias voltage on sensing results were analyzed in this work. We found that lower precision accuracy might be demonstrated by the larger pore (120 nm) while the translocation velocity tended to be slowed down. By increasing the bias voltage could favor the detection productiveness. In spite of the intense interest, the baseline fluctuations and vague event bounds aggravated are far from understood.

23719630,0,2013,Sci Rep,Electron beam-assisted healing of nanopores in magnesium alloys.,Nanopore-based sensing has emerged as a promising candidate for affordable and powerful DNA sequencing technologies. Herein, we demonstrate that nanopores can be successfully fabricated in Mg alloys via focused electron beam (e-beam) technology. Employing in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy techniques, we obtained unambiguous evidence that layer-by-layer growth of atomic planes at the nanopore periphery occurs when the e-beam is spread out, leading to the shrinkage and eventual disappearance of nanopores. The proposed healing process was attributed to the e-beam-induced anisotropic diffusion of Mg atoms in the vicinity of nanopore edges. A plausible diffusion mechanism that describes the observed phenomena is discussed. Our results constitute the first experimental investigation of nanopores in Mg alloys. Direct evidence of the healing process has advanced our fundamental understanding of surface science, which is of great practical importance for many technological applications, including thin film deposition and surface nanopatterning.
23307655,0,2013,J Phys Condens Matter,Ionic Coulomb blockade in nanopores.,An understanding of the dynamics of ions in nanopores is essential for applications ranging from single-molecule detection to DNA sequencing. We show both analytically and by means of molecular dynamics simulations that under specific conditions ion-ion interactions in nanopores lead to the phenomenon of ionic Coulomb blockade, namely the build up of ions inside a nanopore with specific capacitance impeding the flow of additional ions due to Coulomb repulsion. This is the counterpart of electronic Coulomb blockade observed in mesoscopic systems. We discuss the analogies with and differences from the electronic case as well as experimental situations in which this phenomenon could be detected.
22446694,88,2012,Nat Biotechnol,Reading DNA at single-nucleotide resolution with a mutant MspA nanopore and phi29 DNA polymerase.,Nanopore technologies are being developed for fast and direct sequencing of single DNA molecules through detection of ionic current modulations as DNA passes through a pore's constriction. Here we demonstrate the ability to resolve changes in current that correspond to a known DNA sequence by combining the high sensitivity of a mutated form of the protein pore Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) with phi29 DNA polymerase (DNAP), which controls the rate of DNA translocation through the pore. As phi29 DNAP synthesizes DNA and functions like a motor to pull a single-stranded template through MspA, we observe well-resolved and reproducible ionic current levels with median durations of ∼28 ms and ionic current differences of up to 40 pA. Using six different DNA sequences with readable regions 42-53 nucleotides long, we record current traces that map to the known DNA sequences. With single-nucleotide resolution and DNA translocation control, this system integrates solutions to two long-standing hurdles to nanopore sequencing.
22334048,81,2012,Nat Biotechnol,Automated forward and reverse ratcheting of DNA in a nanopore at 5-Å precision.,An emerging DNA sequencing technique uses protein or solid-state pores to analyze individual strands as they are driven in single-file order past a nanoscale sensor. However, uncontrolled electrophoresis of DNA through these nanopores is too fast for accurate base reads. Here, we describe forward and reverse ratcheting of DNA templates through the α-hemolysin nanopore controlled by phi29 DNA polymerase without the need for active voltage control. DNA strands were ratcheted through the pore at median rates of 2.5-40 nucleotides per second and were examined at one nucleotide spatial precision in real time. Up to 500 molecules were processed at ∼130 molecules per hour through one pore. The probability of a registry error (an insertion or deletion) at individual positions during one pass along the template strand ranged from 10% to 24.5% without optimization. This strategy facilitates multiple reads of individual strands and is transferable to other nanopore devices for implementation of DNA sequence analysis.
22658507,34,2012,Phys Life Rev,Nanopores: A journey towards DNA sequencing.,Much more than ever, nucleic acids are recognized as key building blocks in many of life's processes, and the science of studying these molecular wonders at the single-molecule level is thriving. A new method of doing so has been introduced in the mid 1990's. This method is exceedingly simple: a nanoscale pore that spans across an impermeable thin membrane is placed between two chambers that contain an electrolyte, and voltage is applied across the membrane using two electrodes. These conditions lead to a steady stream of ion flow across the pore. Nucleic acid molecules in solution can be driven through the pore, and structural features of the biomolecules are observed as measurable changes in the trans-membrane ion current. In essence, a nanopore is a high-throughput ion microscope and a single-molecule force apparatus. Nanopores are taking center stage as a tool that promises to read a DNA sequence, and this promise has resulted in overwhelming academic, industrial, and national interest. Regardless of the fate of future nanopore applications, in the process of this 16-year-long exploration, many studies have validated the indispensability of nanopores in the toolkit of single-molecule biophysics. This review surveys past and current studies related to nucleic acid biophysics, and will hopefully provoke a discussion of immediate and future prospects for the field.
22491281,19,2012,Nat Biotechnol,DNA sequencing with nanopores.,
23138639,17,2012,Electrophoresis,Recent advances in nanopore sequencing.,The prospect of nanopores as a next-generation sequencing platform has been a topic of growing interest and considerable government-sponsored research for more than a decade. Oxford Nanopore Technologies recently announced the first commercial nanopore sequencing devices, to be made available by the end of 2012, while other companies (Life, Roche, and IBM) are also pursuing nanopore sequencing approaches. In this paper, the state of the art in nanopore sequencing is reviewed, focusing on the most recent contributions that have or promise to have next-generation sequencing commercial potential. We consider also the scalability of the circuitry to support multichannel arrays of nanopores in future sequencing devices, which is critical to commercial viability.
23043363,13,2012,Nano Lett,Individual RNA base recognition in immobilized oligonucleotides using a protein nanopore.,Protein nanopores are under investigation as key components of rapid, low-cost platforms to sequence DNA molecules. Previously, it has been shown that the α-hemolysin (αHL) nanopore contains three recognition sites, capable of discriminating between individual DNA bases when oligonucleotides are immobilized within the nanopore. However, the direct sequencing of RNA is also of critical importance. Here, we achieve sharply defined current distributions that enable clear discrimination of the four nucleobases, guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil, in RNA. Further, the modified bases, inosine, N(6)-methyladenosine, and N(5)-methylcytosine, can be distinguished.
23002425,13,2012,Sci Rep,PEG-labeled nucleotides and nanopore detection for single molecule DNA sequencing by synthesis.,We describe a novel single molecule nanopore-based sequencing by synthesis (Nano-SBS) strategy that can accurately distinguish four bases by detecting 4 different sized tags released from 5'-phosphate-modified nucleotides. The basic principle is as follows. As each nucleotide is incorporated into the growing DNA strand during the polymerase reaction, its tag is released and enters a nanopore in release order. This produces a unique ionic current blockade signature due to the tag's distinct chemical structure, thereby determining DNA sequence electronically at single molecule level with single base resolution. As proof of principle, we attached four different length PEG-coumarin tags to the terminal phosphate of 2'-deoxyguanosine-5'-tetraphosphate. We demonstrate efficient, accurate incorporation of the nucleotide analogs during the polymerase reaction, and excellent discrimination among the four tags based on nanopore ionic currents. This approach coupled with polymerase attached to the nanopores in an array format should yield a single-molecule electronic Nano-SBS platform.
22780094,13,2012,Nano Lett,Assessing graphene nanopores for sequencing DNA.,Using all-atom molecular dynamics and atomic-resolution Brownian dynamics, we simulate the translocation of single-stranded DNA through graphene nanopores and characterize the ionic current blockades produced by DNA nucleotides. We find that transport of single DNA strands through graphene nanopores may occur in single nucleotide steps. For certain pore geometries, hydrophobic interactions with the graphene membrane lead to a dramatic reduction in the conformational fluctuations of the nucleotides in the nanopores. Furthermore, we show that ionic current blockades produced by different DNA nucleotides are, in general, indicative of the nucleotide type, but very sensitive to the orientation of the nucleotides in the nanopore. Taken together, our simulations suggest that strand sequencing of DNA by measuring the ionic current blockades in graphene nanopores may be possible, given that the conformation of DNA nucleotides in the nanopore can be controlled through precise engineering of the nanopore surface.
22355565,13,2012,Sci Rep,Single-molecule sensing electrode embedded in-plane nanopore.,Electrode-embedded nanopore is considered as a promising device structure for label-free single-molecule sequencing, the principle of which is based on nucleotide identification via transverse electron tunnelling current flowing through a DNA translocating through the pore. Yet, fabrication of a molecular-scale electrode-nanopore detector has been a formidable task that requires atomic-level alignment of a few nanometer sized pore and an electrode gap. Here, we report single-molecule detection using a nucleotide-sized sensing electrode embedded in-plane nanopore. We developed a self-alignment technique to form a nanopore-nanoelectrode solid-state device consisting of a sub-nanometer scale electrode gap in a 15 nm-sized SiO(2) pore. We demonstrate single-molecule counting of nucleotide-sized metal-encapsulated fullerenes in a liquid using the electrode-integrated nanopore sensor. We also performed electrical identification of nucleobases in a DNA oligomer, thereby suggesting the potential use of this synthetic electrode-in-nanopore as a platform for electrical DNA sequencing.

22558512,10,2012,Sci Rep,Transverse electric field dragging of DNA in a nanochannel.,Nanopore analysis is an emerging single-molecule strategy for non-optical and high-throughput DNA sequencing, the principle of which is based on identification of each constituent nucleobase by measuring trans-membrane ionic current blockade or transverse tunnelling current as it moves through the pore. A crucial issue for nanopore sequencing is the fact that DNA translocates a nanopore too fast for addressing sequence with a single base resolution. Here we report that a transverse electric field can be used to slow down the translocation. We find 400-fold decrease in the DNA translocation speed by adding a transverse field of 10 mV/nm in a gold-electrode-embedded silicon dioxide channel. The retarded flow allowed us to map the local folding pattern in individual DNA from trans-pore ionic current profiles. This field dragging approach may provide a new way to control the polynucleotide translocation kinetics.

22677395,9,2012,Biophys J,DNA base-calling from a nanopore using a Viterbi algorithm.,Nanopore-based DNA sequencing is the most promising third-generation sequencing method. It has superior read length, speed, and sample requirements compared with state-of-the-art second-generation methods. However, base-calling still presents substantial difficulty because the resolution of the technique is limited compared with the measured signal/noise ratio. Here we demonstrate a method to decode 3-bp-resolution nanopore electrical measurements into a DNA sequence using a Hidden Markov model. This method shows tremendous potential for accuracy (~98%), even with a poor signal/noise ratio.
22461259,9,2012,Chemistry,Synthesis, physicochemical properties, and hydrogen bonding of 4(5)-substituted 1-H-imidazole-2-carboxamide, a potential universal reader for DNA sequencing by recognition tunneling.,We have developed a chemical reagent that recognizes all naturally occurring DNA bases, a so called universal reader, for DNA sequencing by recognition tunneling in nanopores.1 The primary requirements for this type of molecules are the ability to form non-covalent complexes with individual DNA bases and to generate recognizable electronic signatures under an electrical bias. 1-H-imidazole-2-carboxamide was designed as such a recognition moiety to interact with the DNA bases through hydrogen bonding. In the present study, we first furnished a synthetic route to 1-H-imidazole-2-carboxamide containing a short ω-functionalized alkyl chain at its 4(5) position for its attachment to metal and carbon electrodes. The acid dissociation constants of the imidazole-2-carboxamide were then determined by UV spectroscopy. The data show that the 1-H-imidazole-2-carboxamide exists in a neutral form between pH 6-10. Density functional theory (DFT) and NMR studies indicate that the imidazole ring exists in prototropic tautomers. We propose an intramolecular mechanism for tautomerization of 1-H-imidazole-2-carboxamide. In addition, the imidazole-2-carboxamide can self-associate to form hydrogen bonded dimers. NMR titration found that naturally occurring nucleosides interacted with 1-H-imidazole-2-carboxamide through hydrogen bonding in a tendency of dG&gt;dC≫dT&gt;dA. These studies are indispensable to assisting us in understanding the molecular recognition that takes place in the nanopore where routinely used analytical tools such as NMR and FTIR cannot be conveniently applied.
23259840,8,2012,ACS Nano,pH tuning of DNA translocation time through organically functionalized nanopores.,Controlling DNA translocation speed is critically important for nanopore sequencing as free electrophoretic threading is far too rapid to resolve individual bases. A number of promising strategies have been explored in recent years, largely driven by the demands of next-generation sequencing. Engineering DNA-nanopore interactions (known to dominate translocation dynamics) with organic coatings is an attractive method as it does not require sample modification, processive enzymes, or complicated and expensive fabrication steps. In this work, we show for the first time 4-fold tuning of unfolded, single-file translocation time through small, amine-functionalized solid-state nanopores by varying the solution pH in situ. Additionally, we develop a simple analytical model based on electrostatic interactions to explain this effect which will be a useful tool in designing future devices and experiments.
23009852,8,2012,Biophys J,Single-stranded DNA within nanopores: conformational dynamics and implications for sequencing; a molecular dynamics simulation study.,Engineered protein nanopores, such as those based on α-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus have shown great promise as components of next-generation DNA sequencing devices. However, before such protein nanopores can be used to their full potential, the conformational dynamics and translocation pathway of the DNA within them must be characterized at the individual molecule level. Here, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of single-stranded DNA movement through a model α-hemolysin pore under an applied electric field. The simulations enable characterization of the conformations adopted by single-stranded DNA, and allow exploration of how the conformations may impact on translocation within the wild-type model pore and a number of mutants. Our results show that specific interactions between the protein nanopore and the DNA can have a significant impact on the DNA conformation often leading to localized coiling, which in turn, can alter the order in which the DNA bases exit the nanopore. Thus, our simulations show that strategies to control the conformation of DNA within a protein nanopore would be a distinct advantage for the purposes of DNA sequencing.
23005466,8,2012,Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys,Effective driving force applied on DNA inside a solid-state nanopore.,A detailed understanding of the origin of the electrophoretic force on DNA molecules in a solid-state nanopore is important for the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies. Because of the discrepancies between recent attempts to predict this force and both direct and indirect experimental measurements, this topic has been the focus of much recent discussion. We show that the force is predictable to very good accuracy if all of the experimental conditions are accounted for properly. To resolve this issue, we compare the calculation efficiency and accuracy of numerical solutions of Poisson-Boltzmann and Poisson-Nernst-Planck descriptions of electrolyte behavior in the nanopore in the presence of DNA molecules. Two geometries--axially symmetric and cross-sectional--are compared and shown to be compatible. Numerical solutions are carried out on a sufficiently fine mesh to evaluate the viscous drag force acting on DNA inside a silicon nitride nanopore. By assuming the DNA is immobilized in the axial center of the nanopore, the calculation result of this viscous drag force is found to be rather larger than the experimental result. Because the viscous drag force decreases if DNA is closer to the surface of the nanopore, however, the relevant effective driving force is the average over all possible positions of the DNA in the nanopore. When this positional uncertainty is taken into account, the effective driving force acting on DNA inside the nanopore is found to agree very well with the experimental results.
22787559,8,2012,Sci Rep,Single-molecule electrical random resequencing of DNA and RNA.,Two paradigm shifts in DNA sequencing technologies-from bulk to single molecules and from optical to electrical detection-are expected to realize label-free, low-cost DNA sequencing that does not require PCR amplification. It will lead to development of high-throughput third-generation sequencing technologies for personalized medicine. Although nanopore devices have been proposed as third-generation DNA-sequencing devices, a significant milestone in these technologies has been attained by demonstrating a novel technique for resequencing DNA using electrical signals. Here we report single-molecule electrical resequencing of DNA and RNA using a hybrid method of identifying single-base molecules via tunneling currents and random sequencing. Our method reads sequences of nine types of DNA oligomers. The complete sequence of 5'-UGAGGUA-3' from the let-7 microRNA family was also identified by creating a composite of overlapping fragment sequences, which was randomly determined using tunneling current conducted by single-base molecules as they passed between a pair of nanoelectrodes.
23266100,7,2012,Curr Opin Biotechnol,Recent trends in nanopores for biotechnology.,Nanopore technology employs a nanoscale hole in an insulating membrane to stochastically sense with high throughput individual biomolecules in solution. The generality of the nanopore detection principle and the ease of single-molecule detection suggest many potential applications of nanopores in biotechnology. Recent progress has been made with nanopore fabrication and sophistication, as well as with applications in DNA/protein mapping, biomolecular structure analysis, protein detection, and DNA sequencing. In addition, concepts for DNA sequencing devices have been suggested, and computational efforts have been made. The state of the nanopore field is maturing and given the right type of nanopore and operating conditions, nearly every application could revolutionize medicine in terms of speed, cost, and quality. In this review, we summarize progress in nanopores for biotechnological applications over the past 2-3 years.
23199225,6,2012,ACS Nano,Thermophoretic manipulation of DNA translocation through nanopores.,Manipulating DNA translocation through nanopore is one crucial requirement for new ultrafast sequencing methods in the sense that the polymers have to be denatured, unraveled, and then propelled through the pore with very low speed. Here we propose and theoretically explore a novel design to fulfill the demands by utilizing cross-pore thermal gradient. The high temperature in the cis reservoir is expected to transform double-stranded DNA into single strands and that temperature would also prevent those single strands from intrastrand base-pairing, thus, achieving favorable polymer conformation for the subsequent translocation and sequencing. Then, the substantial temperature drop across the pore caused by the thermal-insulating membrane separating cis and trans chambers would stimulate thermophoresis of the molecules through nanopores. Our theoretical evaluation shows that the DNA translocation speeds will be orders smaller than the electrophoretic counterpart, while high capture rate of DNA into nanopore is maintained, both of which would greatly benefit the sequencing.
22711913,6,2012,Appl Phys Lett,Nanometer-thin solid-state nanopores by cold ion beam sculpting.,Recent work on protein nanopores indicates that single molecule characterization (including DNA sequencing) is possible when the length of the nanopore constriction is about a nanometer. Solid-state nanopores offer advantages in stability and tunability, but a scalable method for creating nanometer-thin solid-state pores has yet to be demonstrated. Here we demonstrate that solid-state nanopores with nanometer-thin constrictions can be produced by &quot;cold ion beam sculpting,&quot; an original method that is broadly applicable to many materials, is easily scalable, and requires only modest instrumentation.
23161707,5,2012,Electrophoresis,Fabrication and characterization of nanopores with insulated transverse nanoelectrodes for DNA sensing in salt solution.,We report on the fabrication, simulation, and characterization of insulated nanoelectrodes aligned with nanopores in low-capacitance silicon nitride membrane chips. We are exploring these devices for the transverse sensing of DNA molecules as they are electrophoretically driven through the nanopore in a linear fashion. While we are currently working with relatively large nanopores (6-12 nm in diameter) to demonstrate the transverse detection of DNA, our ultimate goal is to reduce the size sufficiently to resolve individual nucleotide bases, thus sequencing DNA as it passes through the pore. We present simulations and experiments that study the impact of insulating these electrodes, which is important to localize the sensing region. We test whether the presence of nanoelectrodes or insulation affects the stability of the ionic current flowing through the nanopore, or the characteristics of DNA translocation. Finally, we summarize the common device failures and challenges encountered during fabrication and experiments, explore the causes of these failures, and make suggestions on how to overcome them in the future.
23145315,5,2012,Sci Rep,Modulating DNA translocation by a controlled deformation of a PDMS nanochannel device.,Several strategies have been developed for the control of DNA translocation in nanopores and nanochannels. However, the possibility to reduce the molecule speed is still challenging for applications in the field of single molecule analysis, such as ultra-rapid sequencing. This paper demonstrates the possibility to alter the DNA translocation process through an elastomeric nanochannel device by dynamically changing its cross section. More in detail, nanochannel deformation is induced by a macroscopic mechanical compression of the polymeric device. This nanochannel squeezing allows slowing down the DNA molecule passage inside it. This simple and low cost method is based on the exploitation of the elastomeric nature of the device, can be coupled with different sensing techniques, is applicable in many research fields, such as DNA detection and manipulation, and is promising for further development in sequencing technology.
23005684,5,2012,Phys Rev Lett,Topological jamming of spontaneously knotted polyelectrolyte chains driven through a nanopore.,The advent of solid state nanodevices allows for interrogating the physicochemical properties of a polyelectrolyte chain by electrophoretically driving it through a nanopore. Salient dynamical aspects of the translocation process have been recently characterized by theoretical and computational studies of model polymer chains free from self-entanglement. However, sufficiently long equilibrated chains are necessarily knotted. The impact of such topological &quot;defects&quot; on the translocation process is largely unexplored, and is addressed in this Letter. By using Brownian dynamics simulations on a coarse-grained polyelectrolyte model we show that knots, despite being trapped at the pore entrance, do not per se cause the translocation process to jam. Rather, knots introduce an effective friction that increases with the applied force, and practically halts the translocation above a threshold force. The predicted dynamical crossover, which is experimentally verifiable, ought to be relevant in applicative contexts, such as DNA nanopore sequencing.
22747101,5,2012,ACS Nano,Molecular dynamics study of MspA arginine mutants predicts slow DNA translocations and ion current blockades indicative of DNA sequence.,The protein nanopore Mycobacteria smegmatis porin A (MspA), can be used to sense individual nucleotides within DNA, potentially enabling a technique known as nanopore sequencing. In this technique, single-stranded DNA electrophoretically moves through the nanopore and results in an ionic current that is nucleotide-specific. However, with a high transport velocity of the DNA within the nanopore, the ionic current cannot be used to distinguish signals within noise. Through extensive (~100 μs in total) all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we examine the effect of positively charged residues on DNA translocation rate and the ionic current blockades in MspA. Simulation of several arginine mutations show a ~10-30 fold reduction of DNA translocation speed without eliminating the nucleotide induced current blockages. Comparison of our results with similar engineering efforts on a different nanopore (α-hemolysin) reveals a nontrivial effect of nanopore geometry on the ionic current blockades in mutant nanopores.
23208922,4,2012,Electrophoresis,Mapping and sequencing DNA using nanopores and nanodetectors.,Even prior to the introduction of capillary DNA sequencers, nanopores were discussed as a low-cost, high-throughput substrate for sequencing. Since then, other next-generation sequencing technologies have been developed and achieved widespread use, but nanopores have lagged behind due to difficulties in generating usable sequence data. The practical and theoretical issues of translocation speed and signal detection encountered when attempting to sequence DNA with nanopores are discussed. Various methods that different laboratories have used to overcome difficulties in biologically based and solid-state nanopores are also presented. Different approaches designed to circumvent the overriding issue of detecting signals from individual bases in a time-resolved manner in nanopores are described. For example, genomic positional sequencing utilizes hybridization of short oligonucleotide probes to very long DNA templates and then detects these probes by variations in current blockade in solid-state nanodetectors. The positions of the probes relative to each other and relative to the ends of the DNA are determined by measuring the time between current blockade peaks. By assembling many such measurements, it is possible to overcome the problems encountered when attempting to sequence DNA at high speed in nanopores, providing the potential for true de novo sequencing of large genomes on a routine basis.
23165096,4,2012,N Biotechnol,DNA sequencing - spanning the generations.,Nucleic acid sequencing is the mainstay of biological research. There are several generations of DNA sequencing technologies that can be well characterized through their nature and the kind of output they provide. Dideoxy terminator sequencing developed by Sanger dominated for 30 years and was the workhorse used for the Human Genome Project. In 2005 the first 2nd generation sequencer was presented with an output orders of magnitude higher than Sanger sequencing and dramatically decreased cost. We are now at the dawn of 3rd generation with nanopore systems that are being developed for DNA sequencing. Meanwhile the field is also broadening into applications that complement 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation sequencing systems to get high resolution genetic information. The REvolutionary Approaches and Devices for Nucleic Acid analysis (READNA) consortium funded by the European Commission under FP7 has made great contributions to the development of new nucleic acid analysis methodology.
23064727,3,2012,Nanotechnology,Dynamics of DNA translocation in a solid-state nanopore immersed in aqueous glycerol.,Nanopore-based technologies have attracted much attention recently for their promising use in low-cost and high-throughput genome sequencing. To achieve single-base resolution of DNA sequencing, it is critical to slow and control the translocation of DNA, which has been achieved in a protein nanopore but not yet in a solid-state nanopore. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the dynamics of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule in an aqueous glycerol solution confined in a SiO(2) nanopore. The friction coefficient ξ of the ssDNA molecule is found to be approximately 18 times larger in glycerol than in water, which can dramatically slow the motion of ssDNA. The electrophoretic mobility μ of ssDNA in glycerol, however, decreases by almost the same factor, yielding the effective charge (ξμ) of ssDNA being roughly the same as in water. This is counterintuitive since the ssDNA effective charge predicted from the counterion condensation theory varies with the dielectric constant of a solvent. Due to the larger friction coefficient of ssDNA in glycerol, we further show that glycerol can improve trapping of ssDNA in the DNA transistor, a nanodevice that can be used to control the motion of ssDNA in a solid-state nanopore. Simulation results of slowing ssDNA translocation were confirmed in our nanopore experiment.
22887891,3,2012,Biotechnol J,Stepping stones in DNA sequencing.,In recent years there have been tremendous advances in our ability to rapidly and cost-effectively sequence DNA. This has revolutionized the fields of genetics and biology, leading to a deeper understanding of the molecular events in life processes. The rapid technological advances have enormously expanded sequencing opportunities and applications, but also imposed strains and challenges on steps prior to sequencing and in the downstream process of handling and analysis of these massive amounts of sequence data. Traditionally, sequencing has been limited to small DNA fragments of approximately one thousand bases (derived from the organism's genome) due to issues in maintaining a high sequence quality and accuracy for longer read lengths. Although many technological breakthroughs have been made, currently the commercially available massively parallel sequencing methods have not been able to resolve this issue. However, recent announcements in nanopore sequencing hold the promise of removing this read-length limitation, enabling sequencing of larger intact DNA fragments. The ability to sequence longer intact DNA with high accuracy is a major stepping stone towards greatly simplifying the downstream analysis and increasing the power of sequencing compared to today. This review covers some of the technical advances in sequencing that have opened up new frontiers in genomics.
22773160,3,2012,Biomed Microdevices,Formation of lipid bilayers inside microfluidic channel array for monitoring membrane-embedded nanopores of phi29 DNA packaging nanomotor.,An efficient method to form lipid bilayers inside an array of microfluidic channels has been developed and applied to monitor the membrane-embedded phi29 DNA packaging motor with an electrochemical characterization on a lab-on-a-chip (LOC) platform. A push-pull junction capturing approach was applied to confine a small amount of the lipid solution inside a microchannel. The selective permeability between solvents and water in PDMS was utilized to extract the solvent from the lipid solution, resulting in a self-formation of the lipid bilayer in the microchannel array. Each microchannel was independently connected to a silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode array, leading to a high-throughput monitoring of the nanopore insertion in the formed lipid bilayers. The formation of multiple lipid bilayers inside an array of microchannels and the simultaneous electrical and optical monitoring of multiple bilayer provides an efficient LOC platform for the further development of single phi29 motor pore sensing and high throughput single pore dsDNA sequencing.

23231259,2,2012,J Chem Phys,The effects of diffusion on an exonuclease/nanopore-based DNA sequencing engine.,Over 15 years ago, the ability to electrically detect and characterize individual polynucleotides as they are driven through a single protein ion channel was suggested as a potential method for rapidly sequencing DNA, base-by-base, in a ticker tape-like fashion. More recently, a variation of this method was proposed in which a nanopore would instead detect single nucleotides cleaved sequentially by an exonuclease enzyme in close proximity to one pore entrance. We analyze the exonuclease/nanopore-based DNA sequencing engine using analytical theory and computer simulations that describe nucleotide transport. The available data and analytical results suggest that the proposed method will be limited to reading &lt;80 bases, imposed, in part, by the short lifetime each nucleotide spends in the vicinity of the detection element within the pore and the ability to accurately discriminate between the four mononucleotides.
23109189,2,2012,Electrophoresis,DNA sequencing and bar-coding using solid-state nanopores.,Nanopores have emerged as a prominent single-molecule analytic tool with particular promise for genomic applications. In this review, we discuss two potential applications of the nanopore sensors: First, we present a nanopore-based single-molecule DNA sequencing method that utilizes optical detection for massively parallel throughput. Second, we describe a method by which nanopores can be used as single-molecule genotyping tools. For DNA sequencing, the distinction among the four types of DNA nucleobases is achieved by employing a biochemical procedure for DNA expansion. In this approach, each nucleobase in each DNA strand is converted into one of four predefined unique 16-mers in a process that preserves the nucleobase sequence. The resulting converted strands are then hybridized to a library of four molecular beacons, each carrying a unique fluorophore tag, that are perfect complements to the 16-mers used for conversion. Solid-state nanopores are then used to sequentially remove these beacons, one after the other, leading to a series of photon bursts in four colors that can be optically detected. Single-molecule genotyping is achieved by tagging the DNA fragments with γ-modified synthetic peptide nucleic acid probes coupled to an electronic characterization of the complexes using solid-state nanopores. This method can be used to identify and differentiate genes with a high level of sequence similarity at the single-molecule level, but different pathology or response to treatment. We will illustrate this method by differentiating the pol gene for two highly similar human immunodeficiency virus subtypes, paving the way for a novel diagnostics platform for viral classification.
22948520,2,2012,Nanotechnology,Fabrication and characterization of solid-state nanopore arrays for high-throughput DNA sequencing.,We report the fabrication and characterization of uniformly sized nanopore arrays, integrated into an optical detection system for high-throughput DNA sequencing applications. Nanopore arrays were fabricated using focused ion beam milling, followed by TiO(2) coating using atomic layer deposition. The TiO(2) layer decreases the initial pore diameter down to the sub-10 nm range, compatible with the requirements for nanopore-based sequencing using optical readout. We find that the TiO(2) layers produce a lower photoluminescence background as compared with the more widely used Al(2)O(3) coatings. The functionality of the nanopore array was demonstrated by the simultaneous optical detection of DNA-quantum dot conjugates, which were electro-kinetically driven through the nanopores. Our optical scheme employs total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to illuminate a wide area of the TiO(2)-coated membrane. A highly parallel system for observing DNA capture events in a uniformly sized 6 × 6 nanopore array was experimentally realized.
22817705,2,2012,Biochem Soc Trans,Solid-state nanopores for biosensing with submolecular resolution.,Biological cell membranes contain various types of ion channels and transmembrane pores in the 1-100 nm range, which are vital for cellular function. Individual channels can be probed electrically, as demonstrated by Neher and Sakmann in 1976 using the patch-clamp technique [Neher and Sakmann (1976) Nature 260, 799-802]. Since the 1990s, this work has inspired the use of protein or solid-state nanopores as inexpensive and ultrafast sensors for the detection of biomolecules, including DNA, RNA and proteins, but with particular focus on DNA sequencing. Solid-state nanopores in particular have the advantage that the pore size can be tailored to the analyte in question and that they can be modified using semi-conductor processing technology. This establishes solid-state nanopores as a new class of single-molecule biosensor devices, in some cases with submolecular resolution. In the present review, we discuss a few of the most important recent developments in this field and how they might be applied to studying protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions or in the context of ultra-fast DNA sequencing.
22540727,2,2012,Phys Rev Lett,Concentration polarization in translocation of DNA through nanopores and nanochannels.,In this Letter we provide a theory to show that high-field electrokinetic translocation of DNA through nanopores or nanochannels causes large transient variations of the ionic concentrations in front and at the back of the DNA due to concentration polarization (CP). The CP causes strong local conductivity variations, which can successfully explain the nontrivial current transients and ionic distributions observed in molecular dynamics simulations of nanopore DNA translocations as well as the transient current dips and spikes measured for translocating hairpin DNA. Most importantly, as the future of sequencing of DNA by nanopore translocation will be based on time-varying electrical conductance, CP, must be considered in experimental design and interpretation--currently these studies are mostly based on the incomplete pore conductance models that ignore CP and transients in the electrical conductance.
22528263,2,2012,Methods Mol Biol,DNA characterization by transverse electrical current in a nanochannel.,We review an approach for the characterization of single-stranded DNA based on the statistical identification of single bases via transverse electronic transport while DNA translocates in a nanopore or nanochannel. We describe the theoretical methods used to demonstrate this method for experimentally realizable systems and discuss the different physical processes involved. Recent experimental reports have shown the validity of this approach, although further work is necessary to make this a practical fast sequencing tool.
23852976,2,2012,IEEE Trans Biomed Circuits Syst,CMOS low current measurement system for biomedical applications.,We present a micro-chip implementation of a low current measurement system for biomedical applications using capacitive feedback that exhibits 190 fA of RMS noise in a 1 kHz bandwidth. The sampling rate is selectable up to 100 kHz. When measuring the amplifier noise with a 10 GΩ resistor and a 47 pF capacitor at the input, typical of cell membrane capacitance in DNA and patch clamp experiments, the measured RMS noise was 2.44 pA on a 50 pA signal in a 10 kHz bandwidth. Two channels were implemented on 630 × 440 μm² using a 0.5-μm 3-metal 2-poly CMOS process. Each channel consumes 1.5 mW of power from a 3.3 V supply. We measured the characteristics of an artificial lipid bilayer similar to the ones used in DNA sequencing experiments via nanopores.
23234568,1,2012,ACS Nano,Mapping the ion current distribution in nanopore/electrode devices.,Solid-state nanopores with integrated electrodes have interesting prospects in next-generation single-molecule biosensing and sequencing. These include &quot;gated&quot; nanopores with a single electrode integrated into the membrane, as well as two-electrode designs, such as a transversal tunneling junction. Here we report the first comprehensive analysis of current flow in a three-electrode device as a model for this class of sensors. As a new feature, we observe apparent rectification in the pore current that is rooted in the current distribution of the cell, rather than the geometry or electrostatics of the pore. We benchmark our results against a recently developed theoretical model and define operational parameters for nanopore/electrode structures. Our findings thus facilitate the rational design of such sensor devices.
23124983,1,2012,Electrophoresis,Slowing down DNA translocation through a nanopore by lowering fluid temperature.,In the next-generation nanopore-based DNA sequencing technique, the DNA nanoparticles are electrophoretically driven through a nanopore by an external electric field, and the ionic current through the nanopore is simultaneously altered and recorded during the DNA translocation process. The change in the ionic current through the nanopore as the DNA molecule passes through the nanopore represents a direct reading of the DNA sequence. Due to the large mismatch of the cross-sectional areas of the nanopore and the microfluidic reservoirs, the electric field inside the nanopore is significantly higher than that in the fluid reservoirs. This results in high-speed DNA translocation through the nanopore and consequently low read-out accuracy on the DNA sequences. Slowing down DNA translocation through the nanopore thus is one of the challenges in the nanopore-based DNA sequencing technique. Slowing down DNA translocation by lowering the fluid temperature is theoretically investigated for the first time using a continuum model, composed of the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for the ionic mass transport and the Navier-Stokes equations for the hydrodynamic field. The results qualitatively agree with the existing experimental results. Lowering the fluid temperature from 25 to 0°C reduces the translocation speed by a magnitude of about 6.21 to 2.50 mm/sK (i.e. 49.82 to 49.71%) for the salt concentration at 200 and 2000 mM, respectively, improving the read-out accuracy considerably. As the fluid temperature decreases, the magnitude of the ionic current signal decreases (increases) when the salt concentration is high (sufficiently low).
22802160,1,2012,Nanoscale,Electrokinetic ion and fluid transport in nanopores functionalized by polyelectrolyte brushes.,Chemically functionalized nanopores in solid-state membranes have recently emerged as versatile tools for regulating ion transport and sensing single biomolecules. This study theoretically investigated the importance of the bulk salt concentration, the geometries of the nanopore, and both the thickness and the grafting density of the polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes on the electrokinetic ion and fluid transport in two types of PE brush functionalized nanopore: PE brushes are end-grafted to the entire membrane surface (system I), and to its inner surface only (nanopore wall) (system II). Due to a more significant ion concentration polarization (CP), the enhanced local electric field inside the nanopore, the conductance, and the electroosmotic flow (EOF) velocity in system II are remarkably smaller than those in system I. In addition to a significantly enhanced EOF inside the nanopore, the direction of the flow field near both nanopore openings in system I is opposite to that of EOF inside the nanopore. This feature can be applied to regulate the electrokinetic translocation of biomolecules through a nanopore in the nanopore-based DNA sequencing platform.
22719928,1,2012,PLoS One,MspA nanopores from subunit dimers.,Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) forms an octameric channel and represents the founding member of a new family of pore proteins. Control of subunit stoichiometry is important to tailor MspA for nanotechnological applications. In this study, two MspA monomers were connected by linkers ranging from 17 to 62 amino acids in length. The oligomeric pore proteins were purified from M. smegmatis and were shown to form functional channels in lipid bilayer experiments. These results indicated that the peptide linkers did not prohibit correct folding and localization of MspA. However, expression levels were reduced by 10-fold compared to wild-type MspA. MspA is ideal for nanopore sequencing due to its unique pore geometry and its robustness. To assess the usefulness of MspA made from dimeric subunits for DNA sequencing, we linked two M1-MspA monomers, whose constriction zones were modified to enable DNA translocation. Lipid bilayer experiments demonstrated that this construct also formed functional channels. Voltage gating of MspA pores made from M1 monomers and M1-M1 dimers was identical indicating similar structural and dynamic channel properties. Glucose uptake in M. smegmatis cells lacking porins was restored by expressing the dimeric mspA M1 gene indicating correct folding and localization of M1-M1 pores in their native membrane. Single-stranded DNA hairpins produced identical ionic current blockades in pores made from monomers and subunit dimers demonstrating that M1-M1 pores are suitable for DNA sequencing. This study provides the proof of principle that production of single-chain MspA pores in M. smegmatis is feasible and paves the way for generating MspA pores with altered stoichiometries. Subunit dimers enable better control of the chemical and physical properties of the constriction zone of MspA. This approach will be valuable both in understanding transport across the outer membrane in mycobacteria and in tailoring MspA for nanopore sequencing of DNA.
22670603,1,2012,Recent Pat DNA Gene Seq,Recent patents on high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping methods.,Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single-base inheritable variations in a given and defined genetic location that occur in at least 1% of the population. SNPs are useful markers for genetic association studies in disease susceptibility or adverse drug reactions, in evolutionary studies and forensic science. Given the potential impact of SNPs, the biotechnology industry has focused on the development of high-throughput methods for SNP genotyping. Many highthroughput SNP genotyping technologies are currently available and many others are being patented recently. Each offers a unique combination of scale, accuracy, throughput and cost. In this review, we described some of the most important recent SNP genotyping methods and also recent patents associated with it.
22528260,1,2012,Methods Mol Biol,DNA sequencing by nanopore-induced photon emission.,Nanopore-based DNA analysis is an extremely attractive area of research due to the simplicity of the method, and the ability to not only probe individual molecules, but also to detect very small amounts of genomic material. Here, we describe the materials and methods of a novel, nanopore-based, single-molecule DNA sequencing system that utilizes optical detection. We convert target DNA according to a binary code, which is recognized by molecular beacons with two types of fluorophores. Solid-state nanopores are then used to sequentially strip off the beacons, leading to a series of photon bursts that can be detected with a custom-made microscope. We do not use any enzymes in the readout stage; thus, our system is not limited by the highly variable processivity, lifetime, and inaccuracy of individual enzymes that can hinder throughput and reliability. Furthermore, because our system uses purely optical readout, we can take advantage of high-end, wide-field imaging devices to record from multiple nanopores simultaneously. This allows an extremely straightforward parallelization of our system to nanopore arrays.
22466254,1,2012,J Phys Condens Matter,Stability of an aqueous quadrupole micro-trap.,The recently demonstrated functionality of an aqueous quadrupole micro- or nano-trap opens a new avenue for applications of Paul traps, like confinement of a charged biomolecule which requires a water environment for its chemical stability. Besides the strong viscosity forces, the motion of a charged particle in the aqueous trap is subject to dielectrophoretic and electrophoretic forces. In this study, we describe the general conditions for stability of a charged particle in an aqueous quadrupole trap. We find that for typical micro-trap parameters, the effects of both dielectrophoresis and electrophoresis significantly influence the trap stability. In particular, an aqueous quadrupole trap could play the role of a synthetic virtual nanopore for the third generation of DNA sequencing technology.
22422141,1,2012,Nanoscale,Regulating DNA translocation through functionalized soft nanopores.,Nanopores have emerged as promising next-generation devices for DNA sequencing technology. The two major challenges in such devices are: (i) find an efficient way to raise the DNA capture rate prior to funnelling a nanopore, and (ii) reduce the translocation velocity inside it so that single base resolution can be attained efficiently. To achieve these, a novel soft nanopore comprising a solid-state nanopore and a functionalized soft layer is proposed to regulate the DNA electrokinetic translocation. We show that, in addition to the presence of an electroosmotic flow (EOF), which reduces the DNA translocation velocity, counterion concentration polarization (CP) occurs near the entrance of the nanopore. The latter establishes an enrichment of the counterion concentration field, thereby electrostatically enhancing the capture rate. The dependence of the ionic current on the bulk salt concentration, the soft layer properties, and the length of the nanopore are investigated. We show that if the salt concentration is low, the ionic current depends largely upon the length of the nanopore, and the density of the fixed charge of the soft layer, but not upon its degree of softness. On the other hand, if it is high, ionic current blockade always occurs, regardless of the levels of the other parameters. The proposed soft nanopore is capable of enhancing the performance of DNA translocation while maintaining its basic signature of the ionic current at high salt concentration. The results gathered provide the necessary information for designing devices used in DNA sequencing.
23035927,0,2012,Anal Chem,Controlling pH-regulated bionanoparticles translocation through nanopores with polyelectrolyte brushes.,A novel polyelectrolyte (PE)-modified nanopore, comprising a solid-state nanopore functionalized by a nonregulated PE brush layer connecting two large reservoirs, is proposed to regulate the electrokinetic translocation of a soft nanoparticle (NP), comprising a rigid core covered by a pH-regulated, zwitterionic, soft layer, through it. The type of NP considered mimics bionanoparticles such as proteins and biomolecules. We find that a significant enrichment of H(+) occurs near the inlet of a charged solid-state nanopore, appreciably reducing the charge density of the NP as it approaches there, thereby lowering the NP translocation velocity and making it harder to thread the nanopore. This difficulty can be resolved by the proposed PE-modified nanopore, which raises effectively both the capture rate and the capture velocity of the soft NP and simultaneously reduces its translocation velocity through the nanopore so that both the sensing efficiency and the resolution are enhanced. The results gathered provide a conceptual framework for the interpretation of relevant experimental data and for the design of nanopore-based devices used in single biomolecules sensing and DNA sequencing.
22966538,0,2012,J Nanosci Nanotechnol,3-D simulation of nanopore structure for DNA sequencing.,In this paper, we propose a method for simulating nanopore structure by using conventional 3-D simulation tool to mimic the I-V behavior of the nanopore structure. In the simulation, we use lightly doped silicon for ionic solution where some parameters like electron affinity and dielectric constant are fitted to consider the ionic solution. By using this method, we can simulate the I-V behavior of nanopore structure depending on the location and the size of the sphere shaped silicon oxide which is considered to be an indicator of a DNA base. In addition, we simulate an Ionic Field Effect Transistor (IFET) which has basically the nanopore structure, and show that the simulated curves follow sufficiently the I-V behavior of the measurement data. Therefore, we think it is reasonable to apply parameter modeling mentioned above to simulate nanopore structure. The key idea is to modify electron affinity of silicon which is used to mimic the KCl solution to avoid band bending and depletion inside the nanopore. We could efficiently utilize conventional 3-D simulation tool to simulate the I-V behavior of nanopore structures.
22898937,0,2012,Eur Phys J E Soft Matter,Mimicking DNA stretching with the Static Mode method: shear stress versus transverse pulling stress.,DNA sequencing using nanopores is closer than ever to become a reality, but further research and development still need to be done, especially to unravel the atomic-scale mechanisms of induced DNA stretching. At this level, molecular modeling and simulation are essential to investigate DNA conformational flexibility and its response to the forces involved. In this work, through a &quot;Static Mode&quot; approach, we present a directed exploration of the deformations of a 27-mer subjected to externally imposed forces, as it could be in a nanopore. We show how the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone undergoes the majority of the induced deformation, before the base pairing is affected, and to what extent unzipping initiation depends on the force direction.

21926981,96,2011,Nat Nanotechnol,Nanopore sensors for nucleic acid analysis.,Nanopore analysis is an emerging technique that involves using a voltage to drive molecules through a nanoscale pore in a membrane between two electrolytes, and monitoring how the ionic current through the nanopore changes as single molecules pass through it. This approach allows charged polymers (including single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA and RNA) to be analysed with subnanometre resolution and without the need for labels or amplification. Recent advances suggest that nanopore-based sensors could be competitive with other third-generation DNA sequencing technologies, and may be able to rapidly and reliably sequence the human genome for under $1,000. In this article we review the use of nanopore technology in DNA sequencing, genetics and medical diagnostics.
21698376,54,2011,J Appl Genet,Sequencing technologies and genome sequencing.,The high-throughput - next generation sequencing (HT-NGS) technologies are currently the hottest topic in the field of human and animals genomics researches, which can produce over 100 times more data compared to the most sophisticated capillary sequencers based on the Sanger method. With the ongoing developments of high throughput sequencing machines and advancement of modern bioinformatics tools at unprecedented pace, the target goal of sequencing individual genomes of living organism at a cost of $1,000 each is seemed to be realistically feasible in the near future. In the relatively short time frame since 2005, the HT-NGS technologies are revolutionizing the human and animal genome researches by analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to DNA microarray (ChIP-chip) or sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), whole genome genotyping, genome wide structural variation, de novo assembling and re-assembling of genome, mutation detection and carrier screening, detection of inherited disorders and complex human diseases, DNA library preparation, paired ends and genomic captures, sequencing of mitochondrial genome and personal genomics. In this review, we addressed the important features of HT-NGS like, first generation DNA sequencers, birth of HT-NGS, second generation HT-NGS platforms, third generation HT-NGS platforms: including single molecule Heliscope™, SMRT™ and RNAP sequencers, Nanopore, Archon Genomics X PRIZE foundation, comparison of second and third HT-NGS platforms, applications, advances and future perspectives of sequencing technologies on human and animal genome research.
21991340,21,2011,PLoS One,Nucleotide discrimination with DNA immobilized in the MspA nanopore.,Nanopore sequencing has the potential to become a fast and low-cost DNA sequencing platform. An ionic current passing through a small pore would directly map the sequence of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) driven through the constriction. The pore protein, MspA, derived from Mycobacterium smegmatis, has a short and narrow channel constriction ideally suited for nanopore sequencing. To study MspA's ability to resolve nucleotides, we held ssDNA within the pore using a biotin-NeutrAvidin complex. We show that homopolymers of adenine, cytosine, thymine, and guanine in MspA exhibit much larger current differences than in α-hemolysin. Additionally, methylated cytosine is distinguishable from unmethylated cytosine. We establish that single nucleotide substitutions within homopolymer ssDNA can be detected when held in MspA's constriction. Using genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms, we demonstrate that single nucleotides within random DNA can be identified. Our results indicate that MspA has high signal-to-noise ratio and the single nucleotide sensitivity desired for nanopore sequencing devices.
22165962,20,2011,ACS Nano,Stacked graphene-Al2O3 nanopore sensors for sensitive detection of DNA and DNA-protein complexes.,We report the development of a multilayered graphene-Al(2)O(3) nanopore platform for the sensitive detection of DNA and DNA-protein complexes. Graphene-Al(2)O(3) nanolaminate membranes are formed by sequentially depositing layers of graphene and Al(2)O(3), with nanopores being formed in these membranes using an electron-beam sculpting process. The resulting nanopores are highly robust, exhibit low electrical noise (significantly lower than nanopores in pure graphene), are highly sensitive to electrolyte pH at low KCl concentrations (attributed to the high buffer capacity of Al(2)O(3)), and permit the electrical biasing of the embedded graphene electrode, thereby allowing for three terminal nanopore measurements. In proof-of-principle biomolecule sensing experiments, the folded and unfolded transport of single DNA molecules and RecA-coated DNA complexes could be discerned with high temporal resolution. The process described here also enables nanopore integration with new graphene-based structures, including nanoribbons and nanogaps, for single-molecule DNA sequencing and medical diagnostic applications.
21572978,20,2011,IEEE Trans Nanotechnol,Nanopore Sequencing: Electrical Measurements of the Code of Life.,Sequencing a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using a nanopore is a revolutionary concept because it combines the potential for long read lengths (&gt;5 kbp) with high speed (1 bp/10 ns), while obviating the need for costly amplification procedures due to the exquisite single molecule sensitivity. The prospects for implementing this concept seem bright. The cost savings from the removal of required reagents, coupled with the speed of nanopore sequencing places the $1000 genome within grasp. However, challenges remain: high fidelity reads demand stringent control over both the molecular configuration in the pore and the translocation kinetics. The molecular configuration determines how the ions passing through the pore come into contact with the nucleotides, while the translocation kinetics affect the time interval in which the same nucleotides are held in the constriction as the data is acquired. Proteins like α-hemolysin and its mutants offer exquisitely precise self-assembled nanopores and have demonstrated the facility for discriminating individual nucleotides, but it is currently difficult to design protein structure ab initio, which frustrates tailoring a pore for sequencing genomic DNA. Nanopores in solid-state membranes have been proposed as an alternative because of the flexibility in fabrication and ease of integration into a sequencing platform. Preliminary results have shown that with careful control of the dimensions of the pore and the shape of the electric field, control of DNA translocation through the pore is possible. Furthermore, discrimination between different base pairs of DNA may be feasible. Thus, a nanopore promises inexpensive, reliable, high-throughput sequencing, which could thrust genomic science into personal medicine.
22141739,19,2011,Nano Lett,DNA base-specific modulation of microampere transverse edge currents through a metallic graphene nanoribbon with a nanopore.,We study two-terminal devices for DNA sequencing that consist of a metallic graphene nanoribbon with zigzag edges (ZGNR) and a nanopore in its interior through which the DNA molecule is translocated. Using the nonequilibrium Green functions combined with density functional theory, we demonstrate that each of the four DNA nucleobases inserted into the nanopore, whose edge carbon atoms are passivated by either hydrogen or nitrogen, will lead to a unique change in the device conductance. Unlike other recent biosensors based on transverse electronic transport through translocated DNA, which utilize small (of the order of pA) tunneling current across a nanogap or a nanopore yielding a poor signal-to-noise ratio, our device concept relies on the fact that in ZGNRs local current density is peaked around the edges so that drilling a nanopore away from the edges will not diminish the conductance. Inserting a nucleobase into the nanopore affects the charge density in the surrounding area, thereby modulating edge conduction currents whose magnitude is of the order of microampere at bias voltage 0.1 V. The proposed biosensors are not limited to ZGNRs and they could be realized with other nanowires supporting transverse edge currents, such as chiral GNRs or wires made of two-dimensional topological insulators.
22157724,17,2011,Nat Nanotechnol,Local electrical potential detection of DNA by nanowire-nanopore sensors.,Nanopores could potentially be used to perform single-molecule DNA sequencing at low cost and with high throughput. Although single base resolution and differentiation have been demonstrated with nanopores using ionic current measurements, direct sequencing has not been achieved because of the difficulties in recording very small (∼pA) ionic currents at a bandwidth consistent with fast translocation speeds. Here, we show that solid-state nanopores can be combined with silicon nanowire field-effect transistors to create sensors in which detection is localized and self-aligned at the nanopore. Well-defined field-effect transistor signals associated with DNA translocation are recorded when an ionic strength gradient is imposed across the nanopores. Measurements and modelling show that field-effect transistor signals are generated by highly localized changes in the electrical potential during DNA translocation, and that nanowire-nanopore sensors could enable large-scale integration with a high intrinsic bandwidth.
21662982,14,2011,ACS Nano,Controlling DNA translocation through gate modulation of nanopore wall surface charges.,One major challenge of nanopore-based DNA sequencing technology is to find an efficient way to reduce DNA translocation speed so that each nucleotide can reside long enough in the pore for interrogation. Here we report the electrical tuning of DNA translocation speed by gate modulation of nanopore wall surface charges. We find that native surface-charge-induced counterions in the electroosmotic layer substantially enhance advection flow of fluid, which exerts stronger dragging forces on the translocating DNA, and thereby lowering the DNA translocation speed. We propose a feedback device architecture to regulate DNA translocation by modulating the effective wall surface charge density σw*via lateral gate voltages--at the beginning, a positive gate bias is applied to weaken σw* in order to enhance the capture rate of DNA molecule; upon detection of ionic current variance indicating DNA has been driven into the nanopore, gate bias is turned to be negative so that σw* is reinforced and DNA translocation is retarded. We show that a gate electric field can dramatically decrease the DNA translocation speed at a rate about 55 μm/s per 1 mV/nm.
21723816,13,2011,Biophys J,Origins and consequences of velocity fluctuations during DNA passage through a nanopore.,We describe experiments and modeling results that reveal and explain the distribution of times that identical double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules take to pass through a voltage-biased solid-state nanopore. We show that the observed spread in this distribution is caused by viscous-drag-induced velocity fluctuations that are correlated with the initial conformation of nanopore-captured molecules. This contribution exceeds that due to diffusional Brownian motion during the passage. Nevertheless, and somewhat counterintuitively, the diffusional Brownian motion determines the fundamental limitations of rapid DNA strand sequencing with a nanopore. We model both diffusional and conformational fluctuations in a Langevin description. It accounts well for passage time variations for DNA molecules of different lengths, and predicts conditions required for low-error-rate nanopore-strand DNA sequencing with nanopores.
21981556,12,2011,ACS Nano,Computational investigation of DNA detection using graphene nanopores.,Nanopore-based single-molecule detection and analysis have been pursued intensively over the past decade. One of the most promising applications in this regard is DNA sequencing achieved through DNA translocation-induced blockades in ionic current. Recently, nanopores fabricated in graphene sheets were used to detect double-stranded DNA. Due to its subnanometer thickness, graphene nanopores show great potential to realize DNA sequencing at single-base resolution. Resolving at the atomic level electric field-driven DNA translocation through graphene nanopores is crucial to guide the design of graphene-based sequencing devices. Molecular dynamics simulations, in principle, can achieve such resolution and are employed here to investigate the effects of applied voltage, DNA conformation, and sequence as well as pore charge on the translocation characteristics of DNA. We demonstrate that such simulations yield current characteristics consistent with recent measurements and suggest that under suitable bias conditions A-T and G-C base pairs can be discriminated using graphene nanopores.
21297626,12,2011,Nat Nanotechnol,Fast DNA sequencing with a graphene-based nanochannel device.,Devices in which a single strand of DNA is threaded through a nanopore could be used to efficiently sequence DNA. However, various issues will have to be resolved to make this approach practical, including controlling the DNA translocation rate, suppressing stochastic nucleobase motions, and resolving the signal overlap between different nucleobases. Here, we demonstrate theoretically the feasibility of DNA sequencing using a fluidic nanochannel functionalized with a graphene nanoribbon. This approach involves deciphering the changes that occur in the conductance of the nanoribbon as a result of its interactions with the nucleobases via π-π stacking. We show that as a DNA strand passes through the nanochannel, the distinct conductance characteristics of the nanoribbon (calculated using a method based on density functional theory coupled to non-equilibrium Green function theory) allow the different nucleobases to be distinguished using a data-mining technique and a two-dimensional transient autocorrelation analysis. This fast and reliable DNA sequencing device should be experimentally feasible in the near future.
21495701,11,2011,Nano Lett,Transverse conductance of DNA nucleotides in a graphene nanogap from first principles.,The fabrication of nanopores in atomically thin graphene has recently been achieved, and translocation of DNA has been demonstrated. Taken together with an earlier proposal to use graphene nanogaps for the purpose of DNA sequencing, this approach can resolve the technical problem of achieving single-base resolution in electronic nucleobase detection. We have theoretically evaluated the performance of a graphene nanogap setup for the purpose of whole-genome sequencing, by employing density functional theory and the nonequilibrium Green's function method to investigate the transverse conductance properties of nucleotides inside the gap. In particular, we determined the electrical tunneling current variation at finite bias due to changes in the nucleotides orientation and lateral position. Although the resulting tunneling current is found to fluctuate over several orders of magnitude, a distinction between the four DNA bases appears possible, thus ranking the approach promising for rapid whole-genome sequencing applications.
21928773,9,2011,ACS Nano,Gate manipulation of DNA capture into nanopores.,Understanding biophysics governing DNA capture into a nanopore and establishing a manipulation system for the capture process are essential for nanopore-based genome sequencing. In this work, the functionality of extended electric field and electroosmotic flow (EOF) during the capture stage and their dependence on gate voltage, U(G), are investigated. We demonstrate that while both the electric field and EOF within a cis chamber make long-distance contributions to DNA capture around the pore mouth, the former effect is always capturing, while the latter causes trapping or blocking of the molecule depending on the magnitude of the gate voltage, U(G): an anionic EOF induced by high U(G) is capable of doubling the DNA trapping speed and thus the absorption radius in the cis chamber, whereas a cationic EOF by low U(G) would substantially offset the trapping effort by the electric field and even totally block DNA entrance into the pore. Based on the analysis, a gate regulation is proposed with the objective of achieving a high DNA capture rate while maintaining a low error rate.
21339610,9,2011,J Phys Condens Matter,Control and reversal of the electrophoretic force on DNA in a charged nanopore.,Electric field driven transport of DNA through solid-state nanopores is the key process in nanopore-based DNA sequencing that promises dramatic reduction of genome sequencing costs. A major hurdle in the development of this sequencing method is that DNA transport through the nanopores occurs too quickly for the DNA sequence to be detected. By means of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the velocity of DNA transport through a nanopore can be controlled by the charge state of the nanopore surface. In particular, we show that the charge density of the nanopore surface controls the magnitude and/or direction of the electro-osmotic flow through the nanopore and thereby can significantly reduce or even reverse the effective electrophoretic force on DNA. Our work suggests a physical mechanism to control DNA transport in a nanopore by chemical, electrical or electrochemical modification of the nanopore surface.
21709813,8,2011,J Phys Chem Lett,Unzipping of Double-stranded DNA in Engineered α-Hemolysin Pores.,Biological protein α-hemolysin nanopore is under intense investigation as a potential platform for rapid and low-cost DNA sequencing. However, due to its narrow constriction, analysis of DNA in the α-hemolysin pore has long time been restricted to single strands. In this paper, we report that by introducing new surface functional groups into the α-hemolysin pore, facilitated unzipping of double-stranded DNA through the channel could be achieved. Since the mean residence time of the DNA events is dependent on the length of the duplex, and also varies with the nucleotide base composition, the modified protein pore approach offers the potential for rapid double-stranded DNA analysis, including sequencing.
22081018,7,2011,Nanoscale,Slowing and controlling the translocation of DNA in a solid-state nanopore.,DNA sequencing methods based on nanopores could potentially represent a low-cost and high-throughput pathway to practical genomics, by replacing current sequencing methods based on synthesis that are limited in speed and cost. The success of nanopore sequencing techniques requires the solution to two fundamental problems: (1) sensing each nucleotide of a DNA strand, in sequence, as it passes through a nanopore; (2) delivering each nucleotide in a DNA strand, in turn, to a sensing site within the nanopore in a controlled manner. It has been demonstrated that a DNA nucleotide can be sensed using electric signals, such as ionic current changes caused by nucleotide blockage at a constriction region in a protein pore or a tunneling current through the nucleotide-bridged gap of two nanoelectrodes built near a solid-state nanopore. However, it is not yet clear how each nucleotide in a DNA strand can be delivered in turn to a sensing site and held there for a sufficient time to ensure high fidelity sensing. This latter problem has been addressed by modifying macroscopic properties, such as a solvent viscosity, ion concentration or temperature. Also, the DNA transistor, a solid state nanopore dressed with a series of metal-dielectric layers has been proposed as a solution. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the means to study and to understand DNA transport in nanopores microscopically. In this article, we review computational studies on how to slow down and control the DNA translocation through a solid-state nanopore.
21487665,7,2011,Biomed Microdevices,Lipid bilayer coated Al(2)O(3) nanopore sensors: towards a hybrid biological solid-state nanopore.,Solid-state nanopore sensors are highly versatile platforms for the rapid, label-free electrical detection and analysis of single molecules, applicable to next generation DNA sequencing. The versatility of this technology allows for both large scale device integration and interfacing with biological systems. Here we report on the development of a hybrid biological solid-state nanopore platform that incorporates a highly mobile lipid bilayer on a single solid-state Al(2)O(3) nanopore sensor, for the potential reconstitution of ion channels and biological nanopores. Such a system seeks to combine the superior electrical, thermal, and mechanical stability of Al(2)O(3) solid-state nanopores with the chemical specificity of biological nanopores. Bilayers on Al(2)O(3) exhibit higher diffusivity than those formed on TiO(2) and SiO(2) substrates, attributed to the presence of a thick hydration layer on Al(2)O(3), a key requirement to preserving the biological functionality of reconstituted membrane proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the electrostatic repulsion between the dipole of the DOPC headgroup and the positively charged Al(2)O(3) surface may be responsible for the enhanced thickness of this hydration layer. Lipid bilayer coated Al(2)O(3) nanopore sensors exhibit excellent electrical properties and enhanced mechanical stability (GΩ seals for over 50 h), making this technology ideal for use in ion channel electrophysiology, the screening of ion channel active drugs and future integration with biological nanopores such as α-hemolysin and MspA for rapid single molecule DNA sequencing. This technology can find broad application in bio-nanotechnology.
22067161,6,2011,Biophys J,Characterizing and controlling the motion of ssDNA in a solid-state nanopore.,Sequencing DNA in a synthetic solid-state nanopore is potentially a low-cost and high-throughput method. Essential to the nanopore-based DNA sequencing method is the ability to control the motion of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule at single-base resolution. Experimental studies showed that the average translocation speed of DNA driven by a biasing electric field can be affected by ionic concentration, solvent viscosity, or temperature. Even though it is possible to slow down the average translocation speed, instantaneous motion of DNA is too diffusive to allow each DNA base to stay in front of a sensor site for its measurement. Using extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we study the diffusion constant, friction coefficient, electrophoretic mobility, and effective charge of ssDNA in a solid-state nanopore. Simulation results show that the spatial fluctuation of ssDNA in 1 ns is comparable to the spacing between neighboring nucleotides in ssDNA, which makes the sensing of a DNA base very difficult. We demonstrate that the recently proposed DNA transistor could potentially solve this problem by electrically trapping ssDNA inside the DNA transistor and ratcheting ssDNA base-by-base in a biasing electric field. When increasing the biasing electric field, we observed that the translocation of ssDNA changes from ratcheting to steady-sliding. The simulated translocation of ssDNA in the DNA transistor was theoretically characterized using Fokker-Planck analysis.
21790148,6,2011,ACS Nano,How to understand and interpret current flow in nanopore/electrode devices.,Nanopore-based single-molecule sensors have become an important class of analytical devices that have in some cases already reached the market place. Traditionally operated in a two-electrode configuration, devices with three or more electrodes have emerged recently, for example with a view on switching the transport properties of the nanopore or even tunneling-based detection of analytes with the ultimate goal of inexpensive and ultrafast DNA sequencing. How do these additional electrodes affect the current distribution in the cell and hence the sensor performance? This is significantly less clear and thus in focus here. We use impedance modeling of a prototypical three-electrode nanopore sensor and show that, depending on the conditions, standard experimental device characterization is severely affected by the presence of the third electrode. On the other hand, the simulations also provide guidelines on how to avoid such complications, identify &quot;safe&quot; operating conditions, and design criteria for optimized nanopore sensors.
21987056,4,2011,Curr Protoc Mol Biol,Overview of DNA sequencing strategies.,Efficient and cost-effective DNA sequencing technologies are critical to the progress of molecular biology. This overview of DNA sequencing strategies provides a high-level review of seven distinct approaches to DNA sequencing: (a) dideoxy sequencing; (b) solid phase sequencing; (c) sequencing-by-hybridization; (d) mass spectrometry; (e) cyclic array sequencing; (f) microelectrophoresis; and (g) nanopore sequencing. Other platforms currently in development are also briefly described. The primary focus here is on Sanger dideoxy sequencing, which has been the dominant technology since 1977, and on cyclic array strategies, for which several competitive implementations have been developed since 2005. Because the field of DNA sequencing is changing rapidly, this unit represents a snapshot as of September, 2011.
21279445,4,2011,Biomed Microdevices,Forces affecting double-stranded DNA translocation through synthetic nanopores.,One of the recent applications of nanopores is to use them as detectors/analyzers for bio-molecules and nanopore based sequencing has been studied to quickly sequence DNA. In this paper, three categories of forces proposed in the literature to oppose the electrical driving forces in the DNA translocation process are analyzed, (1) the entropic forces of DNA uncoiling/recoiling at the pore entrance/exits, (2) the viscous drag acting on the blob like DNA outside the nanopore, and (3) the viscous drag acting on the linear DNA inside the nanopore. The magnitudes of these forces are calculated based on the parameters used in experiments and it is shown that the first two of the aforementioned categories of forces are usually small compared to the electrical driving force, while the last one is of the same order as the electrical driving force. To evaluate the viscous drag force acting on the linear DNA inside the nanopore, a hydrodynamic model based on the lubrication approximation is used to calculate the flow field and the viscous drag force acting on a DNA immobilized in a nanopore. This model is validated by good agreement with the experimental data for the tethering force used to immobilize a DNA inside the nanopore.
21674382,3,2011,Methods Mol Biol,Modeling nanopores for sequencing DNA.,Using nanopores to sequence DNA rapidly and at a low cost has the potential to radically transform the field of genomic research. However, despite all the exciting developments in the field, sequencing DNA using a nanopore has yet to be demonstrated. Among the many problems that hinder development of the nanopore sequencing methods is the inability of current experimental techniques to visualize DNA conformations in a nanopore and directly relate the microscopic state of the system to the measured signal. We have recently shown that such tasks could be accomplished through computation. This chapter provides step-by-step instructions of how to build atomic scale models of biological and solid-state nanopore systems, use the molecular dynamics method to simulate the electric field-driven transport of ions and DNA through the nanopores, and analyze the results of such computational experiments.
21428458,3,2011,Biochemistry,Molecular dynamics simulations of DNA within a nanopore: arginine-phosphate tethering and a binding/sliding mechanism for translocation.,Protein nanopores show great potential as low-cost detectors in DNA sequencing devices. To date, research has largely focused on the staphylococcal pore α-hemolysin (αHL). In the present study, we have developed simplified models of the wild-type αHL pore and various mutants in order to study the translocation dynamics of single-stranded DNA under the influence of an applied electric field. The model nanopores reflect the experimentally measured conductance values in planar lipid bilayers. We show that interactions between rings of cationic amino acids and DNA backbone phosphates result in metastable tethering of nucleic acid molecules within the pore, leading us to propose a &quot;binding and sliding&quot; mechanism for translocation. We also observe folding of DNA into nonlinear conformational intermediates during passage through the confined nanopore environment. Despite adopting nonlinear conformations, the DNA hexamer always exits the pore in the same orientation as it enters (3' to 5') in our simulations. The observations from our simulations help to rationalize experimentally determined trends in residual current and translocation efficiency for αHL and its mutants.
22166072,2,2011,BMC Bioinformatics,The NTD Nanoscope: potential applications and implementations.,BACKGROUND: Nanopore transduction detection (NTD) offers prospects for a number of highly sensitive and discriminative applications, including: (i) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection; (ii) targeted DNA re-sequencing; (iii) protein isoform assaying; and (iv) biosensing via antibody or aptamer coupled molecules. Nanopore event transduction involves single-molecule biophysics, engineered information flows, and nanopore cheminformatics. The NTD Nanoscope has seen limited use in the scientific community, however, due to lack of information about potential applications, and lack of availability for the device itself. Meta Logos Inc. is developing both pre-packaged device platforms and component-level (unassembled) kit platforms (the latter described here). In both cases a lipid bi-layer workstation is first established, then augmentations and operational protocols are provided to have a nanopore transduction detector. In this paper we provide an overview of the NTD Nanoscope applications and implementations. The NTD Nanoscope Kit, in particular, is a component-level reproduction of the standard NTD device used in previous research papers.RESULTS: The NTD Nanoscope method is shown to functionalize a single nanopore with a channel current modulator that is designed to transduce events, such as binding to a specific target. To expedite set-up in new lab settings, the calibration and troubleshooting for the NTD Nanoscope kit components and signal processing software, the NTD Nanoscope Kit, is designed to include a set of test buffers and control molecules based on experiments described in previous NTD papers (the model systems briefly described in what follows). The description of the Server-interfacing for advanced signal processing support is also briefly mentioned.CONCLUSIONS: SNP assaying, SNP discovery, DNA sequencing and RNA-seq methods are typically limited by the accuracy of the error rate of the enzymes involved, such as methods involving the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enzyme. The NTD Nanoscope offers a means to obtain higher accuracy as it is a single-molecule method that does not inherently involve use of enzymes, using a functionalized nanopore instead.
21870461,1,2011,J Biomed Nanotechnol,A new strategy for next generation sequencing: merging the Sanger's method and the sequencing by synthesis through replacing extension.,The present paper describes a feasible protocol enabling a merge of the classical Sanger sequencing method with the sequencing by DNA synthesis: The cycled proofreading sequencing. This new protocol involves partial chain termination and replacing extension. The first step is done with mixed ddNTP/dNTP targeting one type of nucleotide per subcycle and its relevant replacing extension with unlabeled phosphorothioate-modified dNTP of the same nucleotide type used in partial chain termination. Replacing extension serves as the key step to eliminate fluorescent signals integrated at the previous step, proofread errors, reactivate and synchronize the 3' termini of extended DNA molecules. This microchip-based sequencing method thus inherits advantages from &quot;sequencing-by-termination&quot; and &quot;sequencing-by-extension&quot;; ddNTP is used and reactions are cycled. This microchip-based sequencing method is applicable for reaching the $1000-genome project goal.
21689531,1,2011,Biophys J,Long dwell-time passage of DNA through nanometer-scale pores: kinetics and sequence dependence of motion.,A detailed understanding of the kinetics of DNA motion though nanometer-scale pores is important for the successful development of many of the proposed next-generation rapid DNA sequencing and analysis methods. Many of these approaches require DNA motion through nanopores to be slowed by several orders of magnitude from its native translocation velocity so that the translocation times for individual nucleotides fall within practical timescales for detection. With the increased dwell time of DNA in the pore, DNA-pore interactions begin to play an increasingly important role in translocation kinetics. In previous work, we and others observed that when the DNA dwell time in the pore is substantial (&gt;1 ms), DNA motion in α-hemolysin (α-HL) pores leads to nonexponential kinetics in the escape of DNA out of the pore. Here we show that a three-state model for DNA escape, involving stochastic binding interactions of DNA with the pore, accurately reproduces the experimental data. In addition, we investigate the sequence dependence of the DNA escape process and show that the interaction strength of adenine with α-HL is substantially lower relative to cytosine. Our results indicate a difference in the process by which DNA moves through an α-HL nanopore when the motion is fast (microsecond timescale) as compared with when it is slow (millisecond timescale) and strongly influenced by DNA-pore interactions of the kind reported here. We also show the ability of wild-type α-HL to detect and distinguish between 5-methylcytosine and cytosine based on differences in the absolute ionic current through the pore in the presence of these two nucleotides. The results we present here regarding sequence-dependent (and dwell-time-dependent) DNA-pore interaction kinetics will have important implications for the design of methods for DNA analysis through reduced-velocity motion in nanopores.
21526788,1,2011,J Phys Chem B,Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of DNA translocation in chemically modified nanopores.,Solid-state nanopores provide a direct means to detect and analyze DNA and proteins. In a typical setup, the DNA molecules travel through a nanopore under electrophoretic voltage bias. The nanopore is sandwiched between two chambers that are filled with ionic solution. A major challenge in using solid-state nanopores for DNA sequencing and gene detection is to improve their selectivity and detection sensitivity. To achieve these goals, one solution is to functionalize the nanopores by chemically modifying the pore walls with silanes or nucleic acids. However, little is known about molecular interactions in functionalized nanopores. This paper presents DNA translocation dynamics and the mechanism of DNA sequencing in a functionalized nanopore through a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model. The DNA nucleotide is coarse-grained into two interaction sites: one site corresponds to the base group and the other encompasses the phosphate and sugar groups. The water molecules are included in the model implicitly through Langevin dynamics. The coarse-grained model immensely improves the computational efficiency while still capturing the essential translocation dynamics. The model characterizes important physical properties of functionalized nanopores such as the effective pore diameter and effect of biasing voltage on the DNA translocation dynamics. The model reveals a nonlinear relationship between translocation speed of DNA and applied voltage. Moreover, DNA translocation in nanopores functionalized with hairpin-loop (HPL) DNA and single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) shows significant differences: a target DNA is found to translocate through a ss-DNA coated nanopore 9 times faster than through an HPL coated one at a bias of 100 mV, putatively from lower stiffness of ss-DNA than that for HPL. The DNA translocation speed is also largely influenced by interaction potential between the DNA and surface-tethered molecules. The results reveal that such selective translocation, distinctly different translocation dynamics of target DNA molecules largely stem from the flexibility and orientation of the surface-tethered molecules. These findings can significantly impact the rational design of DNA transport experiments leading to rapid molecule-level diagnostics.
21241153,1,2011,J Chem Phys,Langevin dynamics for the transport of flexible biological macromolecules in confined geometries.,The transport of flexible biological macromolecules in confined geometries is found in a variety of important biophysical systems including biomolecular movements through pores in cell walls, vesicle walls, and synthetic nanopores for sequencing methods. In this study, we extend our previous analysis of the Fokker-Planck and Langevin dynamics for describing the coupled translational and rotational motions of single structured macromolecules near structured external surfaces or walls [M. H. Peters, J. Chem. Phys. 110, 528 (1999); 112, 5488 (2000)] to the problem of many interacting macromolecules in the presence of structured external surfaces representing the confining geometry. Overall macromolecular flexibility is modeled through specified interaction potentials between the structured Brownian subunits (B-particles), as already demonstrated for protein and DNA molecules briefly reviewed here. We derive the Fokker-Planck equation using a formal multiple time scale perturbation expansion of the Liouville equation for the entire system, i.e., solvent, macromolecules, and external surface. A configurational-orientational Langevin displacement equation is also obtained for use in Brownian dynamics applications. We demonstrate important effects of the external surface on implicit solvent forces through formal descriptions of the grand friction tensor and equilibrium average force of the solvent on the B-particles. The formal analysis provides both transparency of all terms of the Langevin displacement equation as well as a prescription for their determination. As an example, application of the methods developed, the real-time movement of an α-helix protein through a carbon nanotube is simulated.
20608744,62,2010,Nano Lett,DNA translocation through graphene nanopores.,Nanopores--nanosized holes that can transport ions and molecules--are very promising devices for genomic screening, in particular DNA sequencing. Solid-state nanopores currently suffer from the drawback, however, that the channel constituting the pore is long, approximately 100 times the distance between two bases in a DNA molecule (0.5 nm for single-stranded DNA). This paper provides proof of concept that it is possible to realize and use ultrathin nanopores fabricated in graphene monolayers for single-molecule DNA translocation. The pores are obtained by placing a graphene flake over a microsize hole in a silicon nitride membrane and drilling a nanosize hole in the graphene using an electron beam. As individual DNA molecules translocate through the pore, characteristic temporary conductance changes are observed in the ionic current through the nanopore, setting the stage for future single-molecule genomic screening devices.
20798343,58,2010,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Nanopore DNA sequencing with MspA.,Nanopore sequencing has the potential to become a direct, fast, and inexpensive DNA sequencing technology. The simplest form of nanopore DNA sequencing utilizes the hypothesis that individual nucleotides of single-stranded DNA passing through a nanopore will uniquely modulate an ionic current flowing through the pore, allowing the record of the current to yield the DNA sequence. We demonstrate that the ionic current through the engineered Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A, MspA, has the ability to distinguish all four DNA nucleotides and resolve single-nucleotides in single-stranded DNA when double-stranded DNA temporarily holds the nucleotides in the pore constriction. Passing DNA with a series of double-stranded sections through MspA provides proof of principle of a simple DNA sequencing method using a nanopore. These findings highlight the importance of MspA in the future of nanopore sequencing.
20561776,39,2010,Curr Opin Biotechnol,Applications of biological pores in nanomedicine, sensing, and nanoelectronics.,Biological protein pores and pore-forming peptides can generate a pathway for the flux of ions and other charged or polar molecules across cellular membranes. In nature, these nanopores have diverse and essential functions that range from maintaining cell homeostasis and participating in cell signaling to activating or killing cells. The combination of the nanoscale dimensions and sophisticated - often regulated - functionality of these biological pores make them particularly attractive for the growing field of nanobiotechnology. Applications range from single-molecule sensing to drug delivery and targeted killing of malignant cells. Potential future applications may include the use of nanopores for single strand DNA sequencing and for generating bio-inspired, and possibly, biocompatible visual detection systems and batteries. This article reviews the current state of applications of pore-forming peptides and proteins in nanomedicine, sensing, and nanoelectronics.
20927439,38,2010,Chem Commun (Camb),Identification of epigenetic DNA modifications with a protein nanopore.,Two DNA bases, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC), marks of epigenetic modification, are recognized in immobilized DNA strands and distinguished from G, A, T and C by nanopore current recording. Therefore, if further aspects of nanopore sequencing can be addressed, the approach will provide a means to locate epigenetic modifications in unamplified genomic DNA.
21113160,32,2010,Nat Nanotechnol,Hybrid pore formation by directed insertion of α-haemolysin into solid-state nanopores.,Most experiments on nanopores have concentrated on the pore-forming protein α-haemolysin (αHL) and on artificial pores in solid-state membranes. While biological pores offer an atomically precise structure and the potential for genetic engineering, solid-state nanopores offer durability, size and shape control, and are also better suited for integration into wafer-scale devices. However, each system has significant limitations: αHL is difficult to integrate because it relies on delicate lipid bilayers for mechanical support, and the fabrication of solid-state nanopores with precise dimensions remains challenging. Here we show that these limitations may be overcome by inserting a single αHL pore into a solid-state nanopore. A double-stranded DNA attached to the protein pore is threaded into a solid-state nanopore by electrophoretic translocation. Protein insertion is observed in 30-40% of our attempts, and translocation of single-stranded DNA demonstrates that the hybrid nanopore remains functional. The hybrid structure offers a platform to create wafer-scale device arrays for genomic analysis, including sequencing.
20459065,30,2010,Nano Lett,Optical recognition of converted DNA nucleotides for single-molecule DNA sequencing using nanopore arrays.,We demonstrate the feasibility of a nanopore based single-molecule DNA sequencing method, which employs multicolor readout. Target DNA is converted according to a binary code, which is recognized by molecular beacons with two types of fluorophores. Solid-state nanopores are then used to sequentially strip off the beacons, leading to a series of detectable photon bursts, at high speed. We show that signals from multiple nanopores can be detected simultaneously, allowing straightforward parallelization to large nanopore arrays.
21133389,28,2010,Nano Lett,DNA tunneling detector embedded in a nanopore.,We report on the fabrication and characterization of a DNA nanopore detector with integrated tunneling electrodes. Functional tunneling devices were identified by tunneling spectroscopy in different solvents and then used in proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating, for the first time, concurrent tunneling detection and ionic current detection of DNA molecules in a nanopore platform. This is an important step toward ultrafast DNA sequencing by tunneling.
20400691,24,2010,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Molecular bases of cyclodextrin adapter interactions with engineered protein nanopores.,Engineered protein pores have several potential applications in biotechnology: as sensor elements in stochastic detection and ultrarapid DNA sequencing, as nanoreactors to observe single-molecule chemistry, and in the construction of nano- and micro-devices. One important class of pores contains molecular adapters, which provide internal binding sites for small molecules. Mutants of the alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) pore that bind the adapter beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD) approximately 10(4) times more tightly than the wild type have been obtained. We now use single-channel electrical recording, protein engineering including unnatural amino acid mutagenesis, and high-resolution x-ray crystallography to provide definitive structural information on these engineered protein nanopores in unparalleled detail.
21138270,22,2010,J Am Chem Soc,Nanopore detection of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine in immobilized single-stranded DNA via adduct formation to the DNA damage site.,The ability to detect DNA damage within the context of the surrounding sequence is an important goal in medical diagnosis and therapies, but there are no satisfactory methods available to detect a damaged base while providing sequence information. One of the most common base lesions is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, which occurs during oxidation of guanine. In the work presented here, we demonstrate the detection of a single oxidative damage site using ion channel nanopore methods employing α-hemolysin. Hydantoin lesions produced from further oxidation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, as well as spirocyclic adducts produced from covalently attaching a primary amine to the spiroiminodihydantoin lesion, were detected by tethering the damaged DNA to streptavidin via a biotin linkage and capturing the DNA inside an α-hemolysin ion channel. Spirocyclic adducts, in both homo- and heteropolymer background single-stranded DNA sequences, produced current blockage levels differing by almost 10% from those of native base current blockage levels. These preliminary studies show the applicability of ion channel recordings not only for DNA sequencing, which has recently received much attention, but also for detecting DNA damage, which will be an important component to any sequencing efforts.
20704324,21,2010,Nano Lett,Nucleobase recognition in ssDNA at the central constriction of the alpha-hemolysin pore.,Nanopores are under investigation for single-molecule DNA sequencing. The alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) protein nanopore contains three recognition points capable of nucleobase discrimination in individual immobilized ssDNA molecules. We have modified the recognition point R(1) by extensive mutagenesis of residue 113. Amino acids that provide an energy barrier to ion flow (e.g., bulky or hydrophobic residues) strengthen base identification, while amino acids that lower the barrier weaken it. Amino acids with related side chains produce similar patterns of nucleobase recognition providing a rationale for the redesign of recognition points.
20722409,20,2010,Nano Lett,Detection of nucleic acids with graphene nanopores: ab initio characterization of a novel sequencing device.,We report an ab initio density functional theory study of the interaction of four nucleobases, cytosine, thymine, adenine, and guanine, with a novel graphene nanopore device for detecting the base sequence of a single-stranded nucleic acid (ssDNA or RNA). The nucleobases were inserted into a pore in a graphene nanoribbon, and the electrical current and conductance spectra were calculated as functions of voltage applied across the nanoribbon. The conductance spectra and charge densities were analyzed in the presence of each nucleobase in the graphene nanopore. The results indicate that due to significant differences in the conductance spectra the proposed device has adequate sensitivity to discriminate between different nucleotides. Moreover, we show that the nucleotide conductance spectrum is affected little by its orientation inside the graphene nanopore. The proposed technique may be extremely useful for real applications in developing ultrafast, low-cost DNA sequencing methods.
20627172,19,2010,Methods Enzymol,Analysis of single nucleic acid molecules with protein nanopores.,We describe the methods used in our laboratory for the analysis of single nucleic acid molecules with protein nanopores. The technical section is preceded by a review of the variety of experiments that can be done with protein nanopores. The end goal of much of this work is single-molecule DNA sequencing, although sequencing is not discussed explicitly here. The technical section covers the equipment required for nucleic acid analysis, the preparation and storage of the necessary materials, and aspects of signal processing and data analysis.
23335871,16,2010,Adv Funct Mater,DNA Sensing using Nano-crystalline Surface Enhanced Al(2)O(3) Nanopore Sensors.,A new solid-state, Al(2)O(3) nanopore sensor with enhanced surface properties for the real-time detection and analysis of individual DNA molecules is reported. Nanopore formation using electron beam based decomposition transformed the local nanostructure and morphology of the pore from an amorphous, stoichiometric structure (O to Al ratio of 1.5) to a hetero-phase crystalline network, deficient in O (O to Al ratio of ~0.6). Direct metallization of the pore region was observed during irradiation, thereby permitting the potential fabrication of nano-scale metallic contacts in the pore region with potential application to nanopore-based DNA sequencing. Dose dependent phase transformations to purely γ and/or α-phase nanocrystallites were also observed during pore formation allowing for surface charge engineering at the nanopore/fluid interface. DNA transport studies revealed an order of magnitude reduction in translocation velocities relative to alternate solid-state architectures, accredited to high surface charge density and the nucleation of charged nanocrystalline domains. The unique surface properties of Al(2)O(3) nanopore sensors makes them ideal for the detection and analysis of ssDNA, dsDNA, RNA secondary structures and small proteins. These nano-scale sensors may also serve as a useful tool in studying the mechanisms driving biological processes including DNA-protein interactions and enzyme activity at the single molecule level.
20808032,13,2010,Nanotechnology,Slowing the translocation of double-stranded DNA using a nanopore smaller than the double helix.,It is now possible to slow and trap a single molecule of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), by stretching it using a nanopore, smaller in diameter than the double helix, in a solid-state membrane. By applying an electric force larger than the threshold for stretching, dsDNA can be impelled through the pore. Once a current blockade associated with a translocating molecule is detected, the electric field in the pore is switched in an interval less than the translocation time to a value below the threshold for stretching. According to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this leaves the dsDNA stretched in the pore constriction with the base-pairs tilted, while the B-form canonical structure is preserved outside the pore. In this configuration, the translocation velocity is substantially reduced from 1 bp/10 ns to approximately 1 bp/2 ms in the extreme, potentially facilitating high fidelity reads for sequencing, precise sorting, and high resolution (force) spectroscopy.
20441749,12,2010,Biophys J,Urea facilitates the translocation of single-stranded DNA and RNA through the alpha-hemolysin nanopore.,The staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) protein nanopore is under investigation as a fast, cheap detector for nucleic acid analysis and sequencing. Although discrimination of all four bases of DNA by the alphaHL pore has been demonstrated, analysis of single-stranded DNAs and RNAs containing secondary structure mediated by basepairing is prevented because these nucleic acids cannot be translocated through the pore. Here, we show that a structured 95-nucleotide single-stranded DNA and its RNA equivalent are translocated through the alphaHL pore in the presence of 4 M urea, a concentration that denatures the secondary structure of the polynucleotides. The alphaHL pore is functional even in 7 M urea, and therefore it is easily stable enough for analyses of challenging DNA and RNA species.
20202812,10,2010,Curr Opin Biotechnol,Recent advances in single-molecule sequencing.,Recent advances in sequencing technologies exhibit a tendency towards single-molecule sequencing, which eventually will lead to the commercial implementation of such platforms. For this purpose dye labelling is currently the foundation of most approaches and an overview is provided on the latest developments. For label-free sequencing the detection of conductivity changes using nanopores or nano-edges will be discussed as well as another promising method that is based on Raman spectroscopy. Here the most recent advance aims to utilize the high lateral resolution of tip-enhanced Raman scattering. For this sequencing procedure Raman spectra must be collected along the DNA or RNA strand, while the difference spectra will provide a direct sequence reading without prior labelling.
20636036,7,2010,Annu Rev Anal Chem (Palo Alto Calif),Single-molecule DNA analysis.,The ability to detect single molecules of DNA or RNA has led to an extremely rich area of exploration of the single most important biomolecule in nature. In cases in which the nucleic acid molecules are tethered to a solid support, confined to a channel, or simply allowed to diffuse into a detection volume, novel techniques have been developed to manipulate the DNA and to examine properties such as structural dynamics and protein-DNA interactions. Beyond the analysis of the properties of nucleic acids themselves, single-molecule detection has enabled dramatic improvements in the throughput of DNA sequencing and holds promise for continuing progress. Both optical and nonoptical detection methods that use surfaces, nanopores, and zero-mode waveguides have been attempted, and one optically based instrument is already commercially available. The breadth of literature related to single-molecule DNA analysis is vast; this review focuses on a survey of efforts in molecular dynamics and nucleic acid sequencing.
20651807,6,2010,Nat Mater,DNA translocation through an array of kinked nanopores.,Synthetic solid-state nanopores are being intensively investigated as single-molecule sensors for detection and characterization of DNA, RNA and proteins. This field has been inspired by the exquisite selectivity and flux demonstrated by natural biological channels and the dream of emulating these behaviours in more robust synthetic materials that are more readily integrated into practical devices. So far, the guided etching of polymer films, focused ion-beam sculpting, and electron-beam lithography and tuning of silicon nitride membranes have emerged as three promising approaches to define synthetic solid-state pores with sub-nanometre resolution. These procedures have in common the formation of nominally cylindrical or conical pores aligned normal to the membrane surface. Here we report the formation of 'kinked' silica nanopores, using evaporation-induced self-assembly, and their further tuning and chemical derivatization using atomic-layer deposition. Compared with 'straight through' proteinaceous nanopores of comparable dimensions, kinked nanopores exhibit up to fivefold reduction in translocation velocity, which has been identified as one of the critical issues in DNA sequencing. Additionally, we demonstrate an efficient two-step approach to create a nanopore array exhibiting nearly perfect selectivity for ssDNA over dsDNA. We show that a coarse-grained drift-diffusion theory with a sawtooth-like potential can reasonably describe the velocity and translocation time of DNA through the pore. By control of pore size, length and shape, we capture the main functional behaviours of protein pores in our solid-state nanopore system.
21112309,5,2010,Biophys J,Distinguishable populations report on the interactions of single DNA molecules with solid-state nanopores.,Solid-state nanopores have received increasing interest over recent years because of their potential for genomic screening and sequencing. In particular, small nanopores (2-5 nm in diameter) allow the detection of local structure along biological molecules, such as proteins bound to DNA or possibly the secondary structure of RNA molecules. In a typical experiment, individual molecules are translocated through a single nanopore, thereby causing a small deviation in the ionic conductance. A correct interpretation of these conductance changes is essential for our understanding of the process of translocation, and for further sophistication of this technique. Here, we present translocation measurements of double-stranded DNA through nanopores down to the diameter of the DNA itself (1.8-7 nm at the narrowest constriction). In contrast to previous findings on such small nanopores, we find that single molecules interacting with these pores can cause three distinct levels of conductance blockades. We attribute the smallest conductance blockades to molecules that briefly skim the nanopore entrance without translocating, the intermediate level of conductance blockade to regular head-to-tail translocations, and the largest conductance blockades to obstruction of the nanopore entrance by one or multiple (duplex) DNA strands. Our measurements are an important step toward understanding the conductance blockade of biomolecules in such small nanopores, which will be essential for future applications involving solid-state nanopores.
20583820,4,2010,Nano Lett,Ionic memcapacitive effects in nanopores.,Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that, when subject to a periodic external electric field, a nanopore in ionic solution acts as a capacitor with memory (memcapacitor) at various frequencies and strengths of the electric field. Most importantly, the hysteresis loop of this memcapacitor shows both negative and diverging capacitance as a function of the voltage. The origin of this effect stems from the slow polarizability of the ionic solution due to the finite mobility of ions in water. We develop a microscopic quantitative model which captures the main features we observe in the simulations and suggest experimental tests of our predictions. We also suggest a possible memory mechanism due to the transport of ions through the nanopore itself, which may be observed at small frequencies. These effects may be important both in DNA sequencing proposals using nanopores and possibly in the dynamics of action potentials in neurons.
20804162,3,2010,Anal Chem,Field effect regulation of DNA translocation through a nanopore.,Field effect regulation of DNA nanoparticle translocation through a nanopore using a gate electrode is investigated using a continuum model, composed of the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for the ionic mass transport and the Navier-Stokes equations for the hydrodynamic field. The field effect regulation of the DNA translocation relies on the induced electroosmotic flow (EOF) and the particle-nanopore electrostatic interaction. When the electrical double layers (EDLs) formed adjacent to the DNA nanoparticle and the nanopore wall are overlapped, the particle-nanopore electrostatic interaction could dominate over the EOF effect, which enables the DNA trapping inside the nanopore when the applied electric field is relatively low. However, the particle-nanopore electrostatic interaction becomes negligible if the EDLs are not overlapped. When the applied electric field is relatively high, a negative gate potential can slow down the DNA translocation by an order of magnitude, compared to a floating gate electrode. The field effect control offers a more flexible and electrically compatible approach to regulate the DNA translocation through a nanopore for DNA sequencing.
21188971,2,2010,Anal Chem,Determining nanocapillary geometry from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using a variable topology network circuit model.,Solid-state nanopores and nanocapillaries find increasing use in a variety of applications including DNA sequencing, synthetic nanopores, next-generation membranes for water purification, and other nanofluidic structures. This paper develops the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to determine the geometry of nanocapillaries. A network equivalent circuit element is derived to include the effects of the capacitive double layer inside the nanocapillaries as well as the influence of varying nanocapillary radius. This variable topology function is similar to the finite Warburg impedance in certain limits. Analytical expressions for several different nanocapillary shapes are derived. The functions are evaluated to determine how the impedance signals will change with different nanocapillary aspect ratios and different degrees of constriction or inflation at the capillary center. Next, the complex impedance spectrum of a nanocapillary array membrane is measured at varying concentrations of electrolyte to separate the effects of nanocapillary double layer capacitance from those of nanocapillary geometry. The variable topology equivalent circuit element model of the nanocapillary is used in an equivalent circuit model that included contributions from the membrane and the measurement apparatus. The resulting values are consistent with the manufacturer's specified tolerances of the nanocapillary geometry. It is demonstrated that electrochemical impedance spectroscopy can be used as a tool for in situ determination of the geometry of nanocapillaries.
21073437,1,2010,Recent Pat DNA Gene Seq,Recent patents of nanopore DNA sequencing technology: progress and challenges.,DNA sequencing techniques witnessed fast development in the last decades, primarily driven by the Human Genome Project. Among the proposed new techniques, Nanopore was considered as a suitable candidate for the single DNA sequencing with ultrahigh speed and very low cost. Several fabrication and modification techniques have been developed to produce robust and well-defined nanopore devices. Many efforts have also been done to apply nanopore to analyze the properties of DNA molecules. By comparing with traditional sequencing techniques, nanopore has demonstrated its distinctive superiorities in main practical issues, such as sample preparation, sequencing speed, cost-effective and read-length. Although challenges still remain, recent researches in improving the capabilities of nanopore have shed a light to achieve its ultimate goal: Sequence individual DNA strand at single nucleotide level. This patent review briefly highlights recent developments and technological achievements for DNA analysis and sequencing at single molecule level, focusing on nanopore based methods.
20669216,1,2010,Chem Asian J,Peering into biological nanopore: a practical technology to single-molecule analysis.,As a unique technique at the singe-molecule level to explore the distribution and temporal order of events, nanopore technology has attracted increasing attention. In comparison to the previous applications in DNA sequencing, this Focus Review highlights the technical details of biological nanopores, especially alpha-hemolysin, in the analysis of peptides and proteins. The instrument configurations, experimental interferences, and data analysis including the conformation of peptides and proteins and their interactions for single-molecule detection are discussed.
20564464,1,2010,Wiley Interdiscip Rev Nanomed Nanobiotechnol,Molecular diagnostics for personal medicine using a nanopore.,Semiconductor nanotechnology has created the ultimate analytical tool: a nanopore with single molecule sensitivity. This tool offers the intriguing possibility of high-throughput, low cost sequencing of DNA with the absolute minimum of material and preprocessing. The exquisite single molecule sensitivity obviates the need for costly and error-prone procedures like polymerase chain reaction amplification. Instead, nanopore sequencing relies on the electric signal that develops when a DNA molecule translocates through a pore in a membrane. If each base pair has a characteristic electrical signature, then ostensibly a pore could be used to analyze the sequence by reporting all of the signatures in a single read without resorting to multiple DNA copies. The potential for a long read length combined with high translocation velocity should make resequencing inexpensive and allow for haplotyping and methylation profiling in a chromosome.
22121871,1,2010,Epigenomics,Bisulfite methylation profiling of large genomes.,Bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA differentiates cytosines from 5-methylcytosines and, thus, identifies DNA methylation patterns at the single-base level. Here, we review recent developments incorporating high-throughput sequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA for target-specific analyses and genome-wide mapping of plant and mammalian methylomes. These developments include the analysis of human embryonic stem cell and fetal fibroblast methylomes at single-base resolution, which supports the presence of non-CG DNA methylation in wild-type embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. New developments in nanopore sequencing technologies may lead to directly detecting 5-methylcytosine independently of bisulfite conversion, but the current accuracy of this approach remains a limitation. Furthermore, recent investigations detecting 5-hydroxymethylcytosine within mammalian DNA may add yet another level of complexity to the epigenetic code of the methylome.
21131989,0,2010,Nat Nanotechnol,Quantum steps to better sequencing.,
19350039,178,2009,Nat Nanotechnol,Continuous base identification for single-molecule nanopore DNA sequencing.,A single-molecule method for sequencing DNA that does not require fluorescent labelling could reduce costs and increase sequencing speeds. An exonuclease enzyme might be used to cleave individual nucleotide molecules from the DNA, and when coupled to an appropriate detection system, these nucleotides could be identified in the correct order. Here, we show that a protein nanopore with a covalently attached adapter molecule can continuously identify unlabelled nucleoside 5'-monophosphate molecules with accuracies averaging 99.8%. Methylated cytosine can also be distinguished from the four standard DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine. The operating conditions are compatible with the exonuclease, and the kinetic data show that the nucleotides have a high probability of translocation through the nanopore and, therefore, of not being registered twice. This highly accurate tool is suitable for integration into a system for sequencing nucleic acids and for analysing epigenetic modifications.
19246620,106,2009,Clin Chem,Next-generation sequencing: from basic research to diagnostics.,BACKGROUND: For the past 30 years, the Sanger method has been the dominant approach and gold standard for DNA sequencing. The commercial launch of the first massively parallel pyrosequencing platform in 2005 ushered in the new era of high-throughput genomic analysis now referred to as next-generation sequencing (NGS).CONTENT: This review describes fundamental principles of commercially available NGS platforms. Although the platforms differ in their engineering configurations and sequencing chemistries, they share a technical paradigm in that sequencing of spatially separated, clonally amplified DNA templates or single DNA molecules is performed in a flow cell in a massively parallel manner. Through iterative cycles of polymerase-mediated nucleotide extensions or, in one approach, through successive oligonucleotide ligations, sequence outputs in the range of hundreds of megabases to gigabases are now obtained routinely. Highlighted in this review are the impact of NGS on basic research, bioinformatics considerations, and translation of this technology into clinical diagnostics. Also presented is a view into future technologies, including real-time single-molecule DNA sequencing and nanopore-based sequencing.SUMMARY: In the relatively short time frame since 2005, NGS has fundamentally altered genomics research and allowed investigators to conduct experiments that were previously not technically feasible or affordable. The various technologies that constitute this new paradigm continue to evolve, and further improvements in technology robustness and process streamlining will pave the path for translation into clinical diagnostics.
19380741,67,2009,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Single-nucleotide discrimination in immobilized DNA oligonucleotides with a biological nanopore.,The sequencing of individual DNA strands with nanopores is under investigation as a rapid, low-cost platform in which bases are identified in order as the DNA strand is transported through a pore under an electrical potential. Although the preparation of solid-state nanopores is improving, biological nanopores, such as alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL), are advantageous because they can be precisely manipulated by genetic modification. Here, we show that the transmembrane beta-barrel of an engineered alphaHL pore contains 3 recognition sites that can be used to identify all 4 DNA bases in an immobilized single-stranded DNA molecule, whether they are located in an otherwise homopolymeric DNA strand or in a heteropolymeric strand. The additional steps required to enable nanopore DNA sequencing are outlined.
19893523,42,2009,Nat Nanotechnol,Translocation of double-stranded DNA through membrane-adapted phi29 motor protein nanopores.,Biological pores have been used to study the transport of DNA and other molecules, but most pores have channels that allow only the movement of small molecules and single-stranded DNA and RNA. The bacteriophage phi29 DNA-packaging motor, which allows double-stranded DNA to enter the virus during maturation and exit during an infection, contains a connector protein with a channel that is between 3.6 and 6 nm wide. Here we show that a modified version of this connector protein, when reconstituted into liposomes and inserted into planar lipid bilayers, allows the translocation of double-stranded DNA. The measured conductance of a single connector channel was 4.8 nS in 1 M KCl. This engineered and membrane-adapted phage connector is expected to have applications in microelectromechanical sensing, microreactors, gene delivery, drug loading and DNA sequencing.
19694456,31,2009,ACS Nano,Discrimination of single base substitutions in a DNA strand immobilized in a biological nanopore.,Nanopores have been explored as highly sensitive sensors for detection and rapid sequencing of single molecules of DNA. To sequence DNA with a nanopore requires that adenine (A), cytosine (C), thymine (T), and guanine (G) produce distinct current signals as they traverse the pore. Recently, we demonstrated that homopolymers of adenine, cytosine, and thymine immobilized in the nanopore protein alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) produced distinct current blockades dependent on their chemical orientation. To probe the detection limit of alphaHL, we examined immobilized single strands of T(40) DNA (polyT) with single base substitutions of A, C, and G at 12 positions on the strand occupying the stem region of alphaHL. We find blockade currents sensitive to base identity over most of these positions with the most sensitive region near the pore constriction. Adenine substitutions increase the measured blockade current to values intermediate to the polyT and polyA currents at a number of positions, while C substitutions increase the current to a level intermediate to polyT and polyC values in some positions, but decrease it below polyT in others. These changes in blockade current were also observed for G substitutions. These results indicate that total blockade currents measured in alphaHL arise from nucleotides at multiple locations and thus are not uniquely attributable to an individual base in a specific position, a finding consistent with a recently published study. The measurements of C and G substitutions also suggest that blockade current may be modulated through interactions between nucleotides and the pore interior at multiple sites in alphaHL.
19167307,25,2009,Biophys J,Microscopic mechanics of hairpin DNA translocation through synthetic nanopores.,Nanoscale pores have proved useful as a means to assay DNA and are actively being developed as the basis of genome sequencing methods. Hairpin DNA (hpDNA), having both double-helical and overhanging coil portions, can be trapped in a nanopore, giving ample time to execute a sequence measurement. In this article, we provide a detailed account of hpDNA interaction with a synthetic nanopore obtained through extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. For synthetic pores with minimum diameters from 1.3 to 2.2 nm, we find that hpDNA can translocate by three modes: unzipping of the double helix and--in two distinct orientations--stretching/distortion of the double helix. Furthermore, each of these modes can be selected by an appropriate choice of the pore size and voltage applied transverse to the membrane. We demonstrate that the presence of hpDNA can dramatically alter the distribution of ions within the pore, substantially affecting the ionic current through it. In experiments and simulations, the ionic current relative to that in the absence of DNA can drop below 10% and rise beyond 200%. Simulations associate the former with the double helix occupying the constriction and the latter with accumulation of DNA that has passed through the constriction.
19645477,16,2009,Nano Lett,DNA strands from denatured duplexes are translocated through engineered protein nanopores at alkaline pH.,Nanopores are under development for the detection of a variety of analytes and the investigation of chemical reactions at the single molecule level. In particular, the analysis of nucleic acid molecules is under intense investigation, including the development of systems for rapid, low-cost DNA sequencing. Here, we show that DNA can be translocated through an engineered alphaHL protein pore at pH 11.7, a value at which dsDNA is denatured. Therefore, the alphaHL pore is sufficiently stable to entertain the possibility of direct nanopore sequencing of genomic dsDNA samples, which are more readily obtained and handled than ssDNA.
19138164,16,2009,Langmuir,Controlling the translocation of single-stranded DNA through alpha-hemolysin ion channels using viscosity.,Translocation of single-stranded DNA through alpha-hemolysin (alpha-HL) channels is investigated in glycerol/water mixtures containing 1 M KCl. Experiments using glass nanopore membranes as the lipid bilayer support demonstrate that the translocation velocities of poly(deoxyadenylic acid), poly(deoxycytidylic acid), and poly(deoxythymidylic acid) 50-mers are decreased by a factor of approximately 20 in a 63/37 (vol %) glycerol/water mixture, relative to aqueous solutions. The ion conductance of alpha-HL and the entry rate of the polynucleotides into the protein channel also decrease with increasing viscosity. Precise control of translocation parameters by adjusting viscosity provides a potential means to improve sequencing methods based on ion channel recordings.
19368382,14,2009,J Am Chem Soc,Real-time monitoring of peptide cleavage using a nanopore probe.,Here we report a rapid, label-free method for monitoring peptide cleavage. Monitoring peptide translocation through an engineered ion channel in the absence and the presence of an enzyme allowed quantitative chemical kinetics information on enzymatic processes to be obtained. In addition to its potential application in disease diagnostics and drug discovery, this peptide/protein cleavage approach is envisioned for further development as a novel rapid, label-free protein sequencing technique.
19584949,13,2009,Sens Actuators B Chem,Nanopore with Transverse Nanoelectrodes for Electrical Characterization and Sequencing of DNA.,A DNA sequencing device which integrates transverse conducting electrodes for the measurement of electrode currents during DNA translocation through a nanopore has been nanofabricated and characterized. A focused electron beam (FEB) milling technique, capable of creating features on the order of 1 nm in diameter, was used to create the nanopore. The device was characterized electrically using gold nanoparticles as an artificial analyte with both DC and AC measurement methods. Single nanoparticle/electrode interaction events were recorded. A low-noise, high-speed transimpedance current amplifier for the detection of nano to picoampere currents at microsecond time scales was designed, fabricated and tested for future integration with the nanopore device.
19736966,10,2009,J Phys Chem B,Slowing DNA translocation through nanopores using a solution containing organic salts.,One of the key challenges to nanopore DNA sequencing is to slow down DNA translocation. Here, we report that the translocation velocities of various DNA homo- and copolymers through protein pores could be significantly decreased by using electrolyte solutions containing organic salts. Using a butylmethylimidazolium chloride (BMIM-Cl) solution instead of the commonly used KCl solution, DNA translocation rates on the order of hundreds of microseconds per nucleotide base were achieved. The much enhanced resolution of the nanopore coupled with different event blockage amplitudes produced by different nucleotides permits the convenient differentiation between various DNA molecules.
19804730,8,2009,Biophys J,Effect of noise on DNA sequencing via transverse electronic transport.,Previous theoretical studies have shown that measuring the transverse current across DNA strands while they translocate through a nanopore or channel may provide a statistically distinguishable signature of the DNA bases, and may thus allow for rapid DNA sequencing. However, fluctuations of the environment, such as ionic and DNA motion, introduce important scattering processes that may affect the viability of this approach to sequencing. To understand this issue, we have analyzed a simple model that captures the role of this complex environment in electronic dephasing and its ability to remove charge carriers from current-carrying states. We find that these effects do not strongly influence the current distributions due to the off-resonant nature of tunneling through the nucleotides--a result we expect to be a common feature of transport in molecular junctions. In particular, only large scattering strengths, as compared to the energetic gap between the molecular states and the Fermi level, significantly alter the form of the current distributions. Since this gap itself is quite large, the current distributions remain protected from this type of noise, further supporting the possibility of using transverse electronic transport measurements for DNA sequencing.
19517496,8,2009,Electrophoresis,DNA sequencing by CE.,Sequencing of human and other genomes has been at the center of interest in the biomedical field over the past several decades and is now leading toward an era of personalized medicine. During this time, DNA-sequencing methods have evolved from the labor-intensive slab gel electrophoresis, through automated multiCE systems using fluorophore labeling with multispectral imaging, to the &quot;next-generation&quot; technologies of cyclic-array, hybridization based, nanopore and single molecule sequencing. Deciphering the genetic blueprint and follow-up confirmatory sequencing of Homo sapiens and other genomes were only possible with the advent of modern sequencing technologies that were a result of step-by-step advances with a contribution of academics, medical personnel and instrument companies. While next-generation sequencing is moving ahead at breakneck speed, the multicapillary electrophoretic systems played an essential role in the sequencing of the Human Genome, the foundation of the field of genomics. In this prospective, we wish to overview the role of CE in DNA sequencing based in part of several of our articles in this journal.
19435350,6,2009,J Am Chem Soc,A biomimetic potassium responsive nanochannel: G-quadruplex DNA conformational switching in a synthetic nanopore.,Potassium is especially crucial in modulating the activity of muscles and nerves whose cells have specialized ion channels for transporting potassium. Normal body function extremely depends on the regulation of potassium concentrations inside the ion channels within a certain range. For life science, undoubtedly, it is significant and challenging to study and imitate these processes happening in living organisms with a convenient artificial system. Here we report a novel biomimetic nanochannel system which has an ion concentration effect that provides a nonlinear response to potassium ion at the concentration ranging from 0 to 1500 microM. This new phenomenon is caused by the G-quadruplex DNA conformational change with a positive correlation with ion concentration. In this work, G-quadruplex DNA was immobilized onto a synthetic nanopore, which undergoes a potassium-responsive conformational change and then induces the change in the effective pore size. The responsive ability of this system can be regulated by the stability of G-quadruplex structure through adjusting potassium concentration. The situation of the grafting G-quadruplex DNA on a single nanopore can closely imitate the in vivo condition because the G-rich telomere overhang is attached to the chromosome. Therefore, this artificial system could promote a potential to conveniently study biomolecule conformational change in confined space by the current measurement, which is significantly different from the nanopore sequencing. Moreover, such a system may also potentially spark further experimental and theoretical efforts to simulate the process of ion transport in living organisms and can be further generalized to other more complicated functional molecules for the exploitation of novel bioinspired intelligent nanopore machines.
19792463,5,2009,Phys Rev Lett,Quantized ionic conductance in nanopores.,Ionic transport in nanopores is a fundamentally and technologically important problem in view of its occurrence in biological processes and its impact on novel DNA sequencing applications. Using molecular dynamics simulations we show that ion transport may exhibit strong nonlinearities as a function of the pore radius reminiscent of the conductance quantization steps as a function of the transverse cross section of quantum point contacts. In the present case, however, conductance steps originate from the break up of the hydration layers that form around ions in aqueous solution. We discuss this phenomenon and the conditions under which it should be experimentally observable.
19624217,5,2009,J Chem Phys,Enhancement of charged macromolecule capture by nanopores in a salt gradient.,Nanopores spanning synthetic membranes have been used as key components in proof-of-principle nanofluidic applications, particularly those involving manipulation of biomolecules or sequencing of DNA. The only practical way of manipulating charged macromolecules near nanopores is through a voltage difference applied across the nanopore-spanning membrane. However, recent experiments have shown that salt concentration gradients applied across nanopores can also dramatically enhance charged particle capture from a low concentration reservoir of charged molecules at one end of the nanopore. This puzzling effect has hitherto eluded a physically consistent theoretical explanation. Here, we propose an electrokinetic mechanism of this enhanced capture that relies on the electrostatic potential near the pore mouth. For long pores with diameter much greater than the local screening length, we obtain accurate analytic expressions showing how salt gradients control the local conductivity which can lead to increased local electrostatic potentials and charged analyte capture rates. We also find that the attractive electrostatic potential may be balanced by an outward, repulsive electro-osmotic flow that can in certain cases conspire with the salt gradient to further enhance the analyte capture rate.
19768589,1,2009,Methods Mol Biol,Scanning probe and nanopore DNA sequencing: core techniques and possibilities.,We provide an overview of the current state of research towards DNA sequencing using nanopore and scanning probe techniques. Additionally, we provide methods for the creation of two key experimental platforms for studies relating to nanopore and scanning probe DNA studies: a synthetic nanopore apparatus and an atomically flat conductive substrate with stretched DNA molecules.
19420436,1,2009,Nanotechnology,Shrinking solid-state nanopores using electron-beam-induced deposition.,Solid-state nanopores of only a few nanometres in size show a great potential for applications such as molecule detection and DNA sequencing. In most cases, the fabrication of such a nanopore requires the high energy beam of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) or focused ion beam (FIB) tool to drill or reshape a small hole in a freestanding membrane. Here, we present a novel method to reduce the size of existing nanopores using electron-beam-induced deposition (EBID) of carbon in a conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM). The existing nanopores are etched in a silicon membrane using anisotropic wet etching and can be shrunk down to a few nanometres using EBID. This paper discusses the parameters that influence the rate of shrinking and provides an insight into the underlying mechanism.
19326157,1,2009,Eur Phys J E Soft Matter,Polymer translocation in a double-force arrangement.,Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we investigate the translocation dynamics of an externally driven polymer chain through a nanopore, where a pulling force F is exerted on the first monomer whilst there is an opposing force F(E) &lt; F within the pore. Such a double-force arrangement has been proposed recently to allow better dynamical control of the translocation process in order to sequence biopolymers. We find that in the double-force arrangement translocation becomes slower as compared to the case under a single monomer pulling force of magnitude F-F(E), but scaling of the translocation time as a function of the chain length tau approximately N2 does not change. The waiting time tau(m) for monomer m to exit the pore is found to be a monotonically increasing function of the bead number almost until m approximately N , which indicates relatively well-defined slowing down and control of the chain velocity during translocation. We also study the waiting time distributions for the beads in the chain, and characterize in detail fluctuations in the bead positions and their transverse position coordinates during translocation. These data should be useful in estimating position-dependent sequencing errors in double-force experiments.
19943114,0,2009,Biomed Microdevices,DNA nanowire translocation phenomena in nanopores.,One recent application of nanopores is to use them as detectors and analyzers for fast DNA sequencing. To better understand the DNA electrokinetic transport through a nanopore, a hydrodynamic model is developed to investigate the flow field, the resistive forces acting on the DNA, the DNA velocity and the ionic current through the nanopore. The numerical results reveal the relation between the DNA velocity and various parameters such as nanopore surface charge and solution concentration. The model is validated by comparing the numerical results with the experimental data for both DNA velocity and ionic current through the nanopore.
18846088,295,2008,Nat Biotechnol,The potential and challenges of nanopore sequencing.,A nanopore-based device provides single-molecule detection and analytical capabilities that are achieved by electrophoretically driving molecules in solution through a nano-scale pore. The nanopore provides a highly confined space within which single nucleic acid polymers can be analyzed at high throughput by one of a variety of means, and the perfect processivity that can be enforced in a narrow pore ensures that the native order of the nucleobases in a polynucleotide is reflected in the sequence of signals that is detected. Kilobase length polymers (single-stranded genomic DNA or RNA) or small molecules (e.g., nucleosides) can be identified and characterized without amplification or labeling, a unique analytical capability that makes inexpensive, rapid DNA sequencing a possibility. Further research and development to overcome current challenges to nanopore identification of each successive nucleotide in a DNA strand offers the prospect of 'third generation' instruments that will sequence a diploid mammalian genome for approximately $1,000 in approximately 24 h.
18708467,59,2008,Biophys J,DNA translocation governed by interactions with solid-state nanopores.,We investigate the voltage-driven translocation dynamics of individual DNA molecules through solid-state nanopores in the diameter range 2.7-5 nm. Our studies reveal an order of magnitude increase in the translocation times when the pore diameter is decreased from 5 to 2.7 nm, and steep temperature dependence, nearly threefold larger than would be expected if the dynamics were governed by viscous drag. As previously predicted for an interaction-dominated translocation process, we observe exponential voltage dependence on translocation times. Mean translocation times scale with DNA length by two power laws: for short DNA molecules, in the range 150-3500 bp, we find an exponent of 1.40, whereas for longer molecules, an exponent of 2.28 dominates. Surprisingly, we find a transition in the fraction of ion current blocked by DNA, from a length-independent regime for short DNA molecules to a regime where the longer the DNA, the more current is blocked. Temperature dependence studies reveal that for increasing DNA lengths, additional interactions are responsible for the slower DNA dynamics. Our results can be rationalized by considering DNA/pore interactions as the predominant factor determining DNA translocation dynamics in small pores. These interactions markedly slow down the translocation rate, enabling higher temporal resolution than observed with larger pores. These findings shed light on the transport properties of DNA in small pores, relevant for future nanopore applications, such as DNA sequencing and genotyping.
18166054,57,2008,J Am Chem Soc,A single-molecule nanopore device detects DNA polymerase activity with single-nucleotide resolution.,The ability to monitor DNA polymerase activity with single-nucleotide resolution has been the cornerstone of a number of advanced single-molecule DNA sequencing concepts. Toward this goal, we report the first observation of the base-by-base DNA polymerase activity with single-base resolution at the single-molecule level. We describe the design and characterization of a supramolecular nanopore device capable of detecting up to nine consecutive DNA polymerase-catalyzed single-nucleotide primer extensions with high sensitivity and spatial resolution (&lt;or=2.4 A). The device is assembled in a suspended lipid membrane by threading and mechanically capturing a single strand of DNA-PEG copolymer inside an alpha-hemolysin protein pore. Single-nucleotide primer extensions result in successive displacements of the template DNA strand within the protein pore, which can be monitored by the corresponding stepped changes in the ion current flowing through the pore under an applied transmembrane potential. The system described thus represents a promising advance toward nanopore-mediated single-molecule DNA sequencing concept and, in addition, might be applicable to studying a number of other biopolymer-protein interactions and dynamics.
19098105,56,2008,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Single-molecule DNA detection with an engineered MspA protein nanopore.,Nanopores hold great promise as single-molecule analytical devices and biophysical model systems because the ionic current blockades they produce contain information about the identity, concentration, structure, and dynamics of target molecules. The porin MspA of Mycobacterium smegmatis has remarkable stability against environmental stresses and can be rationally modified based on its crystal structure. Further, MspA has a short and narrow channel constriction that is promising for DNA sequencing because it may enable improved characterization of short segments of a ssDNA molecule that is threaded through the pore. By eliminating the negative charge in the channel constriction, we designed and constructed an MspA mutant capable of electronically detecting and characterizing single molecules of ssDNA as they are electrophoretically driven through the pore. A second mutant with additional exchanges of negatively-charged residues for positively-charged residues in the vestibule region exhibited a factor of approximately 20 higher interaction rates, required only half as much voltage to observe interaction, and allowed ssDNA to reside in the vestibule approximately 100 times longer than the first mutant. Our results introduce MspA as a nanopore for nucleic acid analysis and highlight its potential as an engineerable platform for single-molecule detection and characterization applications.
18654270,42,2008,Nat Nanotechnol,Solid-state nanopore channels with DNA selectivity.,Solid-state nanopores have emerged as possible candidates for next-generation DNA sequencing devices. In such a device, the DNA sequence would be determined by measuring how the forces on the DNA molecules, and also the ion currents through the nanopore, change as the molecules pass through the nanopore. Unlike their biological counterparts, solid-state nanopores have the advantage that they can withstand a wide range of analyte solutions and environments. Here we report solid-state nanopore channels that are selective towards single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Nanopores functionalized with a 'probe' of hair-pin loop DNA can, under an applied electrical field, selectively transport short lengths of 'target' ssDNA that are complementary to the probe. Even a single base mismatch between the probe and the target results in longer translocation pulses and a significantly reduced number of translocation events. Our single-molecule measurements allow us to measure separately the molecular flux and the pulse duration, providing a tool to gain fundamental insight into the channel-molecule interactions. The results can be explained in the conceptual framework of diffusive molecular transport with particle-channel interactions.
18654430,35,2008,Nat Nanotechnol,Recapturing and trapping single molecules with a solid-state nanopore.,The development of solid-state nanopores, inspired by their biological counterparts, shows great potential for the study of single macromolecules. Applications such as DNA sequencing and the exploration of protein folding require control of the dynamics of the molecule's interaction with the pore, but DNA capture by a solid-state nanopore is not well understood. By recapturing individual molecules soon after they pass through a nanopore, we reveal the mechanism by which double-stranded DNA enters the pore. The observed recapture rates and times agree with solutions of a drift-diffusion model. Electric forces draw DNA to the pore over micrometer-scale distances, and upon arrival at the pore, molecules begin translocation almost immediately. Repeated translocation of the same molecule improves measurement accuracy, offers a way to probe the chemical transformations and internal dynamics of macromolecules on sub-millisecond time and sub-micrometre length scales, and demonstrates the ability to trap, study and manipulate individual macromolecules in solution.
18698831,29,2008,Nano Lett,Nucleotide identification and orientation discrimination of DNA homopolymers immobilized in a protein nanopore.,Nanopores have been used as extremely sensitive resistive pulse sensors to detect analytes at the molecular level. There has been interest in using such a scheme to rapidly and inexpensively sequence single molecules of DNA. To establish reference current levels for adenine, cytosine, and thymine nucleotides, we measured the blockage currents following immobilization of single-stranded DNA polyadenine, polycytosine, and polythymine within a protein nanopore in chemical orientations in which either the 3' or the 5' end enters the pore. Immobilization resulted in low-noise measurements, yielding sharply defined current distributions for each base that enabled clear discrimination of the nucleotides in both orientations. In addition, we find that not only is the blockage current for each polyhomonucleotide orientation dependent, but also the changes in orientation affect the blockage currents for each base differently. This dependence can affect the ability to resolve polyadenine and polythymine; with the 5' end entering the pore, the separation between polyadenine and polythymine is double that observed for the 3' orientation. This suggests that, for better resolution, DNA should be threaded through the 5' end first in nanopore DNA sequencing experiments.
18759490,26,2008,Nano Lett,Electromechanical unzipping of individual DNA molecules using synthetic sub-2 nm pores.,Nanopores have recently emerged as high-throughput tools for probing and manipulating nucleic acid secondary structure at the single-molecule level. While most studies to date have utilized protein pores embedded in lipid bilayers, solid-state nanopores offer many practical advantages which greatly expand the range of applications in life sciences and biotechnology. Using sub-2 nm solid-state nanopores, we show for the first time that the unzipping kinetics of individual DNA duplexes can be probed by analyzing the dwell-time distributions. We performed high-bandwidth electrical measurements of DNA duplex unzipping as a function of their length, sequence, and temperature. We find that our longer duplexes (&gt;10 bp) follow Arrhenius dependence on temperature, suggesting that unzipping can be approximated as a single-barrier crossing, but the unzipping kinetics of shorter duplexes do not involve a barrier, due to the strong biasing electrical force. Finally, we show that mismatches in the duplex affect unzipping times in a position-sensitive manner. Our results are a crucial step toward sequence variability detection and our single-molecule nanopore sequencing technology, which rely on parallel detection from nanopore arrays.
18231983,13,2008,Curr Protoc Mol Biol,Overview of DNA sequencing strategies.,Efficient and cost-effective DNA sequencing technologies have been, and may continue to be, critical to the progress of molecular biology. This overview of DNA sequencing strategies provides a high-level review of six distinct approaches to DNA sequencing: (a) dideoxy sequencing; (b) cyclic array sequencing; (c) sequencing-by-hybridization; (d) microelectrophoresis; (e) mass spectrometry; and (f) nanopore sequencing. The primary focus is on dideoxy sequencing, which has been the dominant technology since 1977, and on cyclic array strategies, for which several competitive implementations have been developed since 2005. Because the field of DNA sequencing is changing rapidly, this unit represents a snapshot of this particular moment.
21709726,6,2008,Recent Pat Biomed Eng,Recent Patents and Advances in the Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies.,We are now witnessing a new genomic revolution due to the arrival and continued advancements in the next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies, which encompass sequencing by synthesis including fluorescent in situ sequencing (FISSEQ) and pyrosequencing, sequencing by ligation including using polony amplification and supported oligonucleotide detection (SOLiD), sequencing by hybridization in combination with sequencing-by-ligation and nanopore technology, nanopore sequencing and other novel sequencing technologies using nano-transistor array, scanning tunneling microscopy and nanowire molecule sensors etc. We review here major technologies and recent patents for achieving high-throughput, ultra-fast, extremely cheap, and highly accurate sequencing. We will see enormous impacts of these next-generation sequencing methods for solving complex biological problems and for ushering in the practice of personalized medicine.
18215086,4,2008,BioDrugs,Convergence of nanotechnology and cardiovascular medicine : progress and emerging prospects.,Advances in the emergence of biological probes, materials, and analytical tools limited to the nanoscale size range, collectively referred to as 'nanotechnology', are increasingly being applied to the understanding and treatment of the major pathophysiological problems in cardiovascular medicine. Analytical techniques based on high-resolution microscopy and molecular-level fluorescence excitation processes capable of detecting nanoscale interactions have been used to elucidate cardiovascular pathology. Nanotechnology has also significantly impacted diagnostic intervention in cardiology, with the use of nanoparticles as contrast agents, for targeted biomedical imaging of vulnerable plaques, for detection of specific pathologic targets signaling the onset of atherosclerosis, and for tracking inflammatory events. Real-time nanoscale biosensors can be used to measure cardiovascular biomarkers, and nanopore sequencing has the potential to speed up the analysis of gene expression in cardiovascular disease. Potential therapeutic applications include the use of nanomaterials in cardiovascular devices, for delivery of drugs and bioactive molecules, or in novel technologies for reducing cholesterol accumulation and for dissolving clots.
18793458,3,2008,BMC Bioinformatics,Clustering ionic flow blockade toggles with a mixture of HMMs.,BACKGROUND: Ionic current blockade signal processing, for use in nanopore detection, offers a promising new way to analyze single molecule properties with potential implications for DNA sequencing. The alpha-Hemolysin transmembrane channel interacts with a translocating molecule in a nontrivial way, frequently evidenced by a complex ionic flow blockade pattern with readily distinguishable modes of toggling. Effective processing of such signals requires developing machine learning methods capable of learning the various blockade modes for classification and knowledge discovery purposes. Here we propose a method aimed to improve our stochastic analysis capabilities to better understand the discriminatory capabilities of the observed the nanopore channel interactions with analyte.RESULTS: We tailored our memory-sparse distributed implementation of a Mixture of Hidden Markov Models (MHMMs) to the problem of channel current blockade clustering and associated analyte classification. By using probabilistic fully connected HMM profiles as mixture components we were able to cluster the various 9 base-pair hairpin channel blockades. We obtained very high Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) classification with a mixture of 12 different channel blockade profiles, each with 4 levels, a configuration that can be computed with sufficient speed for real-time experimental feedback. MAP classification performance depends on several factors such as the number of mixture components, the number of levels in each profile, and the duration of a channel blockade event. We distribute Baum-Welch Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms running on our model in two ways. A distributed implementation of the MHMM data processing accelerates data clustering efforts. The second, simultanteous, strategy uses an EM checkpointing algorithm to lower the memory use and efficiently distribute the bulk of EM processing in processing large data sequences (such as for the progressive sums used in the HMM parameter estimates).CONCLUSION: The proposed distributed MHMM method has many appealing properties, such as precise classification of analyte in real-time scenarios, and the ability to incorporate new domain knowledge into a flexible, easily distributable, architecture. The distributed HMM provides a feature extraction that is equivalent to that of the sequential HMM with a speedup factor approximately equal to the number of independent CPUs operating on the data. The MHMM topology learns clusters existing within data samples via distributed HMM EM learning. A Java implementation of the MHMM algorithm is available at http://logos.cs.uno.edu/~achurban.
18680093,2,2008,Small,An AFM/rotaxane molecular reading head for sequence-dependent DNA structures.,DNA secondary structure may prove to be a significant obstacle both for enzymes that process DNA through an orifice and for the passage of DNA through nanopores proposed for some novel sequencing schemes. A nanomechanical molecular &quot;tape reader&quot; is assembled by threading a nanopore over DNA and pulling it using an atomic force microscope. Its formation is confirmed by studying the force required to open hairpins under that geometry. Unfolding induced by this 0.7-nm-diameter aperture requires 40 times more force than that reported for pulling on the ends of the DNA. Kinetic analysis shows that much less strain is required to destabilize the double helix in this geometry. Consequently, much more force is required to provide the free energy needed for opening.
18069865,28,2007,Nano Lett,Detection of DNA sequences using an alternating electric field in a nanopore capacitor.,Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that back-and-forth motion of DNA strands through a 1 nm diameter pore exhibits sequence-specific hysteresis that arises from the reorientation of the DNA bases in the nanopore constriction. Such hysteresis of the DNA motion results in detectable changes of the electrostatic potential at the electrodes of the nanopore capacitor and in a sequence-specific drift of the DNA strand under an oscillating transmembrane bias. A strategy is suggested for sequencing DNA in a nanopore using the electric field that alternates periodically in time.
17716132,25,2007,Nanomedicine (Lond),Nanopore-based single-molecule DNA analysis.,Nanopore-based DNA analysis is a single-molecule technique with revolutionary potential. It promises to carry out a range of analyses, orders of magnitude faster than current methods, including length measurement, specific sequence detection, single-molecule dynamics and even de novo sequencing. The concept involves using an applied voltage to drive DNA molecules through a narrow pore that separates chambers of electrolyte solution. This voltage also drives a flow of electrolyte ions through the pore, measured as an electric current. When molecules pass through the pore, they block the flow of ions and, thus, their structure and length can be determined based on the degree and duration of the resulting current reductions. In this review, I explain the nanopore-based DNA analysis concept and briefly explore its historical foundations, before discussing and summarizing all experimental results reported to date. I conclude with a summary of the obstacles that must be overcome for it to realize its promised potential.
17526560,21,2007,Biophys J,Influence of the environment and probes on rapid DNA sequencing via transverse electronic transport.,We study theoretically the feasibility of using transverse electronic transport within a nanopore for rapid DNA sequencing. Specifically, we examine the effects of the environment and detection probes on the distinguishability of the DNA bases. We find that the intrinsic measurement bandwidth of the electrodes helps the detection of single bases by averaging over the current distributions of each base. We also find that although the overall magnitude of the current may change dramatically with different detection conditions, the intrinsic distinguishability of the bases is not significantly affected by pore size and transverse field strength. The latter is the result of very effective stabilization of the DNA by the transverse field induced by the probes, so long as that field is much larger than the field that drives DNA through the pore. In addition, the ions and water together effectively screen the charge on the nucleotides, so that the electron states participating in the transport properties of the latter ones resemble those of the uncharged species. Finally, water in the environment has negligible direct influence on the transverse electrical current.
18047341,18,2007,J Am Chem Soc,Protein nanopores with covalently attached molecular adapters.,Molecular adapters are crucial for the stochastic sensing of organic analytes with alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) protein nanopores when direct interactions between analytes and the pore cannot readily be arranged by conventional protein engineering. In our earlier studies, cyclodextrin adapters were lodged noncovalently within the lumen of the alphaHL pore. In the present work, we have realized the controlled covalent attachment of a beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD) adapter in the two possible molecular orientations inside alphaHL pores prepared by genetic engineering. There are two advantages to such a covalent system. First, the adapter cannot dissociate, which means there are no gaps during stochastic detection, a crucial advance for single-molecule exonuclease DNA sequencing where the continuous presence of a molecular adapter will be essential for reading individual nucleotides. Second, the ability to orient the adapter allows analytes to bind through only one of the two entrances to the betaCD cavity. We demonstrate that the covalently attached adapters can be used to alter the ion selectivity of the alphaHL pore, examine binding events at elevated temperatures, and detect analytes with prolonged dwell times.
17705552,18,2007,Nano Lett,Controlling DNA capture and propagation through artificial nanopores.,Electrophorescing biopolymers across nanopores modulates the ionic current through the pore, revealing the polymer's diameter, length, and conformation. The rapidity of polymer translocation ( approximately 30,000 bp/ms) in this geometry greatly limits the information that can be obtained for each base. Here we show that the translocation speed of lambda-DNA through artificial nanopores can be reduced using optical tweezers. DNAs coupled to optically trapped beads were presented to nanopores. DNAs initially placed up to several micrometers from the pore could be captured. Subsequently, the optical tweezers reduced translocation speeds to 150 bp/ms, about 200-fold slower than free DNA. Moreover, the optical tweezers allowed us to &quot;floss&quot; single polymers back and forth through the pore. The combination of controlled sample presentation, greatly slowed translocation speeds, and repeated electrophoresis of single DNAs removes several barriers to using artificial nanopores for sequencing, haplotyping, and characterization of protein-DNA interactions.
17890440,17,2007,Clin Chem,Progress toward ultrafast DNA sequencing using solid-state nanopores.,BACKGROUND: Measurements of the ionic current flowing through nanometer-scale pores (nanopores) have been used to analyze single DNA and RNA molecules, with the ultimate goal of achieving ultrafast DNA sequencing. However, attempts at purely electronic measurements have not achieved the signal contrast required for single nucleotide differentiation. In this report we propose a novel method of optical detection of DNA sequence translocating through a nanopore.METHODS: Each base of the target DNA sequence is 1st mapped onto a 2-unit code, 2 10-bp nucleotide sequence, by biochemical conversion into Designed DNA Polymers. These 2-unit codes are then hybridized to complementary, fluorescently labeled, and self-quenching molecular beacons. As the molecular beacons are sequentially unzipped during translocation through a &lt;2-nm-wide nanopore, their fluorescent tags are unquenched and are detected by a custom-built dual-color total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. The 2-color optical signal is then correlated to the target DNA sequence.RESULTS: A dual-color TIRFM microscope with single-molecule resolution was constructed, and controlled fabrication of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional arrays of solid-state nanopores was performed. A nanofluidic cell assembly was constructed for TIRF-based optical detection of voltage-driven DNA translocation through a nanopore.CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel nanopore-based DNA sequencing technique that uses an optical readout of DNA translocating unzipping through a nanopore. Our technique offers better single nucleotide differentiation in sequence readout, as well as the possibility of large-scale parallelism using nanopore arrays.
17320228,11,2007,Trends Biotechnol,Nanopore sequencing technology: nanopore preparations.,For the past decade, nanometer-scale pores have been developed as a powerful technique for sensing biological macromolecules. Various potential applications using these nanopores have been reported at the proof-of-principle stage, with the eventual aim of using them as an alternative to de novo DNA sequencing. Currently, there have been two general approaches to prepare nanopores for nucleic acid analysis: organic nanopores, such as alpha-hemolysin pores, are commonly used for DNA analysis, whereas synthetic solid-state nanopores have also been developed using various conventional and non-conventional fabrication techniques. In particular, synthetic nanopores with pore sizes smaller than the alpha-hemolysin pores have been prepared, primarily by electron-beam-assisted techniques: these are more robust and have better dimensional adjustability. This review will examine current methods of nanopore preparation, ranging from organic pore preparations to recent developments in synthetic nanopore fabrications.
18047713,8,2007,BMC Bioinformatics,Duration learning for analysis of nanopore ionic current blockades.,BACKGROUND: Ionic current blockade signal processing, for use in nanopore detection, offers a promising new way to analyze single molecule properties, with potential implications for DNA sequencing. The alpha-Hemolysin transmembrane channel interacts with a translocating molecule in a nontrivial way, frequently evidenced by a complex ionic flow blockade pattern. Typically, recorded current blockade signals have several levels of blockade, with various durations, all obeying a fixed statistical profile for a given molecule. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based duration learning experiments on artificial two-level Gaussian blockade signals helped us to identify proper modeling framework. We then apply our framework to the real multi-level DNA hairpin blockade signal.RESULTS: The identified upper level blockade state is observed with durations that are geometrically distributed (consistent with an a physical decay process for remaining in any given state). We show that mixture of convolution chains of geometrically distributed states is better for presenting multimodal long-tailed duration phenomena. Based on learned HMM profiles we are able to classify 9 base-pair DNA hairpins with accuracy up to 99.5% on signals from same-day experiments.CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated several implementations for de novo estimation of duration distribution probability density function with HMM framework and applied our model topology to the real data. The proposed design could be handy in molecular analysis based on nanopore current blockade signal.
17460792,4,2007,Mol Biosyst,Analytical nanobiotechnology for medicine diagnostics.,The review is concerned with the state-of-the-art and the prospects of development of nanotechnologies in clinical proteomics. Nanotechnology in clinical proteomics is a new medical research direction, dealing with the creation and application of nanodevices for performing proteomic analyses in the clinic. Nanotechnological progress in the field of atomic force microscopy makes it possible to perform clinical studies on the revelation, visualization and identification of protein disease markers, in particular of those with the sensitivity of 10(-17) M that surpasses by several orders the sensitivity of commonly adopted clinical methods. At the same time, implementation of nanotechnological approaches into diagnostics allows for the creation of new diagnostic systems based on the optical, electro-optical, electromechanical and electrochemical nanosensoric elements with high operating speed. The application of nanotechnological approaches to creating nanopore-based devices for express sequencing of the genome is discussed.
17444746,4,2007,J Chem Phys,Driven polymer transport through a nanopore controlled by a rotating electric field: off-lattice computer simulations.,The driven translocation kinetics of a single strand polynucleotide chain through a nanopore is studied using off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations, by which the authors demonstrate a novel method in controlling the driven polymer transport through a nanopore by a rotating electric field. The recorded time series of blockade current from the driven polynucleotide transport are used to determine the sequence of polynucleotides by implementing a modified Monte Carlo algorithm, in which the energy landscape paving technique is incorporated to avoid trapping at deep local minima. It is found that only six-time series of block current are required to completely determine the polynucleotide sequence if the average missing rate (AMR) of current signals in these time series is smaller than 20%. For those time series with AMR greater than 20%, the error rate in sequencing an unknown polynucleotide decreases rapidly by increasing the number of time series. To find the most appropriate experimental conditions, the authors have investigated the dependence of AMR of current signals and qualified rate of measured time series of blockade current on various controllable experimental variables.
17444750,1,2007,J Chem Phys,Heteropolymer translocation through nanopores.,The authors investigate the translocation dynamics of heteropolymers driven through a nanopore using a constant temperature Langevin thermostat. Specifically, they consider heteropolymers consisting of two types of monomers labeled A and B, which are distinguished by the magnitude of the driving force that they experience inside the pore. From a series of studies on polymers with sequences AmBn the authors identify both universal as well as specific sequence properties of the translocating chains. They find that the scaling of the average translocation time as a function of the chain length N remains unaffected by the heterogeneity, while the residence time of each bead is a strong function of the sequence for short repeat units. They further discover that for a symmetric heteropolymer AnBn of fixed length, the pattern exhibited by the residence times of the individual monomers has striking similarity with a double slit interference pattern where the total number of repeat units N/2n controls the number of interference fringes. These results are relevant for designing nanopore based sequencing techniques.
17485160,0,2007,Eur Urol,Nanotechnology and its relevance to the urologist.,OBJECTIVES: We review important aspects of nanotechnology, and discuss the wide range of research and clinical applications of nanomedicine in the field of urology. There is particular emphasis on key clinical and pre-clinical studies to provide an update on recent and potential applications in the care of urological patients.METHODS: A directed Medline literature review of nanotechnology was performed. Important publications that have shaped our understanding of nanotechnology were selected for review and were augmented by manual searches of reference lists.RESULTS: Nanotechnology is the study, design, creation, synthesis, manipulation, and application of functional materials, devices, and systems through control of matter at the nanometer scale. Studies demonstrate a number of important concepts. These include nanovectors, nanotubes, and nanosensors for targeted drug delivery; nanowires and nanocantilever arrays for early detection of precancerous and malignant lesions; and nanopores for DNA sequencing. These advances will lead to significant applications relevant to the diagnosis, management, and treatment of all urological conditions.CONCLUSIONS: This review is designed for the urologist to provide an overview and update on nanotechnology and its applications in the field of urology. In the future, it is widely expected that nanotechnology and nanomedicine will have a significant impact on urological research and clinical practice, allowing urologists to intervene at the cellular and molecular level. With structured, safe implementation, nanotechnologies have the potential to revolutionise urological practice in our lifetime.
16448145,59,2006,J Am Chem Soc,Toward single molecule DNA sequencing: direct identification of ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates by using an engineered protein nanopore equipped with a molecular adapter.,Individual nucleic acid molecules might be sequenced by the identification of nucleoside 5'-monophosphates as they are released by processive exonucleases. Here, we show that single molecule detection with a modified protein nanopore can be used to identify ribonucleoside and 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates, thereby taking a step along this path. Distinct levels of current block are observed for each of the four members of a set of nucleoside 5'-monophosphates when the molecules bind within a mutant alpha-hemolysin pore, (M113R)(7), equipped with the molecular adapter heptakis-(6-deoxy-6-amino)-beta-cyclodextrin. While our results compare favorably with alternative approaches, further work will be required to improve the accuracy of identification of the nucleic acid bases, to feed each released nucleotide into the pore, and to ensure that every nucleotide is captured by the adapter.
16608283,46,2006,Nano Lett,Fast DNA sequencing via transverse electronic transport.,A rapid and low-cost method to sequence DNA would usher in a revolution in medicine. We propose and theoretically show the feasibility of a protocol for sequencing based on the distributions of transverse electrical currents of single-stranded DNA while it translocates through a nanopore. Our estimates, based on the statistics of these distributions, reveal that sequencing of an entire human genome could be done with very high accuracy in a matter of hours without parallelization, that is, orders of magnitude faster than present techniques. The practical implementation of our approach would represent a substantial advancement in our ability to study, predict, and cure diseases from the perspective of the genetic makeup of each individual.
16866363,18,2006,Biochemistry,Transport of alpha-helical peptides through alpha-hemolysin and aerolysin pores.,A series of negatively charged alpha-helical peptides of the general formula fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-D(x)A(y)K(z) were synthesized, where x and z were 1, 2, or 3 and y was 10, 14, 18, or 22. The translocation of the peptides through single pores, which were self-assembled into lipid membranes, was analyzed by measuring the current blockade i(block) and the duration t(block). The pores were either alpha-hemolysin, which has a wide vestibule leading into the pore, or aerolysin, which has no vestibule but has a longer pore of a similar diameter. Many thousands of events were measured for each peptide with each pore, and they could be assigned to two types: bumping events (type I) have a small i(block) and long t(block), and translocation events (type II) have a larger i(block) and shorter t(block). For type-II events, both i(block) and t(block) increase with the length of the peptides on both pores tested. The dipole moment and the net charge of each peptide has a major effect on the transport characteristics. The ratio of type-II/type-I events increases as the dipole moment increases, and uncharged peptides gave mostly type-I events. The structural differences between the two nanopores were reflected in the characteristic values of i(block), and in particular, the vestibule of alpha-hemolysin helps to orient the peptides for translocation. Overall, the results demonstrate that the nanopore technology can provide useful structural information but peptide sequencing will require further improvements in the design of the pores.
17055093,14,2006,Trends Biotechnol,Nanopore sequencing technology: research trends and applications.,Nanopore sequencing is one of the most promising technologies being developed as a cheap and fast alternative to the conventional Sanger sequencing method. Protein or synthetic nanopores have been used to detect DNA or RNA molecules. Although none of the technologies to date has shown single-base resolution for de novo DNA sequencing, there have been several reports of alpha-hemolysin protein nanopores being used for basic DNA analyses, and various synthetic nanopores have been fabricated. This review will examine current nanopore sequencing technologies, including recent developments of new applications.
16582464,12,2006,Phys Biol,The role of molecular modeling in bionanotechnology.,Molecular modeling is advocated here as a key methodology for research and development in bionanotechnology. Molecular modeling provides nanoscale images at atomic and even electronic resolution, predicts the nanoscale interaction of unfamiliar combinations of biological and inorganic materials, and evaluates strategies for redesigning biopolymers for nanotechnological uses. The methodology is illustrated in this paper through reviewing three case studies. The first one involves the use of single-walled carbon nanotubes as biomedical sensors where a computationally efficient, yet accurate, description of the influence of biomolecules on nanotube electronic properties through nanotube-biomolecule interactions was developed; this development furnishes the ability to test nanotube electronic properties in realistic biological environments. The second case study involves the use of nanopores manufactured into electronic nanodevices based on silicon compounds for single molecule electrical recording, in particular, for DNA sequencing. Here, modeling combining classical molecular dynamics, material science and device physics, described the interaction of biopolymers, e.g., DNA, with silicon nitrate and silicon oxide pores, furnished accurate dynamic images of pore translocation processes, and predicted signals. The third case study involves the development of nanoscale lipid bilayers for the study of embedded membrane proteins and cholesterol. Molecular modeling tested scaffold proteins, redesigned apolipoproteins found in mammalian plasma that hold the discoidal membranes in the proper shape, and predicted the assembly as well as final structure of the nanodiscs. In entirely new technological areas such as bionanotechnology, qualitative concepts, pictures and suggestions are sorely needed; these three case studies document that molecular modeling can serve a critical role in this respect, even though it may still fall short on quantitative precision.
17118143,7,2006,BMC Bioinformatics,Nanopore Detector based analysis of single-molecule conformational kinetics and binding interactions.,BACKGROUND: A Nanopore Detector provides a means to transduce single molecule events into observable channel current changes. Nanopore-based detection can report directly, or indirectly, on single molecule kinetics. The nanopore-based detector can directly measure molecular characteristics in terms of the blockade properties of individual molecules--this is possible due to the kinetic information that is embedded in the blockade measurements, where the adsorption-desorption history of the molecule to the surrounding channel, and the configurational changes in the molecule itself, imprint on the ionic flow through the channel. This rich source of information offers prospects for DNA sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. A nanopore-based detector can also measure molecular characteristics indirectly, by using a reporter molecule that binds to certain molecules, with subsequent distinctive blockade by the bound-molecule complex.RESULTS: It is hypothesized that reaction histories of individual molecules can be observed on model DNA/DNA, DNA/Protein, and Protein/Protein systems. Preliminary results are all consistent with this hypothesis. Nanopore detection capabilities are also described for highly discriminatory biosensing, binding strength characterization, and rapid immunological screening.CONCLUSION: In essence, the heart of chemistry is now accessible to a new, single-molecule, observation method that can track both external molecular binding states, and internal conformation states.
17193041,0,2006,Small,Towards rapid DNA sequencing: detecting single-stranded DNA with a solid-state nanopore.,
16218707,50,2005,Nano Lett,Detecting single stranded DNA with a solid state nanopore.,Voltage biased solid-state nanopores are used to detect and characterize individual single stranded DNA molecules of fixed micrometer length by operating a nanopore detector at pH values greater than approximately 11.6. The distribution of observed molecular event durations and blockade currents shows that a significant fraction of the events obey a rule of constant event charge deficit (ecd) indicating that they correspond to molecules translocating through the nanopore in a distribution of folded and unfolded configurations. A surprisingly large component is unfolded. The result is an important milestone in developing solid-state nanopores for single molecule sequencing applications.

Miniaturization initially focused on devices that contained micrometer-sized features designed for a particular analytical purpose (e.g., filters for cell isolation and chips for capillary electrophoresis). Now, the focus is shifting to analytical applications based on nano-sized objects such as nanotubes, nanochannels, nanoparticles, nanopores and nanocapacitors. These nanofabricated objects provide new tools for sequencing of nucleic acids and rapid, multiplexed, nucleic acid detection.

The genesis of nanotechnology can be traced to the promise of revolutionary advances across medicine, communications, genomics and robotics. Without doubt, one of the greatest values of nanotechnology will be in the development of new and effective medical treatments (i.e., nanomedicine). This review focuses on the potential of nanomedicine, including the development of nanoparticles for diagnostic and screening purposes, DNA sequencing using nanopores, manufacture of drug delivery systems and single-virus detection.
15345583,78,2004,Biophys J,Microscopic Kinetics of DNA Translocation through synthetic nanopores.,We have previously demonstrated that a nanometer-diameter pore in a nanometer-thick metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible membrane can be used as a molecular sensor for detecting DNA. The prospects for using this type of device for sequencing DNA are avidly being pursued. The key attribute of the sensor is the electric field-induced (voltage-driven) translocation of the DNA molecule in an electrolytic solution across the membrane through the nanopore. To complement ongoing experimental studies developing such pores and measuring signals in response to the presence of DNA, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations of DNA translocation through the nanopore. A typical simulated system included a patch of a silicon nitride membrane dividing water solution of potassium chloride into two compartments connected by the nanopore. External electrical fields induced capturing of the DNA molecules by the pore from the solution and subsequent translocation. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that 20-basepair segments of double-stranded DNA can transit a nanopore of 2.2 x 2.6 nm(2) cross section in a few microseconds at typical electrical fields. Hydrophobic interactions between DNA bases and the pore surface can slow down translocation of single-stranded DNA and might favor unzipping of double-stranded DNA inside the pore. DNA occluding the pore mouth blocks the electrolytic current through the pore; these current blockades were found to have the same magnitude as the blockade observed when DNA transits the pore. The feasibility of using molecular dynamics simulations to relate the level of the blocked ionic current to the sequence of DNA was investigated.
15539451,2,2004,Bioinformatics,A parallel graph decomposition algorithm for DNA sequencing with nanopores.,MOTIVATION: With the potential availability of nanopore devices that can sense the bases of translocating single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), it is likely that 'reads' of length approximately 10(5) will be available in large numbers and at high speed. We address the problem of complete DNA sequencing using such reads. We assume that approximately 10(2) copies of a DNA sequence are split into single strands that break into randomly sized pieces as they translocate the nanopore in arbitrary orientations. The nanopore senses and reports each individual base that passes through, but all information about orientation and complementarity of the ssDNA subsequences is lost. Random errors (both biological and transduction) in the reads create further complications.RESULTS: We have developed an algorithm that addresses these issues. It can be considered an extreme variation of the well-known Eulerian path approach. It searches over a space of de Bruijn graphs until it finds one in which (a) the impact of errors is eliminated and (b) both possible orientations of the two ssDNA sequences can be identified separately and unambiguously. Our algorithm is able to correctly reconstruct real DNA sequences of the order of 10(6) bases (e.g. the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae) from simulated erroneous reads on a modest workstation in about 1 h. We describe, and give measured timings of, a parallel implementation of this algorithm on the Cray Multithreaded Architecture (MTA-2) supercomputer, whose architecture is ideally suited to this 'unstructured' problem. Our parallel implementation is crucial to the problem of rapidly sequencing long DNA sequences and also to the situation where multiple nanopores are used to obtain a high-bandwidth stream of reads.
12942073,110,2003,Nat Mater,DNA molecules and configurations in a solid-state nanopore microscope.,A nanometre-scale pore in a solid-state membrane provides a new way of electronically probing the structure of single linear polymers, including those of biological interest in their native environments. Previous work with biological protein pores wide enough to let through and sense single-stranded DNA molecules demonstrates the power of using nanopores, but many future tasks and applications call for a robust solid-state pore whose nanometre-scale dimensions and properties may be selected, as one selects the lenses of a microscope. Here we demonstrate a solid-state nanopore microscope capable of observing individual molecules of double-stranded DNA and their folding behaviour. We discuss extensions of the nanopore microscope concept to alternative probing mechanisms and applications, including the study of molecular structure and sequencing.
12831370,15,2003,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Nanotechnology and medicine.,Nanotechnology, or systems/device manufacture at the molecular level, is a multidisciplinary scientific field undergoing explosive development. The genesis of nanotechnology can be traced to the promise of revolutionary advances across medicine, communications, genomics and robotics. On the surface, miniaturisation provides cost effective and more rapidly functioning mechanical, chemical and biological components. Less obvious though is the fact that nanometre sized objects also possess remarkable self-ordering and assembly behaviours under the control of forces quite different from macro objects. These unique behaviours are what make nanotechnology possible, and by increasing our understanding of these processes, new approaches to enhancing the quality of human life will surely be developed. A complete list of the potential applications of nanotechnology is too vast and diverse to discuss in detail, but without doubt one of the greatest values of nanotechnology will be in the development of new and effective medical treatments (i.e., nanomedicine). This review focuses on the potential of nanotechnology in medicine, including the development of nanoparticles for diagnostic and screening purposes, artificial receptors, DNA sequencing using nanopores, manufacture of unique drug delivery systems, gene therapy applications and the enablement of tissue engineering.
10740260,41,2000,Trends Biotechnol,Nanopores and nucleic acids: prospects for ultrarapid sequencing.,DNA and RNA molecules can be detected as they are driven through a nanopore by an applied electric field at rates ranging from several hundred microseconds to a few milliseconds per molecule. The nanopore can rapidly discriminate between pyrimidine and purine segments along a single-stranded nucleic acid molecule. Nanopore detection and characterization of single molecules represents a new method for directly reading information encoded in linear polymers. If single-nucleotide resolution can be achieved, it is possible that nucleic acid sequences can be determined at rates exceeding a thousand bases per second.
