The unifying feature of second-generation sequencing technologies is that single template strands are amplified clonally onto a solid surface prior to the sequencing reaction. To convert template strands into a compatible state for attachment to this surface, a multistep library preparation is required, which typically culminates in amplification by the PCR. PCR is an inherently biased process, which decreases the efficiency of data acquisition. Flowcell reverse transcription sequencing is a method of transcriptome sequencing for Illumina sequencers in which the reverse transcription reaction is performed on the flowcell by using unamplified, adapter-ligated mRNA as a template. This approach removes PCR biases and duplicates, generates strand-specific paired-end data and is highly reproducible. The procedure can be performed quickly, taking 2 d to generate clusters from mRNA.
20081834	51	2010	Nat Methods	FRT-seq: amplification-free, strand-specific transcriptome sequencing.	We report an alternative approach to transcriptome sequencing for the Illumina Genome Analyzer, in which the reverse transcription reaction takes place on the flowcell. No amplification is performed during the library preparation, so PCR biases and duplicates are avoided, and because the template is poly(A)(+) RNA rather than cDNA, the resulting sequences are necessarily strand-specific. The method is compatible with paired- or single-end sequencing.
