25920980,1,2015,Afr J AIDS Res,Reducing the overall HIV-burden in South Africa: is 'reviving ABC' an appropriate fit for a complex, adaptive epidemiological HIV landscape?,This article questions the recommendations to 'revive ABC (abstain, be faithful, condomise)' as a mechanism to 'educate' people in South Africa about HIV prevention as the South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence and Behaviour Survey, 2012, suggests. We argue that ABC was designed as a response to a particular context which has now radically changed. In South Africa the contemporary context reflects the mass roll-out of antiretroviral treatment; significant bio-medical knowledge gains; a generalised population affected by HIV that has made sense of and embodied those diverse experiences; and a government committed to confronting the epidemic. We suggest that the situation can now be plausibly conceptualised as a complex, adaptive epidemiological landscape that could benefit from an expansion of the existing, 'descriptive' prevention paradigm towards strategies that focus on the dynamics of transmission. We argue for this shift by proposing a theoretical framework based on complexity theory and pattern management. We interrogate one educational prevention heuristic that emphasises the importance of risk-reduction through the lens of transmission, called A-3B-4C-T. We argue that this type of approach provides expansive opportunities for people to engage with the epidemic in contextualised, innovative ways that supersede the opportunities afforded by ABC. We then suggest that framing the prevention imperative through the lens of 'dynamic prevention' at scale opens more immediate opportunities, as well as developing a future-oriented mind-set, than the 'descriptive prevention' parameters can facilitate. The parameters of the 'descriptive prevention' paradigm, that maintain - and partially reinforce - the presence of ABC, do not have the flexibility required to develop the armamentarium of tools required to contribute to the management of a complex epidemiological landscape. Uncritically adhering to both the 'descriptive paradigm', and ABC, represents an historically dislocated form of prevention - with restrictive options for reducing the overall burden of HIV-related challenges in South Africa.
25600279,1,2015,Mol Plant,Kinesin-4 Functions in Vesicular Transport on Cortical Microtubules and Regulates Cell Wall Mechanics during Cell Elongation in Plants.,In plants, anisotropic cell expansion depends on cortical microtubules that serve as tracks along which macromolecules and vesicles are transported by the motor kinesins of unknown identities. We used cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fibers that underwent robust elongation to discover kinesins that are involved in cell elongation and found Gh KINESIN-4A expressed abundantly. The motor was detected by immunofluorescence on vesicle-like structures that were associated with cortical microtubules. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the orthologous motor At KINESIN-4A/FRA1, previously implicated in cellulose deposition during secondary growth in fiber cells, was examined by live-cell imaging in cells expressing the fluorescently tagged functional protein. The motor decorated vesicle-like particles that exhibit a linear movement along cortical microtubules with an average velocity of 0.89 μm/min, which was significantly different from those linked to cellulose biosynthesis. We also discovered that At KINESIN-4A/FRA1 and the related At KINESIN-4C play redundant roles in cell wall mechanics, cell elongation, and the axial growth of various vegetative and reproductive organs, as the loss of At KINESIN-4C greatly enhanced the defects caused by a null mutation at the KINESIN-4A/FRA1 locus. The double mutant displayed a lack of cell wall softening at normal stages of rapid cell elongation. Furthermore, enhanced deposition of arabinose-containing carbohydrate was detected in the kinesin-4 mutants. Our findings established a connection between the Kinesin-4-based transport of cargoes containing non-cellulosic components along cortical microtubules and cell wall mechanics and cell elongation in flowering plants.
26192029,0,2015,ACS Chem Neurosci,Benzothiazepine CGP37157 analogues exert cytoprotection in various in vitro models of neurodegeneration.,Mitochondria regulate cellular Ca2+ oscillations, taking up Ca2+ through its uniporter and releasing it through the mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger. The role of mitochondria in the regulation of Ca2+ cycle has received much attention recently, as it is a central stage in neuronal survival and death processes. Over the last decades, the 4,1-benzothiazepine CGP37157 has been the only available blocker of the mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger, although it targets several other several calcium transporters. We report the synthesis of 4,1-benzothiazepine derivatives with the goal of enhancing mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger blockade and selectivity, and the evaluation of their cytoprotective effect. The compound 4c presented an interesting neuroprotective profile in addition to an important blockade of the mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger. The use of this benzothiazepine could help to understand the physiological functions of the mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger. In addition, we hypothesize that a moderate blockade of the mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger would provide enhanced neuroprotection in neurons.
26189256,0,2015,Eur J Gynaecol Oncol,The differences of phyllodes and acoustic attenuation in breast lesions diagnosed with Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System for Ultrasonography (BI-RADS-US) category 4C.,OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to discuss the differences of malignant findings in breast lesions diagnosed with Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System for Ultrasonography (BI-RADS-US) category 4C to determine which malignant findings are more important.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 159 cases of breast lesions diagnosed with BI-RADS-US category 4C were analyzed retrospectively. All patients got pathological results (81 cases of benign; 78 cases of breast cancer). Two doctors scanned and diagnosed the patients, with another doctor recording ultrasonographic findings retrospectively. The differences were compared by means of the Chi-square (χ2) test.RESULTS: Phyllodes and acoustic attenuation had statistical differences in the comparison of breast lesions (p &lt; 0.05). Irregular shape, indistinct boundary, poorly-defined margin, penetrating or tortuous surrounding vessels, RI ≥ 0.7, and microcalcification had no statistical differences in the comparison of benign and malignant breast lesions.CONCLUSIONS: Phyllodes and acoustic attenuation are the more important malignant ultrasonographic findings of breast cancer. The malignant ultrasonographic findings are not unique for breast cancer.
26188134,0,2015,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,On the use of spatial frequency to isolate contributions from the magnocellular and parvocellular systems and the dorsal and ventral cortical streams.,Many authors have claimed that suprathreshold achromatic stimuli of low and high spatial frequency can be used to separate responses from different entities in the visual system. Most prominently, it has been proposed that such stimuli can differentiate responses from the magnocellular and parvocellular systems. As is reviewed here, investigators who have examined stimulus specificity of neurons in these systems have found little difference between magno- and parvocellular cells. It has also been proposed that spatial frequency can be used to selectively activate the &quot;magnocellular-dorsal stream&quot;. The present review indicates that cells in Area MT of the dorsal do prefer very low spatial frequencies. However, the review also shows that cells in Area V4 of the ventral stream respond, not only to relatively high spatial frequencies, but also to low frequency stimuli. Thus, low spatial frequencies cannot be relied upon to selectively activate the dorsal stream.
26187015,0,2015,Bioorg Med Chem,Design, synthesis and cytotoxicity studies of dithiocarbamate ester derivatives of emetine in prostate cancer cell lines.,A small library of emetine dithiocarbamate ester derivatives were synthesized in 25-86% yield via derivatization of the N2'- position of emetine. Anticancer evaluation of these compounds in androgen receptor positive LNCaP and androgen receptor negative PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines revealed time dependent and dose-dependent cytotoxicity. With the exception of compound 4c, all the dithiocarbamate ester analogs in this study showed appreciable potency in all the prostate cancer cell lines (regardless of whether it is androgen receptor positive or negative) with a cytotoxicity IC50 value ranging from 1.312±0.032μM to 5.201±0.125μM by day 7 of treatment. Compared to the sodium dithiocarbamate salt 1, all the dithiocarbamate ester analogs (2 and 4a-4g) displayed lower cytotoxicity than compound 1 (PC3, IC50=0.087±0.005μM; DU145, IC50=0.079±0.003μM and LNCaP, IC50=0.079±0.003μM) on day 7 of treatment. Consequently, it appears that S-alkylation of compound 1 leads to a more stable dithiocarbamate ester derivative that resulted in lower anticancer activity in the prostate cancer cell lines.
26173868,0,2015,Eur J Clin Nutr,Body composition in young female eating-disorder patients with severe weight loss and controls: evidence from the four-component model and evaluation of DXA.,OBJECTIVES: Whether fat-free mass (FFM) and its components are depleted in eating-disorder (ED) patients is uncertain. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is widely used to assess body composition in pediatric ED patients; however, its accuracy in underweight populations remains unknown. We aimed (1) to assess body composition of young females with ED involving substantial weight loss, relative to healthy controls using the four-component (4C) model, and (2) to explore the validity of DXA body composition assessment in ED patients.METHODS: Body composition of 13 females with ED and 117 controls, aged 10-18 years, was investigated using the 4C model. Accuracy of DXA for estimation of FFM and fat mass (FM) was tested using the approach of Bland and Altman.RESULTS: Adjusting for age, height and pubertal stage, ED patients had significantly lower whole-body FM, FFM, protein mass (PM) and mineral mass (MM) compared with controls. Trunk and limb FM and limb lean soft tissue were significantly lower in ED patients. However, no significant difference in the hydration of FFM was detected. Compared with the 4C model, DXA overestimated FM by 5±36% and underestimated FFM by 1±9% in ED patients.CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that ED patients are depleted not only in FM but also in FFM, PM and MM. DXA has limitations for estimating body composition in individual young female ED patients.European Journal of Clinical Nutrition advance online publication, 15 July 2015; doi:10.1038/ejcn.2015.111.
26167104,0,2015,Med Chem Res,Synthesis and anticancer activity of thiosubstituted purines.,New thiopurines with the propargylthio, pyrrolidinobutynylthio, sulfenamide, and sulfonamide groups in the pyrimidine ring were synthesized. The anticancer activity of these compounds and previously obtained 2- or 6-substituted azathioprine analogs and dialkylaminoalkylthiopurines were tested in vitro against three cell lines: glioblastoma SNB-19, melanoma C-32, and human ductal breast epithelial tumor T47D. 2-Chloro-7-methyl-6-pyrrolidinobutynylthiopurine (5b) was the most potent compound against SBN-19 and C-32 cell lines with the activity similar to cisplatin (EC50 = 5.00 and 7.58 μg/ml, respectively). The dialkylaminoalkylthio derivatives (4b, 4c, 4e, and 4f) showed good activity against SBN-19 cell line (EC50 &lt; 10 μg/ml). The azathioprine analogs (2a, 2b, and 3a) were more active than azathioprine against SBN-19 and C-32 cell lines. The sulfenamide and sulfonamide derivatives of purine were very weak active against tested cell lines. All studied thiopurines were less toxic than cisplatin.
26166302,0,2015,J Agric Food Chem,Synthesis of Novel Oxime Sulfonate Derivatives of 2'(2',6')-(Di)chloropicropodophyllotoxins as Insecticidal Agents.,To discover novel natural-product-based pesticidal agents, we prepared a series of oxime sulfonate derivatives of 2'(2',6')-(Di)chloropicropodophyllotoxins by structural modification of podophyllotoxin. Their structures were well-characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), optical rotation, and melting point. Moreover, the key steric structure of compound 5f was unambiguously determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Additionally, their insecticidal activity was evaluated at 1 mg/mL against the pre-third-instar larvae of oriental armyworm (Mythimna separata Walker), a typical lepidopteran pest. Among all derivatives, compounds 4c, 5c, and 5d exhibited more promising insecticidal activity, with the final mortality rates greater than 60%, when compared to their precursor podophyllotoxin and the positive control, toosendanin. It demonstrated that introduction of the chlorine atom at the C-2' or C-2',6' position on the E ring of picropodophyllotoxin or oxime sulfonate derivatives of picropodophyllotoxin was important for the insecticidal activity and introduction of a halogen (e.g., fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) atom-substituted phenylsulfonyl group on the oxime fragment of 2'(2',6')-(di)chloropicropodophyllones could lead to more promising compounds.
26164624,0,2015,Bioorg Med Chem,Imidazole clubbed 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives as potential antifungal agents.,A series of compounds in which 2-(4-ethyl-2-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole was clubbed with substituted 1,3,4-oxadiazole was synthesized and subjected to antifungal activity evaluation. In vitro assays indicated that several clubbed derivatives had excellent antifungal activity against different strains of laboratory and clinically isolated Candida species. Structural Activity Relationship (SAR) studies revealed that the presence and position of substituents on the phenyl ring of the 1,3,4-oxadiazole unit, guides the antifungal potential of the compounds, where compound 4b, 4c and 4g were found to be active against all the tested fungal strains. Impairment of ergosterol biosynthesis upon the concomitant treatment of 4b, 4c and 4g, revealed the possible mechanisms of antifungal action of these compounds. Inhibitors snugly fitting the active site of the target enzyme, as revealed by molecular docking studies, may well explain their excellent inhibitory activity.
26151773,0,2015,Autophagy,Burkholderia pseudomallei survival in lung epithelial cells benefits from miRNA-mediated suppression of ATG10.,Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a disease with high mortality, which is prevalent in tropical regions of the world. A recent study shows that B. pseudomallei can survive inside mammalian cells owning to its ability to actively evade cell autophagy. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, based on microarray screening, we found that ATG10 was downregulated following B. pseudomallei infection in A549 human lung epithelial cells. Forced expression of ATG10 accelerated the elimination of intracellular B. pseudomallei by enhancing the process of autophagy. Moreover, MIR4458, MIR4667-5p and MIR4668-5p were found, by microarray screening, to be upregulated in response to B. pseudomallei infection. These 3 novel miRNAs, MIR4458, MIR4667-5p and MIR4668-5p, targeted to the 3'-untranslated region of ATG10 indifferent time-course and spatial manners. Upregulation of these miRNAs reduced the level of ATG10 and inhibited autophagy, leading to increasing survival rate of intracellular B. pseudomallei. Furthermore, the increase of these miRNAs was correlated with the reduced promoter methylation status in A549 cells in response to B. pseudomallei infection. Our results reveal that 3 novel miRNAs regulate autophagy-mediated elimination of B. pseudomallei by targeting ATG10, and provide potential targets for clinical treatment.
26141033,0,2015,Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol,Dust mite infestation in cooking flour: experimental observations and practical recommendations.,BACKGROUND: The first documented case of oral mite anaphylaxis has recently been reported in Thailand, with mites possibly originating from cooking flour.OBJECTIVE: Our study was designed to assess the effects of cooking flours enhancement and storage conditions on mite proliferation and to provide practical recommendations to prevent mite anaphylaxis.METHODS: In a factorial experiment, six commercial brands of cooking flours were selected and either inoculated or set free of mites and stored in one of the four containers chosen for the study: original package, plastic bag, plastic box and glass bottle. The resulting experimental units where then stored at either room temperature or in a refrigerator (+4C). In order to determine levels of Der f 1 allergen, 0.1 gram of flour was sampled from each experimental unit and tested by ELISA. Sampling was carried out immediately after inoculation and subsequently at week 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 20.RESULTS: Levels of Der f 1 allergen in the inoculated samples increased significantly in all conditions 6 weeks after inoculation (p &lt;0.001) and reached the highest levels at week 8. While experimental units left at room temperature showed higher levels of mite growth (p &lt;0.001), no statistical differences were found among types of containers. The highest amount of Der f 1 was observed for Gogi, followed by Gold Label, tempura flour, corn flour, wheat flour and tapioca starch, respectively (p &lt;0.01).CONCLUSIONS: In the context of our experiment, mites preferably grew in cooking flours containing high amounts of wheat at room temperature, particularly after 8 week of storage. According to our results, we thus advise to keep household cooking flour refrigerated and while the type of container does not matter, storage should not exceed 20 weeks.
26135049,0,2015,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,One-Pot Synthesis of Copper Sulfide Nanowires/Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanocomposites with Excellent Lithium-Storage Properties as Anode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries.,Copper sulfide nanowires/reduced graphene oxide (CuSNWs/rGO) nanocompsites are successfully synthesized via a facile one-pot and template-free solution method in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-ethyl glycol (EG) mixed solvent. It is noteworthy that the precursor plays a crucial role in the formation of the nanocomposites structure. SEM, TEM, XRD, IR and Raman spectroscopy are used to investigate the morphological and structural evolution of CuSNWs/rGO nanocomposites. The as-fabricated CuSNWs/rGO nanocompsites show remarkably improved Li-storage performance, excellent cycling stability as well as high-rate capability compared with pristine CuS nanowires. It obtains a reversible capacity of 620 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C (1C = 560 mA g(-1)) after 100 cycles and 320 mAh g(-1) at a high current rate of 4C even after 430 cycles. The excellent lithium storage performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect between CuS nanowires and rGO nanosheets. The as-formed CuSNWs/rGO nanocomposites can effectively accommodate large volume changes, supply a 2D conducting network and trap the polysulfides generated during the conversion reaction of CuS.
26132550,0,2015,Inorg Chem,Neutral &quot;Cp-Free&quot; Silyl-Lanthanide(II) Complexes: Synthesis, Structure, and Bonding Analysis.,Complexes featuring lanthanide silicon bonds represent a research area still in its infancy. Herein, we report a series of Cp-free lanthanide (+II) complexes bearing σ-bonded silyl ligands. By reactions of LnI2 (Ln = Yb, Eu, Sm) either with a 1,4-oligosilanyl dianion [K-Si(SiMe3)2SiMe2SiMe2Si(SiMe3)2-K)] (1) or with 2 (Me3Si)3SiK (3) the corresponding neutral metallacyclopentasilanes ({Me2Si(Me3Si)2Si}2)Ln·(THF)4 (Ln = Yb (2a), Eu (2b), Sm (2c)), or the disilylated complexes ({Me3Si}3Si)2Ln·(THF)3 (Ln = Yb (4a), Eu (4b), Sm (4c)), were selectively obtained. Complexes 2b, 2c, 4b, and 4c represent the first examples of structurally characterized Cp-free Eu and Sm complexes with silyl ligands. In both series, a linear correlation was observed between the Ln-Si bond lengths and the covalent radii of the corresponding lanthanide metals. Density functional theory calculations were also carried out for complexes 2a-c and 4a-c to elucidate the bonding situation between the Ln(+II) centers and Si.
26131184,0,2015,Int J Clin Exp Med,Prospective validation of an ultrasound-based thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI-RADS) on 3980 thyroid nodules.,OBJECTIVE: Ultrasound (US) features of solidity, hypoechogenicity or marked hypoechogenicity, microlobulated or irregular margins, microcalcifications, and taller-than-wide shape are suspicious characteristics for thyroid nodules. An US based Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) is classified based on the number of aforesaid features. TI-RADS category 3 included nodules without any suspicious features, and categories 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 included nodules with one, two, three or four, or five suspicious US features. The purpose of the study was to prospectively validate the effectiveness of the TI-RADS.METHODS: From October 2011 to June 2013, we prospectively categorized 3980 thyroid nodules (3752 benign and 228 malignant lesions) in 2921 patients using TI-RADS classification. TI-RADS categories 2 and 3 were considered as benign whereas TI-RADS categories 4 and 5 as malignant. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV) and accuracy were calculated.RESULTS: Of the 3980 nodules, 2953 nodules were TI-RADS category 2 (0% malignancy), 466 nodules TI-RADS category 3 (1.3% malignancy), 186 nodules TI-RADS category 4a (4.8% malignancy), 165 nodules TI-RADS category 4b (30.3% malignancy), 188 nodules TI-RADS category 4c (75.5% malignancy), and 22 nodules TI-RADS category 5 (95.5% malignancy). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy were 97%, 90%, 40%, 99%, and 91%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: TI-RADS classification had great diagnostic value in diagnosing thyroid nodules. The actual probability of malignancy was in accord with the theory risk of malignancy.
26129378,0,2015,Med Phys,WE-G-BRA-08: Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for Gamma Knife Radiosurgery.,PURPOSE: To perform a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) study for Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery processes at our institution based on our experience with the treatment of more than 13,000 patients.METHODS: A team consisting of medical physicists, nurses, radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and an external physicist expert was formed for the FMEA study. A process tree and a failure mode table were created for the GK procedures using the Leksell GK Perfexion and 4C units. Three scores for the probability of occurrence (O), the severity (S), and the probability of no detection (D) for failure modes were assigned to each failure mode by each professional on a scale from 1 to 10. The risk priority number (RPN) for each failure mode was then calculated (RPN = OxSxD) as the average scores from all data sets collected.RESULTS: The established process tree for GK radiosurgery consists of 10 sub-processes and 53 steps, including a sub-process for frame placement and 11 steps that are directly related to the frame-based nature of the GK radiosurgery. Out of the 86 failure modes identified, 40 failure modes are GK specific, caused by the potential for inappropriate use of the radiosurgery head frame, the imaging fiducial boxes, the GK helmets and plugs, and the GammaPlan treatment planning system. The other 46 failure modes are associated with the registration, imaging, image transfer, contouring processes that are common for all radiation therapy techniques. The failure modes with the highest hazard scores are related to imperfect frame adaptor attachment, bad fiducial box assembly, overlooked target areas, inaccurate previous treatment information and excessive patient movement during MRI scan.CONCLUSION: The implementation of the FMEA approach for Gamma Knife radiosurgery enabled deeper understanding of the overall process among all professionals involved in the care of the patient and helped identify potential weaknesses in the overall process.
26127894,0,2015,Med Phys,SU-E-T-230: Creating a Large Number of Focused Beams with Variable Patient Head Tilt to Improve Dose Fall-Off for Brain Radiosurgery.,PURPOSE: To develop a treatment delivery and planning strategy by increasing the number of beams to minimize dose to brain tissue surrounding a target, while maximizing dose coverage to the target.METHODS: We analyzed 14 different treatment plans via Leksell PFX and 4C. For standardization, single tumor cases were chosen. Original treatment plans were compared with two optimized plans. The number of beams was increased in treatment plans by varying tilt angles of the patient head, while maintaining original isocenter and the beam positions in the x-, y- and z-axes, collimator size, and beam blocking. PFX optimized plans increased beam numbers with three pre-set tilt angles, 70, 90, 110, and 4C optimized plans increased beam numbers with tilt angles increasing arbitrarily from range of 30 to 150 degrees. Optimized treatment plans were compared dosimetrically with original treatment plans.RESULTS: Comparing total normal tissue isodose volumes between original and optimized plans, the low-level percentage isodose volumes decreased in all plans. Despite the addition of multiple beams up to a factor of 25, beam-on times for 1 tilt angle versus 3 or more tilt angles were comparable (&lt;1 min.). In 64% (9/14) of the studied cases, the volume percentage decrease by &gt;5%, with the highest value reaching 19%. The addition of more tilt angles correlates to a greater decrease in normal brain irradiated volume. Selectivity and coverage for original and optimized plans remained comparable.CONCLUSION: Adding large number of additional focused beams with variable patient head tilt shows improvement for dose fall-off for brain radiosurgery. The study demonstrates technical feasibility of adding beams to decrease target volume.
26127878,0,2015,Med Phys,SU-E-T-212: Comparison of TG-43 Dosimetric Parameters of Low and High Energy Brachytherapy Sources Obtained by MCNP Code Versions of 4C, X and 5.,PURPOSE: Different versions of MCNP code are widely used for dosimetry purposes. The purpose of this study is to compare different versions of the MCNP codes in dosimetric evaluation of different brachytherapy sources.METHODS: The TG-43 parameters such as dose rate constant, radial dose function, and anisotropy function of different brachytherapy sources, i.e. Pd-103, I-125, Ir-192, and Cs-137 were calculated in water phantom. The results obtained by three versions of Monte Carlo codes (MCNP4C, MCNPX, MCNP5) were compared for low and high energy brachytherapy sources. Then the cross section library of MCNP4C code was changed to ENDF/B-VI release 8 which is used in MCNP5 and MCNPX codes. Finally, the TG-43 parameters obtained using the MCNP4C-revised code, were compared with other codes.RESULTS: The results of these investigations indicate that for high energy sources, the differences in TG-43 parameters between the codes are less than 1% for Ir-192 and less than 0.5% for Cs-137. However for low energy sources like I-125 and Pd-103, large discrepancies are observed in the g(r) values obtained by MCNP4C and the two other codes. The differences between g(r) values calculated using MCNP4C and MCNP5 at the distance of 6cm were found to be about 17% and 28% for I-125 and Pd-103 respectively. The results obtained with MCNP4C-revised and MCNPX were similar. However, the maximum difference between the results obtained with the MCNP5 and MCNP4C-revised codes was 2% at 6cm.CONCLUSION: The results indicate that using MCNP4C code for dosimetry of low energy brachytherapy sources can cause large errors in the results. Therefore it is recommended not to use this code for low energy sources, unless its cross section library is changed. Since the results obtained with MCNP4C-revised and MCNPX were similar, it is concluded that the difference between MCNP4C and MCNPX is their cross section libraries.
26127183,0,2015,Med Phys,SU-D-BRB-04: Plan Quality Comparison of Intracranial Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) for Gamma Knife and VMAT Treatments.,PURPOSE: To compare treatment plan quality of intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for VMAT (RapidArc) and Gamma Knife (GK) systems.METHODS: Ten patients with 24 tumors (seven with 1-2 and three with 4-6 lesions), previously treated with GK 4C (prescription doses ranging from 14-23 Gy) were re-planned for RapidArc. Identical contour sets were kept on MRI images for both plans with tissues assigned a CT number of zero. RapidArc plans were performed using 6 MV flattening-filter-free (FFF) beams with dose rate of 1400 MU/minute using two to eight arcs with the following combinations: 2 full coplanar arcs and the rest non-coplanar half arcs. Beam selection was based on target depth. Areas that penetrated more than 10 cm of tissue were avoided by creating smaller arcs or using avoidance sectors in optimization. Plans were optimized with jaw tracking and a high weighting to the normal-brain-tissue and Normal-Tissue-Objective without compromising PTV coverage. Plans were calculated on a 1 mm grid size using AAA algorithm and then normalized so that 99% of each target volume received the prescription dose. Plan quality was assessed by target coverage using Paddick Conformity Index (PCI), sparing of normal-brain-tissue through analysis of V4, V8, and V12 Gy, and integral dose.RESULTS: In all cases critical structure dose criteria were met. RapidArc had a higher PCI than GK plans for 23 out of 24 lesions. The average PCI was 0.76±0.21 for RapidArc and 0.46±0.20 for GK plans (p≤0.001), respectively. Integral dose and normal-brain-tissue doses for all criteria were lower for RapidArc in nearly all patients. The average ratio of GK to RapidArc plans was 1.28±0.27 (p=0.018), 1.31±0.25 (p=0.017), 1.81±0.43 (p=0.005), and 1.50±0.61 (p=0.006) for V4, V8, and V12 Gy, and integral dose, respectively.CONCLUSION: VMAT was capable of producing higher quality treatment plans than GK when using optimal beam geometries and proper optimization techniques.
26124900,0,2015,Pol J Radiol,Antenatal Diagnosis of Jeune Syndrome (Asphyxiating Thoracic Dysplasia) with Micromelia and Facial Dysmorphism on Second-Trimester Ultrasound.,BACKGROUND: Jeune syndrome is a rare congenital malformation with a reported incidence of 1 in 100,000-130,000 live births. Thoracic hypoplasia is the most striking abnormality of this disorder. Here we report a case of Jeune syndrome with marked thoracic hypoplasia, micromelia and facial dysmorphism, which was diagnosed on a second-trimester antenatal real-time three-dimensional ultrasound.CASE REPORT: A 24-year-old primigravida came for routine anomaly scan at 19 weeks of gestation. Transabdominal grey scale and real time 3D ultrasound (US) was done with GE Logiq P5 with curvilinear array transducers (4C and 4D3C-L). US findings were consistent with the diagnosis of Jeune syndrome (Asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia).CONCLUSIONS: Jeune syndrome is an extremely rare congenital disorder with a spectrum of abnormalities of which thoracic hypoplasia is the most striking. It can be diagnosed on early antenatal US by its characteristic skeletal and morphological features which can guide further management of pregnancy in form of termination or preparation for surgical correction of the deformity.
26118405,0,2015,Eur J Dent Educ,Developing integrated clinical reasoning competencies in dental students using scaffolded case-based learning - empirical evidence.,INTRODUCTION: This study provides empirical evidence of the development of integrated clinical reasoning in the discipline-based School of Dentistry, University of Pretoria, South Africa. Students were exposed to case-based learning in comprehensive patient care (CPC) in the preclinical year of study, scaffolded by means of the four-component instructional design model for complex learning.METHODS: Progress test scores of third- to fifth-year dental students, who received case-based teaching and learning in the third year (2009-2011), were compared to the scores of preceding fourth- and fifth-year cohorts. These fourth- and fifth-year cohorts received content-based teaching concurrently with their clinical training in CPC. The progress test consisted of a complex case study and 32 MCQs on tracer conditions. Students had to gather the necessary information and had to make diagnostic and treatment-planning decisions.RESULTS: Preclinical students who participated in the case-based teaching and learning achieved similar scores compared to final-year students who received lecture-based teaching and learning. Final-year students who participated in the case-based learning made three more correct clinical decisions per student, compared to those who received content-based teaching. Students struggled more with treatment-planning than with diagnostic decisions.CONCLUSION: The scaffolded case-based learning appears to contribute to accurate clinical decisions when compared to lecture-based teaching. It is suggested that the development of integrated reasoning competencies starts as early as possible in a dental curriculum, perhaps even in the preclinical year of study. Treatment-planning should receive particular attention.
26104012,0,2015,Int J Dermatol,Assessment of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction in patients with psoriasis by speckle tracking echocardiography: A Speckle Tracking Study.,BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disease and is reportedly associated with adverse cardiovascular risks. Left ventricular (LV) function has not been studied comprehensively in psoriasis.OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to study LV mechanics in patients with psoriasis by speckle tracking echocardiography.METHODS: The study population consisted of 40 patients with psoriasis and 35 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Two-dimensional echocardiography images were obtained from LV apical four-chamber (4C), long axis (LAX), and two-chamber (2C) views. Peak longitudinal strain and strain rate were obtained from 4C, LAX, and 2C views. Global strain and strain rate were calculated by averaging data for the three apical views.RESULTS: Patients with psoriasis had significantly lower mean ± standard deviation (SD) 4C (17.1 ± 1.7 vs. 19.2 ± 2.3; P &lt; 0.01), LAX (16.6 ± 1.5 vs. 19.5 ± 2.3; P &lt; 0.01), and 2C (16.5 ± 1.5 vs. 19.4 ± 2.2; P &lt; 0.01) peak longitudinal strain values compared with the control group. Moreover, mean ± SD LV global strain (16.6 ± 1.5 vs. 19.9 ± 2.1; P &lt; 0.01) and strain rate (1.39 ± 0.30 vs. 1.51 ± 0.20; P &lt; 0.01) values were found to be significantly lower in the psoriasis group. In a multiple regression model, global strain was independently associated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (β = 0.29, P = 0.04), duration of disease (β = 0.35, P &lt; 0.01), ejection fraction (EF) (β = 0.38, P =0.01), and the ratio of early diastolic mitral inflow velocity to early diastolic annular velocity (E/E' ratio) (β = 0.34, P =0.02). Also, in a multiple regression model, global strain rate was independently associated with duration of disease (β = 0.36, P &lt; 0.01), EF (β = 0.32, P = 0.01), and E/E' ratio (β = 0.35, P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Using 2-D strain imaging, we have demonstrated that patients with psoriasis have lower LV functions.
26102866,0,2015,J Hypertens,4C.10: LOWER COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IS NOT CORRELATED WITH VASCULAR STIFFNESS IN ELDERLY TREATED HYPERTENSIVES.,OBJECTIVE: To correlate cognitive performance with vascular stiffness in elderly normotensives and hypertensives.DESIGN AND METHOD: Cognitive performance was assessed by CAMCOG-R in elderly normotensives [NTN; n = 20 (7 women); 68 ± 1yo; 131 ± 3mmHg; education = 11 ± 1y] and pharmacologically treated hypertensives [HTN; n = 42 (26 women); 68 ± 1yo; 149 ± 3mmHg; education = 8 ± 1y]. Subjects treated with beta-blockers were excluded. Depression was assessed by Beck Depression Inventory. We measured carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) with Complior and central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) with SphygmoCor. Augmentation pressure (AP) was derived from central aortic pressure waveform.RESULTS: CAMCOG-R global score was larger in NTN (87 ± 2 vs. 77 ± 1, p &lt; 0.001). While CASP was higher in HTN (137 ± 5 vs. 123 ± 2mmHg, p = 0.001), PWV and AP were similar in NTN and HTN (PWV 11.6 ± 0.5 vs. 11.6 ± 0.4m/s, p = 0.9; AP 15 ± 1 vs. 18 ± 1mmHg, p = 0.1). In a linear multiple regression model controlled for sex and depression, both hypertension and less education, but not PWV and AP, were independent adverse predictors of CAMCOG-R global score (Table; adjusted R-squared of model = 0.56; p-value of model &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: As expected, normotensives exhibited better cognitive performance than hypertensives. Importantly, hypertension and less education, but not indices of vascular stiffness, were associated with lower cognitive performance. These results suggest that vascular stiffness is not correlated with lower cognitive performance in elderly treated hypertensives.(Figure is included in full-text article.).
26102865,0,2015,J Hypertens,4C.09: EFFECT OF ANGII-INDUCED HYPERTENSION AND ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT ON PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN A MOUSE MODEL FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.,OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is a treatable condition which opens important avenues for prevention of AD. Elevated angiotensin II (AngII) is an important cause of essential hypertension and has deleterious effects on endothelial function and cerebral blood flow (CBF). In this study we therefore investigated the interaction between AngII, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and MRI-measurements in the APPswe/PS1[Delta]E9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD.DESIGN AND METHOD: We studied the effect of 2 months of induced hypertension (AngII-infusion using osmotic micropumps, vs saline (sal) as control) and, subsequently (after 1 month of induced hypertension) the effect of treatment (vs placebo) with antihypertensive (eprosartan mesylate (EM), 0.35 mg/Kg vs water) on SBP and metabolite levels, functional and neuronal connectivity and CBF in 10 months-old wildtype C57bl6/j (WT) and APP/PS1 mice. SBP was monitored twice a month via tail cuff plethysmography. RsfMRI, DTI, MRS, FAIR-ASL were measured on the 11.7T magnet (Bruker BioSpec).RESULTS: In this study, chronic AngII-infusion increased BP in both transgenic and WT mice, while at 12-Month under AngII-infusion APP/PS1 mice had a higher SBP than WT mice. Furthermore, only in hypertensive AD mice cortical CBF was lowered compared to hypertensive WT mice. Additional data will be presented on the impact of AngII-induced hypertension and subsequent treatment with EM on Aβ-pathology, cognition, metabolite levels, structural and functional connectivity.CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data suggest an interaction between APP/PS1 induced pathologies, SBP, and antihypertensive treatment. Our results also reveal an association between hypertension (AngII), APP/PS1 and CBF.
26102864,0,2015,J Hypertens,4C.08: AORTIC STIFFNESS IS AN INDEPENDENT BIOMARKER OF SUBCLINICAL BRAIN DAMAGE IN ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE.,OBJECTIVE: Ischemic stroke may be the first manifestation of cerebrovascular disease. However, subclinical organ complications of underlying arterial stiffness and hypertension may coexist and stratify outcome. The study aimed to examine measures of arterial stiffness and blood pressure (BP) on subclinical brain damage in acute ischemic stroke patients.DESIGN AND METHOD: In a prospective study, we enrolled 132 (68,6% males) patients with acute ischemic stroke, AIS (age 62.2 ± 12.2 years, admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 7.1 ± 6.5, mean ± SD). Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CF-PWV), central augmentation index (cAIx), as well as central and peripheral BPs were measured (SphygmoCor, Omron, respectively) one week after stroke onset. The presence of brain subclinical lesions was graded on admission computed tomography scans using van Swieten criteria with any relevant cerebral small vessel disease considered as brain microvascular damage.RESULTS: In univariate analysis, high carotid-femoral PWV (p = 0.00005), and high cAIx (p = 0.02) were significantly associated with brain microvascular damage. Age, presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous ischemic stroke, but not BP values, also predicted brain outcome. In multivariate analysis, the predictive value of carotid-femoral PWV remained significant (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.62; p = 0.02). By contrast, cAIx had no significant predictive value after adjustment.CONCLUSIONS: Increased aortic stiffness is associated with brain microvascular disease in patients with acute ischemic stroke, beyond and above classical risk factors. PWV provides a useful new tool for identification of subclinical brain damage in AIS.
26102863,0,2015,J Hypertens,4C.07: RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION, CLINIC AND AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE AND BLOOD PRESSURE VARIABILITY: RESULTS FROM THE PAMELA STUDY.,OBJECTIVE: The relation between blood pressure (BP) and cognitive function has received growing interest in recent years. Some cross-sectional studies have shown an inverse association between BP and cognitive dysfunction, while longitudinal studies yield mixed results.DESIGN AND METHOD: In the PAMELA study cognitive function was assessed via minimental test at the evaluation performed in 2001-2002, taking as reference clinic data collected at the 1st PAMELA examination carried out 10 yrs before. 471 subjects participated at this substudy. Measurements included clinic and 24-hour BP (Spacelabs 90207). BP variability was obtained by calculating 1) the SD of 24-hour, day, and night mean values, 2) the day/night BP difference and (3) the residual or erratic BP variability (Fourier spectral analysis).RESULTS: Mean age of the subjects enrolled was 63.0 ± 5.7 yrs (mean ± SD) at the 1St examination. At the 2nd evaluation performed 10 yrs later 26 subjects had a minimental score &lt; 23, indicative of a cognitive dysfunction (CD), the remaining 445 showing normal scores (C, 24-30). For similar heart rate, office and home systolic (but not diastolic) BP were, although not significantly, greater in CD than in C (148.0 ± 22.5 vs 143.5 ± 19.9 and 139.5 ± 15.14 vs 133.3 ± 17.9 mmHg, P = NS). 24hour BP was similar in CD and C, this being the case also for 24 hour BP variability, expressed as SD systolic (15.3 ± 4.1 vs 14.8 ± 3.7 mmHg, P = NS) and diastolic (12.9 ± 3.47 vs 12.2 ± 2.9 mmHg, P = NS) or day/night BP difference. In contrast, residual BP variability was significantly greater in CD than in C for both systolic (11.2 ± 2.2 vs 10.6 ± 2.5 mmHg, P &lt; 0.05) and diastolic (9.3 ± 2.1 vs 8.7 ± 2.3 mmHg, P &lt; 0.05), the difference between groups being greater when the grading of minimental responses was based on 3 score categories (0-20,21-24 and &gt;24). This was particularly the case in males.CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the most sensitive prognostic variable for the development of cognitive alterations does not appear to be absolute BP load or absolute BP variability but rather its short-term erratic component, which has been previously shown to represent the part of BP variability with major impact on cardiovascular mortality.
26102862,0,2015,J Hypertens,4C.06: COGNITIVE STATUS IN HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. HEART AND BRAIN STUDY IN ARGENTINE.,OBJECTIVE: Know the cognitive status of hypertensive patients, the prevalence of the cognitive impairment and its association with different parameters of hypertensive disease.DESIGN AND METHOD: Multicenter study (18 centers) distributed in 5 regions of the Argentine. Epidemiological, cross and observational study. In the Heart and Brain Study, 1281 hypertensive patients, &gt;/ = 21 years, both sexes were included. The sample was obtained by patients attending cardiology clinic. A validated survey with closed answers was used. Blood pressure (BP) was obtained according to international norms. The hypertensives patients were divided in two groups: treated/controlled (&lt;/ = 140 and &lt;/ = 90 mm Hg) and treated/no-controlled (&gt;140 y &gt;90 mm Hg). The education levels was registered. Cognition was assessed by Mini-Mental Statement Examination (MMSE) (global cognition), Clock drawing test (executive function), mini-Boston Naming Test (mBNT)(semantic memory). The cut-off of the test were: 1) MMSE &lt;/ = 24 pts., CDT &lt;/ = 5 pts., mBNT &lt;/ = 9 pts. (applied in patients &gt;/ = 60 years with &gt;/ = 7 years education).RESULTS: Average age was 60,2 ± 13,5 yrs, 71% female (n = 881). In the treated /controlled group (n = 570; 46,0%) the BP (SBP 125.8 ± 9.7 mm Hg and DBP 75.9 ± 8.4 mm Hg) was lower than treated/no-controlled group (SBP 155.5 ± 18.4 mm Hg and DBP 88.7 ± 11.6 mm Hg) (p &lt;0.001). In the treated/no-controlled group, higher OR for poor outcomes in mini-BNT was observed (OR = 1.36; CI 95%, 1.04-1.75, p = 0.021), ajusting for age, sex and education level in the logistic regression model. The 22.1% presented impairment in global cognition, 36.2% executive dysfunction and 48.9% impairment semantic memory. In the one way analysis of variance, high pulse pressure was associated with poor outcomes in CDT (&lt;0.0036) and mini-BNT (&lt;0.001), whereas that SBP was associated with poor outcomes in mini-BNT (&lt;0.001). But, after ajusting (age, sex, education) in the linear regression model the miniBNT was the only test associated with high BP (p 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of hypertensive patients impairment of the semantic memory (cortical function) was more prevalent than executive dysfunction (sub-cortical). The miniBNT was the only test associated with high BP in treated/no-controlled group. Hypertension could impact negatively on cortical structures as well as the known subcortical.
26102861,0,2015,J Hypertens,4C.05: PWV IS AN INDEPENDENT DETERMINANT OF COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION IN CKD PATIENTS.,OBJECTIVE: Cognitive dysfunction has long been recognized as a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), through several putative mechanisms, including high BP, large and small artery damage. Our study tests the hypothesis that large artery stiffness and microvascular damage are related to brain microcirculation changes as reflected by impaired cognitive function in CKD patients.(Figure is included in full-text article.)DESIGN AND METHOD: : Two hundred seventeen patients (50 with CKD stage 1; 67 stage 2; 53 stage 3; 47 stage 4), with mean age 58.4 years (64.5% males), were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Cognitive function was assessed using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Full score on the MMSE is 30; cognitive impairment was defined as &lt;26 and cognitive dysfunction as &lt;19. Educational level was categorized as lower versus higher education. Using the Sphygmocor system and an oscillometric device, we directly measured brachial SBP (bSBP) and pulse pressure (bPP), carotid SBP (cSBP) and pulse pressure (cPP) and estimated aortic SBP (aSBP) and pulse pressure (aPP) from the radial pressure waveform. Pulse Pressure Amplification (PPA), augmentation index (AIx) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) were calculated.RESULTS: The risk of cognitive dysfunction increased significantly from CKD stage 3 to 4 (p &lt; 0.01). Table. In univariate analysis, age (p &lt; 0.001), education level (p &lt; 0.001) stages of CKD (p &lt; 0.004), cfPWV (p &lt; 0.029), AIx (p &lt; 0.03), bSBP (p &lt; 0.002), aSBP (p &lt; 0.012), cSBP (p &lt; 0.015) and cPP (p &lt; 0.002) were significantly and negatively associated with MMSE. In multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for CKD stages, the remaining independent factor significantly (p &lt; 0.02) associated with cognitive dysfunction was cfPWV.CONCLUSIONS: Carotid-femoral PWV may be a more sensitive marker of cognitive dysfunction than other parameters of central blood pressure. Since high cfPWV is associated with high pressure pulsatility at the cerebrovascular level, these data suggest that the later could play a pathophysiological role in cognitive dysfunction. In clinical practice, measuring aortic stiffness may help predicting the cognitive decline. Whether, the reduction in aortic stiffness following treatment translates into improved cognitive outcomes remains to be determined.
26102860,0,2015,J Hypertens,4C.04: TRENDS IN ADMISSION BLOOD PRESSURE IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE STROKE AND TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK: THE NATIONAL ACUTE STROKE ISRAELI SURVEY (NASIS).,OBJECTIVE: Elevated blood pressure (BP) is commonly observed during an acute stroke and is often higher in patients with a history of hypertension. Several studies have shown that elevated admission systolic BP during acute stroke is associated with unfavorable outcome. Management of hypertension has been improved in recent years leading to a higher rate of BP control. Our aim was to evaluate trends in admission BP levels in patients admitted with acute stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) over the past decade.DESIGN AND METHOD: Data were based on the triennial 2-month period (February to March 2004, March to April 2007, April to May 2010) National Acute Stroke Israeli Registry. The study population comprised 6177 patients, aged above 18 years who were hospitalized with acute stroke or TIA and had data on BP levels on admission. Among those who were included in the study, 4382 had ischemic stroke, 1227 had TIA and 476 had intracerebral hemorrhage. We compared patients' characteristics and temporal trends of admission BP and antihypertensive therapy before admission.RESULTS: Admission systolic BP (SBP) decreased from161 ± 29 mm Hg in 2004 to 153 ± 28 mm Hg in 2010 (p &lt; 0.001). This trend was observed in patients with hypertension (164 ± 29 to 156 ± 28) and in those without hypertension (148 ± 26 to 140 ± 21). Similar tredns were observed for patients with TIA. The use of three or more antihypertensive agents increased from 16.9% in 2004 to 20% in 2010 (p = 0.02). In patients with acute stroke, admission SBP was associated with stroke severity (p &lt; 0.001). Rate of disability at discharge or in-hospital death decreased from 71.3% in 2004 to 64.8% in 2010 (p &lt; .0001). Admission SBP was associated with in-hospital death or short-term disability with an adjusted OR, for 10 mmHg change in SBP, of 1.040 (95% CI; 1.011-1.071).CONCLUSIONS: Admission SBP in patients with acute stroke and TIA decreased over the years and may contribute to the improved outcome in these patients.
26102859,0,2015,J Hypertens,4C.03: SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN OLDER SUBJECTS AT RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.,OBJECTIVE: To test the cross-sectional and longitudinal association of heart rate variability measured from 10-second electrocardiogram recordings with cognitive function in older subjects at high risk of cardiovascular disease.DESIGN AND METHOD: We studied 3,583 men and women, mean age 75.0 years, who were enrolled in PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) study. From baseline 10-second electrocardiograms the standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals was calculated as the index of heart rate variability. Four domains of cognitive function testing reaction time, processing speed and immediate and delayed memory were assessed at baseline and repeated during a mean follow-up of 3.2 years. Using analyses of covariance, we calculated the adjusted mean values of baseline and annual changes of cognitive scores in thirds of heart rate variability.RESULTS: Participants with lower heart rate variability had worse cognitive function at baseline including reaction time, processing speed and immediate and delayed memory (all p-values &lt; 0.05). In longitudinal analysis, participants with lower heart rate variability had a steeper cognitive decline in reaction time (mean annual change of: 1.49 seconds in the lowest tertile, 0.84 seconds in the middle tertile and 1.06 seconds in the highest tertile, p-value = 0.05) and processing speed (mean annual change of: -0.51 digits coded in the lowest tertile, -0.45 digits coded in the middle tertile and -0.35 digits coded in the highest tertile, p-value = 0.009). There was no significant difference in annual changes of immediate and delayed memory between heart rate variability groups. All these associations remained unchanged after adjustment for medications, cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidities.CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that lower heart rate variability measured from 10-second electrocardiogram recording is associated with worse executive function at baseline as well as future decline in executive function independent of cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidities.
26102858,0,2015,J Hypertens,4C.02: PROLONGED ANGIOTENSIN II-INDUCED HYPERTENSION IMPAIRS SHORT-TERM MEMORY IN ADULT MICE.,OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment is a major disability increasing due to population ageing. Hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of vascular cognitive impairment. However the contribution of hypertension in the pathological cascade of vascular cognitive impairment remains elusive. Although few cardiovascular models have shown to be relevant for the study of vascular cognitive impairment, chronic hypertensive models with established cognitive impairment are lacking. In particular working and short-term memories have never been investigated. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the impact of prolonged Angiotensin II-induced hypertension on working and short-term memories in adult mice.DESIGN AND METHOD: 3-4 months old male C57BL/6 mice were infused during 3 months with Angiotensin II at a dose of 2000 ng/kg/min (Ang II, n = 10) or saline (Control, n = 10) via osmotic minipumps. Blood pressure was measured weekly by the tail-cuff method. Garcia neurological test was used to assess motor and behavioural functions to detect eventual stroke signs. Working memory was assessed in a Y-maze during an alternation task over 3 months. Finally, evaluation of short-term memory was performed during an object location task (1 h intertrial). The resulting discrimination index d2 calculated is an indication of recognition of the novel location of the objects.RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure increased and reached a plateau after 4 weeks (Figure, panel A). Neurological score was unchanged in both groups, suggesting absence of stroke. The percentage of alternations was significantly higher in both groups than the chance level of 50% (p &lt; 0.05) indicating a functional working memory in both groups. While the alternation rate did not differ between Ang II and Control (pint 0.14, pAngII 0.93, ptime 0.51), the discrimination index d2 was different from zero (no discrimination) in Control (p &lt; 0.001) but not in Ang II (p = 0.48) and tended to differ between both groups (p = 0.06) (Figure, panel B).(Figure is included in full-text article.)CONCLUSIONS: : In conclusion, we show for the first time that prolonged Angiotensin II-induced hypertension impairs short-term memory in adult mice. Immunohistochemical investigations of brain sections are being done to identify the structural damage involved in this hypertensive model of short-term memory impairment.
26102857,0,2015,J Hypertens,4C.01: LIFETIME OBESITY, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY FROM THE 1946 BIRTH COHORT.,OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a major risk factor for cognitive impairment and increases risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). As CVD in itself is a risk factor for cognitive impairment, we assessed the influence of cardiovascular (CV) phenotypes on the association between lifetime exposure to obesity and midlife memory function.(Figure is included in full-text article.)DESIGN AND METHOD: : 233 participants of the National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) Study, with lifetime measures of BMI (36, 43, 53, and 60-64 years) and CV risk factors, vascular phenotypes (carotid intima-media thickness, cIMT, aortic pulse wave velocity, aPWV, and aortic calcification score, AAC-8) and cognitive data (word memory test, WMT) at 60-64 years were included in this study. Patterns of BMI change over 30 years were identified. Multivariable linear regression models (with adjustments for sex, heart rate, education and CV risk factors) were used to establish the associations between cross-sectional and lifetime measures of adiposity with memory function as well as the influence of vascular phenotypes on these associations.RESULTS: At 60-64 years old, obese participants had lower WMT performance (P &lt; 0.001), higher cIMT (P &lt; 0.001), aPWV (P &lt; 0.002) and AAC-8 (P = 0.012) compared to their normal weight peers. aPWV and AAC-8 (P &lt; 0.001 for both) but not cIMT were negatively associated with performance at the WMT. The association between BMI with WMT remained significant following adjustments for aPWV and CV risk factors (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, adjustment for BMI and CV risk factors did not affect the association between aPWV and WMT (P = 0.009). Longer exposure to adiposity was associated with lower memory function (P-trend &lt; 0.001) and higher aPWV (P-trend = 0.043) at 60-64 years. Individuals who, at any point, dropped one BMI category had memory function and vascular phenotypes similar to normal weight subjects (P = 0.431 and P = 0.914, respectively). The beneficial effect of wieght loss on memory function was lost if people re-gained weight (Figures 1A and 1B).CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime exposure to adiposity increases aortic stiffness and reduces memory function. These impacts are potentially reversible with weight loss. However, once vascular damage is established, its impact on memory function is likely to be independent from current BMI and CV risk factors levels.
26102741,0,2015,J Hypertens,1D.06: LONGITUDINAL EVALUATION OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK AFTER PEDIATRIC KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION.,OBJECTIVE: Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) carry an increased cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular death is the second leading cause of death in children after renal transplantation. The 4C-T (Cardiovascular Comorbidity in Children with CKD and Transplantation) study evaluates cardiovascular target organ damage longitudinally in children prior to and after renal transplantation.DESIGN AND METHOD: The multicenter, prospective, observational 4C study enrolled 736 children aged 6 to 17 years with estimated GFR &lt;40 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 55 Pediatric Nephrology centres from 12 European countries. Of these, 226 have started renal replacement therapy (RRT) and entered the 4C-T sub-study. At annual study visits, the morphology and function of the heart and large arteries were monitored by noninvasive methods.RESULTS: 176 of the 226 patients on RRT had at least one visit after RRT start and were included in this analysis. 70 patients had started dialysis and 106 received a transplant. 62% of the patients were transplanted pre-emptively. Overall patients carried a higher cardiovascular risk compared to the age-matched general population as documented by elevated age-adjusted aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). Factors determining PWV, IMT and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were analysed using mixed longitudinal modelling (table).(Figure is included in full-text article.)CONCLUSIONS: : Our data is consistent with the hypothesis that transplantation lowers cardiovascular risk. Mixed modeling allowed to decipher the positive effect of transplantation from interfering cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and PTH.
26102403,0,2015,AJR Am J Roentgenol,Subcategorization of Suspicious Breast Lesions (BI-RADS Category 4) According to MRI Criteria: Role of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced and Diffusion-Weighted Imaging.,OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to investigate whether dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is adequate for subcategorization of suspicious lesions (BI-RADS category 4) and to evaluate whether use of DWI improves diagnostic performance.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group was composed of 103 suspicious lesions found in 83 subjects. Patient ages and lesion sizes were compiled, and two radiologists reanalyzed the images; subcategorized the findings as BI-RADS 4A, 4B, or 4C; and calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. The stratified variables were tested by univariate analysis and inserted in two multivariate predictive models, which were used to generate ROC curves and compare AUCs. Positive predictive values (PPVs) for each subcategory and ADC level were calculated, and interobserver agreement was tested.RESULTS: Forty-four (42.7%) suspicious findings proved malignant. Except for age (p = 0.08), all stratified predictor variables were significant in univariate analyses (p &lt; 0.01). Logistic regression models did not differ substantially after comparison of the ROC curves (p = 0.09), but the one including ADC values was slightly better: AUC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.95) against AUC of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.78-0.93). PPV increased progressively in each BI-RADS 4 subcategory (4A, 0.15; 4B, 0.37; 4C, 0.84). ADC values of 1.10 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s or less had the second highest PPV (0.77). Interobserver agreement was substantial at a kappa value of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.70-0.90; p &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: Risk stratification of suspicious lesions (BI-RADS category 4) can be satisfactorily performed with DCE-MRI and slightly improved when DWI is introduced.
26095922,0,2015,J Appl Microbiol,Identification of high-risk Listeria monocytogenes serotypes in lineage I (serotype 1/2a, 1/2c, 3a, and 3c) using multiplex PCR.,AIMS: Using molecular subtyping techniques, Listeria monocytogenes is divided into three major phylogenetic lineages, and a multiplex PCR method can differentiate five L. monocytogenes subgroups: 1/2a-3a, 1/2c-3c, 1/2b-3b-7, 4b-4d-4e, and 4a-4c. In the current study, we conducted genome comparisons and evaluated serotype-associated genes for their utility as a multiplex PCR-based method for distinguishing high-risk serotypes 1/2a and 1/2c in lineage I from low-risk serotypes 3a and 3c.METHODS AND RESULTS: Primer sets were developed that are specific for serotype 1/2c (LMOSLCC2372_0308) and serotype 3a (LMLG_0742). These primers were then tested in a multiplex format with primers specific for serotype 1/2a (flaA) to separate serotypes 1/2a, 1/2c, 3a, and 3c using 25 strains of lineage I L. monocytogenes.CONCLUSIONS: Here for the first time we report primers specific for L. monocytogenes serotype 1/2c and serotype 3a, and we demonstrate a multiplex PCR method for separating the four serotypes of lineage I L. monocytogenes.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The described multiplex PCR assay consistently showed successful separation of 1/2a and 1/2c strains from 3a and 3c strains. PCR is routinely performed in many diagnostic and epidemiologic investigations for L. monocytogenes, and these primers should increase the feasibility and accessibility of L. monocytogenes serotyping.

26088545,0,2015,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis and Characterization of New 1,2,4-Triazolo[1,5-a]pyridines That Extend the Life Span of Caenorhabiditis elegans via Their Anti-Inflammatory/Antioxidant Effects.,In the present study, we describe the synthesis of a new set of 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyridines and their fused ring systems. The products were assayed for various types of biological activities like anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activity. Compounds 4c, 4f, 12a, 14, 16, and 19 were found to reduce carrageenan- and dextran-induced inflammation in rats. In addition, compounds 4f and 12a were found to have antioxidative radical scavenging activity. Furthermore, these compounds were tested in the model system Caenorhabiditis elegans and there increased heat stress resistance, reduced the formation of advanced glycation end products, and finally extended the life span.
26080616,0,2015,Public Health Nutr,Food and beverage cues in children's television programmes: the influence of programme genre.,OBJECTIVE: The link between childhood obesity and both television viewing and television advertising have previously been examined. We sought to investigate the frequency and type of food and beverage placements in children-specific television broadcasts and, in particular, differences between programme genres.METHOD: Content of five weekdays of children-specific television broadcasting on both UK (BBC) and Irish (RTE) television channels was summarized. Food and beverage placements were coded based on type of product, product placement, product use and characters involved. A comparison was made between different programme genres: animated, cartoon, child-specific, film, quiz, tween and young persons' programming.RESULTS: A total of 1155 (BBC=450; RTE=705) cues were recorded giving a cue every 4·2 min, an average of 12·3 s/cue. The genre with most cues recorded was cartoon programming (30·8 %). For the majority of genres, cues related to sweet snacks (range 1·8-23·3 %) and sweets/candy (range 3·6-25·8 %) featured highly. Fast-food (18·0 %) and sugar-sweetened beverage (42·3 %) cues were observed in a high proportion of tween programming. Celebratory/social motivation factors (range 10-40 %) were most common across all genres while there were low proportions of cues based on reward, punishment or health-related motivating factors.CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence for the prominence of energy-dense/nutrient-poor foods and beverages in children's programming. Of particular interest is the high prevalence of fast-food and sugar-sweetened beverage cues associated with tween programming. These results further emphasize the need for programme makers to provide a healthier image of foods and beverages in children's television.
26077489,0,2015,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel m-carborane-containing estrogen receptor partial agonists as SERM candidates.,We designed and synthesized novel m-carborane-containing selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) candidates using previously reported m-carborane-containing ER partial agonist 1 as the lead compound. Biological activities were evaluated by means of ERα competitive binding assay and MCF-7 cell proliferation assay. Re-positioning the N,N-dimethylaminoethyloxy group at the para position of 1 to the meta position enhanced the ERα-binding affinity, and 4c showed the highest relative binding affinity (RBA: 83 vs 17β-estradiol=100) among the tested compounds. Compound 4b showed the most potent ER-agonist activity (EC50: 1.4nM) and the lowest maximal efficacy (Emax: 50%) in MCF-7 cell proliferation assay. Inhibition of 0.1nM 17β-estradiol-induced MCF-7 cell proliferation by 4b (IC50: 0.4μM) was at least 10 times more potent than that of the lead compound 1.
26077389,0,2015,FEBS J,Structural characterization of human galectin-4 C-terminal domain: elucidating the molecular basis for recognition of glycosphingolipids, sulfated saccharides and blood group antigens.,Human galectin-4 is a lectin that is expressed mainly in the gastrointestinal tract and exhibits metastasis-promoting roles in some cancers. Its tandem-repeat nature exhibits two distinct carbohydrate recognition domains allowing crosslinking by simultaneous binding to sulfated and non-sulfated (but not sialylated) glycosphingolipids and glycoproteins, facilitating stabilization of lipid rafts. Critically, galectin-4 exerts favourable or unfavourable effects depending upon the cancer. Here we report the first X-ray crystallographic structural information on human galectin-4, specifically the C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain of human (galectin-4C) in complex with lactose, lactose-3'-sulfate, 2'-fucosyllactose, lacto-N-tetraose and lacto-N-neotetraose. These structures enable elucidation of galectin-4C binding fine-specificity towards sulfated and non-sulfated lacto- and neolacto-series sphingolipids as well as to human blood group antigens. Analysis of the lactose-3'-sulfate complex structure shows that galectin-4C does not recognize the sulfate group using any specific amino acid, but binds the ligand nonetheless. Complex structures with lacto-N-tetraose and lacto-N-neotetraose displayed differences in binding interactions exhibited by the non-reducing-end galactose. That of lacto-N-tetraose points outward from the protein surface whereas that of lacto-N-neotetraose interacts directly with the protein. Recognition patterns of human galectin-4C towards lacto- and neolacto-series glycosphingolipids are similar to those of human galectin-3; however, detailed scrutiny revealed differences stemming from the extended binding site that offer distinction in ligand profiles of these two galectins. Structural characterization of the complex with 2'-fucosyllactose, a carbohydrate with similarity to the H antigen, and molecular dynamics studies highlight structural features that allow specific recognition of A and B antigens, whilst a lack of interaction with the 2'-fucose of blood group antigens was revealed.DATABASE ACCESSION CODES: 4YLZ, 4YM0, 4YM1, 4YM2, 4YM3.
26068564,0,2015,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,Use of Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccines in Persons Aged ≥10 Years at Increased Risk for Serogroup B Meningococcal Disease: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, 2015.,In October 2014, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed the first serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccine (MenB-FHbp [Trumenba, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]) as a 3-dose series. In January 2015, FDA licensed a second MenB vaccine (MenB-4C [Bexsero, Novartis Vaccines]) as a 2-dose series. Both vaccines were approved for use in persons aged 10-25 years. Following outbreaks of serogroup B meningococcal disease on two college campuses in 2013, both MenB vaccines were granted Breakthrough Therapy designations, which expedites drug development and review by FDA, and were licensed based on accelerated approval regulations. On February 26, 2015, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended use of MenB vaccines among certain groups of persons aged ≥10 years who are at increased risk for serogroup B meningococcal disease. This report summarizes information on MenB administration and provides recommendations and guidance for use of these vaccines among persons aged ≥10 years in certain groups who are at increased risk for serogroup B meningococcal disease, and reviews the evidence considered by ACIP to make these recommendations. Recommendations for broader use of MenB vaccines in adolescents and college students will be considered separately by ACIP.
26066495,0,2015,Dalton Trans,Aluminum complexes based on pyridine substituted alcohols: synthesis, structure, and catalytic application in ROP.,A series of substituted pyridine dialcohols (2,6-bis(hydroxyalkyl)pyridines), 1-4, was used for the synthesis of various types of aluminum complexes. Aluminum methyl derivatives, 2-4a, were obtained by the reaction of AlMe3 with the corresponding ligand or transmetallation reactions of germylenes. Aluminum chloride complexes, 3-4b, were obtained by substitution of the Me group under the action of chlorinating agents. Methoxy-, 2-4c, or benzyloxy-, 2d, aluminum complexes were synthesized in transalkoxylation reaction of Me2Al(OX) (X = Me, Bn) by the corresponding ligand. All complexes obtained were thoroughly investigated by multinuclear NMR and X-ray analysis. It has been established that the structure of the ligand (number of carbon atoms) determines the nature of the complexes formed. Compounds were used as initiators of ring-opening polymerization of l-lactide and ε-caprolactone and showed moderate activity with controlled or immortal character.
26061284,0,2015,Chem Biol Drug Des,Synthesis, Biological Evaluation, and Docking of Dihydropyrazole Sulfonamide Containing 2-hydroxyphenyl Moiety: A Series of Novel MMP-2 Inhibitors.,In this study, we synthesized a series of dihydropyrazole sulfonamide derivatives containing 2-hydroxyphenyl moiety as antitumor agents to target the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). All of the synthesized compounds were examined by bioactivity assays, in which compound 4c turned out as a potential antagonist of MMP-2 along with potent anticancer activity against four tumor cell lines. Structure-activity relationship analysis was also performed to examine how structural changes impacted the bioactivity. Suggested to be caused by the induction of apoptosis, the antitumor mechanism of 4c was further confirmed by PI combining with annexin V-FITC staining assay using flow cytometry analysis. These new findings along with molecular docking observations suggested that compound 4c could be developed as a potential anticancer agent.
26060130,0,2015,Phys Chem Chem Phys,Ternary B2X2H2 (X = O and S) rhombic clusters and their potential use as inorganic ligands in sandwich-type (B2X2H2)2Ni complexes.,Based upon global searches and electronic structure calculations at the B3LYP and CCSD(T) levels, we present the global-minimum structures of two ternary B-O-H and B-S-H rhombic clusters: D2h B2O2H2 (, (1)Ag) and C2v B2S2H2 (, (1)A1). Both species feature a B2X2 (X = O or S) four-membered ring as the core, with two H atoms attached terminally. The former cluster is perfectly planar, whereas the latter undergoes a slight butterfly distortion. Bonding analyses reveal a four-center four-electron (4c-4e) o-bond in these clusters, which are 4π systems in a nonbonding/bonding combination, in contrast to an antibonding/bonding combination in a classical 4π antiaromatic hydrocarbon such as cyclobutadiene (C4H4). Clusters and are considered to be aromatic. The present results also help elucidate the bonding nature in the relevant heteroatomic ring B2N2H4 system and suggest that it is not appropriate to consider B2N2H4 as an inorganic cyclobutadiene, a conception that has been in existence in the literature for over 40 years. The electronic properties of the global-minimum clusters and are predicted. It is shown that B2O2H2 () and B2S2H2 () may serve as effective inorganic ligands to form sandwich-type transition metal complexes, such as D2d [B2O2H2]2Ni () and D2d [B2S2H2]2Ni ().
26059817,0,2015,J Cell Physiol,C-ing the Genome: A Compendium of Chromosome Conformation Capture Methods to Study Higher-Order Chromatin Organization.,Three-dimensional organization of the chromatin has important roles in transcription, replication, DNA repair, and pathologic events such as translocations. There are two fundamental ways to study higher-order chromatin organization: microscopic and molecular approaches. In this review, we briefly introduce the molecular approaches, focusing on chromosome conformation capture or&quot;3C&quot; technology and its derivatives, which can be used to probe chromatin folding at resolutions beyond that provided by microscopy techniques. We further discuss the different types of data generated by the 3C-based methods and how they can be used to answer distinct biological questions. This article is protected by copyright.

26059046,0,2015,Am J Med Genet A,A de novo 1.58 Mb deletion, including MAP2K6 and mapping 1.28 Mb upstream to SOX9, identified in a patient with Pierre Robin sequence and osteopenia with multiple fractures.,Defects of long-range regulatory elements of dosage-sensitive genes represent an under-recognized mechanism underlying genetic diseases. Haploinsufficiency of SOX9, the gene essential for development of testes and differentiation of chondrocytes, results in campomelic dysplasia, a skeletal malformation syndrome often associated with sex reversal. Chromosomal rearrangements with breakpoints mapping up to 1.6 Mb up- and downstream to SOX9, and disrupting its distant cis-regulatory elements, have been described in patients with milder forms of campomelic dysplasia, Pierre Robin sequence, and sex reversal. We present an ∼1.58 Mb deletion mapping ∼1.28 Mb upstream to SOX9 that encompasses its putative long-range cis-regulatory element(s) and MAP2K6 in a patient with Pierre Robin sequence and osteopenia with multiple fractures. Low bone mass panel testing using massively parallel sequencing of 23 nuclear genes, including COL1A1 and COL1A2 was negative. Based on the previous mouse model of Map2k6, suggesting that Sox9 is likely a downstream target of the p38 MAPK pathway, and our previous chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) data showing potential interactions between SOX9 promoter and MAP2K6, we hypothesize that deletion of MAP2K6 might have affected SOX9 expression and contributed to our patient's phenotype. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
26054925,0,2015,Org Biomol Chem,One-pot three-component domino protocol for the synthesis of novel pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidines as antimicrobial and anti-biofilm agents.,A simple and facile synthesis of a series of novel pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidines has been achieved successfully via the one-pot three-component reaction of 2-amino-7-methyl-5-oxo-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydropyrano[4,3-b]pyran-3-carbonitriles, DMF-DMA and arylamines in the presence of 1-butyl-3-methylhydrogensulphate [Bmim]HSO4 ionic liquid. This method has several advantages such as high yields, clean reaction, simple methodology and short reaction times. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and different Candida strains. Among the derivatives screened, compounds 4c, 4d, 4h and 4l were found to be active against both bacterial and Candida strains with MIC values ranging from 3.9 to 31.2 μg mL(-1). In addition, compound 4l showed a good minimum bactericidal concentration, minimum fungicidal concentration and anti-biofilm activities. Furthermore, the mode of the antifungal action for the promising compound 4l was evaluated in C. albicans MTCC 1637 through an ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition process.
26053813,0,2015,Neurol India,First reported case of Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 4C in a child from India with SH3TC2 mutation but absent spinal deformities.,Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) disease is a group of hereditary motor sensory neuropathies with significant genetic heterogeneity. This disorder has been scarcely reported in the Indian literature. Here, we report a case of the rare but relatively more severe autosomal recessive CMT type 4C disease with a few features that are distinct from its regular presentation. Our patient was proven to have one of the common mutations in the SH3TC2 gene, which has so far not been described in Indian patients.
26048798,0,2015,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Naltrindole derivatives with fluorinated ethyl substituents on the 17-nitrogen as δ opioid receptor inverse agonists.,We synthesized derivatives of the δ opioid receptor (DOR) antagonists naltrindole (NTI) and compound 1 that were modified with small alkyl or fluorinated ethyl substituents on the 17-nitrogen. Although the derivatives showed decreased binding affinities for the opioid receptors, their selectivities for the DOR were higher than the parent compounds NTI and compound 1. Surprisingly, 17-fluoroethyl NTI derivatives exerted DOR inverse agonistic activities. The DOR inverse agonism of compounds 4c-e was less efficacious but significant, as compared with a standard DOR inverse agonist ICI-174864. On the other hand, compound 1 and its derivatives with small alkyl or monofluoroethyl substituents were partial agonists, but the derivatives having di- or trifluoroethyl group showed neither agonistic nor inverse agonistic activities.
26043745,0,2015,Ann Bot,Flow sorting of C-genome chromosomes from wild relatives of wheat Aegilops markgrafii, Ae. triuncialis and Ae. cylindrica, and their molecular organization.,BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Aegilops markgrafii (CC) and its natural hybrids Ae. triuncialis (U(t)U(t)C(t)C(t)) and Ae. cylindrica (D(c)D(c)C(c)C(c)) represent a rich reservoir of useful genes for improvement of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), but the limited information available on their genome structure and the shortage of molecular (cyto-) genetic tools hamper the utilization of the extant genetic diversity. This study provides the complete karyotypes in the three species obtained after fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with repetitive DNA probes, and evaluates the potential of flow cytometric chromosome sorting.METHODS: The flow karyotypes obtained after the analysis of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained chromosomes were characterized and the chromosome content of the peaks on the flow karyotypes was determined by FISH. Twenty-nine conserved orthologous set (COS) markers covering all seven wheat homoeologous chromosome groups were used for PCR with DNA amplified from flow-sorted chromosomes and genomic DNA.KEY RESULTS: FISH with repetitive DNA probes revealed that chromosomes 4C, 5C, 7C(t), T6U(t)S.6U(t)L-5C(t)L, 1C(c) and 5D(c) could be sorted with purities ranging from 66 to 91 %, while the remaining chromosomes could be sorted in groups of 2-5. This identified a partial wheat-C-genome homology for group 4 and 5 chromosomes. In addition, 1C chromosomes were homologous with group 1 of wheat; a small segment from group 2 indicated 1C-2C rearrangement. An extensively rearranged structure of chromosome 7C relative to wheat was also detected.CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of purifying Aegilops chromosomes provides an attractive opportunity to investigate the structure and evolution of the Aegilops C genome and to develop molecular tools to facilitate the identification of alien chromatin and support alien introgression breeding in bread wheat.
26042076,0,2015,Front Psychol,Motivational and evolutionary aspects of a physical exercise training program: a longitudinal study.,Several studies have indicated that motivational level and prior expectations influence one's commitment to physical activity. Moreover, these aspects are not properly described in terms of proximal (SDT, Self Determination Theory) and distal (evolutionary) explanations in the literature. This paper aims to verify if level of motivation (BREQ-2, Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-2) and expectations regarding regular physical exercise (IMPRAF-54) before starting a 1-year exercise program could determine likelihood of completion. Ninety-four volunteers (53 women) included a completed protocol group (CPG; n = 21) and drop-out group (n = 73). The IMPRAF-54 scale was used to assess six different expectations associated with physical activity, and the BREQ-2 inventory was used to assess the level of motivation in five steps (from amotivation to intrinsic motivation). Both questionnaires were assessed before starting a regular exercise program. The CPG group presented higher sociability and lower pleasure scores according to IMPRAF-54 domains. A logistic regression analysis showed that a one-point increment on sociability score increased the chance of completing the program by 10%, and the same one-point increment on pleasure score reduced the chance of completing the protocol by 16%. ROC curves were also calculated to establish IMPRAF-54 cutoffs for adherence (Sociability - 18.5 points - 81% sensibility/50% specificity) and dropout (Pleasure - 25.5 points - 86% sensibility/20% specificity) of the exercise protocol. Our results indicate that an expectation of social interaction was a positive factor in predicting adherence to exercise. Grounded in SDT and its innate needs (competence, autonomy, relatedness), physical exercise is not an end; it is a means to achieve autonomy and self-cohesion. The association of physical activity with social practices, as occurs in hunter-gathering groups, can engage people to be physically active and can provide better results in adherence exercise programs for the general population.
26041565,0,2015,Br J Surg,Systematic review of intervention design and delivery in pragmatic and explanatory surgical randomized clinical trials.,BACKGROUND: Surgical interventions are complex, with multiple components that require consideration in trial reporting. This review examines the reporting of details of surgical interventions in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) within the context of explanatory and pragmatic study designs.METHODS: Systematic searches identified RCTs of surgical interventions published in 2010 and 2011. Included studies were categorized as predominantly explanatory or pragmatic. The extent of intervention details in the reports were compared with the CONSORT statement for reporting trials of non-pharmacological treatments (CONSORT-NPT). CONSORT-NPT recommends reporting the descriptions of surgical interventions, whether they were standardized and adhered to (items 4a, 4b and 4c). Reporting of the context of intervention delivery (items 3 and 15) and operator expertise (item 15) were assessed.RESULTS: Of 4541 abstracts and 131 full-text articles, 80 were included (of which 39 were classified as predominantly pragmatic), reporting 160 interventions. Descriptions of 129 interventions (80·6 per cent) were provided. Standardization was mentioned for 47 (29·4 per cent) of the 160 interventions, and 22 articles (28 per cent) reported measurement of adherence to at least one aspect of the intervention. Seventy-one papers (89 per cent) provided some information about context. For one-third of interventions (55, 34·4 per cent), some data were provided regarding the expertise of personnel involved. Reporting standards were similar in trials classified as pragmatic or explanatory.CONCLUSION: The lack of detail in trial reports about surgical interventions creates difficulties in understanding which operations were actually evaluated. Methods for designing and reporting surgical interventions in RCTs, contributing to the quality of the overall study design, are required. This should allow better implementation of trial results into practice.
26041439,0,2015,Andrology,Relaxin affects cell organization and early and late stages of spermatogenesis in a coculture of rat testicular cells.,Relaxin and its receptor RXFP1 are co-expressed in Sertoli cells, and relaxin can stimulate proliferation of Sertoli cells. In this study, we investigated a role of relaxin in spermatogenesis, using a short-term culture of testicular cells of the rat that allowed differentiation of spermatogonia to spermatids. Sertoli, germ, and peritubular myoid cells were the predominant cell types in the culture. Sertoli and germ cells expressed RXFP1. Cultures were incubated without (control) or with 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 100 ng/mL H2 relaxin (RLN) for 2 days. Cell organization, number, and differentiation were analyzed after 2 (D2), 5 (D5) or 8 (D8) days of culturing. Although the proportion of germ cells decayed from D2 to D5, the relative contribution of HC, 1C, 2C, and 4C germ cell populations remained constant in the control group during the whole culture. RLN did not affect the proportion of germ cell populations compared with control, but increased gene and/or protein expression of the undifferentiated and differentiated spermatogonia markers PLZF and c-KIT, and of the post-meiotic marker Odf2 in D5. RLN favored organization of cells in tubule-like structures, the arrangement of myoid cells around the tubules, arrangement of c-KIT-positive spermatogonia at the basal region of the tubules, and expression of the cell junction protein β-catenin close to the plasma membrane region. Knockdown of relaxin with small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced expression of β-catenin at the cell junctions, and shifted its expression to the nucleus. We propose that relaxin may affect spermatogenesis by modulating spermatogonial self renewal and favoring cell contact.
26034064,0,2015,Bioinformatics,FourCSeq: analysis of 4C sequencing data.,MOTIVATION: Circularized Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C) is a powerful technique for studying the spatial interactions of a specific genomic region called the 'viewpoint' with the rest of the genome, both in a single condition or comparing different experimental conditions or cell types. Observed ligation frequencies typically show a strong, regular dependence on genomic distance from the viewpoint, on top of which specific interaction peaks are superimposed. Here, we address the computational task to find these specific peaks and to detect changes between different biological conditions.RESULTS: We model the overall trend of decreasing interaction frequency with genomic distance by fitting a smooth monotonically decreasing function to suitably transformed count data. Based on the fit, z-scores are calculated from the residuals, and high z-scores are interpreted as peaks providing evidence for specific interactions. To compare different conditions, we normalize fragment counts between samples, and call for differential contact frequencies using the statistical method DESEQ2: adapted from RNA-Seq analysis.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A full end-to-end analysis pipeline is implemented in the R package FourCSeq available at www.bioconductor.org.CONTACT: felix.klein@embl.de or whuber@embl.deSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
26028125,0,2015,ACS Nano,Glassy Metal Alloy Nanofiber Anodes Employing Graphene Wrapping Layer: Toward Ultralong-Cycle-Life Lithium-Ion Batteries.,Amorphous silicon (a-Si) has been intensively explored as one of the most attractive candidates for high-capacity and long-cycle-life anode in Li-ion batteries (LIBs) primarily because of its reduced volume expansion characteristic (∼280%) compared to crystalline Si anodes (∼400%) after full Li(+) insertion. Here, we report one-dimensional (1-D) electrospun Si-based metallic glass alloy nanofibers (NFs) with an optimized composition of Si60Sn12Ce18Fe5Al3Ti2. On the basis of careful compositional tailoring of Si alloy NFs, we found that Ce plays the most important role as a glass former in the formation of the metallic glass alloy. Moreover, Si-based metallic glass alloy NFs were wrapped by reduced graphene oxide sheets (specifically Si60Sn12Ce18Fe5Al3Ti2 NFs@rGO), which can prevent the direct exposure of a-Si alloy NFs to the liquid electrolyte and stabilize the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on the surfaces of rGO sheets while facilitating electron transport. The metallic glass nanofibers exhibited superior electrochemical cell performance as an anode: (i) Si60Sn12Ce18Fe5Al3Ti2 NFs show a high specific capacity of 1017 mAh g(-1) up to 400 cycles at 0.05C with negligible capacity loss as well as superior cycling performance (nearly 99.9% capacity retention even after 2000 cycles at 0.5C); (ii) Si60Sn12Ce18Fe5Al3Ti2 NFs@rGO reveals outstanding rate behavior (569.77 mAh g(-1) after 2000 cycles at 0.5C and a reversible capacity of around 370 mAh g(-1) at 4C). We demonstrate the potential suitability of multicomponent a-Si alloy NFs as a long-cycling anode material.
26022351,0,2015,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Inhibition of breast cancer cell migration by activation of cAMP signaling.,Almost all deaths from breast cancer arise from metastasis of the transformed cells to other sites in the body. Hence, uncovering a means of inhibiting breast cancer cell migration would provide a significant advance in the treatment of this disease. Stimulation of the cAMP signaling pathway has been shown to inhibit migration and motility of a number of cell types. A very effective way of selectively stimulating cAMP signaling is through inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Therefore, we examined full expression profiles of all known PDE genes at the mRNA and protein levels in four human breast cancer cell lines and eight patients' breast cancer tissues. By these analyses, expression of almost all PDE genes was seen in both cell lines and tissues. In the cell lines, appreciable expression was seen for PDEs 1C, 2A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 4D, 5A, 6B, 6C, 7A, 7B, 8A, 9A, 10A, and 11A. In patients' tissues, appreciable expression was seen for PDEs 1A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 5A, 6B, 6C, 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B, and 9A. PDE8A mRNA in particular is prominently expressed in all cell lines and patients' tissue samples examined. We show here that stimulation of cAMP signaling with cAMP analogs, forskolin, and PDE inhibitors, including selective inhibitors of PDE3, PDE4, PDE7, and PDE8, inhibit aggressive triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell migration. Under the same conditions, these agents had little effect on breast cancer cell proliferation. This study demonstrates that PDE inhibitors inhibit breast cancer cell migration, and thus may be valuable therapeutic targets for inhibition of breast cancer metastasis. Since PDE8A is expressed in all breast cancer samples, and since dipyridamole, which inhibits PDE8, and PF-04957325, a selective PDE8 inhibitor, both inhibit migration, it suggests that PDE8A may be a valuable novel target for treatment of this disease.
26015481,0,2015,Infect Immun,Four-Component Staphylococcus aureus Vaccine 4C-Staph Enhances Fcγ Receptor Expression in Neutrophils and Monocytes and Mitigates S. aureus Infection in Neutropenic Mice.,Staphylococcus aureus is a human bacterial pathogen causing a variety of diseases. The occurrence of multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus underlines the need for a vaccine. Defining immune correlates of protection may support the design of an effective vaccine. We used a murine Staphylococcus aureus infection model, in which bacteria were inoculated in an air pouch generated on the back of the animal. Analysis of the air-pouch content in mice immunized or not with an adjuvanted multiantigen vaccine formulation, four-component S. aureus vaccine (4C-Staph), prior to infection allowed us to measure bacteria, cytokines, and 4C-Staph-specific antibodies and to analyze host immune cells recruited to the infection site. Immunization with 4C-Staph resulted in accumulation of antigen-specific antibodies in the pouch and mitigated the infection. Neutrophils were the most abundant cells in the pouch, and they showed the upregulation of Fcγ receptor (FcγR) following immunization with 4C-Staph. Reduction of the infection was also obtained in mice immunized with 4C-Staph and depleted of neutrophils; these mice showed an increase in monocytes and macrophages. Upregulation of the FcγR and the presence of antigen-specific antibodies induced by immunization with 4C-Staph may contribute to increase bacterial opsonophagocytosis. Protection in neutropenic mice indicated that an effective vaccine could activate alternative protection mechanisms compensating for neutropenia, a condition often occurring in S. aureus-infected patients.
25998045,0,2015,Ann Hum Genet,Genetic Association and Altered Gene Expression of Osteoprotegerin in Otosclerosis Patients.,Otosclerosis (OTSC) is a late-onset hearing disorder characterized by increased bone turnover in the otic capsule. Disturbed osteoprotegerin expression has been found in the otosclerotic foci which may have an important role in the pathogenesis of OTSC. To identify the genetic risk factors, we sequenced the coding region and exon-intron boundaries of the OPG gene in 254 OTSC patients and 262 controls. Sequence analysis identified five known polymorphisms c.9C&gt;G, c.30+15C&gt;T, c.400+4C&gt;T, c.768A&gt;G, and c.817+8A&gt;C. Testing of these SNPs revealed sex specific association with c.9C&gt;G in males and c.30+15C&gt;T in females after multiple correction. Furthermore, meta-analysis provided evidence of association of the c.9C&gt;G polymorphism with OTSC. In secondary analysis, we investigated the mRNA expression of OPG and associated genes RANK and RANKL in otosclerotic tissues compared to controls. Expression analysis revealed significantly missing/reduced OPG expression only in otosclerotic tissues. However, the signal sequence polymorphism c.9C&gt;G has shown no effect on OPG mRNA expression. In conclusion, our results suggest that the risk of OTSC is influenced by variations in the OPG gene along with other factors which might regulate its altered expression in otosclerotic tissues. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these observations.
25995270,0,2015,Genome Res,Topologically associating domains and their long-range contacts are established during early G1 coincident with the establishment of the replication-timing program.,Mammalian genomes are partitioned into domains that replicate in a defined temporal order. These domains can replicate at similar times in all cell types (constitutive) or at cell type-specific times (developmental). Genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) has revealed sub-megabase topologically associating domains (TADs), which are the structural counterparts of replication domains. Hi-C also segregates inter-TAD contacts into defined 3D spatial compartments that align precisely to genome-wide replication timing profiles. Determinants of the replication-timing program are re-established during early G1 phase of each cell cycle and lost in G2 phase, but it is not known when TAD structure and inter-TAD contacts are re-established after their elimination during mitosis. Here, we use multiplexed 4C-seq to study dynamic changes in chromatin organization during early G1. We find that both establishment of TADs and their compartmentalization occur during early G1, within the same time frame as establishment of the replication-timing program. Once established, this 3D organization is preserved either after withdrawal into quiescence or for the remainder of interphase including G2 phase, implying 3D structure is not sufficient to maintain replication timing. Finally, we find that developmental domains are less well compartmentalized than constitutive domains and display chromatin properties that distinguish them from early and late constitutive domains. Overall, this study uncovers a strong connection between chromatin re-organization during G1, establishment of replication timing, and its developmental control.
25993279,0,2015,Acad Med,Designing Evidence-Based Medicine Training to Optimize the Transfer of Skills From the Classroom to Clinical Practice: Applying the Four Component Instructional Design Model.,Evidence-based medicine (EBM) skills, although taught in medical schools around the world, are not optimally practiced in clinical environments because of multiple barriers, including learners' difficulty transferring EBM skills learned in the classroom to clinical practice. This lack of skill transfer may be partially due to the design of EBM training. To facilitate the transfer of EBM skills from the classroom to clinical practice, the authors explore one instructional approach, called the Four Component Instructional Design (4C/ID) model, to guide the design of EBM training. On the basis of current cognitive psychology, including cognitive load theory, the premise of the 4C/ID model is that complex skills training, such as EBM training, should include four components: learning tasks, supportive information, procedural information, and part-task practice. The combination of these four components can inform the creation of complex skills training that is designed to avoid overloading learners' cognitive abilities; to facilitate the integration of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to execute a complex task; and to increase the transfer of knowledge to new situations. The authors begin by introducing the 4C/ID model and describing the benefits of its four components to guide the design of EBM training. They include illustrative examples of educational practices that are consistent with each component and that can be applied to teaching EBM. They conclude by suggesting that medical educators consider adopting the 4C/ID model to design, modify, and/or implement EBM training in classroom and clinical settings.
25988611,0,2015,Molecules,Design, synthesis and antitubercular activity of certain nicotinic Acid hydrazides.,Three series of 6-aryl-2-methylnicotinohydrazides 4a-i, N'-arylidene-6-(4-bromophenyl)-2-methylnicotino hydrazides 7a-f, and N'-(un/substituted 2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)-6-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-methylnicotinohydrazides 8a-c were synthesized and evaluated for their potential in vitro antimycobacterial activity against M. tuberculosis. The results showed that isatin hydrazides 8a-c are remarkably more active than the parent hydrazide 4c. Hydrazides 8b and 8c exhibited the highest activity among all the tested compounds (MIC = 12.5 and 6.25 µg/mL, respectively). Compounds 8b and 8c were also devoid of apparent cytotoxicity to HT-29, PC-3, A549, HepG2 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines. Besides, 8b and 8c showed good drug-likeness scores of 0.62 and 0.41, respectively. Those two isatin hydrazides could offer an excellent framework for future development to obtain more potent antitubercular agents. The SAR study suggested that lipophilicity of the synthesized derivatives is a crucial element that accounts for their antimycobacterial activity. Finally, a theoretical kinetic study was established to predict the ADME of the active derivatives.
25985362,0,2015,Molecules,Synthesis, biological activities, and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study of novel camptothecin analogues.,In continuation of our program aimed at the development of natural product-based pesticidal agents, three series of novel camptothecin derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their biological activities against T. Cinnabarinus, B. brassicae, and B. xylophilus. All of the derivatives showed good-to-excellent activity against three insect species tested, with LC50 values ranging from 0.00761 to 0.35496 mmol/L. Remarkably, all of the compounds were more potent than CPT against T. Cinnabarinus, and compounds 4d and 4c displayed superior activity (LC50 0.00761 mmol/L and 0.00942 mmol/L, respectively) compared with CPT (LC50 0.19719 mmol/L) against T. Cinnabarinus. Based on the observed bioactivities, preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) correlations were also discussed. Furthermore, a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) was built. The model gave statistically significant results with the cross-validated q2 values of 0.580 and correlation coefficient r2 of 0.991 and  of 0.993. The QSAR analysis indicated that the size of the substituents play an important in the activity of 7-modified camptothecin derivatives. These findings will pave the way for further design, structural optimization, and development of camptothecin-derived compounds as pesticidal agents.
25973410,0,2015,J Biomed Phys Eng,Investigation of Collimator Influential Parameter on SPECT Image Quality: a Monte Carlo Study.,BACKGROUND: Obtaining high quality images in Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) device  is the most important goal in nuclear medicine. Because if image quality is low, the possibility of making a mistake in diagnosing and treating the patient will rise. Studying effective factors in spatial resolution of imaging systems is thus deemed to be vital. One of the most important factors in SPECT imaging in nuclear medicine is the use of an appropriate collimator for a certain radiopharmaceutical feature in order to create the best image as it can be effective in the quantity of Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) which is the main parameter  in spatial resolution.METHOD: In this research, the simulation of the detector and collimator of SPECT imaging device, Model HD3 made by Philips Co. and the investigation of important factors on the collimator were carried out using MCNP-4c code.RESULTS: The results of the experimental measurments and simulation calculations revealed a relative difference of less than 5% leading to the confirmation of the accuracy of conducted simulation MCNP code calculation.CONCLUSION: This is the first essential step in the design and modelling of new collimators used for creating high quality images in nuclear medicine.
25968342,0,2015,World J Surg,Proposed Minimum Rates of Surgery to Support Desirable Health Outcomes: An Observational Study Based on Three Strategies.,BACKGROUND: The global volume of surgery is estimated at 312.9 million operations annually, but rates of surgery vary dramatically. Identifying surgical rates associated with improved health outcomes would be useful for benchmarking and targeted health system strengthening.METHODS: We identified rates of surgery associated with a life expectancy (LE) of 74-75 years, a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of less than or equal to 100 per 100,000 live births, and the estimated need for surgery in the seven global burden of disease (GBD) super-regions based on the prevalence of surgical conditions. We compared our findings to surgical rates from Chile, China, Costa Rica, and Cuba (&quot;4C&quot;), countries with moderate resources but high health outcomes.RESULTS: The median surgical rates associated with LE of 74-75 years (N = 17) and MMR below 100 (N = 109) are 4392 (IQR 2897-4873) and 5028 (IQR 4139-6778) operations per 100,000 people annually, respectively. The mean surgical rate estimated for the seven super-regions was 4723 (95 % CI 3967-5478) operations per 100,000 people annually. The &quot;4C&quot; countries had a mean surgical rate of 4344 (95 % CI 2620-6068) operations per 100,000 people annually. Thirteen of the twenty-one GBD regions, accounting for 78 % of the world's population, do not achieve rates of surgery at the lowest end of this range.CONCLUSIONS: We identified a narrow range of surgical rates associated with important health indicators. This target range can be used for benchmarking of surgical services, and as part of a policy aimed at strengthening health care systems and surgical capacity.
25968087,0,2015,Psychon Bull Rev,GRAPES-Grounding representations in action, perception, and emotion systems: How object properties and categories are represented in the human brain.,In this article, I discuss some of the latest functional neuroimaging findings on the organization of object concepts in the human brain. I argue that these data provide strong support for viewing concepts as the products of highly interactive neural circuits grounded in the action, perception, and emotion systems. The nodes of these circuits are defined by regions representing specific object properties (e.g., form, color, and motion) and thus are property-specific, rather than strictly modality-specific. How these circuits are modified by external and internal environmental demands, the distinction between representational content and format, and the grounding of abstract social concepts are also discussed.
25965012,0,2015,J Therm Biol,Temperature and developmental responses of body and cell size in Drosophila; effects of polyploidy and genome configuration.,Increased adult body size in Drosophila raised at lower temperatures could be attributed both to an increase in the cell volume and cell number. It is not clear, however, whether increased cell size is related to (or even caused by) increased nuclear volume and genome size (or configuration). Experiments with Drosophila melanogaster stocks (Oregon-R and w1118) raised at 16, 22, 24, and 28°C resulted in larger adult body and wing size with lower temperature, while eye size was less affected. The increase in wing size reflected an increase in cell size in both males and females of both stocks. The nucleus size, genome size, and DNA condensation of adult flies, embryos, and Schneider 2 cells (S2 cells, of larval origin) were estimated by flow cytometry. In both adult flies and S2 cells, both nucleus size and DNA condensation varied with temperature, while DNA content appears to be constant. From 12% to 18% of the somatic cells were tetraploid (4C) and 2-5% were octoploid (8C), and for the Oregon strain we observed an increase in the fraction of polyploid cells with decreasing temperature. The observed increase in body size (and wing size) at low temperatures could partly be linked with the cell size and DNA condensation, while corresponding changes in the haploid genome size were not observed.
25958065,0,2015,Surgery,Thyroid incidentalomas detected on (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography: Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS) in the diagnosis and management of patients.,BACKGROUND: Our aim was to evaluate the role of the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS) in the risk stratification of thyroid incidentalomas detected on (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) scans.METHODS: Eighty-seven thyroid nodules in 84 patients showing incidentally detected increased uptake on (18)F-FDG-PET/CT who also had ultrasonography (US)-guided fine needle aspiration performed were included. On review of the US images, a TIRADS category was assigned to each thyroid nodule based on the number of suspicious US features. The correlation between the TIRADS category and the standard uptake values (SUV) on (18)F-FDG-PET/CT were calculated and compared.RESULTS: Of the 87 thyroid nodules, 47 (54%) were benign, and 40 (46%) were malignant. The malignancy rate of the TIRADS categories were as follows: 9% for category 3, 15% for category 4a, 39% for category 4b, 72% for category 4c, and 100.0% for category 5. Combining the TIRADS with the SUV showed increased specificity and positive predictive value but decreased sensitivity and negative predictive value compared with TIRADS alone (all P &lt; .05). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve value of TIRADS was the greatest, comparable with the combined TIRADS and SUV (0.737 to 0.724, P = .788).CONCLUSION: TIRADS may be applied in the risk stratification of thyroid incidentalomas detected on (18)F-FDG-PET/CT. Considering the high malignancy rate of thyroid incidentalomas showing increased (18)F-FDG uptake, ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration is mandatory even if there are no suspicious features present on US.
25953807,0,2015,J Antimicrob Chemother,Time series analysis of the impact of an intervention in Tayside, Scotland to reduce primary care broad-spectrum antimicrobial use.,OBJECTIVES: Concern about Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and resistance has driven interventions internationally to reduce broad-spectrum antimicrobial use. An intervention combining guidelines, education and feedback was implemented in Tayside, Scotland in 2009 aiming to reduce primary care prescribing of co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and clindamycin ('4C antimicrobials'). Our aim was to assess the impact of this real-world intervention on antimicrobial prescribing rates.METHODS: We used interrupted time series with segmented regression analysis to examine associations between the intervention and changes in antimicrobial prescribing (quarterly rates of patients exposed to 4C antimicrobials, non-4C antimicrobials and any antimicrobial in 2005-12).RESULTS: The intervention was associated with a highly significant and sustained decrease in 4C antimicrobial prescribing, by 33.5% (95% CI -26.1 to -40.9), 42.2% (95% CI -34.2 to -50.2) and 55.5% (95% CI -45.9 to -65.1) at 6, 12 and 24 months after intervention, respectively. The effect was seen across all age groups, with the largest reductions in people aged 65 years and over (58.4% reduction at 24 months, 95% CI -46.7 to -70.1) and care home residents (65.6% reduction at 24 months, 95% CI -51.8 to -79.4). There were balancing increases in doxycycline, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim prescribing as well as a reduction in macrolide prescribing. Total antimicrobial exposure did not change.CONCLUSIONS: A real-world intervention to reduce primary care prescribing of antimicrobials associated with CDI led to large, sustained reductions in the targeted prescribing, largely due to substitution with guideline-recommended antimicrobials rather than by avoiding antimicrobial use altogether. Further research is needed to examine the impact on antimicrobial resistance.
25946375,0,2015,Cell Cycle,p27(Kip1) participates in the regulation of endoreplication in differentiating chick retinal ganglion cells.,Nuclear DNA duplication in the absence of cell division (i.e. endoreplication) leads to somatic polyploidy in eukaryotic cells. In contrast to some invertebrate neurons, whose nuclei may contain up to 200,000-fold the normal haploid DNA amount (C), polyploid neurons in higher vertebrates show only 4C DNA content. To explore the mechanism that prevents extra rounds of DNA synthesis in these latter cells we focused on the chick retina, where a population of tetraploid retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) has been described. We show that differentiating chick RGCs that express the neurotrophic receptors p75 and TrkB while lacking retinoblastoma protein, a feature of tetraploid RGCs, also express p27(Kip1). Two different short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) that significantly downregulate p27(Kip1) expression facilitated DNA synthesis and increased ploidy in isolated chick RGCs. Moreover, this forced DNA synthesis could not be prevented by Cdk4/6 inhibition, thus suggesting that it is triggered by a mechanism similar to endoreplication. In contrast, p27(Kip1) deficiency in mouse RGCs does not lead to increased ploidy despite previous observations have shown ectopic DNA synthesis in RGCs from p27(Kip1-/-) mice. This suggests that a differential mechanism is used for the regulation of neuronal endoreplication in mammalian versus avian RGCs.
25944878,0,2015,Am J Hypertens,Aortic Pulse Wave Velocity in Healthy Children and Adolescents: Reference Values for the Vicorder Device and Modifying Factors.,BACKGROUND: Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), an indicator of arterial stiffness, independently predicts cardiovascular mortality risk in adults. Arterial stiffening advances with age and seems accelerated in children with certain disease conditions such as chronic kidney disease or diabetes. The Vicorder, an oscillometric device to measure PWV, has been validated in children, but reference values in a large pediatric cohort, association to carotid stiffness and influence of individual and family risk factors have not been determined.METHODS: Pulse waves were captured in 1,003 healthy children (aged 6-18 years) in 6 centers and gender-specific reference data normalized to age/height were constructed. In 589 children carotid distensibility and intima media thickness were measured. Gestational and family history was reported.RESULTS: PWV correlated with age (r = 0.57, P &lt; 0.0001) with significant gender-related differences starting at age 9. Further significant correlations were seen for height, weight, body mass index, blood pressure, pulse pressure, and heart rate. Independent predictors for PWV in a multivariate regression analysis were gender, age, height, weight, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate. Risk factors for higher PWV included small for gestational age at birth, secondhand smoking, parental hypertension, and obesity. PWV showed weak correlations with 2 of the carotid distensibility measures, but not with intima media thickness.CONCLUSION: This study defines reference values for PWV captured by the Vicorder device in children and adolescents and reveals associations with potential cardiovascular risk factors in a healthy population. Gender-specific percentiles for age/height will allow for the assessment of pediatric cohorts using this oscillometric method.
25941114,0,2015,Tumour Biol,Expression of toll-like receptors in HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma-an in vivo and in vitro study.,The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has increased over the past decades in many western countries. This trend is mainly attributed to the human papillomavirus (HPV). Cancer-related actions of immunological defense systems are being intensively researched. Human toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors that participate in the immunological defense against pathogens, but their actions are also linked to cancer. The expression of TLRs in cervical epithelium alters both during the clearance of HPV infection and the HPV-induced neoplasia, but the expression of TLRs has not been studied in OPSCC. Thirty-five paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed, squamous cell carcinoma tissue specimens were analyzed for TLRs 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 and HPV and p16 statuses. The TLR 9 expression was lower in HPV-positive tumors compared with HPV-negative tumors. TLR 7 was expressed in all cancer specimens, but elevated expression was evident in HPV and/or p16-positive tumors. The majority of p16-positive tumors did not express TLR 5, whereas its expression was stronger in p16-negative tumors. The results of in vitro analysis of five human OPSCC cell lines and one human oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line agree with the in vivo trends: low levels of TLR 5 and high levels of TLR 7 in p16-positive OPSCC. Overall, TLR 7 and 9 expression patterns are demonstrated here to relate to the HPV status in vivo and TLR 5 and 7 expression patterns to the p16 status in vivo and in vitro.
25940108,0,2015,Immunogenetics,A CT60G&gt;A polymorphism in the CTLA-4 gene of the recipient may confer susceptibility to acute graft versus host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,T cell activation plays a crucial role in the development of acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD). Cytotoxic T cell antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a co-inhibitory molecule that negatively regulates T cell activation, differentiation, and proliferation. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CTLA-4 gene may affect its function. Inconsistent observations have been reported regarding the associations of CTLA-4 SNPs with complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Moreover, the majority of the observations were focused on the donors' SNPs. Recently, a few studies have shown that recipients' genetic variations in the CTLA-4 gene might influence HSCT results. The aim of our study was to determine the influence of the CTLA-4 gene polymorphisms of the donors and the recipients on the outcome of HSCT. Altogether, 312 donor-recipient pairs were genotyped for the CTLA-4c.49A&gt;G (rs231775) and CT60G&gt;A (rs3087243) SNPs using the TaqMan®SNP Genotyping Assays. In this study, it was shown that the recipients' CT60G&gt;A[GG] genotype, the myeloablative conditioning regimen, and HSCT from an unrelated donor were independent aGvHD risk factors (odds ratio (OR) 2.63, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 1.45-4.59, p = 0.001; OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.65-4.07, p = 0.00003; and OR 1.87, 95 % CI 1.02-3.24, p = 0.04, respectively). Moreover, haplotype analysis revealed that possessing allele A in both of the SNPs decreased the risk of aGvHD approximately 1.5-fold (RR 0.69, p = 0.008). Our data suggest that the CT60G&gt;A[GG] genotype in the recipient has an impact on aGvHD development, especially in patients receiving transplants from unrelated donors together with the myeloablative conditioning regimen.

25937167,0,2015,Int Immunopharmacol,Immuno-detection of OCTN1 (SLC22A4) in HeLa cells and characterization of transport function.,OCTN1 was immuno-detected in the cervical cancer cell HeLa, in which the complete pattern of acetylcholine metabolizing enzymes is expressed. Comparison of immuno-staining intensity of HeLa OCTN1 with the purified recombinant human OCTN1 allowed measuring the specific OCTN1 concentration in the HeLa cell extract and, hence calculating the HeLa OCTN1 specific transport activity that was about 10nmol×min(-1)×mgprotein(-1), measured as uptake of [(3)H]acetylcholine in proteoliposomes reconstituted with HeLa extract. This value was very similar to the specific activity of the recombinant protein. Acetylcholine transport was suppressed by incubation of the protein or proteoliposomes with the anti-OCTN1 antibody and was strongly inhibited by PLP and MTSEA, known inhibitors of OCTN1. The absence of ATP in the internal side of proteoliposomes strongly impaired transport function of both the HeLa and, as expected, the recombinant OCTN1. HeLa OCTN1 was inhibited by spermine, NaCl (Na(+)), TEA, γ-butyrobetaine, choline, acetylcarnitine and ipratropium but not by neostigmine. Besides acetylcholine, choline was taken up by HeLa OCTN1 proteoliposomes. The transporter catalyzed also acetylcholine and choline efflux which, differently from uptake, was not inhibited by MTSEA. Time course of [(3)H]acetylcholine uptake in intact HeLa cells was measured. As in proteoliposomes, acetylcholine transport in intact cells was inhibited by TEA and NaCl. Efflux of [(3)H]acetylcholine occurred in intact cells, as well. The experimental data concur in demonstrating a role of OCTN1 in transporting acetylcholine and choline in HeLa cells.
25931819,0,2015,Int J Nanomedicine,Cu(2+)-RGDFRGDS: exploring the mechanism and high efficacy of the nanoparticle in antithrombotic therapy.,Thrombosis disease has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the discovery of antithrombotic agents, three complexes of Cu(2+) and repetitive arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequences, Cu(II)-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (Cu[II]-4a), Cu(II)-Arg-Gly-Asp-Val-Arg-Gly-Asp-Val (Cu[II]-4b), and Cu(II)-Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe (Cu[II]-4c), were previously reported, of which Cu(II)-4a and Cu(II)-4c possessed the highest in vitro and in vivo activity, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images visualized that Cu(II)-4a and Cu(II)-4c formed nanoaggregates and nanoparticles, respectively. However, the details of the formation of the nanospecies complexes and of the mechanism for inhibiting thrombosis remain to be clarified. For this purpose, this study designed a novel complex of Cu(II) and the RGD octapeptide, Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDFRGDS), consisting of Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe of Cu(II)-4c and Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser of Cu(II)-4a, to colligate their biological and nanostructural benefits. In contrast with Cu(II)-4a, -4b, and -4c, Cu(II)-RGDFRGDS (Cu(2+)-FS) had high antiplatelet and antithrombotic activities, with the formed nanoparticles having a porous surface. Additionally, this paper evidenced the dimer had the basic structural unit of Cu(2+)-FS in water, theoretically simulated the formation of Cu(2+)-FS nanoparticles, and identified that Cu(2+)-FS activity in decreasing glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, P-selectin, and IL-8 was responsible for the antithrombotic action. Finally, adherence onto the surface and entry into the cytoplasm were considered the steps of a two-step model for the blocking of platelet activation by Cu(2+)-FS nanoparticles. Findings indicated that the antiplatelet aggregation activity of Cu(2+)-FS was 10-52 times higher than that of RGDFRGDS, while the effective dose for antithrombotic action was 5,000 times lower than that of RGDFRGDS.

All of these compounds represent C-functional (R2C═O, R2C═N-OH, R-NH(C═O)-R, R2NH, or R3C-Br) silicon-containing heterocycles that contain Si-MOP, Si-DMOP, or Si-TMOP moieties (MOP = 4-methoxyphenyl; DMOP = 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl; TMOP = 2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl), which can be cleaved under mild conditions by protodesilylation. As a proof of principle, compounds 3a-3c were transformed quantitatively and selectively into the chlorosilane 6 (treatment with hydrogen chloride in dichloromethane). Thus, the C- and Si-functional compounds 1a-1c, 2a-2c, 3a-3c, 4a-4c, 5a, and 5b represent versatile building blocks for synthesis.
25927661,0,2015,Mar Drugs,Novel Adociaquinone Derivatives from the Indonesian Sponge Xestospongia sp.,Seven new adociaquinone derivatives, xestoadociaquinones A (1a), B (1b), 14-carboxy-xestoquinol sulfate (2) and xestoadociaminals A-D (3a, 3c, 4a, 4c), together with seven known compounds (5-11) were isolated from an Indonesian marine sponge Xestospongia sp. Their structures were elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR and mass spectrometric data. All the compounds were evaluated for their potential inhibitory activity against eight different protein kinases involved in cell proliferation, cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders as well as for their antioxidant and antibacterial activities.
25923950,0,2015,J Med Chem,Studies on the ATP Binding Site of Fyn Kinase for the Identification of New Inhibitors and Their Evaluation as Potential Agents against Tauopathies and Tumors.,Fyn is a member of the Src-family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases. Its abnormal activity has been shown to be related to various human cancers as well as to severe pathologies, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Herein, a structure-based drug design protocol was employed aimed at identifying novel Fyn inhibitors. Two hits from commercial sources (1, 2) were found active against Fyn with Ki of about 2 μM, while derivative 4a, derived from our internal library, showed a Ki of 0.9 μM. A hit-to-lead optimization effort was then initiated on derivative 4a to improve its potency. Slightly modifications rapidly determine an increase in the binding affinity, with the best inhibitors 4c and 4d having Kis of 70 and 95 nM, respectively. Both compounds were found able to inhibit the phosphorylation of the protein Tau in an Alzheimer's model cell line and showed antiproliferative activities against different cancer cell lines.
25922992,0,2015,Elife,A simple biophysical model emulates budding yeast chromosome condensation.,Mitotic chromosomes were one of the first cell biological structures to be described, yet their molecular architecture remains poorly understood. We have devised a simple biophysical model of a 300 kb-long nucleosome chain, the size of a budding yeast chromosome, constrained by interactions between binding sites of the chromosomal condensin complex, a key component of interphase and mitotic chromosomes. Comparisons of computational and experimental (4C) interaction maps, and other biophysical features, allow us to predict a mode of condensin action. Stochastic condensin-mediated pairwise interactions along the nucleosome chain generate native-like chromosome features and recapitulate chromosome compaction and individualization during mitotic condensation. Higher order interactions between condensin binding sites explain the data less well. Our results suggest that basic assumptions about chromatin behavior go a long way to explain chromosome architecture and are able to generate a molecular model of what the inside of a chromosome is likely to look like.
25919038,0,2015,Clin Respir J,Myocardial deformation and total atrial conduction time in the prediction of cardiac involvement in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.,AIMS: In this study, we aim to evaluate the left atrial global longitudinal strain (LAGLS), total atrial conduction time (TACT) and left ventricle (LV) functions in recently diagnosed pulmonary sarcoidosis (PS) patients.METHOD: Fifty recently diagnosed PS patients (group 1) and a control group of 50 healthy individuals (group 2) were evaluated in the study. Two-dimensional echocardiography images were obtained from LV apical 4-chamber (4C), long-axis (L) and 2-chamber (2C) views. Peak longitudinal strain and strain rate (SR) were obtained from 4C, L and 2C views. Mean values of the three views were calculated. LV global longitudinal strain and LV-SR torsion were determined as the net differences in the mean rotation between the apical and basal levels. LAGLS and TACT values were calculated.RESULTS: The study found that LAGLS was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 (P &lt; 0.05). TACT was also significantly longer in group 1 than in group 2 (respectively group 1: 111.6 ± 15.1 ms; group 2: 103.4 ± 5.8 ms, P &lt; 0.001). There was a significant moderate negative correlation between LAGLS and TACT (r = -0.36, P &lt; 0.05). Patients with sarcoidosis had significantly lower LV longitudinal strain and SR measurements than the control group. Although LV basal rotation (LVR) values were similar in both groups, LVR-apical and LV-torsion (LVTR) values were significantly higher in the patient group (group 1).CONCLUSION: The identification of left atrial and left ventricular myocardial deformation using speckle tracking echocardiography in patients with PS allows subclinical LV dysfunction and subclinical electrophysiologic changes to be detected earlier.
25913114,0,2015,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and bioactivity of 2',3'-benzoabscisic acid analogs.,2',3'-Benzoabscisic acid 4a is significantly more active than (±)-ABA and can be potentially used as a plant growth regulator for agriculture. In this study, six 4a analogs were designed and synthesized. Bioassay showed that 4a displayed greater activity than (±)-ABA and the six analogs produced less inhibition than 4a itself. Specially, some analogs displayed markedly different activities to different physiological and biochemical process, which were largely different from ABA and 4a. Compared to (±)-ABA, 4b and 4c were more effective germination inhibitors for lettuce, but less effective inhibitors for rice elongation. Five-membered analog 5 was higher or slightly weaker in inhibiting Arabidopsis seed germination and rice elongation, respectively, but at least 10 times less effective than (±)-ABA in lettuce seed germination. Dual acid 6 and alkyne acid 20 nearly produced no inhibitory activity for Arabidopsis seed germination, but displayed excellent activity in inhibiting rice seedling growth. The preference of the analogs to different physiology process indicated that they might provide a strategy to develop novel ABA agonists or antagonist and be used as probe to investigate the function of different ABA receptors.
25901194,0,2015,Am J Transl Res,ADP-ribosylation factor-like 4C (ARL4C), a novel ovarian cancer metastasis suppressor, identified by integrated genomics.,Understanding the molecular mechanisms involving the initiation, progression, and metastasis of ovarian cancer is important for the prevention, detection, and treatment of ovarian cancer. In this study, two ovarian cancer cell lines, HO-8910 and its derivative HO-8910PM with highly metastatic potential, were applied to comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis. We found 14 chromosome fragments with different copy numbers between the two cell lines, one (2q36.1-37.3) of which was confirmed to be one-copy loss in HO-8910PM by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Using the microarray data on gene expression profiles from these cell lines, 6 significantly expression-decreased genes located on 2q36.1-37.3 in HO-8910PM were identified. Of the 6 genes, ARL4C was identified as a novel ovarian cancer-related gene using integrated molecular and genomic analyses. ARL4C mRNA expression was validated by quantitative PCR to be markedly decreased in HO-8910PM cells, compared to that in HO-8910. Both overexpression and knockdown of ARL4C demonstrated that low ARL4C expression promotes the migration but not influences proliferation capability of ovarian cancer cells in vitro, indicating its specific role in ovarian cancer progression. Furthermore, ovarian cancer patients with medium and high expression of ARL4C mRNA had a favorable prognosis compared to those with low expression, suggesting the ARL4C could be a potential predictor for ovarian cancer prognosis.
25899854,0,2015,Eur J Neurosci,Sox4 participates in the modulation of Schwann cell myelination.,In order to identify new regulators of Schwann cell myelination potentially playing a role in peripheral nervous system (PNS) pathologies, we analysed gene expression profiling data from three mouse models of demyelinating neuropathies and from the developing PNS. This analysis revealed that Sox4, which encodes a member of the Sry-related high-mobility group box protein family, was consistently upregulated in all three analysed models of neuropathy. Moreover, Sox4 showed a peak in its expression during development that corresponded with the onset of myelination. To gain further insights into the role of Sox4 in PNS development, we generated a transgenic mouse that specifically overexpresses Sox4 in Schwann cells. Sox4 overexpression led to a temporary delay in PNS myelination without affecting axonal sorting. Importantly, we observed that, whereas Sox4 mRNA could be efficiently overexpressed, Sox4 protein expression in Schwann cells was strictly regulated. Finally, our data showed that enforced expression of Sox4 in the mouse model for Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4C aggravated its neuropathic phenotype. Together, these observations reveal that Sox4 contributes to the regulation of Schwann cell myelination, and also indicates its involvement in the pathophysiology of peripheral neuropathies.
25897715,0,2015,Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,Hafnium(IV) chloride complexes with chelating β-ketiminate ligands: Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and volatility study.,The synthesis and characterization of four new β-ketiminate hafnium(IV) chloride complexes dichloro-bis[4-(phenylamido)pent-3-en-2-one]-hafnium (4a), dichloro-bis[4-(4-methylphenylamido)pent-3-en-2-one]-hafnium (4b), dichloro-bis[4-(4-methoxyphenylamido)pent-3-en-2-one]-hafnium (4c), and dichloro-bis[4-(4-chlorophenylamido)pent-3-en-2-one]-hafnium (4d) are reported. All the complexes (4a-d) were characterized by spectroscopic methods ((1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR), and elemental analysis while the compound 4c was further examined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, revealing that the complex is monomer with the hafnium center in octahedral coordination environment and oxygens of the chelating N-O ligands are trans to each other and the chloride ligands are in a cis arrangement. Volatile trends are established for four new β-ketiminate hafnium(IV) chloride complexes (4a-d). Sublimation enthalpies (ΔHsub) were calculated from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data, which show that, the dependence of ΔHsub on the molecular weight (4a-c) and inductive effects from chlorine (4d).
25893177,0,2015,World J Orthop,Knee salvage procedures: The indications, techniques and outcomes of large osteochondral allografts.,The overall incidence of osteochondral defect in the general population is estimated to be 15 to 30 per 100000 people. These lesions can become symptomatic causing pain, swelling and decreased function of the knee, and may eventually progress to osteoarthritis. In the young and active population, partial or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is rarely the treatment of choice due to risk of early failure. Osteochondral allograft transplantation has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective treatment of large osteochondral and chondral defects of the knee in appropriately selected patients. The treatment reduces pain, improves function and is a viable limb salvage procedure for patients, especially young and active patients for whom TKA is not recommended. Either large dowels generated with commercially available equipment or free hand shell allografts can be implanted in more posterior lesions. Current recommendations for fresh allografts stored at 4C advise implantation within 21-28 d of procurement for optimum chondrocyte viability, following screening and testing protocols. Higher rates of successful allograft transplantation are observed in younger patients, unipolar lesions, normal or corrected malalignment, and defects that are treated within 12 mo of symptom onset. Patients with bipolar lesions, uncorrectable malalignment, advanced osteoarthritis, and those over 40 tend to have less favourable outcomes.
25868644,0,2015,Ann Occup Hyg,Eye Lens Opacities Among Physicians Occupationally Exposed to Ionizing Radiation.,We compared the frequency of lens opacities among physicians with and without occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, and estimated dose-response between cumulative dose and opacities. We conducted ophthalmologic examinations of 21 physicians with occupational exposure to radiation and 16 unexposed physicians. Information on cumulative radiation doses (mean 111 mSv) was based on dosimeter readings recorded in a national database on occupational exposures. Lens changes were evaluated using the Lens Opacities Classification System II, with an emphasis on posterior subcapsular (PSC) and cortical changes. Among the exposed physicians, the prevalences of cortical and PSC changes were both 11% (3/21), and the corresponding frequencies in the unexposed group were 44% (n = 7) and 6% (n = 1). For dose-response analysis, the data were pooled with 29 exposed physicians from our previous study. No association of either type of lens changes with cumulative recorded dose was observed. Our findings do not indicate an increased frequency of lens opacities in physicians with occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. However, the subjects in this study have received relatively low doses and therefore the results do not exclude small increases in lens opacities or contradict the studies reporting increases among interventional cardiologists with materially higher cumulative doses.
25865133,0,2015,Bioorg Med Chem,Diarylsulfonamides and their bioisosteres as dual inhibitors of alkaline phosphatase and carbonic anhydrase: Structure activity relationship and molecular modelling studies.,The effect of bioisosteric replacement of carboxamide linking group with sulfonamide linking group, on alkaline phosphatase (AP) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition activity of aromatic benzenesulfonamides was investigated. A series of carboxamide linked aromatic benzenesulfonamides 1a-1c, 2a-2d and their sulfonamide linked bioisosteres 3a-3d, 4a-4d was synthesized and evaluated for inhibitory activity against bovine tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) and bCA II. A significant increase in CA inhibition activity was observed upon bioisosteric replacement of carboxamide linking group with a sulfonamide group. Some of these compounds were identified as highly potent and selective AP inhibitors. Compounds 1b, 2b, 3d, 4d 5b and 5c were found to be selective bTNAP inhibitors, whereas compounds 1a, 1c, 2a, 2c, 2d, 3a, 3c, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5a were found to be selective bIAP inhibitors. For most active AP inhibitor 3b, detailed kinetic studies indicated a competitive mode of inhibition against tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and non-competitive mode of inhibition against intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP). Molecular docking studies were carried out to rationalize important binding site interactions.
25865064,0,2015,Nuklearmedizin,TIRADS for sonographic assessment of hypofunctioning and indifferent thyroid nodules.,AIM: To test the feasibility of the Thyroid Imaging Reporting And Data System (TIRADS) according to Horvath and Kwak for the assessment of thyroid nodules.PATIENTS, METHOD: Retrospective analysis of patients with thyroid nodules applying the following inclusion criteria: B-mode-ultrasound, surgery and histological results. Thyroid nodules were classified as TIRADS 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 4C, 5 and 6.RESULTS: A total of 172 patients were included (133 women, 48 ± 13 years, 39 men, 49 ± 11 years) with 222 thyroid nodules (24.9 ± 11.5 mm). Final histological diagnosis revealed 203 benign nodules (91%) and 19 malignant nodules (9%; 18 papillary thyroid carcinoma, PTC, and one medullary thyroid carcinoma, MTC). One hundred and sixty thyroid nodules were hypofunctioning in 99mTc-pertechnetate-scintigraphy, 14 nodules were hyperfunctioning and 46 nodules were classified as indifferent. In two cases with small carcinoma &lt; 1 cm 99mTc-pertechnetate-scintigraphy was not performed. According to Horvath, the prevalence of malignancy was 6.7% in TIRADS 2, 0% in 3, 1.9% in 4A, 33% in 4B, 12.5% in 5 and 100% in 6; 73 nodules (39%) were not clearly classifiable, including 3 carcinoma (4.1%). According to Kwak, the prevalence of malignancy was 6.9% in TIRADS 2, 0% in 3, 2% in 4A, 4.1% in 4B, 23.1% in 4C, and 100% in 5 and 6, respectively. Notably, in the subgroup of hot nodules, 11 (79%) were graded as TIRADS 4A or higher, and thus advisable for fine-needle aspiration biopsy in both TIRADS.CONCLUSION: The TIRADS described by Horvath is not practicable due to numerous unclassifiable nodules. The revised TIRADS published by Kwak is feasible and suitable to assess the prevalence of malignancy, but it cannot replace scintigraphic imaging. Fine-needle-biopsy is not necessary in nodules categorized as (K)TIRADS 3, 4A and 5.
25862406,0,2015,Biochim Biophys Acta,N-linked Glycosylation of human SLC1A5 (ASCT2) transporter is critical for trafficking to membrane.,The human amino acid transporter SLC1A5 (ASCT2) contains two N-glycosylation sites (N163 and N212) located in the large extracellular loop. In the homology structural model of ASCT2 these Asn residues are extracellularly exposed. Mutants of the two Asn exhibited altered electrophoretic mobility. N163Q and N212Q displayed multiple bands with apparent molecular masses from 80kDa to 50kDa. N163/212Q displayed a single band of 50kDa corresponding to the unglycosylated protein. The presence in membrane of WT and mutants was evaluated by protein biotinylation assay followed by immunoblotting. The double mutation significantly impaired the presence of the protein in membrane, without impairment in protein synthesis. [(3)H]glutamine transport was measured in cells transiently transfected with the WT or mutants. N163/212Q exhibited a strongly reduced transport activity correlating with reduced surface expression. The same proteins extracted from cells and reconstituted in liposomes showed comparable transport activities demonstrating that the intrinsic transport function of the mutants was not affected. The rate of endocytosis of ASCT2 was assayed by a reversible biotinylation strategy. N212Q and N163/212Q showed strongly increased rates of endocytosis respect to WT. ASCT2 stability was determined using cycloheximide. N163Q or N163/212Q showed a slightly or significantly lower stability with respect to WT. To assess trafficking to the membrane, a brefeldin-based assay, which caused retention of proteins in ER, was performed. One hour after brefeldin removal WT protein was localized to the plasma membrane while the double mutant was localized in the cytosol. The results demonstrate that N-glycosylation is critical for trafficking.
25858671,0,2015,Sci Rep,Galectin-1-secreting neural stem cells elicit long-term neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury.,Galectin-1 (gal-1), a special lectin with high affinity to β-galactosides, is implicated in protection against ischemic brain injury. The present study investigated transplantation of gal-1-secreting neural stem cell (s-NSC) into ischemic brains and identified the mechanisms underlying protection. To accomplish this goal, secretory gal-1 was stably overexpressed in NE-4C neural stem cells. Transient cerebral ischemia was induced in mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 60 minutes and s-NSCs were injected into the striatum and cortex within 2 hours post-ischemia. Brain infarct volume and neurological performance were assessed up to 28 days post-ischemia. s-NSC transplantation reduced infarct volume, improved sensorimotor and cognitive functions, and provided more robust neuroprotection than non-engineered NSCs or gal-1-overexpressing (but non-secreting) NSCs. White matter injury was also ameliorated in s-NSC-treated stroke mice. Gal-1 modulated microglial function in vitro, by attenuating secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and nitric oxide) in response to LPS stimulation and enhancing production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β). Gal-1 also shifted microglia/macrophage polarization toward the beneficial M2 phenotype in vivo by reducing CD16 expression and increasing CD206 expression. In sum, s-NSC transplantation confers robust neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia, probably by alleviating white matter injury and modulating microglial/macrophage function.
25854241,0,2015,J Chem Phys,Photoelectron spectroscopy of B4O4 (-): Dual 3c-4e π hyperbonds and rhombic 4c-4e o-bond in boron oxide clusters.,Gas-phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) is combined with global structural searches and electronic structure calculations at the hybrid Becke 3-parameter exchange functional and Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional (B3LYP) and single-point coupled-cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)) levels to probe the structural and electronic properties and chemical bonding of the B4O4 (0/-) clusters. The measured PES spectra of B4O4 (-) exhibit a major band with the adiabatic and vertical detachment energies (ADE and VDE) of 2.64 ± 0.10 and 2.81 ± 0.10 eV, respectively, as well as a weak peak with the ADE and VDE of 1.42 ± 0.08 and 1.48 ± 0.08 eV. The former band proves to correspond to the Y-shaped global minimum of Cs B4O4 (-) ((2)A″), with the calculated ADE/VDE of 2.57/2.84 eV at the CCSD(T) level, whereas the weak band is associated with the second lowest-energy, rhombic isomer of D2h B4O4 (-) ((2)B2g) with the predicted ADE/VDE of 1.43/1.49 eV. Both anion structures are planar, featuring a B atom or a B2O2 core bonded with terminal BO and/or BO2 groups. The same Y-shaped and rhombic structures are also located for the B4O4 neutral cluster, albeit with a reversed energy order. Bonding analyses reveal dual three-center four-electron (3c-4e) π hyperbonds in the Y-shaped B4O4 (0/-) clusters and a four-center four-electron (4c-4e) π bond, that is, the so-called o-bond in the rhombic B4O4 (0/-) clusters. This work is the first experimental study on a molecular system with an o-bond.
25849418,0,2015,Chem Res Toxicol,Mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter, a novel target of mercury toxicity.,The effect of Hg(2+) and CH3Hg(+) on the mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter (CACT) has been studied on the recombinant protein and on the CACT extracted from HeLa cells or Zebrafish and reconstituted in proteoliposomes. Transport was abolished upon treatment of the recombinant CACT in proteoliposomes by Hg(2+) or CH3Hg(+). Inhibition was reversed by the SH reducing agent 1,4-dithioerythritol, GSH, and N-acetylcysteine. IC50 for Hg(2+) and CH3Hg(+) of 90 nM and 137 nM, respectively, were measured by dose-response analyses. Inhibition was abolished in the C-less CACT mutant. Strong reduction of inhibition by both reagents was observed in the C136A and some reduction in the C155A mutants. Inhibition similar to that of the WT was observed in the C23V/C58V/C89S/C155V/C283S mutant, containing only C136. Optimal inhibition by Hg(2+)was found in the four replacement mutants C23V/C58V/C89S/C283S containing both C136 and C155 indicating cross-reaction of Hg(2+) with the two Cys residues. Inhibition kinetic analysis showed mixed inhibition by Hg(2+) or competitive inhibition by CH3Hg(+). HeLa cells or Zebrafish were treated with the more potent inhibitor. Ten micromolar HgCl2 caused clear impairment of viability of HeLa cells. The transport assay in proteoliposomes with CACT extracted from treated cells showed that the transporter was inactivated and that DTE rescued the activity. Nearly identical results were observed with Zebrafish upon extraction of the CACT from the liver of the treated animals that, indeed, showed accumulation of the mercurial compound.
25848904,0,2015,Radiology,Thyroid Nodules: Nondiagnostic Cytologic Results according to Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System before and after Application of the Bethesda System.,Purpose To compare the malignancy rates and the effectiveness of the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS) for risk stratification of nodules with nondiagnostic results classified before and after application of the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by an institutional review board, with waiver of informed consent. A total of 763 patients with 790 thyroid nodules and nondiagnostic cytologic results were included (mean age ± standard deviation, 52.3 years ± 11.5), 485 nodules from the pre-Bethesda period (from March 2007 to December 2008) and 305 nodules from the post-Bethesda period (from May 2011 to May 2012). A TIRADS category was assigned to each thyroid nodule on the basis of the number of features that appeared suspicious for cancer at ultrasonography (US). Malignancy rates and TIRADS categories during the two periods were compared. Correlation between TIRADS category and malignancy risk between the two periods was evaluated and compared. Results The malignancy rates of nodules with nondiagnostic cytologic results were not significantly different between the two periods (P = .148). Malignancy risk of TIRADS category 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 was 1.8%, 5.7%, 4.1%, 29.8%, and 16.7%, for the pre-Bethesda period, and 1.6%, 3.0%, 7.1%, 16.3%, and 25.0% for the post-Bethesda period, respectively. Near-perfect correlation was seen between the TIRADS category and malignancy risk in the post-Bethesda period (r = 0.961, P = .009), while no significant correlation was found in the pre-Bethesda period (r = 0.731, P = .161). Conclusion Malignancy risk stratification with TIRADS was more effective for nodules with nondiagnostic cytologic results classified according to the Bethesda System. When these Bethesda-classified nodules with nondiagnostic results are evaluated as TIRADS category 3 or 4a, they may be treated conservatively with follow-up US, but when other cytologic classifications are applied, follow-up US and fine- needle aspiration must be considered for nodules showing one or more features suspicious for cancer at US.

25847765,0,2015,Eur J Med Chem,Design, synthesis, biological evaluation and molecular docking studies of phenylpropanoid derivatives as potent anti-hepatitis B virus agents.,A series of phenylpropanoid derivatives were synthesized, and their anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity was evaluated in HepG 2.2.15 cells. Most of the synthesized derivatives showed effective anti-HBV activity. Of these compounds, compound 4c-1 showed the most potent anti-HBV activity, demonstrating potent inhibitory effect not only on the secretion of HBsAg (IC50 = 14.18 μM, SI = 17.85) and HBeAg (IC50 = 6.20 μM, SI = 40.82) secretion but also HBV DNA replication (IC50 = 23.43 μM, SI = 10.80). The structure-activity relationships (SARs) of phenylpropanoid derivatives had been discussed, which were useful for phenylpropanoid derivatives to be explored and developed as novel anti-HBV agents. Moreover, the docking study of all synthesized compounds inside the HLA-A protein (PDB ID: 3OX8) active site were carried out to explore the molecular interactions and a molecular target for activity of phenylpropanoid derivatives with the protein using a moe-docking technique. This study identified a new class of potent anti-HBV agents.
25847619,0,2015,Pharmacol Biochem Behav,Antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and smooth muscle relaxant activities of the pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazinone derivatives: Possible mechanisms of action.,The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic as well as anti-inflammatory activities of the new pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazinone derivatives. Moreover, the present study attempted to assess some of the mechanisms involved in the pharmacological activity of these compounds. In the previous studies it was shown that these compounds were highly active in the phenylbenzoquinone-induced 'writhing syndrome' test and had much lower activity in the hot plate, which indicates that mainly peripheral mechanisms of analgesia are involved in their effects. In these extended studies the analgesic activity of two tested compounds (4c, 4f) was confirmed in some animal models of pain. The studied compounds showed a significant and dose-related antinociceptive effect in the models of pain induced by formalin, capsaicin and glutamic acid. Both compounds decreased the edema formation and one of them (4c) attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia in carrageenan-induced paw inflammation in rats. Furthermore, both compounds inhibited cell migration, plasma exudation and nociceptive reaction in zymosan A-induced mouse peritonitis. In the subsequent studies, including experiments on isolated organs (ileum, trachea, aorta), radioligand assays and biochemical tests, it was demonstrated that analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the investigated structures are largely due to their competitive antagonism for histamine H1 receptor. The influence on the level of cAMP in inflammatory cells (shown in RAW 264.7 macrophages) and subsequent inhibition of cytokine (TNFα, IL-1β) release can also be one of the important mechanisms of their action. Moreover some additional mechanisms may also be involved in the eventual analgesic effect of tested pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazinone derivatives.
25847052,0,2015,Mol Med Rep,Knockdown of reticulon 4C by lentivirus inhibits human colorectal cancer cell growth.,Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer worldwide with high cell motility and metastatic potential. Reticulon 4C (RTN4-C) is the shortest isoform of the reticulon family protein RTN4, which may act to induce cell apoptosis and suppress tumor development. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of RTN4‑C in colorectal cancer, and potentially identify a novel target for anti‑tumor therapy. To investigate the biological role of RTN4‑C in colorectal cancer, the expression levels of RTN4‑C were initially analyzed in six colorectal cancer cell lines by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. In addition, lentivirus‑based RNA interference was utilized to knock down RTN4‑C expression in RKO and DLD‑1 cells with low and high levels of RTN4‑C, respectively. The rate of proliferation decreased in RTN4‑C silenced RKO and DLD‑1 cells compared with the control, as determined using MTT and colony formation assays. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that RTN4‑C knockdown in RKO cells led to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, particularly at the sub‑G1 phase representing apoptotic cells. These results indicate that RTN4‑C has an important role in colorectal cancer cell growth, which may provide a potential therapeutic approach for human colorectal cancer.
25845242,0,2015,Mol Biol (Mosk),[Spatial organization of house-keeping genes in interphase nuclei].,Spatial organization of the eukaryotic genome is tightly connected to its functioning. In particular, the interaction of gene promoters with remote enhancer elements in active chromatin hubs, as well as the recruitment of genes to the common transcription factories plays an important role in regulation of gene transcription. Most of works related to the analysis of spatial interaction of genome regulatory elements relies on models of tissue-specific genes. Meanwhile, it remains unclear to which extent the spatial organization of chromosomes is guided by house-keeping genes that are transcribed in most of cell types and outnumber the transcribed tissue-specific genes. To address this question, we used the 4C technique to characterize genome-wide the spatial contacts of the chicken house-keeping genes CARHSP1 and TRAP1 situated on chromosome 14. The promoters of these genes had an increased frequency of interaction with chromosome regions enriched in CpG islands and binding motifs for the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1, both of which mark promoters of house-keeping genes, and overall with transcriptionally active regions. By contrast, the analysis of interaction of a gene poor region of chromosome 14 revealed no such preferences. The evidence for the interaction of house-keeping gene promoters were also obtained in independent cytological experiments aimed at visualization of non-methylated CpG islands in individual nuclei of human cells, which showed clustering of CpG islands in the nuclear space. Altogether, the results of our work suggest that the interaction of house-keeping genes constitutes an important factor that determines the spatial organization of interphase chromosomes.
25843648,0,2015,Infect Genet Evol,Genomic and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of infectious bronchitis coronavirus.,Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Gammacoronavirus that causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens. A QX-like strain was analysed by high-throughput Illumina sequencing and genetic variation across the entire viral genome was explored at the sub-consensus level by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) in the order 5'-UTR-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3'UTR were predicted. The relative frequencies of missense: silent SNPs were calculated to obtain a comparative measure of variability in specific genes. The most variable ORFs in descending order were E, 3b, 5'UTR, N, 1a, S, 1ab, M, 4c, 5a, 6b. The E and 3b protein products play key roles in coronavirus virulence, and RNA folding demonstrated that the mutations in the 5'UTR did not alter the predicted secondary structure. The frequency of SNPs in the Spike (S) protein ORF of 0.67% was below the genomic average of 0.76%. Only three SNPS were identified in the S1 subunit, none of which were located in hypervariable region (HVR) 1 or HVR2. The S2 subunit was considerably more variable containing 87% of the polymorphisms detected across the entire S protein. The S2 subunit also contained a previously unreported multi-A insertion site and a stretch of four consecutive mutated amino acids, which mapped to the stalk region of the spike protein. Template-based protein structure modelling produced the first theoretical model of the IBV spike monomer. Given the lack of diversity observed at the sub-consensus level, the tenet that the HVRs in the S1 subunit are very tolerant of amino acid changes produced by genetic drift is questioned.
25835079,0,2015,Diagn Interv Radiol,Nonpalpable BI-RADS 4 breast lesions: sonographic findings and pathology correlation.,PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate ultrasonography (US) findings for Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 4 lesions using BI-RADS US lexicon and determine the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of US with respect to biopsy results.METHODS: Sonograms of 186 BI-RADS 4 nonpalpable breast lesions with a known diagnosis were reviewed retrospectively. The morphologic features of all lesions were described using BI-RADS lexicon and the lesions were subcategorized into 4A, 4B, and 4C on the basis of the physician's level of suspicion. Lesion descriptors and biopsy results were correlated. Pathologic results were compared with US features. PPVs of BI-RADS subcategories 4A, 4B, and 4C were calculated.RESULTS: Of 186 lesions, 38.7% were malignant and 61.2% were benign. PPVs according to subcategories 4A, 4B, and 4C were 19.5%, 41.5%, and 74.3%, respectively. Microlobulated, indistinct, and angular margins, posterior acoustic features, and echo pattern were nonspecific signs for nonpalpable BI-RADS 4 lesions. Typical signs of malignancy were irregular shape (PPV, 66%), spiculated margin (PPV, 80%) and nonparallel orientation (PPV, 58.9%). Typical signs of benign lesions were oval shape (NPV, 77.1%), circumscribed margin (NPV, 67.5%), parallel orientation (NPV, 70%), and abrupt interface (NPV, 67.6%).CONCLUSION: BI-RADS criteria are not sufficient for discriminating between malignant and benign lesions, and biopsy is required. Subcategories 4A, 4B, and 4C are useful in predicting the likelihood of malignancy. However, objective and clear subclassification rules are needed.
25831887,0,2015,Mol Biol (Mosk),[Spatial organization of interphase chromosomes and the role of chromatin fiber dynamycs in the positioning of genome elements].,Many studies are devoted to the analysis ofinterphase chromosome architecture due to the evidence of functional-dependent spatial organization of the genome. These studies are based on classical cytological methods as well as on biochemical approaches (3C, 4C, 5C, Hi-C) allowing for the detection of long-range interactions between fragments of chromatin fibers, including the genome-wide interactions. In this review, we discuss the results of these researches which make it possible to explain functional-dependent multilevel compartmentalization of the nucleous and unravel the principals of high-level chromatin organization. Special attention is paid to the enchancer-promoter interactions important for the regulation of gene expression. Accordingly, we consider the model of an active chromatin hub and the alternative model of an active chromatin compartment, which was proposed based on reconsideration of some steps of the 3C procedure.
25831539,0,2015,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Motion of proximal histidine and structural allosteric transition in soluble guanylate cyclase.,We investigated the changes of heme coordination in purified soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by time-resolved spectroscopy in a time range encompassing 11 orders of magnitude (from 1 ps to 0.2 s). After dissociation, NO either recombines geminately to the 4-coordinate (4c) heme (τG1 = 7.5 ps; 97 ± 1% of the population) or exits the heme pocket (3 ± 1%). The proximal His rebinds to the 4c heme with a 70-ps time constant. Then, NO is distributed in two approximately equal populations (1.5%). One geminately rebinds to the 5c heme (τG2 = 6.5 ns), whereas the other diffuses out to the solution, from where it rebinds bimolecularly (τ = 50 μs with [NO] = 200 μM) forming a 6c heme with a diffusion-limited rate constant of 2 × 10(8) M(-1)⋅s(-1). In both cases, the rebinding of NO induces the cleavage of the Fe-His bond that can be observed as an individual reaction step. Saliently, the time constant of bond cleavage differs depending on whether NO binds geminately or from solution (τ5C1 = 0.66 μs and τ5C2 = 10 ms, respectively). Because the same event occurs with rates separated by four orders of magnitude, this measurement implies that sGC is in different structural states in both cases, having different strain exerted on the Fe-His bond. We show here that this structural allosteric transition takes place in the range 1-50 μs. In this context, the detection of NO binding to the proximal side of sGC heme is discussed.
25813138,0,2015,J Environ Radioact,Long-term assessment of contaminated articles from the Chernobyl reactor.,The Chernobyl accident caused a release of radioactive materials from the reactor into the environment. This event contaminated people, their surroundings and their personal property, especially in the zone around the reactor. Among the affected individuals were British students who were studying in Minsk and Kiev at the time of the Chernobyl accident. These students were exposed to external and internal radiation, and the individuals' articles of clothing were contaminated. The primary objective of this study was to analyze a sample of this contaminated clothing 20 years after the accident using three different detectors, namely, a BP4/4C scintillation detector, a Min-Con Geiger-Müller tube detector and a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector. The clothing articles were initially assessed and found not to be significantly contaminated. However, there were several hot spots of contamination in various regions of the articles. The net count rates for these hot spots were in the range of 10.00 ± 3.16 c/s to 41.00 ± 6.40 c/s when the BP4/4C scintillation detector was used. The HPGe detector was used to identify the radionuclides present in the clothing, and the results indicated that the only active radionuclide was (137)Cs because of this isotope's long half-life.
25810480,0,2015,J Neurophysiol,Contrasting effects of strabismic amblyopia on metabolic activity in superficial and deep layers of striate cortex.,To probe the mechanism of visual suppression, we have raised macaques with strabismus by disinserting the medial rectus muscle in each eye at 1 mo of age. Typically, this operation produces a comitant, alternating exotropia with normal acuity in each eye. Here we describe an unusual occurrence: the development of severe amblyopia in one eye of a monkey after induction of exotropia. Shortly after surgery, the animal demonstrated a strong fixation preference for the left eye, with apparent suppression of the right eye. Later, behavioral testing showed inability to track or to saccade to targets with the right eye. With the left eye occluded, the animal demonstrated no visually guided behavior. Optokinetic nystagmus was absent in the right eye. Metabolic activity in striate cortex was assessed by processing the tissue for cytochrome oxidase (CO). Amblyopia caused loss of CO in one eye's rows of patches, presumably those serving the blind eye. Layers 4A and 4B showed columns of reduced CO, in register with pale rows of patches in layer 2/3. Layers 4C, 5, and 6 also showed columns of CO activity, but remarkably, comparison with more superficial layers showed a reversal in contrast. In other words, pale CO staining in layers 2/3, 4A, and 4B was aligned with dark CO staining in layers 4C, 5, and 6. No experimental intervention or deprivation paradigm has been reported previously to produce opposite effects on metabolic activity in layers 2/3, 4A, and 4B vs. layers 4C, 5, and 6 within a given eye's columns.
25800645,0,2015,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis, biological evaluation and molecular docking of some substituted pyrazolines and isoxazolines as potential antimicrobial agents.,A series of substituted pyrazolines (2a-e, 3a-h and 6a-c) and isoxazolines (4a-e) were synthesized and their structures were established on the basis of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectra. All the synthesized compounds were tested against two bacterial and four fungal strains and found to exhibit moderate to potent antifungal activity. Compounds 2b, 4c, 4d and 6a-c exhibited significant activity against all tested fungal strains. MIC values of all the active compounds were comparable with standard drug fluconazole. The results of the in silico molecular docking study supported the antifungal activity of the synthesized compounds.
25799264,0,2015,J Med Chem,Design and Synthesis of New α-Naphthoflavones as Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1B1 Inhibitors To Overcome Docetaxel-Resistance Associated with CYP1B1 Overexpression.,CYP1B1 is recognized as a new target in cancer prevention and therapy. Taking α-naphthoflavone as a lead, a series of 6,7,10-trimethoxy-α-naphthoflavones (4a-o) were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory potency against CYP1B1 and selectivity over CYP1A1 and 1A2. SAR analysis indicated that introducing methoxy groups at C(6), C(7), and C(10) on the naphthalene part and a fluoro atom at C(3') on the B-ring, could sharply increase the efficiency toward CYP1B1 inhibition. Among the prepared derivatives, compound 4c is the most potent and selective CYP1B1 inhibitor ever reported. More effort was taken to acquire water-soluble α-naphthoflavone derivatives for further cell-based study of overcoming anticancer drug-resistance. Finally, we obtained water-soluble naphthoflavone (11f) which could obviously eliminate the docetaxel-resistance caused by the enhanced expression of CYP1B1 in MCF-7/1B1 cells. It could be envisaged that the discovery of new α-naphthoflavones as CYP1B1 inhibitors is clinically important for overcoming CYP1B1-mediated drug-resistance in cancer therapeutics.
25793199,0,2015,Biomed Res Int,Application of bladder acellular matrix in urinary bladder regeneration: the state of the art and future directions.,Construction of the urinary bladder de novo using tissue engineering technologies is the &quot;holy grail&quot; of reconstructive urology. The search for the ideal biomaterial for urinary bladder reconstruction has been ongoing for decades. One of the most promising biomaterials for this purpose seems to be bladder acellular matrix (BAM). In this review we determine the most important factors, which may affect biological and physical properties of BAM and its regeneration potential in tissue engineered urinary bladder. We also point out the directions in modification of BAM, which include incorporation of exogenous growth factors into the BAM structure. Finally, we discuss the results of the urinary bladder regeneration with cell seeded BAM.
25791388,0,2015,Dalton Trans,Phosphine, isocyanide, and alkyne reactivity at pentanuclear molybdenum/tungsten-iridium clusters.,The trigonal bipyramidal clusters M2Ir3(μ-CO)3(CO)6(η(5)-C5H5)2(η(5)-C5Me4R) (M = Mo, R = Me 1a, R = H; M = W, R = Me, H) reacted with isocyanides to give ligand substitution products M2Ir3(μ-CO)3(CO)5(CNR′)(η(5)-C5H5)2(η(5)-C5Me4R) (M = Mo, R = Me, R′ = C6H3Me2-2,6 3a; M = Mo, R = Me, R′ = (t)Bu 3b), in which core geometry and metal atom locations are maintained, whereas reactions with PPh3 afforded M2Ir3(μ-CO)4(CO)4(PPh3)(η(5)-C5H5)2(η(5)-C5Me4R) (M = Mo, R = Me 4a, H 4c; M = W, R = Me 4b, H), with retention of core geometry but with effective site-exchange of the precursors’ apical Mo/W with an equatorial Ir. Similar treatment of trigonal bipyramidal MIr4(μ-CO)3(CO)7(η(5)-C5H5)(η(5)-C5Me5) (M = Mo 2a, W 2b) with PPh3 afforded the mono-substitution products MIr4(μ-CO)3(CO)6(PPh3)(η(5)-C5H5)(η(5)-C5Me5) (M = Mo 5a; M = W 5b), and further reaction of the molybdenum example 5a with excess PPh3 afforded the bis-substituted cluster MoIr4(μ3-CO)2(μ-CO)2(CO)4(PPh3)2(η(5)-C5H5)(η(5)-C5Me5) (6). Reaction of 1a with diphenylacetylene proceeded with alkyne coordination and C≡C cleavage, affording Mo2Ir3(μ4–η(2)-PhC2Ph)(μ3-CPh)2(CO)4(η(5)-C5H5)2(η(5)-C5Me5) (7a) together with an isomer. Reactions of 2a and 2b with PhC≡CR afforded MIr4(μ3–η(2)-PhC2R)(μ3-CO)2(CO)6(η(5)-C5H5)(η(5)-C5Me5) (M = Mo, R = Ph 8a; M = W, R = Ph 8b, H; M = W, R = C6H4(C2Ph)-3 9a, C6H4(C2Ph)-4), while addition of 0.5 equivalents of the diynes 1,3-C6H4(C2Ph)2 and 1,4-C6H4(C2Ph)2 to WIr4(μ-CO)3(CO)7(η(5)-C5H5)(η(5)-C5Me5) gave the linked clusters [WIr4(CO)8(η(5)-C5H5)(η(5)-C5Me5)]2(μ6–η(4)-PhC2C6H4(C2Ph)-X) (X = 3, 4). The structures of 3a, 4a–4c, 5b, 6, 7a, 8a, 8b and 9a were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, establishing the core isomerization of 4, the site selectivity for ligand substitution in 3–6, the alkyne C≡C dismutation in 7, and the site of alkyne coordination in 7–9. For clusters 3–6, ease of oxidation increases on increasing donor strength of ligand, increasing extent of ligand substitution, replacing Mo by W, and decreasing core Ir content, the Ir-rich clusters 5 and 6 being the most reversible. For clusters 7–9, ease of oxidation diminishes on replacing Mo by W, increasing the Ir content, and proceeding from mono-yne to diyne, although the latter two changes are small. In situ UV-vis-near-IR spectroelectrochemical studies of the (electrochemically reversible) reduction process of 8b were undertaken, the spectra becoming increasingly broad and featureless following reduction. The incorporation of isocyanides, phosphines, or alkyne residues in these pentanuclear clusters all result in an increased ease of oxidation and decreased ease of reduction, and thereby tune the electron richness of the clusters.
25788621,0,2015,Bioinformatics,4DGenome: a comprehensive database of chromatin interactions.,MOTIVATION: The 3D structure of the genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression. Recent progress in mapping technologies for chromatin interactions has led to a rapid increase in this kind of interaction data. This trend will continue as research in this burgeoning field intensifies.RESULTS: We describe the 4DGenome database that stores chromatin interaction data compiled through comprehensive literature curation. The database currently covers both low- and high-throughput assays, including 3C, 4C-Seq, 5C, Hi-C, ChIA-PET and Capture-C. To complement the set of interactions detected by experimental assays, we also include interactions predicted by a recently developed computational method with demonstrated high accuracy. The database currently contains ∼8 million records, covering 102 cell/tissue types in five organisms. Records in the database are described using a standardized file format, facilitating data exchange. The vast major of the interactions were assigned a confidence score. Using the web interface, users can query and download database records via a number of annotation dimensions. Query results can be visualized along with other genomics datasets via links to the UCSC genome browser. We anticipate that 4DGenome will be a valuable resource for investigating the spatial structure-and-function relationship of genomes.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: 4Dgenome is freely accessible at http://4dgenome.int-med.uiowa.edu.

25784492,0,2015,J Agric Food Chem,Ametoctradin is a potent Qo site inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiration complex III.,Ametoctradin is a new Oomycete-specific fungicide under development by BASF. It is a potent inhibitor of the bc1 complex in mitochondrial respiration. However, its detailed action mechanism remains unknown. In the present work, the binding mode of ametoctradin was first uncovered by integrating molecular docking, MD simulations, and MM/PBSA calculations, which showed that ametoctradin should be a Q(o) site inhibitor of bc1 complex. Subsequently, a series of new 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derivatives were designed and synthesized to further understand the substituent effects on the 5- and 6-position of 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine. The calculated binding free energies (ΔG(cal)) of newly synthesized analogues as Qo site inhibitors correlated very well (R(2) = 0.96) with their experimental binding free energies (ΔG(exp)). Two compounds (4a and 4c) with higher inhibitory activity against porcine SQR than ametoctradin were successfully identified. The structural and mechanistic insights obtained from the present study will provide a valuable clue for future designing of a new promising bc1 inhibitor.
25775519,0,2015,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Environmental stress induces trinucleotide repeat mutagenesis in human cells.,The dynamic mutability of microsatellite repeats is implicated in the modification of gene function and disease phenotype. Studies of the enhanced instability of long trinucleotide repeats (TNRs)-the cause of multiple human diseases-have revealed a remarkable complexity of mutagenic mechanisms. Here, we show that cold, heat, hypoxic, and oxidative stresses induce mutagenesis of a long CAG repeat tract in human cells. We show that stress-response factors mediate the stress-induced mutagenesis (SIM) of CAG repeats. We show further that SIM of CAG repeats does not involve mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, or transcription, processes that are known to promote TNR mutagenesis in other pathways of instability. Instead, we find that these stresses stimulate DNA rereplication, increasing the proportion of cells with &gt;4 C-value (C) DNA content. Knockdown of the replication origin-licensing factor CDT1 eliminates both stress-induced rereplication and CAG repeat mutagenesis. In addition, direct induction of rereplication in the absence of stress also increases the proportion of cells with &gt;4C DNA content and promotes repeat mutagenesis. Thus, environmental stress triggers a unique pathway for TNR mutagenesis that likely is mediated by DNA rereplication. This pathway may impact normal cells as they encounter stresses in their environment or during development or abnormal cells as they evolve metastatic potential.
25768697,0,2015,Eur J Med Chem,New heterocyclic hybrids of pyrazole and its bioisosteres: design, synthesis and biological evaluation as dual acting antimalarial-antileishmanial agents.,A new series of pyrazole derivatives were synthesized by hybridization with five-membered heterocyclic moieties such as thiazoles, thiazolidinones, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles and pyrazolines. The compounds were evaluated for their in vivo antimalarial activity against Plasmodium berghei infected mice and the most active derivatives were further examined for their in vitro antimalarial activity against chloroquine resistant (RKL9) strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Compounds 2c, 2d, 4b, 4c, 4d, 5a, 6c, 8c and 9b had more than 90% parasite suppression activity of that found with the antimalarial reference standard drug, chloroquine phosphate and had lower IC50 values than chloroquine. Compounds 4b and 9b were the most active derivatives, and their activities were 5-fold higher than chloroquine. All the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antileishmanial activity against Leishmania aethiopica promastigotes and amastigote. The results showed that compounds 2c, 2d, 3d, 4b, 4c, 4d and 5a had lower or similar IC50 values than the reference standard drugs, amphotericin B and miltefosine. Compound 3d had the highest antileishmanial activity. Collectively, compounds 2c, 2d, 4b, 4c, 4d and 5a exhibited dual activity against malaria and leishmaniasis and were safe and well tolerated by the experimental animals orally up to 300 mg/kg and parenterally up to 100 mg/kg.
25756759,0,2015,Microb Drug Resist,Antibiotic Resistance of Listeria monocytogenes Isolated from Meat-Processing Environments, Beef Products, and Clinical Cases in Brazil.,The present study aimed to assess the antimicrobial resistance and the presence of virulence markers in 137 Listeria monocytogenes isolates obtained from meat-processing environments, beef products, and clinical cases. All isolates were subject to molecular serogrouping and their antibiotic resistance profiles were assessed against 12 antimicrobials. In addition, isolates were subjected to detection of virulence marker genes (inlA, inlC, inlJ). The isolates were classified into serogroups 4b, 4d, 4a, or 4c (46%), 1/2c or 3c (27%), 1/2a or 3a (13.9%), and 1/2b or 3b (13.1%). All tested isolates presented sensitivity to the majority of the tested antimicrobials, but most of them presented resistance or intermediate resistance to clindamycin (88.3%) and oxacillin (73.7%). Virulence markers were detected in all isolates, demanding further analysis to better characterize their pathogenic potential.
25743216,0,2015,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis, docking and ADMET studies of novel chalcone triazoles for anti-cancer and anti-diabetic activity.,A series of novel chalcone-triazole derivatives were synthesized and screened for in vitro anticancer activity on the human cancer cell lines IMR32 (neuroblastoma), HepG2 (hepatoma) and MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), DU-145 (prostate carcinoma), and A549 (lung adenocarcinoma). Among the tested compounds, 4r showed the most promising anticancer activity in all the cell lines whereas, compounds 4c (IC50 65.86 μM), 4e (IC50 66.28 μM), 4o (IC50 35.81 μM), 4q (IC50 50.82 μM) and 4s (IC50 48.63 μM) showed better activity than the standard doxorubicin (IC50 69.33 μM) in A549 cell line alone. Rat intestinal α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the synthesized derivatives showed 4m (IC50 67.77 μM), 4p (IC50 74.94 in μM) and 4s (IC50 102.10 μM) as most active compared to others. The in silico docking of synthesized derivatives 4a-4t with DNA topoisomerase IIα revealed the LibDock score in the range of 71.2623-118.29 whereas, compounds 4h, 4m, 4p and 4s with docking target α-glucosidase were in the range of 100.372-107.784.
25738741,0,2015,Biochem J,An antibody raised against a pathogenic serpin variant induces mutant-like behaviour in the wild-type protein.,A monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to a transient intermediate may act as a catalyst for the corresponding reaction; here we show this principle can extend on a macro molecular scale to the induction of mutant-like oligomerization in a wild-type protein. Using the common pathogenic E342K (Z) variant of α1-antitrypsin as antigen-whose native state is susceptible to the formation of a proto-oligomeric intermediate-we have produced a mAb (5E3) that increases the rate of oligomerization of the wild-type (M) variant. Employing ELISA, gel shift, thermal stability and FRET time-course experiments, we show that mAb5E3 does not bind to the native state of α1-antitrypsin, but recognizes a cryptic epitope in the vicinity of the post-helix A loop and strand 4C that is revealed upon transition to the polymerization intermediate, and which persists in the ensuing oligomer. This epitope is not shared by loop-inserted monomeric conformations. We show the increased amenity to polymerization by either the pathogenic E342K mutation or the binding of mAb5E3 occurs without affecting the energetic barrier to polymerization. As mAb5E3 also does not alter the relative stability of the monomer to intermediate, it acts in a manner similar to the E342K mutant, by facilitating the conformational interchange between these two states.
25737037,0,2015,Muscle Nerve,Phenotypic variability of CMT4C in a French-Canadian kindred.,INTRODUCTION: Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4C (CMT4C) is an autosomal recessive dysmyelinating neuropathy characterized by precocious and rapidly progressive scoliosis.METHODS: Patients in a French-Canadian kindred were evaluated with clinical examination, electrophysiologic study, and genomic DNA extraction.RESULTS: Six of 10 siblings were clinically symptomatic with supportive electrophysiologic features. The proband presented with regional side-to-side sensorimotor asymmetry, typical pes cavus without obvious scoliosis, and unremarkable plain films of the spine. Affected siblings all share symptoms of foot deformity but have variable onset of neuropathic symptoms, degree of extremity weakness, progression of symptoms, and, most notably, evidence of scoliosis. DNA sequence analysis revealed a novel combination of 2 known recessive mutations, p.R904X and p.R954X, in the SH3TC2 gene.CONCLUSIONS: A broad spectrum of phenotypes should be considered in the possible diagnosis of CMT4C. The absence of scoliosis or late-onset symptoms should not exclude SH3TC2 from the list of candidate genes under consideration. Age of onset and clinical features were variable and suggest that polygenic factors contribute to the final phenotype. Muscle Nerve, 2015.
25732097,0,2015,Appl Radiat Isot,Radiation shielding design of BNCT treatment room for D-T neutron source.,Recent studies have shown that D-T neutron generator can be used as a proper neutron source for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) of deep-seated brain tumors. In this paper, radiation shielding calculations have been conducted based on the computational method for designing a BNCT treatment room for a recent proposed D-T neutron source. By using the MCNP-4C code, the geometry of the treatment room has been designed and optimized in such a way that the equivalent dose rate out of the treatment room to be less than 0.5μSv/h for uncontrolled areas. The treatment room contains walls, monitoring window, maze and entrance door. According to the radiation protection viewpoint, dose rate results of out of the proposed room showed that using D-T neutron source for BNCT is safe.
25730390,0,2015,Molecules,Synthesis, central nervous system activity and structure-activity relationships of novel 1-(1-Alkyl-4-aryl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazo)-3-substituted urea derivatives.,A series of 10 novel urea derivatives has been synthesized and evaluated for their central nervous system activity. Compounds 3a-3h were prepared in the reaction between the respective 1-alkyl-4-aryl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-amines 1a and 1b and appropriate benzyl-, phenethyl-isocyanate or ethyl 4-isocyanatobenzoate and ethyl isocyanatoacetate 2 in dichloromethane. Derivatives 4c and 4g resulted from the conversion of 3c and 3g into the respective amides due to action of an aqueous ammonia solution. The results obtained in this study, based on literature data suggest a possible involvement of serotonin system and/or the opioid system in the effects of tested compounds, and especially in the effect of compound 3h. The best activity of compound 3h may be primarily attributed to its favourable ADMET properties, i.e., higher lipophilicity (related to lower polar surface area and greater molecular surface, volume and mass than for other compounds) and good blood-brain permeation. This compound has also the greatest polarizability and ovality. The HOMO and LUMO energies do not seem to be directly related to activity.
25728023,0,2015,Eur J Med Chem,Fluoroalkane thioheterocyclic derivatives and their antitumor activity.,Two series of novel trifluorobutenyl derivatives of heterocyclic with convenient and efficient synthesis methods and their antitumor activity on three cell lines have been reported for the first time. The derivatives were synthesized by the nucleophilic substitution between 4-bromo-1,1,2-trifluorobutene-1-ene and commercially available nitrogen-containing heterocycles with sulfydryl or monosubstituted malononitrile. The twenty-four new compounds were characterized by (1)HNMR, (13)CNMR and HR-MS. Totally, thirty-seven compounds were evaluated for the antitumor activity on three cancer cell lines (SH-SY5Y, MCF-7 and HepG2) using conventional MTT assay. The pharmacological results indicated that the compounds 3c, 3h, 4c, 8, 9, 10 and 11 showed potent to moderate antitumor activity against three cancer cell lines, with IC50 values ranging between 0.4 μM and 41.5 μM. Even though they had less active than the reference compound taxol against MCF-7 and HepG2 lines, but they were better than the reference compound noscapine against SH-SY5Y cells, especially the compound 3h with a IC50 value of 0.4 μM.
25712772,0,2015,Virus Genes,Full genome sequence of guinea fowl coronavirus associated with fulminating disease.,Guinea fowl coronavirus (GfCoV), a recently characterized avian coronavirus, was identified from outbreaks of fulminating disease (peracute enteritis) in guinea fowl in France. The full-length genomic sequence was determined to better understand its genetic relationship with avian coronaviruses. The full-length coding genome sequence was 26,985 nucleotides long with 11 open reading frames and no hemagglutinin-esterase gene: a genome organization identical to that of turkey coronavirus [5' untranslated region (UTR)-replicase (ORFs 1a, 1ab)-spike (S) protein-ORF3 (ORFs 3a, 3b)-small envelop (E or 3c) protein-membrane (M) protein-ORF5 (ORFs 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b)-nucleocapsid (N) protein (ORFs N and 6b)-3' UTR]. This is the first complete genome sequence of a GfCoV and confirms that the new virus belongs to group gammacoronaviruses.
25709727,0,2015,Pan Afr Med J,Genotypes and subtypes of hepatitis C virus in Burundi: a particularity in sub-Saharan Africa.,INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health issue. HCV genotype identification is clinically important to tailor the dosage and duration of treatment. Indeed, distinct therapeutic approaches are required for each genotype. Up to now, there is no study assessing HCV genotypes and subtypes in Burundi. The aim of the study was to determine HCV genotypes and subtypes in Burundi and to highlight the difficulties related to LiPA Method, widely used for African samples.METHODS: In this study, a total of 179 samples contained anti-HCV antibodies were tested for HCV RNA, genotyping and subtyping. The analysis had been made in Cerba laboratory, Paris, France.RESULTS: 166 patients (92.7%) were genotype 4; 10 patients (5.6%) were genotype 1 and 3 patients (1.7%) were genotype 3. It was possible to determine subtypes for 51 HCV-4 (30.7%) patients. Among these, 25 (49.1%) had 4h subtype; 11 (21.6%) had 4e subtype; 2 (3.9%) had 4k subtype and 13 patients (25.5%) had 4a/4c/4d subtype. The LiPA method failed to subtype 115 (69.3%) HCV-4 and to separate the three subtype: 4a, 4c and 4d.CONCLUSION: Genotype 4 and subtype 4h followed by 4e are the widespread in Burundi.
25699484,0,2015,Brain Cogn,The need to differentiate the magnocellular system from the dorsal stream in connection with dyslexia.,A number of authors have postulated a &quot;magnocellular-dorsal stream&quot; deficit in dyslexia. Combining the magnocellular system and the dorsal stream into a single entity in this context faces the problem that contrast sensitivity data do not point to a magnocellular deficiency linked to dyslexia, while, on the other hand, motion perception data are largely consistent with a dorsal stream dysfunction. Thus, there are data both for and against a &quot;magnocellular-dorsal stream&quot; deficit in connection with dyslexia. It is here pointed out that this inconsistency is abolished once it is recognized that the magnocellular system and the dorsal stream are separate entities.
25675144,0,2015,J Med Chem,Synthesis of CDDO-amino acid-nitric oxide donor trihybrids as potential antitumor agents against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant colon cancer.,Seventeen CDDO-amino acid-NO donor trihybrids (4a-q) were designed and synthesized. Biological evaluation indicated that the most active compound 4c produced high levels of NO and inhibited the proliferation of drug-sensitive (HCT-8, IC50 = 0.294 μM) and drug-resistant (HCT-8/5-FU, IC50 = 0.232 μM) colon cancer cells, which were attenuated by an NO scavenger or typical substrate of PepT1. Furthermore, 4c triggered HCT-8 and HCT-8/5-FU cell apoptosis more strongly than CDDO-Me, inhibited the HIF-1α, Stat3, AKT, and ERK signaling, and induced the nitration of P-gp, MRP1, and BCRP proteins in HCT-8/5-FU cells. Finally, 4c had 4.36-5.53-fold less inhibitory activity against nontumor colon epithelial-like cells (CCD841, IC50 = 1.282 μM) in vitro and inhibited the growth of implanted human drug-resistant colon cancers in mice more potently than CDDO-Me. Together, 4c is a novel trihybrid with potent antitumor activity and may be a promising candidate for the treatment of drug-resistant colon cancer.
25659076,0,2015,PLoS One,Markers of bone metabolism are affected by renal function and growth hormone therapy in children with chronic kidney disease.,OBJECTIVES: The extent and relevance of altered bone metabolism for statural growth in children with chronic kidney disease is controversial. We analyzed the impact of renal dysfunction and recombinant growth hormone therapy on a panel of serum markers of bone metabolism in a large pediatric chronic kidney disease cohort.METHODS: Bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b), sclerostin and C-terminal FGF-23 (cFGF23) normalized for age and sex were analyzed in 556 children aged 6-18 years with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 10-60 ml/min/1.73 m2. 41 children receiving recombinant growth hormone therapy were compared to an untreated matched control group.RESULTS: Standardized levels of BAP, TRAP5b and cFGF-23 were increased whereas sclerostin was reduced. BAP was correlated positively and cFGF-23 inversely with eGFR. Intact serum parathormone was an independent positive predictor of BAP and TRAP5b and negatively associated with sclerostin. BAP and TRAP5B were negatively affected by increased C-reactive protein levels. In children receiving recombinant growth hormone, BAP was higher and TRAP5b lower than in untreated controls. Sclerostin levels were in the normal range and higher than in untreated controls. Serum sclerostin and cFGF-23 independently predicted height standard deviation score, and BAP and TRAP5b the prospective change in height standard deviation score.CONCLUSION: Markers of bone metabolism indicate a high-bone turnover state in children with chronic kidney disease. Growth hormone induces an osteoanabolic pattern and normalizes osteocyte activity. The osteocyte markers cFGF23 and sclerostin are associated with standardized height, and the markers of bone turnover predict height velocity.
25655387,0,2015,Amino Acids,Synthesis and in vitro antitumor activity of new octapeptide analogs of somatostatin containing unnatural amino acids.,Some modified octapeptide analogs of somatostatin with the following structure D-Phe-c(Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Xxx-Yyy-Cys)-Thr-NH2, where Xxx is Lys or Orn and Yyy is Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid), Ac5c (1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid) or Ac6c (1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) have been synthesized. The peptides were prepared by standard Fmoc-solid phase peptide chemistry method. The direct disulphide bond formation has been employed on the solid phase by Tl(CF3CO2)3. The cytotoxic effects of the compounds were tested in vitro against a panel of tumor cell lines: HT-29 (human colorectal cancer cell line), MDA-MB-23 (human breast cancer cell line), Hep-G2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line), HeLa (cervical cancer cell line) and normal human diploid cell line Lep-3. The new peptides exhibited different concentration-dependent antiproliferative effect against the tumor cell lines after 24 h treatment. The compounds were most effective to the HT-29 tumor cells. The compound 4C (Orn(5), Aib(6)) demonstrated the most pronounced antiproliferative effects on HT-29 cells with the IC50 = 0.0199 μM.
25643758,0,2015,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Design, synthesis and bioevaluation of novel umbelliferone analogues as potential mushroom tyrosinase inhibitors.,Abstract A series of umbelliferone analogues were synthesized and their inhibitory effects on the DPPH and mushroom tyrosinase were evaluated. The results showed that some of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant mushroom tyrosinase inhibitory activities. Especially, 2-oxo-2-[(2-oxo-2H-chromen-7-yl)oxy]ethyl-2,4-dihydroxybenzoate (4e) bearing 2,4-dihydroxy substituted phenyl ring exhibited the most potent tyrosinase inhibitory activity with IC50 value 8.96 µM and IC50 value of kojic acid is 16.69. The inhibition mechanism analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plots revealed that the type of inhibition of compound 4e on tyrosinase was non-competitive. The docking study against tyrosinase enzyme was also performed to determine the binding affinity of the compounds. The compounds 4c and 4e showed the highest binding affinity with active binding site of tyrosinase. The initial structure activity relationships (SARs) analysis suggested that further development of such compounds might be of interest. The statistics of our results endorses that compounds 4c and 4e may serve as a structural template for the design and development of novel tyrosinase inhibitors.
25643071,0,2015,J Am Chem Soc,Two-dimensional Cu2Si monolayer with planar hexacoordinate copper and silicon bonding.,Two-dimensional (2D) materials with planar hypercoordinate motifs are extremely rare due to the difficulty in stabilizing the planar hypercoordinate configurations in extended systems. Furthermore, such exotic motifs are often unstable. We predict a novel Cu2Si 2D monolayer featuring planar hexacoordinate copper and planar hexacoordinate silicon. This is a global minimum in 2D space which displays reduced dimensionality and rule-breaking chemical bonding. This system has been studied with density functional theory, including molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations. Bond order analysis and partitioning reveals 4c-2e σ bonds that stabilize the two-dimensional structure. We find that the system is quite stable during short annealing simulations up to 900 K, and predict that it is a nonmagnetic metal. This work opens up a new branch of hypercoordinate two-dimensional materials for study.
25634392,0,2015,Indian Heart J,Two dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography in detection of subclinical left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with severe aortic stenosis.,INTRODUCTION: Subclinical left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction may develop in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) despite normal LV ejection fraction (EF%).THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the role of two dimensional (2D) speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) in detection of subclinical LV systolic dysfunction in patients with severe AS.PATIENTS AND METHOD: The study included 50 patients with severe AS (mean age: 45 ± 9 years) and 30 age-matched healthy individuals (mean age 43 ± 7 years. Conventional echocardiographic parameters used for the assessment of AS severity were measures and 2D Speckle tracking imaging of the peak systolic strain curves of the Inferior septum and lateral wall in the apical four-chamber view (4C-PLS), the Inferior and anterior wall was in the apical two chamber view (2C-PLS), and the infero lateral and anterior septum in the apical three-chamber view (3C-PLS) were obtained. Left ventricular global longitudinal systolic strain (LV-GLS) was calculated by averaging the peak systolic values of the 6 LV walls.RESULTS: LV-GLS was significantly reduced in patients with AS compared to controls (&lt;0.001) and negatively correlated with left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (r = -0.47, p = 0.01) irrespective of EF%, maximum velocity, peak pressure gradient and mean pressure gradient across the aortic valve and the aortic valve area.CONCLUSION: Patients with severe AS have evidence of subclinical LV systolic dysfunction despite preserved EF%. 2D speckle tracking appears to be useful in detection of subclinical LV dysfunction in patients with AS.
25627404,0,2015,Ther Drug Monit,Determination of the HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir in plasma and dried blood spot by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.,BACKGROUND: Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. Analytical methods for telaprevir should separate the compound from its R-diastereomer VRT-127394, which is 30-fold less active. The objective of this work was to develop liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) assays for telaprevir both in plasma as well as in dried blood spot (DBS), capable of stabilizing the equilibrium and chromatographically separating the two epimers.METHODS: Human plasma was acidified with formic acid and frozen within one hour after collection, to stabilize the equilibrium between the two telaprevir diastereomers ex vivo in plasma. After protein precipitation the sample was analyzed with LC-MS/MS. For the DBS assay, sampling paper was impregnated with citric acid solution to achieve stabilisation of the epimers on the sampling paper. DBS samples were extracted before LC-MS/MS analysis. LC-MS/MS analysis comprised on line solid-phase extraction and separation on a C18 column with the mass spectrometer operating in TurboIonSpray negative ionization mode and performing multiple reaction monitoring.RESULTS: The assays were linear over the concentration range of 0.1-10 mg/L in plasma and DBS. Accuracies ranged from 97% to 106% in plasma and from 93% to 99% in DBS. Within- and between-day coefficients of variation were &lt;7.9% in plasma and &lt;9.3% in DBS. Human whole blood samples with hematocrit values of 27-47% gave reproducible quantitation results in the DBS assay and spot volume did not affect results of the DBS assay either. Acidified plasma with telaprevir was stable for 5 hours at 20C, and telaprevir on impregnated DBS paper was stable for at least 3 months at 4C or at 20C.CONCLUSIONS: An assay was developed and validated for the determination of telaprevir in human plasma, separating telaprevir from its R-diastereomer VRT-127394. In addition, a DBS assay was developed, which avoids immediate centrifuging, acidification and freezing of patient samples to stabilize the equilibrium between the two telaprevir diastereomers.
25612671,0,2015,Kobe J Med Sci,Identification and characterization of TMEM33 as a reticulon-binding protein.,Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle that has an elaborate and continuous membrane system composed of sheet-like cisternae and a network of interconnected tubules. The ER tubules are shaped by reticulons, a conserved ER membrane protein family. However, how the membrane-shaping activity is regulated remains to be elucidated. To understand the mode of action of reticulons, we isolated TMEM33, a conserved protein harboring three transmembrane domains, as a reticulon 4C-binding protein by affinity chromatography. In addition to reticulon 4C, TMEM33 binds to reticulon 1A, -2B, -3C and a reticulon homology domain-containing protein Arl6IP1. Exogenously expressed TMEM33 localizes at both the ER membrane and the nuclear envelope. Exogenously expressed TMEM33 co-localizes with exogenously expressed reticulon 4C well at the ER sheets and partially at the ER tubules. Exogenously expressed TMEM33 suppresses the exogenously expressed reticulon 4C-induced tubulation of ER. These results suggest that TMEM33 has a potency to suppress the membrane-shaping activity of reticulons, thereby regulating the tubular structure of ER.
25608770,0,2015,Ann Surg Oncol,Evaluation of Malignancy Risk Stratification of Microcalcifications Detected on Mammography: A Study Based on the 5th Edition of BI-RADS.,BACKGROUND: The 5th edition of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System subdivides suspicious calcifications into two categories: 4B-amorphous, coarse heterogeneous, and fine pleomorphic calcifications; 4C-fine linear or fine linear branching calcifications. We investigated whether these revised categories are appropriate for malignancy risk stratification.METHODS: We studied 246 patients (mean age 48.2 years) with suspicious microcalcifications detected on mammography who underwent stereotactic biopsy (n = 154) or surgical excisional biopsy with preoperative mammogram-guided needle localization (n = 92). Pre-biopsy mammograms were reviewed retrospectively, and imaging features were analyzed according to the revised morphology and distribution descriptors. Pathological results of stereotactic biopsy and surgical excision were considered, with the surgical results being the reference standard. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated and compared using the χ (2) test or Fisher's exact test.RESULTS: Overall PPV of suspicious microcalcifications was 22.4 %. PPVs of morphology descriptors were as follows: amorphous 7.9 %, coarse heterogeneous 17.8 %, fine pleomorphic 63.2 %, fine linear/fine linear branching 100 % (p &lt; 0.001). PPVs of distribution descriptors were as follows: regional 8.8 %, grouped 14.3 %, linear 87.5 %, segmental 63.6 % (p &lt; 0.001). For morphology and distribution descriptors combinations, PPVs for amorphous/regional and amorphous/grouped microcalcifications were 4.2 and 7.6 %, resepectively. The PPV for fine pleomorphic/linear or segmental was 93.8 %.CONCLUSIONS: Subcategorization of morphology descriptors for suspicious microcalcifications is needed because of the different PPVs for amorphous, coarse heterogeneous, and fine pleomorphic microcalcifications. Combining morphology and distribution descriptors for suspicious microcalcifications provides accurate risk stratification.
25577710,0,2015,Bioorg Med Chem,Design and synthesis of a novel series of histamine H3 receptor antagonists through a scaffold hopping strategy.,Lead compounds 5-fluoro-2-methyl-N-[2-methyl-4-(2-methyl-[1,3']bipyrrolidinyl-1'-yl)-phenyl]-benzamide (1), tetrahydro-pyran-4-carboxylic acid [((2S,3'S)-2-methyl-[1,3']bipyrrolidinyl-1'-yl)-phenyl]-amide (2), and 3,5-dimethyl-isoxazole-4-carboxylic acid [((2S,3'S)-2-methyl-[1,3']bipyrrolidinyl-1'-yl)-phenyl]-amide (3) discovered in our laboratory, displayed high histamine H3 receptor (H3R) affinity, good selectivity and weak human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) channel affinity with desirable overall physico-chemical and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of a novel series of H3R antagonists utilizing a scaffold hopping strategy. Further structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of the series culminated in the identification of ((2S,3'S)-2-methyl-[1,3']bipyrrolidinyl-1'-yl)-naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid (tetrahydro-pyran-4-yl)-amide (4c) and -[4-((2S,3'S)-2-methyl-[1,3']bipyrrolidinyl-1'-yl)-phenyl]-N-(tetrahydro-pyran-4-yl)-acetamide (4d), which exhibited good H3R affinity in vitro, good selectivity, and desirable PK properties. Compounds 4c and 4d were also assessed in cardiac safety experiments. In particular, the effects of the compounds on action potentials recorded from ventricular myocytes isolated from guinea pigs were used to screen compounds that not only displayed a low affinity towards hERG channel, but also had lower interference with other cardiac ion channels. Compound 4c did not alter the major parameters in this model system at ⩽10 μM, and no significant induction of any major haemodynamic effect when intravenously administered at 3mg/kg dose to anaesthetized mongrel dogs. Compound 4c is a new promising lead as orally potent and selective H3R antagonist belonging to a distinct structural class.
25567984,0,2015,Nucleic Acids Res,DNA binding by FOXP3 domain-swapped dimer suggests mechanisms of long-range chromosomal interactions.,FOXP3 is a lineage-specific transcription factor that is required for regulatory T cell development and function. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the FOXP3 forkhead domain bound to DNA. The structure reveals that FOXP3 can form a stable domain-swapped dimer to bridge DNA in the absence of cofactors, suggesting that FOXP3 may play a role in long-range gene interactions. To test this hypothesis, we used circular chromosome conformation capture coupled with high throughput sequencing (4C-seq) to analyze FOXP3-dependent genomic contacts around a known FOXP3-bound locus, Ptpn22. Our studies reveal that FOXP3 induces significant changes in the chromatin contacts between the Ptpn22 locus and other Foxp3-regulated genes, reflecting a mechanism by which FOXP3 reorganizes the genome architecture to coordinate the expression of its target genes. Our results suggest that FOXP3 mediates long-range chromatin interactions as part of its mechanisms to regulate specific gene expression in regulatory T cells.
25564376,0,2015,Bioorg Med Chem,Novel agonists of benzodiazepine receptors: design, synthesis, binding assay and pharmacological evaluation of 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidinone and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole derivatives.,Agonists of benzodiazepine (BZD) binding site in GABA receptors are widely used in clinical practice. In spite of their benefits they have several side effects, so synthesis of new agonists of these receptors to get more specific effect and better profile of adverse drug reactions is still continued. Novel BZD agonists were designed based on the pharmacophore/receptor model of BZD binding site of GABAA receptor. Energy minima conformers of the designed compounds and estazolam, a known BZD receptor agonist, were well superimposed in conformational analysis. Docking studies revealed that the carbonyl group of the compound 4c, 3-(2-chlorobenzyl)-5-methyl-2-phenyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7(3H)-one, was near the nitrogen moiety of triazole ring of estazolam providing the hydrogen bond acceptor in proper direction in the BDZ-binding site of GABAA receptor model (α1β2ϒ2). The designed compounds were synthesized and their in vitro affinity for the central BZD receptor was determined. Most of the novel compounds had better affinity for the BZD site of action on GABAA receptor complex than diazepam. Finally, the novel compound 4c with the best affinity in radioligand receptor binding assay (Ki=0.42 nM and IC50=0.68 nM) was selected as candidate for in vivo evaluation. This compound showed significant hypnotic activity and weak anticonvulsant effect with no impairment on learning and memory performance in mouse. The pharmacological effects of the compound 4c were antagonized by flumazenil, a BZD antagonist, which confirms the involvement of BZD receptors in the biological effects of the novel ligand.
25561915,0,2015,Iran J Pharm Res,Synthesis and Antibacterial Evaluation of (S,Z)-4-methyl-2-(4-oxo-5-((5-substituted phenylfuran-2-yl) methylene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-3-yl)Pentanoic Acids.,The microbial resistance has become a global hazard with the irrational use of antibiotics. Infection of drug-resistant bacteria seriously threatens human health. Currently, there is an urgent need for the development of novel antimicrobial agents with new mechanisms and lower levels of toxicity. In this paper, a series of (S ,Z)-4-methyl-2-(4-oxo-5-((5-substitutedphenylfuran-2-yl) methylene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-3-yl)pentanoic acids via a Knoevenagel condensation were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity in - vitro. The synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR and MS. The antibacterial test in - vitro showed that all of the synthesized compounds had good antibacterial activity against several Gram-positive bacteria (including multidrug-resistant clinical isolates) with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values in the range of 2-4 µg/mL. Especially compounds 4c, 4d, 4e and 4f were the most potent, with MIC values of 2 µg/mL against four multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacterial strains.
25553879,0,2015,Biointerphases,Lamellar slippage of bilayers--a hypothesis on low friction of natural joints.,The cartilage's amphoteric surface behavior is a physical phenomenon in biological lubrication. However, there is a lack of knowledge on amphoteric phospholipids bilayers and in overcoming friction in cartilage joints. In this paper, friction experiments were conducted, and the cartilage's surface was characterized using pH and wettability, while the interfacial energy and coefficients were determined. The lamellar slippage of bilayers and a short-range repulsion between the interfaces of negatively charged (-PO4 (-)) cartilage surfaces resulted in low frictional properties of the joint.
25553487,0,2015,J Org Chem,Cu(II)-promoted methanolysis of N,N-bis(2-picolyl)carbamates: rate-limiting metal ion delivery of coordinated alcoholate nucleophile followed by fast partitioning of a tetrahedral intermediate.,Five O-aryl/alkyl N,N-bis(2-picolyl)carbamates were prepared with the O-aryl/alkyl portions being p-nitrophenoxy, m-nitrophenoxy, trifluoroethoxy, methoxy, and isopropoxy (4a,b,c,d,e, respectively) and the kinetics and reaction products of their methanolysis reactions in the presence of Cu(O₃SCF₃)₂ determined. The catalyzed reactions have maximal rates for each substrate at a 1:1 ratio of [4]:[Cu²⁺] at (s)(s)pH 7.9, where the active forms are Cu(II):4:(⁻OCH₃). The reactions are fast, that for the complex of 4a having a t(1/2) of 30 s. The products of the reaction with 4a and 4b arise exclusively from C-OAr cleavage: those with 4d and 4e arise exclusively from C-N cleavage. With 4c, products from both C-O and C-N cleavage are observed in a 2.17:1 ratio. The common mechanism involves rate-limiting delivery of a Cu(II)-coordinated methoxide to the C═O unit to form a tetrahedral intermediate followed by fast partitioning to products by two pathways with relative barriers dependent on the (s)(s)pK(a)(HOAr/HOR). The data allow one to predict an effective (s)(s)pK(a) of ∼15.6 for the (s)(s)pK(a)(NH) of Cu(II):bis(2-picolyl)amine.
24642470,10,2014,J Clin Invest,A common genetic variant within SCN10A modulates cardiac SCN5A expression.,Variants in SCN10A, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel, are associated with alterations of cardiac conduction parameters and the cardiac rhythm disorder Brugada syndrome; however, it is unclear how SCN10A variants promote dysfunctional cardiac conduction. Here we showed by high-resolution 4C-seq analysis of the Scn10a-Scn5a locus in murine heart tissue that a cardiac enhancer located in Scn10a, encompassing SCN10A functional variant rs6801957, interacts with the promoter of Scn5a, a sodium channel-encoding gene that is critical for cardiac conduction. We observed that SCN5A transcript levels were several orders of magnitude higher than SCN10A transcript levels in both adult human and mouse heart tissue. Analysis of BAC transgenic mouse strains harboring an engineered deletion of the enhancer within Scn10a revealed that the enhancer was essential for Scn5a expression in cardiac tissue. Furthermore, the common SCN10A variant rs6801957 modulated Scn5a expression in the heart. In humans, the SCN10A variant rs6801957, which correlated with slowed conduction, was associated with reduced SCN5A expression. These observations establish a genomic mechanism for how a common genetic variation at SCN10A influences cardiac physiology and predisposes to arrhythmia.
24814726,7,2014,Neuroscience,Neuroanatomical distribution of oxytocin and vasopressin 1a receptors in the socially monogamous coppery titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus).,The coppery titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus) is a socially monogamous New World primate that has been studied in the field and the laboratory to investigate the behavioral neuroendocrinology of primate pair bonding and parental care. Arginine vasopressin has been shown to influence male titi monkey pair-bonding behavior, and studies are currently underway to examine the effects of oxytocin on titi monkey behavior and physiology. Here, we use receptor autoradiography to identify the distribution of arginine vasopressin 1a receptor (AVPR1a) and oxytocin receptors (OXTR) in hemispheres of titi monkey brain (n=5). AVPR1a are diffuse and widespread throughout the brain, but the OXTR distribution is much more limited, with the densest binding being in the hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus, CA1 field) and the presubiculum (layers I and III). Moderate OXTR binding was detected in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, pulvinar, superior colliculus, layer 4C of primary visual cortex, periaqueductal gray (PAG), pontine gray, nucleus prepositus, and spinal trigeminal nucleus. OXTR mRNA overlapped with OXTR radioligand binding, confirming that the radioligand was detecting OXTR protein. AVPR1a binding is present throughout the cortex, especially in cingulate, insular, and occipital cortices, as well as in the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, central amygdala, endopiriform nucleus, hippocampus (CA4 field), globus pallidus, lateral geniculate nucleus, infundibulum, habenula, PAG, substantia nigra, olivary nucleus, hypoglossal nucleus, and cerebellum. Furthermore, we show that, in the titi monkey brain, the OXTR antagonist ALS-II-69 is highly selective for OXTR and that the AVPR1a antagonist SR49059 is highly selective for AVPR1a. Based on these results and the fact that both ALS-II-69 and SR49059 are non-peptide, small-molecule antagonists that should be capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, these two compounds emerge as excellent candidates for the pharmacological manipulation of OXTR and AVPR1a in future behavioral experiments in titi monkeys and other primate species.
24504671,3,2014,J Radiat Res,Estimation of β-ray dose in air and soil from Fukushima Daiichi Power Plant accident.,Following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident of 2011, which deposited radionuclides across Tohoku and northern Kanto, β-ray dose evaluation has been performed to estimate radiation exposure for small creatures like insects as well as human skin. Using the Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNP-4C, we calculated the β-ray dose for (129m)Te, (129)Te, (131)I, (132)Te, (132)I, (134)Cs and (137)Cs in air as a function of altitude and in soil. These calculations of β-dose rate for each radionuclide were conducted for the conditions following the FDNPP accident, with (137)Cs deposition assumed to be 1000 kBq/m(2). Beta-ray dose rate was found to be ∼10-fold (resp. 5-fold) higher than the γ-ray dose rate in the soil (resp. on the ground surface) at ∼20 days after deposition, and ∼4-fold (resp. 1.7-fold) higher after 6 months or more. For convenience, the height dependence of the ratio for 0, 10, 30, 90, 180 and 365 days after deposition was obtained by a fitting function. The cumulative 70 µm β-ray dose at 30, 60 and 90 days after deposition was estimated to be 35, 45 and 53 mGy for the ground surface, and 61, 79 and 92 mGy in the soil, respectively. These results can be used to estimate the external β-ray exposure for small creatures as well as for human skin.

25320307,2,2014,J Virol,Merkel cell polyomavirus small T antigen mediates microtubule destabilization to promote cell motility and migration.,Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive skin cancer of neuroendocrine origin with a high propensity for recurrence and metastasis. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) causes the majority of MCC cases due to the expression of the MCPyV small and large tumor antigens (ST and LT, respectively). Although a number of molecular mechanisms have been attributed to MCPyV tumor antigen-mediated cellular transformation or replication, to date, no studies have investigated any potential link between MCPyV T antigen expression and the highly metastatic nature of MCC. Here we use a quantitative proteomic approach to show that MCPyV ST promotes differential expression of cellular proteins implicated in microtubule-associated cytoskeletal organization and dynamics. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that MCPyV ST expression promotes microtubule destabilization, leading to a motile and migratory phenotype. We further highlight the essential role of the microtubule-associated protein stathmin in MCPyV ST-mediated microtubule destabilization and cell motility and implicate the cellular phosphatase catalytic subunit protein phosphatase 4C (PP4C) in the regulation of this process. These findings suggest a possible molecular mechanism for the highly metastatic phenotype associated with MCC.</AbstractText>: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive skin cancer of neuroendocrine origin with a high propensity for recurrence and metastasis.

However, the molecular mechanisms leading to virally induced cancer development have yet to be fully elucidated. In particular, no studies have investigated any potential link between the virus and the highly metastatic nature of MCC. We demonstrate that the MCPyV small tumor antigen (ST) promotes the destabilization of the host cell microtubule network, which leads to a more motile and migratory cell phenotype. We further show that MCPyV ST induces this process by regulating the phosphorylation status of the cellular microtubule-associated protein stathmin by its known association with the cellular phosphatase catalytic subunit PP4C. These findings highlight stathmin as a possible biomarker of MCC and as a target for novel antitumoral therapies.
25272055,2,2014,J Med Chem,Converting potent indeno[1,2-b]indole inhibitors of protein kinase CK2 into selective inhibitors of the breast cancer resistance protein ABCG2.,A series of indeno[1,2-b]indole-9,10-dione derivatives were synthesized as human casein kinase II (CK2) inhibitors. The most potent inhibitors contained a N(5)-isopropyl substituent on the C-ring. The same series of compounds was found to also inhibit the breast cancer resistance protein ABCG2 but with totally different structure-activity relationships: a N(5)-phenethyl substituent was critical, and additional hydrophobic substituents at position 7 or 8 of the D-ring or a methoxy at phenethyl position ortho or meta also contributed to inhibition. The best ABCG2 inhibitors, such as 4c, 4h, 4i, 4j, and 4k, behaved as very weak inhibitors of CK2, whereas the most potent CK2 inhibitors, such as 4a, 4p, and 4e, displayed limited interaction with ABCG2. It was therefore possible to convert, through suitable substitutions of the indeno[1,2-b]indole-9,10-dione scaffold, potent CK2 inhibitors into selective ABCG2 inhibitors and vice versa. In addition, some of the best ABCG2 inhibitors, which displayed a very low cytotoxicity, thus giving a high therapeutic ratio, and appeared not to be transported, constitute promising candidates for further investigations.
25205476,2,2014,Herz,Subclinical left ventricular systolic dysfunction in diabetic patients and its association with retinopathy: A 2D speckle tracking echocardiography study.,AIM: It is important to diagnose diabetic cardiomyopathy in the early stages to prevent development of evident heart failure in the future. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with two-dimensional (2D) speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) and the secondary objective was to compare retinopathy-positive and -negative diabetic patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 82 patients with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and 90 gender-matched healthy controls were included. Retinopathy was present in 55 patients in the study group. All study participants underwent conventional 2D echocardiography and STE.RESULTS: All diabetic patients had preserved LV ejection fraction (LV-EF ≥ 50). Compared with the control group, diabetic patients had a larger left atrium (47.3 ± 19.9 mm vs. 36.9 ± 17.8 mm, p &lt; 0.001) and a higher E/Em ratio (12.0 ± 2.9 vs. 10.5 ± 3.7, p = 0.004). The LV-EF, LV end diastolic and end systolic volumes, E/A ratios, deceleration times, and tissue Doppler parameters were compared between groups. The study group was observed to have statistically significant lower four-chamber (4C; 17.7 ± 3.0 % vs. 19.3 ± 3.5 %, p = 0.002), three-chamber (3C; 17.5 ± 3.0 % vs. 19.2 ± 3.4 %, p = 0.001), and two-chamber (2C; 18.5 ± 3.5 % vs. 20.1 ± 2.4 %, p = 0.001) peak longitudinal strain values compared with the control group. Moreover, LV global strain values were found to be significantly lower in the DM group than in the control group (17.9 ± 2.7 % vs. 21.1 ± 3.2 %, p &lt; 0.001). By contrast, basal rotation (4.9 ± 3.3° vs.2.8 ± 4.5°, p = 0.001), apical rotation (15.3 ± 6.7° vs. 12.1 ± 5.3°, p = 0.001) and LV twist (20.2 ± 7.2° vs. 16.9 ± 6.5°, p = 0.002) in the DM group were significantly increased compared with those of controls.CONCLUSION: The STE procedure can be a useful novel technique in the determination of subclinical LV dysfunction in diabetic patients. Diabetic patients have lower longitudinal myocardial mechanics, and circumferential and rotational mechanics are impaired. There was no significant association between diabetic retinopathy and LV function.
25193078,2,2014,Exp Cell Res,JMJD2A attenuation affects cell cycle and tumourigenic inflammatory gene regulation in lipopolysaccharide stimulated neuroectodermal stem cells.,JMJD2A is a lysine trimethyl-specific histone demethylase that is highly expressed in a variety of tumours. The role of JMJD2A in tumour progression remains unclear. The objectives of this study were to identify JMJD2A-regulated genes and understand the function of JMJD2A in p53-null neuroectodermal stem cells (p53(-/-) NE-4Cs). We determined the effect of LPS as a model of inflammation in p53(-/-) NE-4Cs and investigated whether the epigenetic modifier JMJD2A alter the expression of tumourigenic inflammatory genes. Global gene expression was measured in JMJD2A knockdown (kd) p53(-/-) NE-4Cs and in LPS-stimulated JMJD2A-kd p53(-/-) NE-4C cells. JMJD2A attenuation significantly down-regulated genes were Cdca2, Ccnd2, Ccnd1, Crebbp, IL6rα, and Stat3 related with cell cycle, proliferation, and inflammatory-disease responses. Importantly, some tumour-suppressor genes including Dapk3, Timp2 and TFPI were significantly up-regulated but were not affected by silencing of the JMJD2B. Furthermore, we confirmed the attenuation of JMJD2A also down-regulated Cdca2, Ccnd2, Crebbp, and Rest in primary NSCs isolated from the forebrains of E15 embryos of C57/BL6J mice with effective p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α (PFT-α). Transcription factor (TF) motif analysis revealed known binding patterns for CDC5, MYC, and CREB, as well as three novel motifs in JMJD2A-regulated genes. IPA established molecular networks. The molecular network signatures and functional gene-expression profiling data from this study warrants further investigation as an effective therapeutic target, and studies to elucidate the molecular mechanism of JMJD2A-kd-dependent effects in neuroectodermal stem cells should be performed.
25027287,2,2014,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Temporal regulation of mRNAs for select bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), BMP receptors and their associated SMAD proteins during bovine early embryonic development: effects of exogenous BMP2 on embryo developmental progression.,BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated embryotrophic actions of maternal (oocyte-derived) follistatin during bovine early embryogenesis. Classical actions of follistatin are attributed to inhibition of activity of growth factors including activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP). However, temporal changes in BMP mRNA in early bovine embryos and the effects of exogenous BMP on embryo developmental progression are not understood. The objectives of present studies were to characterize mRNA abundance for select BMP, BMP receptors and BMP receptor associated SMADs during bovine oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis and determine effects of addition of exogenous BMP protein on early development.METHODS: Relative abundance of mRNA for BMP2, BMP3, BMP7, BMP10, SMAD1, SMAD5, ALK3, ALK6, ALK2, BMPR2, ACVR2A and ACVR2B was determined by RT-qPCR analysis of germinal vesicle (GV) and in vitro matured metaphase II (MII) oocytes and in vitro produced embryos collected at pronuclear, 2-cell (C), 4C, 8C, 16C, morula and blastocyst stages. Effects of addition of recombinant human BMP2 (0, 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml) during initial 72 h of embryo culture on early cleavage (within 30 h post insemination), total cleavage, development to 8C-16C and blastocyst stages and blastocyst mRNA abundance for markers of inner cell mass (NANOG) and trophectoderm (CDX2) were also determined.RESULTS: Abundance of mRNA for BMP2, BMP10, SMAD1, SMAD5, ALK3, ALK2, BMPR2 and ACVR2B was elevated in MII oocytes and/or pronuclear stage embryos (relative to GV) and remained elevated through the 8C -16C stages, whereas BMP3, BMP7 and ALK2 mRNAs were transiently elevated. Culture of embryos to the 8C stage in the presence of α-amanitin resulted in increased abundance for all of above transcripts examined relative to untreated 8C embryos. Effects of addition of exogenous BMP2 on early cleavage rates and rates of development to 8C-16C and blastocyst stages were not observed, but BMP2 treatment increased blastocyst mRNA for CDX2 and NANOG.CONCLUSIONS: Abundance of maternally derived mRNAs for above BMP system components are dynamically regulated during oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis. Exogenous BMP2 treatment does not influence progression to various developmental endpoints, but impacts characteristics of resulting blastocysts. Results support a potential role for BMPs in bovine early embryogenesis.
24758919,2,2014,Can Assoc Radiol J,The Lung Reporting and Data System (LU-RADS): a proposal for computed tomography screening.,Despite the positive outcome of the recent randomized trial of computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer, substantial implementation challenges remain, including the clear reporting of relative risk and suggested workup of screen-detected nodules. Based on current literature, we propose a 6-level Lung-Reporting and Data System (LU-RADS) that classifies screening CTs by the nodule with the highest malignancy risk. As the LU-RADS level increases, the risk of malignancy increases. The LU-RADS level is linked directly to suggested follow-up pathways. Compared with current narrative reporting, this structure should improve communication with patients and clinicians, and provide a data collection framework to facilitate screening program evaluation and radiologist training. In overview, category 1 includes CTs with no nodules and returns the subject to routine screening. Category 2 scans harbor minimal risk, including &lt;5 mm, perifissural, or long-term stable nodules that require no further workup before the next routine screening CT. Category 3 scans contain indeterminate nodules and require CT follow up with the interval dependent on nodule size (small [5-9 mm] or large [≥ 10 mm] and possibly transient). Category 4 scans are suspicious and are subdivided into 4A, low risk of malignancy; 4B, likely low-grade adenocarcinoma; and 4C, likely malignant. The 4B and 4C nodules have a high likelihood of neoplasm simply based on screening CT features, even if positron emission tomography, needle biopsy, and/or bronchoscopy are negative. Category 5 nodules demonstrate frankly malignant behavior on screening CT, and category 6 scans contain tissue-proven malignancies.
24695349,2,2014,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo),Aliphatic substitution of o-carboranyl phenols enhances estrogen receptor beta selectivity.,The two subtypes of estrogen receptor (ER), ERα and ERβ, differ greatly in expression pattern and biological functions, and ERβ-selective ligands candidates to treat immune-related disorders. ERβ-selective ligands have mostly been designed based the idea of introducing a substituent that interferes sterically with the ligand's interaction with Met421 to selectively decrease the affinity for ERα (the equivalent residue in ERβ is Ile373). Therefore, we designed and synthesized a series of carboranyl phenol derivatives bearing an aliphatic substituent as candidate ERβ-selective ligands. Introduction of a longer aliphatic substituent into the carboranyl moiety enhanced the ERβ selectivity of o-carboranyl phenol derivatives 4, but not m-carboranyl bisphenol derivatives 5. Compound 4c showed 7.4-fold ERβ selectivity in ER-binding assay and exhibited moderate estrogenic activity in cell proliferation assay using MCF-7 cell line.
24642002,2,2014,BMC Complement Altern Med,Extreme sensitivity of gene expression in human SH-SY5Y neurocytes to ultra-low doses of Gelsemium sempervirens.,BACKGROUND: Gelsemium sempervirens L. (Gelsemium s.) is a traditional medicinal plant, employed as an anxiolytic at ultra-low doses and animal models recently confirmed this activity. However the mechanisms by which it might operate on the nervous system are largely unknown. This work investigates the gene expression of a human neurocyte cell line treated with increasing dilutions of Gelsemium s. extract.METHODS: Starting from the crude extract, six 100 × (centesimal, c) dilutions of Gelsemium s. (2c, 3c, 4c, 5c, 9c and 30c) were prepared according to the French homeopathic pharmacopoeia. Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were exposed for 24 h to test dilutions, and their transcriptome compared by microarray to that of cells treated with control vehicle solutions.RESULTS: Exposure to the Gelsemium s. 2c dilution (the highest dose employed, corresponding to a gelsemine concentration of 6.5 × 10(-9) M) significantly changed the expression of 56 genes, of which 49 were down-regulated and 7 were overexpressed. Several of the down-regulated genes belonged to G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, calcium homeostasis, inflammatory response and neuropeptide receptors. Fisher exact test, applied to the group of 49 genes down-regulated by Gelsemium s. 2c, showed that the direction of effects was significantly maintained across the treatment with high homeopathic dilutions, even though the size of the differences was distributed in a small range.CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that Gelsemium s., a medicinal plant used in traditional remedies and homeopathy, modulates a series of genes involved in neuronal function. A small, but statistically significant, response was detected even to very low doses/high dilutions (up to 30c), indicating that the human neurocyte genome is extremely sensitive to this regulation.
24607854,2,2014,Mutat Res,Nucleotide excision repair gene polymorphisms, meat intake and colon cancer risk.,PURPOSE: Much of the DNA damage from colon cancer-related carcinogens, including heterocyclic amines (HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from red meat cooked at high temperature, are repaired by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Thus, we examined whether NER non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) modified the association between red meat intake and colon cancer risk.METHODS: The study consists of 244 African-American and 311 white colon cancer cases and population-based controls (331 African Americans and 544 whites) recruited from 33 counties in North Carolina from 1996 to 2000. Information collected by food frequency questionnaire on meat intake and preparation methods were used to estimate HCA and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP, a PAH) intake. We tested 7 nsSNPs in 5 NER genes: XPC A499V and K939Q, XPD D312N and K751Q, XPF R415Q, XPG D1104H, and RAD23B A249V. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression.RESULTS: Among African Americans, we observed a statistically significant positive association between colon cancer risk and XPC 499 AV+VV genotype (OR=1.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.7, AA as referent), and an inverse association with XPC 939 QQ (OR=0.3, 95%CI: 0.2, 0.8, KK as referent). These associations were not observed among whites. For both races combined, there was interaction between the XPC 939 genotype, well-done red meat intake and colon cancer risk (OR=1.5, 95% CI=1.0, 2.2 for high well-done red meat and KK genotype as compared to low well-done red meat and KK genotype, pinteraction=0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that NER nsSNPs are associated with colon cancer risk and may modify the association between well-done red meat intake and colon cancer risk.
24591618,2,2014,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Identification of ocular dominance domains in New World owl monkeys by immediate-early gene expression.,Ocular dominance columns (ODCs) have been well studied in the striate cortex (V1) of macaques, as well defined arrays of columnar structure that receive inputs from one eye or the other, whereas ODC expression seems more obscure in some New World primate species. ODCs have been identified by means of eye injections of transneuronal transporters and examination of cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity patterns after monocular enucleation. More recently, live-imaging techniques have been used to reveal ODCs. Here, we used the expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs), protooncogene, c-Fos, and zinc finger protein, Zif268, after monocular inactivation (MI) to identify ODCs in V1 of New World owl monkeys. Because IEG expression is more sensitive to activity changes than CO expression, it is capable of revealing activity maps in all layers throughout V1 and demonstrating brief activity changes within a couple of hours. Using IEGs, we not only revealed apparent ODCs in owl monkeys but also discovered a number of unique features of their ODCs. Distinct from those in macaques, these ODCs sometimes bridged to other columns in layer 4 (Brodmann layer 4C). CO blobs straddled ODC borders in the central visual field, whereas they centered ODC patches in the peripheral visual field. In one case, the ODC pattern continued into V2. Finally, an elevation of IEG expression in layer 4 (4C) was observed along ODC borders after only brief MI. Our data provide insights into the structure and variability of ODCs in primates and revive debate over the functions and development of ODCs.
24561615,2,2014,Nucleic Acids Res,fourSig: a method for determining chromosomal interactions in 4C-Seq data.,The ability to correlate chromosome conformation and gene expression gives a great deal of information regarding the strategies used by a cell to properly regulate gene activity. 4C-Seq is a relatively new and increasingly popular technology where the set of genomic interactions generated by a single point in the genome can be determined. 4C-Seq experiments generate large, complicated data sets and it is imperative that signal is properly distinguished from noise. Currently, there are a limited number of methods for analyzing 4C-Seq data. Here, we present a new method, fourSig, which in addition to being precise and simple to use also includes a new feature that prioritizes detected interactions. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of fourSig with previously published and novel 4C-Seq data sets and show that our significance prioritization correlates with the ability to reproducibly detect interactions among replicates.
24462499,2,2014,Exp Gerontol,Contribution of genetic polymorphisms on functional status at very old age: a gene-based analysis of 38 genes (311 SNPs) in the oxidative stress pathway.,Preservation of functional ability is a well-recognized marker of longevity. At a molecular level, a major determinant of the physiological decline occurring with aging is the imbalance between production and accumulation of oxidative damage to macromolecules, together with a decreased efficiency of stress response to avoid or repair such damage. In this paper we investigated the association of 38 genes (311 SNPs) belonging to the pro-antioxidant pathways with physical and cognitive performances, by analyzing single SNP and gene-based associations with Hand Grip strength (HG), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Walking Speed (WS), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Composite Cognitive Score (CCS) in a Cohort of 1089 Danish nonagenarians. Moreover, for each gene analyzed in the pro-antioxidant pathway, we tested the influence on longitudinal survival. In the whole sample, nominal associations were found for TXNRD1 variability with ADL and WS, NDUFS1 and UCP3 with HG and WS, GCLC and UCP2 with WS (p&lt;0.05). Stronger associations although not holding the multiple comparison correction, were observed between MMSE and NDUFV1, MT1A and GSTP1 variability (p&lt;0.009). Moreover, we found that association between genetic variability in the pro-antioxidant pathway and functional status at old age is influenced by sex. In particular, most significant associations were observed in nonagenarian females, between HG scores and GLRX and UCP3 variability, between ADL levels and TXNRD1, MMSE and MT1A genetic variability. In males, a borderline statistically significant association with ADL level was found for UQCRFS1 gene. Nominally significant associations in relation to survival were found in the female sample only with SOD2, NDUFS1, UCP3 and TXNRD1 variability, the latter two confirming previous observations reported in the same cohort. Overall, our work supports the evidence that genes belonging to the pro-anti-oxidant pathway are able to modulate physical and cognitive performance after the ninth decade of life, finally influencing extreme survival.
25471566,1,2014,J Neurosci,Probing α4βδ GABAA receptor heterogeneity: differential regional effects of a functionally selective α4β1δ/α4β3δ receptor agonist on tonic and phasic inhibition in rat brain.,In the present study, the orthosteric GABAA receptor (GABAAR) ligand 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (Thio-THIP) was found to possess a highly interesting functional profile at recombinant human GABAARs and native rat GABAARs. Whereas Thio-THIP displayed weak antagonist activity at α1,2,5β2,3γ2S and ρ1 GABAARs and partial agonism at α6β2,3δ GABAARs expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the pronounced agonism exhibited by the compound at α4β1δ and α4β3δ GABAARs was contrasted by its negligible activity at the α4β2δ subtype. To elucidate to which extent this in vitro profile translated into functionality at native GABAARs, we assessed the effects of 100 μm Thio-THIP at synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors in principal cells of four different brain regions by slice electrophysiology. In concordance with its α6β2,3δ agonism, Thio-THIP evoked robust currents through extrasynaptic GABAARs in cerebellar granule cells. In contrast, the compound did not elicit significant currents in dentate gyrus granule cells or in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), indicating predominant expression of extrasynaptic α4β2δ receptors in these cells. Interestingly, Thio-THIP evoked differential degrees of currents in ventrobasal thalamus neurons, a diversity that could arise from differential expression of extrasynaptic α4βδ subtypes in the cells. Finally, whereas 100 μm Thio-THIP did not affect the synaptic currents in ventrobasal thalamus neurons or striatal MSNs, it reduced the current amplitudes recorded from dentate gyrus granule cells, most likely by targeting perisynaptic α4βδ receptors expressed at distal dendrites of these cells. Being the first published ligand capable of discriminating between β2- and β3-containing receptor subtypes, Thio-THIP could be a valuable tool in explorations of native α4βδ GABAARs.

25381333,1,2014,Hum Mol Genet,Functional characterization of CYP2D6 enhancer polymorphisms.,CYP2D6 metabolizes nearly 25% of clinically used drugs. Genetic polymorphisms cause large inter-individual variability in CYP2D6 enzyme activity and are currently used as biomarker to predict CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype. Previously, we had identified a region 115 kb downstream of CYP2D6 as enhancer for CYP2D6, containing two completely linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs133333 and rs5758550, associated with enhanced transcription. However, the enhancer effect on CYP2D6 expression, and the causative variant, remained to be ascertained. To characterize the CYP2D6 enhancer element, we applied chromatin conformation capture combined with the next-generation sequencing (4C assays) and chromatin immunoprecipitation with P300 antibody, in HepG2 and human primary culture hepatocytes. The results confirmed the role of the previously identified enhancer region in CYP2D6 expression, expanding the number of candidate variants to three highly linked SNPs (rs133333, rs5758550 and rs4822082). Among these, only rs5758550 demonstrated regulating enhancer activity in a reporter gene assay. Use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats mediated genome editing in HepG2 cells targeting suspected enhancer regions decreased CYP2D6 mRNA expression by 70%, only upon deletion of the rs5758550 region. These results demonstrate robust effects of both the enhancer element and SNP rs5758550 on CYP2D6 expression, supporting consideration of rs5758550 for CYP2D6 genotyping panels to yield more accurate phenotype prediction.
25172976,1,2014,Bosn J Basic Med Sci,Left ventricular mechanics in Behcet's disease: a speckle tracking echocardiographic study.,Although cardiac involvement is rarely seen in Behcet's disease (BD), it is essential to detect subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction for prognostic purposes. Herein we aimed to show the role of two dimensional (2D) speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) in determination of subclinical LV dysfunction in patients with BD. 30 patients diagnosed as BD due to International Study Group Behcet's diagnostic criteria and 25 control subjects underwent Doppler echocardiography including pulsed tissue Doppler of the mitral annulus and speckle-tracking echocardiography. LV peak longitudinal strain and strain rate (SR) was calculated in four-chamber (4C), apical long-axis (LAX), and two-chamber (2C) views, and values of the three views were averaged LV global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) and SR. LV torsion was determined as the net difference in the mean rotation between the apical and basal levels. There was not any significant difference in age and gender between groups. Patients with BD had significantly lower LV longitudinal strain and Sr measurements than the control group. Although LV basal rotation (LVR) basal values were similar in both groups, LVR-apical and LV torsion (LVTR) values were significantly higher in patient group. LVR-apical and LV-GLS were found to have a good positive corelation (r:0.44, p&lt;0.001) (r: -0.56, r: -0.65,respectively. p&lt;0.001). There was a weak positive correlation between LVTR and LV-GLS (r: 0.29, p&lt;0.05). We demonstrated that combined assessment of LV-GLS, LV-GLSR, LVTR and LVR-apical values detected by STE can be useful in determination of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction in BD.
25135855,1,2014,Biochim Biophys Acta,Significance of redox-active cysteines in human FAD synthase isoform 2.,FAD synthase (FMN:ATP adenylyl transferase, FMNAT or FADS, EC 2.7.7.2) is the last enzyme in the pathway converting riboflavin into FAD. In humans, FADS is localized in different subcellular compartments and exists in different isoforms. Isoform 2 (490-amino acids) is organized in two domains: the 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase domain, that is the FAD-forming catalytic domain, and one resembling a molybdopterin-binding (MPTb) domain, with a hypothetical regulatory role. hFADS2 contains ten Cys residues, seven of which located in the PAPS reductase domain, with a possible involvement either in FAD synthesis or in FAD delivery to cognate apo-flavoproteins. A homology model of the PAPS reductase domain of hFADS2 revealed a co-ordinated network among the Cys residues in this domain. In this model, C312 and C303 are very close to the flavin substrate, consistent with a significantly lowered FAD synthesis rate in C303A and C312A mutants. FAD synthesis is also inhibited by thiol-blocking reagents, suggesting the involvement of free cysteines in the hFADS2 catalytic cycle. Mass spectrometry measurements and titration with thiol reagents on wt hFADS2 and on several individual cysteine/alanine mutants allowed us to detect two stably reduced cysteines (C139 and C241, one for each protein domain), two stable disulfide bridges (C399-C402, C303-C312, both in the PAPS domain), and two unstable disulfides (C39-C50; C440-C464). Whereas the C39-C50 unstable disulfide is located in the MPTb domain and appears to have no catalytic relevance, a cysteine-based redox switch may involve formation and breakdown of a disulfide between C440 and C464 in the PAPS domain.
25051213,1,2014,Gen Comp Endocrinol,Gene expression, function, and diversity of Nkx2-4 in the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss.,Nkx2 homeodomain transcription factors are involved in various developmental processes and cell specification: e.g. in mammals, NKX2-1 is essential for thyroid-specific gene expression and thyroid morphogenesis. Among Nkx2 proteins, information is still very limited for Nkx2-4. In the present study, we have identified three distinct cDNAs encoding Nkx2-4 isoforms (Nkx2-4a, -b, and -c) from the rainbow trout thyroid tissue, and characterized their transcriptional properties. The trout Nkx2-4 proteins were all predicted to conserve three characteristic domains: the tinman-like amino terminal decapeptide, the NK2 homeodomain, and the NK2-specific domain, and also share 75-89% amino acid similarity. It was shown by dual luciferase assay that Nkx2-4a and Nkx2-4b, but not Nkx2-4c, significantly activated transcription from a cotransfected rat thyroglobulin (TG) promoter. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that all the Nkx2-4 isoforms could bind to the TG promoter, implying that the faint transcriptional activity of Nkx2-4c might result from some critical amino acid substitution(s) outside the homeodomain. RT-PCR analysis revealed similar tissue distribution patterns for Nkx2-4a and Nkx2-4b mRNAs. Both mRNAs were expressed abundantly in the thyroid, and weakly in the testis. On the other hand, Nkx2-4c mRNA was detected in the ovary as well as in the thyroid. The expression sites of Nkx2-4c mRNA were localized, by in situ hybridization histochemistry, to the ovarian granulosa cells and to the thyroid follicular cells. The results suggest that in the rainbow trout, Nkx2-4a and Nkx2-4b might play a major role in TG gene transcription whereas Nkx2-4c might have some functions in the ovary as well as the thyroid.
24956555,1,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis of new class of spirocarbocycle derivatives by multicomponent domino reaction and their evaluation for antimicrobial, anticancer activity and molecular docking studies.,A series of 25 new spirocarbocycles were synthesized by a three component reaction that involves few cyclic nucleophiles, vinyl malononitriles and aldehydes with variable substitution patterns. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity and the compounds showed significant activity. Synthesized compounds 4c, 4i and 6i showed good anticancer activity against A549 cancer cell line. Molecular docking studies indicated that compound 4i had the greatest affinity for DNA gyrase receptor than others and compound 6i had the greatest affinity for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor. These compounds can be better therapeutic agents for microbial and cancer cell lines.
24951056,1,2014,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Analysis of embryo morphokinetics, multinucleation and cleavage anomalies using continuous time-lapse monitoring in blastocyst transfer cycles.,BACKGROUND: Time-lapse imaging combined with embryo morphokinetics may offer a non-invasive means for improving embryo selection. Data from clinics worldwide are necessary to compare and ultimately develop embryo classifications models using kinetic data. The primary objective of this study was to determine if there were kinetic differences between embryos with limited potential and those more often associated with in vitro blastocyst formation and/or implantation. We also wanted to compare putative kinetic markers for embryo selection as proposed by other laboratories to what we were observing in our own laboratory setting.METHODS: Kinetic data and cycle outcomes were retrospectively analyzed in patients age 39 and younger with 7 or more zygotes cultured in the Embryoscope. Timing of specific events from the point of insemination were determined using time-lapse (TL) imaging. The following kinetic markers were assessed: time to syngamy (tPNf), t2, time to two cells (c), 3c (t3), 4c ( t4), 5c (t5), 8c (t8), morula (tMor), start of blastulation (tSB); tBL, blastocyst (tBL); expanded blastocyst (tEBL). Durations of the second (cc2) and third (cc3) cell cycles, the t5-t2 interval as well as time to complete synchronous divisions s1, s2 and s3 were calculated. Incidence and impact on development of nuclear and cleavage anomalies were also assessed.RESULTS: A total of 648 embryos transferred on day 5 were analyzed. The clinical pregnancy and implantation rate were 72% and 50%, respectively. Morphokinetic data showed that tPNf, t2,t4, t8, s1, s2,s3 and cc2 were significantly different in embryos forming blastocysts (ET or frozen) versus those with limited potential either failing to blastulate or else forming poor quality blastocysts ,ultimately discarded. Comparison of embryo kinetics in cycles with all embryos implanting (KID+) versus no implantation (KID-) suggested that markers of embryo competence to implant may be different from ability to form a blastocyst. The incidence of multinucleation and reverse cleavage amongst the embryos observed was 25% and 7%, respectively. Over 40% of embryos exhibiting these characteristics did however form blastocysts meeting our criteria for freezing.CONCLUSIONS: These data provide us with a platform with which to potentially enhance embryo selection for transfer.
24891466,1,2014,Am J Trop Med Hyg,Preliminary investigation of the contribution of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and UGT1A9 polymorphisms on artesunate-mefloquine treatment response in Burmese patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and UGT1A9 genetic polymorphisms and treatment response after a three-day course of artesunate-mefloquine was investigated in 71 Burmese patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Results provide evidence for the possible link between CYP2A6 and CYP2B6 polymorphisms and plasma concentrations of artesunate/dihydroartemisinin and treatment response. In one patient who had the CYP2A6*1A/*4C genotype (decreased enzyme activity), plasma concentration of artesunate at one hour appeared to be higher, and the concentration of dihydroartemisinin was lower than for those carrying other genotypes (415 versus 320 ng/mL). The proportion of patients with adequate clinical and parasitologic response who had the CYP2B6*9/*9 genotype (mutant genotype) was significantly lower compared with those with late parasitologic failure (14.0% versus 19.0%). Confirmation through a larger study in various malaria-endemic areas is required before a definite conclusion on the role of genetic polymorphisms of these drug-metabolizing enzymes on treatment response after artesunate-based combination therapy can be made.
24860160,1,2014,Bioinformatics,Identification of chromosomal translocation hotspots via scan statistics.,MOTIVATION: The detection of genomic regions unusually rich in a given pattern is an important undertaking in the analysis of next-generation sequencing data. Recent studies of chromosomal translocations in activated B lymphocytes have identified regions that are frequently translocated to c-myc oncogene. A quantitative method for the identification of translocation hotspots was crucial to this study. Here we improve this analysis by using a simple probabilistic model and the framework provided by scan statistics to define the number and location of translocation breakpoint hotspots. A key feature of our method is that it provides a global chromosome-wide nominal control level to clustering, as opposed to previous methods based on local criteria. While being motivated by a specific application, the detection of unusual clusters is a widespread problem in bioinformatics. We expect our method to be useful in the analysis of data from other experimental approaches such as of ChIP-seq and 4C-seq.RESULTS: The analysis of translocations from B lymphocytes with the method described here reveals the presence of longer hotspots when compared with those defined previously. Further, we show that the hotspot size changes substantially in the absence of DNA repair protein 53BP1. When 53BP1 deficiency is combined with overexpression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, the hotspot length increases even further. These changes are not detected by previous methods that use local significance criteria for clustering. Our method is also able to identify several exclusive translocation hotspots located in genes of known tumor supressors.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The detection of translocation hotspots is done with hot_scan, a program implemented in R and Perl. Source code and documentation are freely available for download at https://github.com/itojal/hot_scan.
24852154,1,2014,Pediatr Clin North Am,A review of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension.,It is now well recognized that idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can occur in children. Relative to the adult population, the demographic features and clinical presentation of IIH as well as the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for children are quite different. Although these differences are well established, specific diagnostic and treatment guidelines for pediatric patients have largely been based on the adult literature. Exciting new evidence is now available to assist the clinician in managing pediatric patients with IIH.
24837407,1,2014,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Vildagliptin , a DPP-4 inhibitor for the twice-daily treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without metformin.,INTRODUCTION: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors increase circulating levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide regulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion. In addition, GLP-1 suppresses glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying and increases satiety. The combination of vildagliptin with the biguanide metformin is of particular interest because of its complementary mode of action, addressing insulin resistance, alpha- and beta cell function in the islet of the pancreas.AREAS COVERED: Because of the abundance of data supporting the use of vildagliptin alone and in combination with metformin, the present paper aims at giving an overview on the current evidence for its use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.EXPERT OPINION: The data suggest that vildagliptin offers similar glycemic control compared to sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones, while having the benefit of being associated with fewer cases of hypoglycemia and less body weight gain. There is increasing evidence that compared with sulfonylureas, vildagliptin has favorable effects on pancreatic alpha- and beta-cell function. Vildagliptin in combination with metformin, improve glycemic control with a favorable safety and tolerability profile, making it an attractive therapeutic option in patients where metformin monotherapy alone is not sufficient.
24833716,1,2014,Hum Mol Genet,Haplotype-specific modulation of a SOX10/CREB response element at the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C locus SH3TC2.,Loss-of-function mutations in the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (SH3TC2) gene cause autosomal recessive demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. The SH3TC2 protein has been implicated in promyelination signaling through axonal neuregulin-1 and the ERBB2 Schwann cell receptor. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the SH3TC2 gene. We performed computational and functional analyses that revealed two cis-acting regulatory elements at SH3TC2-one at the promoter and one ∼150 kb downstream of the transcription start site. Both elements direct reporter gene expression in Schwann cells and are responsive to the transcription factor SOX10, which is essential for peripheral nervous system myelination. The downstream enhancer harbors a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that causes an ∼80% reduction in enhancer activity. The SNP resides directly within a predicted binding site for the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and we demonstrate that this regulatory element binds to CREB and is activated by CREB expression. Finally, forskolin induces Sh3tc2 expression in rat primary Schwann cells, indicating that SH3TC2 is a CREB target gene. These findings prompted us to determine if SNP genotypes at SH3TC2 are associated with differential phenotypes in the most common demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, CMT1A. Interestingly, this revealed several associations between SNP alleles and disease severity. In summary, our data indicate that SH3TC2 is regulated by the transcription factors CREB and SOX10, define a regulatory SNP at this disease-associated locus and reveal SH3TC2 as a candidate modifier locus of CMT disease phenotypes.
24727243,1,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Novel metronidazole-chalcone conjugates with potential to counter drug resistance in Trichomonas vaginalis.,Trichomoniasis is the most prevalent, curable sexually transmitted disease (STD), which increases risk of viral STDs and HIV. However, drug resistance has been developed by some strains of Trichomonas vaginalis against Metronidazole (MTZ), the FDA approved drug against trichomoniasis. In the present study twenty two chalcone hybrids of metronidazole have been synthesized in a quest to get new molecules with higher potential against metronidazole-resistant T. vaginalis. All new hybrid molecules were found active against T. vaginalis with varying levels of activity against MTZ-susceptible and resistant strains. Eight compounds (4a, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4f, 4h, 4q and 4s) were found as active as the standard drug with an MIC of 1.56 μg/ml against MTZ-susceptible strain. However, compounds 4e, 4h and 4m were 4-times more active than MTZ against drug-resistant T. vaginalis, amongst which 4e and 4h were most promising against both susceptible and resistant strains.
24714090,1,2014,Int J Mol Sci,Pharmacological evaluation and preparation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs containing an N-acyl hydrazone subunit.,A series of anti-inflammatory derivatives containing an N-acyl hydrazone subunit (4a-e) were synthesized and characterized. Docking studies were performed that suggest that compounds 4a-e bind to cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 isoforms, but with higher affinity for COX-2. The compounds display similar anti-inflammatory activities in vivo, although compound 4c is the most effective compound for inhibiting rat paw edema, with a reduction in the extent of inflammation of 35.9% and 52.8% at 2 and 4 h, respectively. The anti-inflammatory activity of N-acyl hydrazone derivatives was inferior to their respective parent drugs, except for compound 4c after 5 h. Ulcerogenic studies revealed that compounds 4a-e are less gastrotoxic than the respective parent drug. Compounds 4b-e demonstrated mucosal damage comparable to celecoxib. The in vivo analgesic activities of the compounds are higher than the respective parent drug for compounds 4a-b and 4d-e. Compound 4a was more active than dipyrone in reducing acetic-acid-induced abdominal constrictions. Our results indicate that compounds 4a-e are anti-inflammatory and analgesic compounds with reduced gastrotoxicity compared to their respective parent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
24711827,1,2014,Iran J Pharm Res,Synthesis of N-arylmethyl Substituted Indole Derivatives as New Antiplatelet Aggregation Agents.,A number of N-arylmethyl substituted indole derivatives have been synthesized and their effectiveness against ADP and arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation in human plasma was determined. The desired compounds were synthesized by reacting the appropriate aniline derivative with isatin (or substituted isatin) to form the corresponding imine structures. The so formed compound was then activated using sodium hydride and reacted with the proper substituted benzyl halides. Among the tested compounds, derivatives 4a, 4c, 4d, 4f-i and 4k were the most potent compounds with satisfactory IC50 values (under 38.5 μM) for inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid. All indole derivatives without substitution on position 1 of the indole ring, exhibited either weaker activities or were not active at all.
24631365,1,2014,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of new pyrazolone-pyridazine conjugates as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents.,A new series of pyrazolone-pyridazine conjugates 3 and 4a-l were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic means and elemental analyses. All compounds were tested in vivo for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties against diclofenac, as reference compound. The synthesized compounds were also evaluated for their ability to inhibit the production of certain inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 in serum samples. The ulcerogenic potential of the synthesized compounds was also determined. IC50 values for inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes were investigated in vitro for the most active candidates. Molecular docking was performed on the active site of COX-2 to predict their mode of binding to the amino acids. Among the synthesized derivatives, compounds 4c and 4e showed good analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities with lower ulcer index than the reference drug.
24601758,1,2014,OMICS,How does mother-to-child transmission of HIV differ among African populations? Lessons from MBL2 genetic variation in Zimbabweans.,Mannose binding lectin (MBL) is a pathogen pattern recognition protein involved in antimicrobial activities. Variation in MBL2 gene has been extensively implicated in differential outcomes of infectious diseases in studies conducted outside Africa, but virtually very little is known on the role of this candidate gene in the African continent. We investigated human genetic variations in MBL2 in a Zimbabwean pediatric population and their putative associations with HIV infection in perinatally exposed children. One hundred and four children aged 7 to 9 years comprising 68 perinatally exposed to HIV (32 who were born infected and 36 who were uninfected) and 36 unexposed controls were recruited. DNA samples were genotyped for MBL2 polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP and sequencing. HIV infected children had markedly variable and significantly lower mean height (p=0.03) and weight (p=0.005) when compared to the uninfected children. Using all samples, frequencies for MBL2 genetic variants for the Zimbabwean population were calculated. Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms were observed and minor alleles occurred with the following frequencies: -550C&gt;G (G: 0.02), -435G&gt;A (A: 0.08), -428A&gt;C (C: 0.39), -394A&gt;G (A: 0.39), -328AGAGAA ins/del (AGAGAA ins: 0.44), -245G&gt;A (A: 0.05), -221C&gt;G (C: 0.12), -111A&gt;T (T: 0.10), -70C&gt;T (C: 0.46), +4C&gt;T (C: 0.45), novel -595G&gt;A (A: 0.02), and 170G&gt;A (0.24). We found that the MBL2 +4T variant displayed a trend for association with reduced risk of HIV transmission from mother-to-child but the remaining vast majority of the genetic markers did not show a significant association. We conclude (1) the MBL2 gene is highly polymorphic in the Zimbabwean population, and (2) MBL2 genetic variation does not appear to play a major role in influencing the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission in our study sample. These observations contest the hitherto significant role of this candidate gene for HIV transmission from mother-to-child in non-African populations and thus, further speak to the limits of extrapolating genomic association studies directly to the African populations from studies conducted elsewhere. It is hoped that more OMICS research in a diverse set of African countries can shed further light on the putative role (or the lack thereof ) of this candidate gene in HIV transmission in the continent, a major global health burden in Africa.
24492257,1,2014,Plant Cell Physiol,Aphidicolin-induced nuclear elongation in tobacco BY-2 cells.,Plant nuclei are known to differentiate into various shapes within a single plant. However, little is known about the mechanisms of nuclear morphogenesis. We found that nuclei of tobacco BY-2 cells were highly elongated on long-term treatment with 5 mg l⁻¹ aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA polymerase α. In aphidicolin-treated cells, the nuclear length was correlated with the cell length. During culture in the presence of aphidicolin, the nuclei were elongated in parallel with cell elongation. Nuclear elongation was inhibited by the inhibition of cell elongation with 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile, a cellulose synthesis inhibitor. However, cell elongation induced in the auxin-depleted medium in the absence of aphidicolin did not cause nuclear elongation, indicating that cell elongation alone is not sufficient for nuclear elongation. Treatment with either latrunculin B or propyzamide inhibited the aphidicolin-induced nuclear elongation, indicating that both actin filaments and microtubules (MTs) are required for nuclear elongation. Observations using BY-YTHCLR2 cells, in which actin filaments, MTs and nuclei were simultaneously visualized, revealed that the longitudinally arranged MT bundles associated with the nucleus play an important role in nuclear elongation, and that actin filaments affect the formation of these MT bundles. In aphidicolin-treated cells, the nuclear DNA contents of the elongated nuclei exceeded 4C, and the nuclear length was highly correlated with the nuclear DNA content. In cells treated with 50 mg l⁻¹ aphidicolin, cells were elongated and nucleus-associated longitudinal MT bundles were formed, but the nuclear DNA contents did not exceed 4C and the nuclei did not elongate. These results indicate that an increase in the nuclear DNA content above 4C is also required for nuclear elongation.
24483989,1,2014,Liver Int,Histological subclassification of cirrhosis can predict recurrence after curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma.,BACKGROUND: Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection continues to be a major cause of death. This prospective study is designed to investigate whether histological subclassification of cirrhosis using the Laennec system could predict recurrence in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC after curative resection.METHODS: Patients with HBV-related HCC who underwent curative resection and showed Laennec stage 3 to 4 were enrolled and the cases with stage 4 were subclassified histologically into three groups (stages 4A, 4B and 4C) according to the Laennec system. Between February 2006 and August 2009, 92 patients were recruited.RESULTS: Stage 3, 4A, 4B and 4C were identified in 24 (26.1%), 15 (16.3%), 43 (46.7%) and 10 (10.9%) patients respectively. The cumulative incidence rates of recurrence at 1, 2 and 3 years were 24.2%, 40.5% and 55.1% respectively. On multivariate analysis, serum albumin [hazard ratio (HR), 0.528; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.312-0.891; P=0.017] and Edmondson-Steiner grade III-IV (HR, 3.456; 95% CI, 1.123-10.517; P=0.031) were significantly correlated with early recurrence (&lt;1 year), whereas stage 4C (HR, 5.426; 95% CI, 1.030-28.598; P=0.046) was the only independent risk factor for late recurrence (≥1 year).CONCLUSIONS: Histological subclassification of cirrhosis using the Laennec system is a significant predictor of late recurrence in patients with HBV-related HCC after curative resection.
24448439,1,2014,Nucleus,Implications of COMT long-range interactions on the phenotypic variability of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.,22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) results from a hemizygous microdeletion on chromosome 22 and is characterized by extensive phenotypic variability. Penetrance of signs, including congenital heart, craniofacial, and neurobehavioral abnormalities, varies widely and is not well correlated with genotype. The three-dimensional structure of the genome may help explain some of this variability. The physical interaction profile of a given gene locus with other genetic elements, such as enhancers and co-regulated genes, contributes to its regulation. Thus, it is possible that regulatory interactions with elements outside the deletion region are disrupted in the disease state and modulate the resulting spectrum of symptoms. COMT, a gene within the commonly deleted ~3 Mb region has been implicated as a contributor to the neurological features frequently found in 22q11DS patients. We used this locus as bait in a 4C-seq experiment to investigate genome-wide interaction profiles in B lymphocyte and fibroblast cell lines derived from both 22q11DS and unaffected individuals. All normal B lymphocyte lines displayed local, conserved chromatin looping interactions with regions that are lost in atypical and distal deletions, which may mediate similarities between typical, atypical, and distal 22q11 deletion phenotypes. There are also distinct clusterings of cis interactions based on disease state. We identified regions of differential trans interactions present in normal, and lost in deletion-carrying, B lymphocyte cell lines. This data suggests that hemizygous chromosomal deletions such as 22q11DS can have widespread effects on chromatin organization, and may contribute to the inherent phenotypic variability.
24412305,1,2014,Chem Biol Interact,Remedial effects of novel 2,3-disubstituted thiazolidin-4-ones in chemical mediated inflammation.,Three thiazolidin-4-one derivatives were synthesized, purified and characterized by chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. In the in vitro assays, these compounds inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrite and cytokine generation in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages and whole blood. These derivatives attenuated carrageenan-induced acute inflammation in rats. The most effective compound 4C possessed identical anti-inflammatory action at two doses (50 and 100 mg/kg). Further, the effect of compound 4C on locally induced inflammatory mediators was investigated in carrageenan-induced air pouch inflammation in rats. In this model, compound 4C inhibited the cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 (systemic and local). Additionally, compound 4C was able to reduce locally elevated prostaglandin-E₂ (PGE₂). Inhibition of leukocyte infiltration by compound 4C was correlated with reduced locally released myeloperoxidase (MPO). To conclude, compound 4C corrected the inflammatory condition by negative effect on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6) network and prostaglandin-E₂ generation.
25537272,0,2014,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Structure-based design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel β-secretase inhibitors containing a pyrazole or thiazole moiety as the P3 ligand.,We describe structure-based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of novel inhibitors bearing a pyrazole (compounds 3a-h) or a thiazole moiety (compounds 4a-e) as the P3 ligand. We have also explored Boc-β-amino-l-alanine as a novel P2 ligand. A number of inhibitors have displayed β-secretase inhibitory potency. Inhibitor 4c has shown potent BACE1 inhibitory activity, Ki=0.25nM, cellular EC50 of 194nM, and displayed good selectivity over BACE2. A model of 4c was created based upon the X-ray structure of 2-bound β-secretase which revealed critical interactions in the active site.
25496215,0,2014,Radiology,The Added Value of Statistical Modeling of Backscatter Properties in the Management of Breast Lesions at US.,PURPOSE: To develop a classification method based on the statistical backscatter properties of tissues that can be used as an ancillary tool to the usual Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification for solid breast lesions identified at ultrasonography (US).MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study received institutional review board approval, and all subjects provided informed consent. Eighty-nine women (mean age, 50 years; age range, 22-82 years) with 96 indeterminate solid breast lesions (BI-RADS category 4-5; mean size, 13.2 mm; range, 2.6-44.7 mm) were enrolled. Prior to biopsy, additional radiofrequency US images were obtained, and a 3-second cine sequence was used. The research data were analyzed at a later time and were not used to modify patient management decisions. The lesions were segmented manually, and parameters of the homodyned K distribution (α, k, and μn values) were extracted for three regions: the intratumoral zone, a 3-mm supratumoral zone, and a 5-mm infratumoral zone. The Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to identify parameters with the best discriminating value, yielding intratumoral α, supratumoral k, and infratumoral μn values.RESULTS: The 96 lesions were classified as follows: 48 BI-RADS category 4A lesions, 16 BI-RADS category 4B lesions, seven BI-RADS category 4C lesions, and 25 BI-RADS category 5 lesions. There were 24 cancers (25%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.65, 0.86). Overall, 24% of biopsies (in 17 of 72 lesions) could have been spared. By limiting analysis to lesions with a lower likelihood of malignancy (BI-RADS category 4A-4B), this percentage increased to 26% (16 of 62 lesions). Among benign lesions, the model was used to correctly classify 10 of 38 fibroadenomas (26%) and three of seven stromal fibroses (43%).CONCLUSION: The statistical model performs well in the classification of solid breast lesions at US, with the potential of preventing one in four biopsies without missing any malignancy.
25490951,0,2014,Toxicol Sci,Functional and molecular effects of mercury compounds on the human OCTN1 cation transporter: C50 and C136 are the targets for potent inhibition.,The effect of mercury compounds has been tested on the organic cation transporter, hOCTN1. MeHg(+), Hg(2+), or Cd(2+) caused strong inhibition of transport. 1,4-Dithioerythritol (DTE), cysteine (Cys), and N-acetyl-l-cysteine reversed (NAC) the inhibition at different extents. 2-Aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA), a prototype SH reagent, exerted inhibition of transport similar to that observed for the mercurial agents. To investigate the mechanism of action of mercurials, mutants of hOCTN1 in which each of the Cys residues was substituted by Ala have been constructed, over-expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified. Tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) uptake mediated by each mutant in proteoliposomes was comparable to that of wild type (WT). IC50 values of the WT and mutants for the mercury compounds were derived from dose-response analyses. The mutants C50A and C136A showed significant increase of IC50 indicating that the 2 Cys residues were involved in the interaction with the mercury compounds and inhibition of the transporter. The double mutant C50A/C136A was constructed; the lack of inhibition confirmed that the 2 Cys residues are the targets of mercury compounds. MTSEA showed similar behavior with respect to the mercurial reagents with the difference that increased IC50 was observed also in the C81A mutant. Similar results were obtained when transport was measured as acetylcholine uptake. Ethyl mercury (Thimerosal) inhibited hOCTN1 as well. C50A, C50A/C136A and, at very lower extent, C136A showed increased IC50 indicating that C50 was the major target of this mercury compound. The homology model of hOCTN1 was built using as template PiPT and validated by the experimental data on mutant proteins.
25490933,0,2014,Elife,Registered report: Tumour micro-environment elicits innate resistance to RAF inhibitors through HGF secretion.,The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of 50 papers in the field of cancer biology published between 2010 and 2012. This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from &quot;Tumour micro-environment elicits innate resistance to RAF inhibitors through HGF secretion&quot; by Straussman and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012 (Straussman et al., 2012). The key experiments being replicated in this study are from Figure 2A, C, and D (and Supplemental Figure 11) and Figure 4C (and Supplemental Figure 19) (Straussman et al., 2012). Figure 2 demonstrates resistance to drug sensitivity conferred by co-culture with some stromal cell lines and identifies the secreted factor responsible as HGF. In Figure 4, Straussman and colleagues show that blocking the HGF receptor MET abrogates HGF’s rescue of drug sensitivity. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange, and the results of the replications will be published by eLife.
25488575,0,2014,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Value of sonographic features in predicting malignancy in thyroid nodules diagnosed as follicular neoplasm on cytology.,BACKGROUND: The cytological diagnosis of follicular neoplasm (Thy3F) remains a diagnostic challenge. The main aim of this study was to stratify the risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules diagnosed as Thy3F on cytology (Thy3F) using thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TIRADS).METHODS: A database of thyroid nodules with Thy3F cytological results from ultrasound-guided FNA (US-FNA) between January 2007 and March 2014 was studied retrospectively. Information on patient demographics, ultrasound characteristics and final histology of the nodules was collated. The number of suspicious US features of each thyroid nodule was counted based on TIRADS. The malignancy rate of each of the TIRADS category was also calculated based on the final histological outcomes of the nodules and compared to that calculated using a recently proposed thyroid malignancy risk prediction model.RESULTS: The overall malignancy rate of Thy3F cytology was 24·3%. There were significantly higher percentages of malignant nodules with irregular margins (20·0% vs 0%, P = 0·000), hypo-echogenicity (74·3% vs 51·4%, P = 0·013) and taller-than-wide morphology (17·1% vs 0·9%, P = 0·001) when compared to benign nodules. The risk of malignancy increased with advancing TIRADS score: TIRADS 4A (14·3%), TIRADS 4B (23·1%), TIRADS 4C (87·5%) and TIRADS 5 (100%). The malignancy rate calculated using the prediction model similarly increased with advancing TIRADS score: TIRADS 4A (6·2%), TIRADS 4B (32·5%), TIRADS 4C (79·9%) and TIRADS 5 (90%).CONCLUSION: Thyroid nodules with TIRADS scores 4C and 5 should be considered for single definitive surgery in view of the high malignant rate.
25486429,0,2014,Oncogene,Arl4c expression in colorectal and lung cancers promotes tumorigenesis and may represent a novel therapeutic target.,We recently demonstrated that expression of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-like 4c (Arl4c) induced by a combination of Wnt/β-catenin and epidermal growth factor/Ras signaling in normal epithelial cells grown in three-dimensional culture promotes cellular migration and proliferation, resulting in formation of tube-like structures, suggesting the involvement of Arl4c in epithelial morphogenesis. It is conceivable that there could be a common mechanism between epithelial morphogenesis and carcinogenesis. Therefore the current study was conducted to investigate whether Arl4c might be involved in tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical analyses of tissue specimens obtained from colorectal and lung cancer patients revealed that Arl4c was not observed in non-tumor regions but was strongly expressed at high frequencies in tumor lesions. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin or Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling reduced Arl4c mRNA levels in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells and A549 lung cancer cells. Knockdown of Arl4c inhibited Rac activity and also prevented nuclear localization of yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in these cancer cells. Arl4c-depleted cancer cells consistently showed decreased migration, invasion and proliferation capabilities both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, direct injection of Arl4c small interfering RNA (siRNA) into HCT116 cell-derived tumors (in vivo treatment with siRNA) inhibited tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. These results suggest that Arl4c is involved in tumorigenesis and might represent a novel therapeutic target for suppressing proliferation and invasion of colorectal and lung cancer cells.Oncogene advance online publication, 8 December 2014; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.402.
25479813,0,2014,Ultrasound Med Biol,Diagnostic evaluation of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: ultrasonographic, mammographic and histopathologic correlations.,The aims of the study described here were to illustrate the spectrum of ultrasonographic features of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and to evaluate the ability of ultrasonography (US) to predict the grade and recurrence of DCIS on the basis of mammographic and histopathologic findings. We retrospectively evaluated the ultrasonographic features of 129 DCIS lesions from 127 consecutive women and compared these with their mammographic and histopathologic features. The mean size of DCISs on ultrasonography and mammography (MMG) was 3.67 ± 1.40 and 4.00 ± 1.74 cm, respectively, which do not differ statistically (p = 0.09). Despite the statistical difference in Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification on US and MMG (p = 0.000), the median BI-RADS classification is category 4c on both US and MMG (p = 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of microcalcification on MMG and US. Clusters &lt;5 mm in greatest diameter are easily seen on MMG. At US, a scattered/linear distribution on MMG had a higher level of visibility than clustered distribution on MMG. The correlation between tumor size and DCIS with micro-invasion evaluated using US is higher than that obtained using MMG (p = 0.001 and 0.024, respectively). When US was used for the detection of DCIS, diagnostic accuracy was significantly associated with higher Van Nuys groups, the presence of micro-invasion and comedo carcinoma (p = 0.000, 0.022 and 0.011, respectively). However, mammographic diagnostic accuracy was found not to associate with higher Van Nuys groups, the presence of micro-invasion and comedo carcinoma (p = 0.054, 0.093 and 0.256, respectively). Ultrasonography may play an important role both in detecting DCIS and in evaluating its histopathologic features. Detection of DCIS using MMG alone may be suboptimal for patients with dense breasts, especially among Chinese women.
25475561,0,2014,Proteomics,In vitro flowering associated protein changes in Dendrocalamus hamiltonii.,In Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, conversion of vegetative meristem to a floral meristem was successfully achieved on flower induction medium. A total of 128 differentially expressed proteins were evidenced by 2DE in floral meristem protein profiles. Analysis of 103 proteins through PMF revealed change in abundance in the content of 79 proteins, disappearance and new appearance in the content of 7 and 17 proteins, respectively. MS/MS and subsequent homology search identified 65 proteins that were involved in metabolism (22 proteins), regulatory (11 proteins), signaling and transportation (12 proteins), stress (6 proteins), flowering (8 proteins), and unknown functions (6 proteins). The data suggested that change in metabolism related proteins might be providing nutrient resources for floral initiation in D. hamiltonii. Further, interactive effects of various proteins like bHLH145, B-4c transcription factors (heat stress transcription factor), maturase K, MADS box, zinc finger proteins, and scarecrow-like protein 21 (flowering related), a key enzyme of ethylene biosynthesis SAMS (S-adenosylmethionine synthase) and aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase, improved calcium signaling related proteins (CML36), and change in phytohormone related proteins such as phosphatase proteins (2c3 and 2c55), which are the positive regulators of gibberellic acid and phytochrome regulation related proteins (DASH, LWD1) might be the possible major regulators of floral transition in this bamboo.
25474059,0,2014,J Food Prot,Listeria monocytogenes serotype prevalence and biodiversity in diverse food products.,The aim of this study was to assess serotype prevalence and biodiversity of Listeria monocytogenes strains isolated from diverse food products, i.e., minced pork, fruits, and vegetables. Three hundred twenty-six samples previously purchased from supermarkets and street markets within the Athens area were studied for L. monocytogenes prevalence. A total of 121 strains were isolated from the 36 samples that were positive for L. monocytogenes. Serotyping was performed with multiplex PCR, and biodiversity was assessed with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR analysis using M13, UBC155, and HLWL85 as primers and with repetitive element palindromic (rep) PCR analysis using (GTG)5 as the primer. The majority (17 of 22) of the contaminated minced pork samples contained strains identified as serotype 1/2a, either alone or in combination with strains belonging to serotypes 1/2b, 4a, 4c, or 4ab. However, all L. monocytogenes isolates from fruits and vegetables belonged to serotype 4b. Rep-PCR provided better differentiation of the isolates than did RAPD PCR and resulted in discrimination of the isolates into a larger number of unique profiles. Complete differentiation was achieved only with the combination of these subtyping techniques.
25471592,0,2014,Echocardiography,Long-Term Cardiac Remodeling in Elite Athletes: Assessment by Tissue Doppler and Speckle Tracking Echocardiography.,AIMS: Currently, it remains unclear whether there are differences in the long-term physiologic and adaptive changes in an athlete's heart, varying by the type of exercise undertaken. In this study, we used standard and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) to evaluate the long-term effects of cardiac remodeling, which persisted many years after retiring from professional sports (marathon running and wrestling).METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-four marathon runners, 25 wrestlers, and 24 healthy subjects were included in the study. Left ventricular (LV) strain (S) and strain rate (Sr) were evaluated by apical two- (2C), three- (3C), and four-chamber (4C) imaging. Global S and Sr were calculated by averaging the 3 apical views. The participants' mean age was comparable across the 3 groups. Weight, body mass index, LV mass, LV mass index, and relative diastolic wall thickness were higher in wrestlers than the other groups (P &lt; 0.001). Systolic and diastolic functions, evaluated using conventional echocardiography, were comparable among the 3 groups. 2C, 3C, and 4C longitudinal strain (LS), global LS (GLS), and global Sr systolic filling (SrS) values were comparable between the marathon runners and control group; however, GLS, LS-2C, GLSrS, SrS-3C, and SrS-2C values were significantly increased in wrestlers compared with the control group.CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial changes in wrestlers and marathon runners who quit sports after an extensive period were evaluated using standard echocardiographic and STE parameters. Although they had stopped playing active sports more than 10 years earlier, both the structural and functional properties of the heart were maintained in wrestlers.
25458226,0,2014,Eur J Radiol,Ultrasound screening of contralateral breast after surgery for breast cancer.,OBJECTIVE: To determine whether supplemental screening ultrasound (US) to mammography could improve cancer detection rate of the contralateral breast in patients with a personal history of breast cancer and dense breasts.MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a one-year study period, 1314 screening patients with a personal history of breast cancer and dense breasts simultaneously underwent mammography and breast US. BI-RADS categories were given for mammography or US-detected lesions in the contralateral breast. The reference standard was histology and/or 1-year imaging follow-up, and the cancer rate according to BI-RADS categories and cancer detection rate and positive biopsy rate according to detection modality were analyzed.RESULTS: Of 1314 patients, 84 patients (6.4%) were categorized as category 3 with one interval cancer and one cancer which was upgraded to category 4A after 6-month follow-up US (2.5% cancer rate, 95% CIs 1.5-9.1%). Fifteen patients (1.1%) had category 4A or 4B lesions in the contralateral breast. Four lesions were detected on mammography (two lesions were also visible on US) and 11 lesions were detected on US and 5 cancers were confirmed (33.3%, 95% CIs 15.0-58.5%). Six patients (0.5%) had category 4C lesions, 2 detected on mammography and 4 on US and 4 cancers were confirmed (66.7%, 95% CIs 29.6-90.8%). No lesions were categorized as category 5 in the contralateral breast. Cancer detection rate by mammography was 3.3 per 1000 patients and that by US was 5.0 per 1000 patients, therefore overall cancer detection rate by mammography plus US was 8.3 per 1000 patients. Positive biopsy rate of mammography-detected lesions was 66.7% (4 of 6) and that of US-detected lesions was 40.0% (6 of 15).CONCLUSION: US can be helpful to detect mammographically occult breast cancer in the contralateral breast with high positive biopsy rate and low category 3 rate in patients with a previous history of breast cancer and dense breasts.
25457126,0,2014,Bioorg Med Chem,NA,A series of (R)-3-amino-1-((3aS,7aS)-octahydro-1H-indol-1-yl)-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butan-1-one derivatives was designed, synthesized, and evaluated as novel inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Most of the synthesized compounds demonstrated good inhibition activities against DPP-4. Among these, compounds 3e, 4c, 4l, and 4n exhibited prominent inhibition activities against DPP-4, with IC50s of 0.07, 0.07, 0.14, and 0.17μM, respectively. The possible binding modes of compounds 3e and 4n with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 were also explored by molecular docking simulation. These potent DPP-4 inhibitors were optimized for the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, and compound 4n displayed an attractive pharmacokinetic profile (F=96.3%, t1/2=10.5h).
25455412,0,2014,Eur J Radiol,Non-mass-like breast lesions at ultrasonography: feature analysis and BI-RADS assessment.,OBJECTIVE: To analyze the features of non-mass-like (NML) breast lesions on ultrasound (US) and determine their corresponding malignancy rate and to stratify these lesion patterns according to US BI-RADS categories.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-four consecutive lesions were retrospectively classified into four types according to the US features, the corresponding positive predictive values (PPVs) were obtained. Clinical, imaging, and histopathological findings were reviewed.RESULTS: Among the 164 lesions, 39 (24%) were classified as type Ia, 14 (8%) as type Ib, 39 (24%) as type IIa, 19 (12%) as type IIb, 19 (12%) as type III, and 34 (21%) as type IV. The PPVs for malignancy were 21% for type Ia, 79% for type Ib, 10% for type IIa, 58% for type IIb, 16% for type III, and 21% for type IV. All NML lesions were classified as BI-RADS category 4a (type IIa), 4b (type Ia, III and IV) and 4c (type Ib and IIb) according to their PPVs. There was a significantly higher frequency of malignancy among lesions of type Ib and type IIb compared with the other types (P&lt;0.01 for each). Lesions with associated calcifications, presence of abnormal axillary nodes, or a mammographic finding of suspected malignancy had a higher probability of malignancy (P&lt;0.05 for each).CONCLUSION: US is useful in clarifying the indication for biopsy of NML lesions. The types of US classifications used in our study establish reliable references for the NML patterns when stratified according to the BI-RADS categories.
25453799,0,2014,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Design, synthesis and anticancer evaluation of tetrahydro-β-carboline-hydantoin hybrids.,A series of new tetrahydro-β-carboline-hydantoin hybrids have been designed and synthesized based on the structure of the known Eg5 inhibitor HR22C16. These compounds have been evaluated for their anticancer activity against lung (A549), cervical (ME180, HeLa), prostate (PC-3) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines by MTT assay. These hybrids have displayed significant in vitro cytotoxicity in comparison to etoposide against PC-3, A549, and MCF-7 cell lines. The hybrids 3a, 3b, 3c, 3e, 3f, 3g, 4b, 4c, 4e and 4f appear to be more effective against the PC-3 cell line, among which compound 4b displayed the highest cytotoxicity (6.08 ± 0.2, IC₅₀ μM). Based on these results, an attempt was made to rationalize their mechanism of action through cell cycle analysis studies. The flow-cytometric analysis of compound 4b in PC-3 cells indicated a G2/M cell cycle arrest. Molecular docking studies substantiate that these compounds indeed bind to the allosteric site of Eg5 formed from Glu116, Gly117, Glu118, Trp127, Ala133, Ile136, Pro137, Tyr211, Leu214, and Glu215 residues with the most potent compound 4b showing the most favorable interaction.
25441779,0,2014,Ann Hum Genet,Identification and molecular characterization of HNF1B gene mutations in Indian diabetic patients with renal abnormalities.,Heterozygous mutations of the HNF1B gene (HNF1B-MODY or MODY5) are associated with a wide clinical spectrum of renal and extrarenal disease without clear genotype-phenotype correlation. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of HNF1B gene mutations in young Indian diabetic patients with various renal abnormalities. Fifty unrelated young diabetic patients, who also had renal abnormalities, were selected from the electronic records of a large diabetes centre in Chennai, in southern India. All patients were sequenced for HNF1B gene mutations. The whole or partial gene deletion was analyzed by MLPA. Functional characterization of the novel variant (Asn321Asp) was also performed using transcriptional activation and subcellular localization assays. We identified six different HNF1B gene mutations which included four previously reported (-67C&gt;T, Arg165His, IVS2nt+2insT, Met1_Trp557del) and two novel variations (Asn321Asp, IVS3nt-4C&gt;G). The functional study revealed that the novel variation Asn321Asp in both the heterozygous and homozygous state showed similar transcriptional activity, expression levels and normal transportation of protein to the nucleus similar to wild type, suggesting that it is not likely to be pathogenic. This is the first major study of HNF1B-MODY from India and shows that about 10% of young diabetic subjects with renal abnormalities seen at a tertiary diabetes centre harbor HNF1B gene mutations.
25434937,0,2014,J Neurosurg,Comparison of radiation dose spillage from the Gamma Knife Perfexion with that from volumetric modulated arc radiosurgery during treatment of multiple brain metastases in a single fraction.,OBJECT: The objective of this study was to examine radiation dose distributions created by 2 competing radiosurgery modalities for treating multiple brain metastases: single-isocenter volumetric modulated arc radiosurgery (VMAS) and Gamma Knife Perfexion (GKP). In addition, the effectiveness of multiple radiosurgery quality metrics was evaluated and compared between these advanced treatment modalities.METHODS: Seven anonymized MRI data sets, each showing 2-5 metastases, were used to create plans on each system. The GammaPlan (version 10.1) program was used for planning of GKP. A neurosurgeon contoured the volumes to be treated, and no planning target volume expansion was used. A prescription dose coverage of ≥ 99% was achieved for each tumor volume. The Philips Pinnacle (version 9.2) program was used for planning of VMAS, using the SmartArc optimization algorithm for delivery on a Varian iX linear accelerator. Contours were transferred from GammaPlan, and again no planning target volume expansion was used. Between 2 and 5 arcs with table angles of 90°-270° were used. Again, a V100% of ≥ 99% was achieved for each tumor volume. After planning, the MRI scans, tumor volumes, and dose information from each plan were exported according to the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine standard to the VelocityAI program for analysis. Brain dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for normal brain tissues were generated, and the volume of these tissues receiving 20%-90% of the prescription dose was tabulated. Finally, the prescription isodose to tumor volume ratio (PITV; Shaw et al., 1993), conformity index (CI; Paddick, 2000), gradient index (GI, Paddick and Lippitz, 2006), and conformity/gradient index (CGI, Wagner et al. 2003) were calculated for each plan. Both the PITV and CI have ideal values of 1, while the GI and CGI have ideal values of lowest and highest achievable, respectively.RESULTS: The DVHs consistently showed that with VMAS a higher amount of normal brain tissues received each dose level than with GKP. These increases were largest for lower isodose levels, with the volumes of normal brain that received 20%-50% and 60%-90% of the prescription dose showing average increases of 403% and 227%, respectively. Prescription isodose conformality showed only minor differences between the 2 modalities. Radiosurgery quality metrics including measures of the dose gradient (GI and CGI) indicated that the GKP plan was superior in each case, with respective average GI and CGI values of 3.04 and 57.75 for GKP and of 10.22 and 10.85 for VMAS. Metrics evaluating prescription isodose conformality alone differed only slightly between the modalities. Average respective PITV and CI values were 2.13 and 0.53 for GKP and 2.27 and 0.51 for VMAS.CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery plans for the treatment of multiple metastases with VMAS delivered significantly more dose to the normal brain tissues than plans for GKP. Radiosurgery quality metrics including a measure of the dose gradient are better suited to providing contrast between modern radiosurgery treatment platforms.
25429402,0,2014,Nanoscale,Monodisperse SnSb nanocrystals for Li-ion and Na-ion battery anodes: synergy and dissonance between Sn and Sb.,We report a facile chemical synthesis of monodisperse colloidal SnSb nanocrystals (NCs) via reaction between Sn NCs and SbCl3 in oleylamine under reducing conditions. In comparison with individual Sn and Sb NCs and their mixtures, we show that through the creation of SnSb alloyed NCs the Li-ion storage properties are enhanced due to combination of high cycling stability of Sb with higher specific Li-ion storage capacity of Sn. In particular, stable capacities of above 700 and 600 mA h g(-1) were obtained after 100 cycles of charging/discharging at 0.5C and 4C rates, respectively (1C corresponding to a current density of 660 mA g(-1)). Furthermore, Na-ion storage capacities of &gt;350 mA h g(-1) and &gt;200 mA h g(-1) were obtained at 1C and 20C rates, respectively. This study highlights the differences between Li- and Na-ion (electro)chemistries and the great utility of monodisperse NCs as model systems for understanding size and compositional effects on the performance of conversion-type electrode materials.
25429341,0,2014,Iran J Basic Med Sci,N-Phenyl-2-p-tolylthiazole-4-carboxamide derivatives: Synthesis and cytotoxicity evaluation as anticancer agents.,OBJECTIVES: According to the prevalence of neoplastic diseases, there is a deep necessity for discovery of novel anticancer drugs in the field of medicinal chemistry. In the current study, a new series of phenylthiazole derivatives (compounds 4a-4f) was synthesized and their anticancer activity was assessed in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All synthesized derivatives were evaluated towards three human cancerous cell lines of SKNMC (Neuroblastoma), Hep-G2 (Human hepatocarcinoma) and MCF-7 cell (Breast cancer) using MTT assay and obtained values (IC50 ± SD) were compared with doxorubicin.RESULTS: Unfortunately, none of the synthesized compounds showed superior activity than doxorubicin against cancerous cell lines. MCF-7 cell line was the most resistant cell line against tested compounds. Compounds 4c with para nitro (IC50 = 10.8 ± 0.08 µM) and 4d with meta chlorine (IC50 = 11.6 ± 0.12 µM) moieties exerted the highest cytotoxic effects towards SKNMC and Hep-G2 cell lines respectively.CONCLUSION: A new series of phenylthiazole derivatives were synthesized and their anticancer activity was assessed against cancerous cell lines. More structural modifications and derivatization is necessary to achieve to the more potent compounds.
25423616,0,2014,Biochemistry,Spectroscopic studies of the Salmonella enterica adenosyltransferase enzyme SeCobA: molecular-level insight into the mechanism of substrate Cob(II)alamin activation.,CobA from Salmonella enterica (SeCobA) is a member of the family of ATP:Co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase (ACAT) enzymes that participate in the biosynthesis of adenosylcobalamin by catalyzing the transfer of the adenosyl group from an ATP molecule to a reactive Co(I)rrinoid species transiently generated in the enzyme active site. This reaction is thermodynamically challenging, as the reduction potential of the Co(II)rrinoid precursor in solution is far more negative than that of available reducing agents in the cell (e.g., flavodoxin), precluding nonenzymic reduction to the Co(I) oxidation state. However, in the active sites of ACATs, the Co(II)/Co(I) redox potential is increased by &gt;250 mV via the formation of a unique four-coordinate (4c) Co(II)rrinoid species. In the case of the SeCobA ACAT, crystallographic and kinetic studies have revealed that the phenylalanine 91 (F91) and tryptophan 93 (W93) residues are critical for in vivo activity, presumably by blocking access to the lower axial ligand site of the Co(II)rrinoid substrate. To further assess the importance of the F91 and W93 residues with respect to enzymatic function, we have characterized various SeCobA active-site variants using electronic absorption, magnetic circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. Our data provide unprecedented insight into the mechanism by which SeCobA converts the Co(II)rrinoid substrate to 4c species, with the hydrophobicity, size, and ability to participate in offset π-stacking interactions of key active-site residues all being critical for activity. The structural changes that occur upon Co(II)rrinoid binding also appear to be crucial for properly orienting the transiently generated Co(I) &quot;supernucleophile&quot; for rapid reaction with cosubstrate ATP.
25407094,0,2014,Psychol Med,The trajectory of cognitive decline in the pre-dementia phase in memory clinic visitors: findings from the 4C-MCI study.,BACKGROUND: We investigated the course of decline in multiple cognitive domains in non-demented subjects from a memory clinic setting, and compared pattern, onset and magnitude of decline between subjects who progressed to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia at follow-up and subjects who did not progress.METHOD: In this retrospective cohort study 819 consecutive non-demented patients who visited the memory clinics in Maastricht or Amsterdam between 1987 and 2010 were followed until they became demented or for a maximum of 10 years (range 0.5-10 years). Differences in trajectories of episodic memory, executive functioning, verbal fluency, and information processing speed/attention between converters to AD dementia and subjects remaining non-demented were compared by means of random effects modelling.RESULTS: The cognitive performance of converters and non-converters could already be differentiated seven (episodic memory) to three (verbal fluency and executive functioning) years prior to dementia diagnosis. Converters declined in these three domains, while non-converters remained stable on episodic memory and executive functioning and showed modest decline in verbal fluency. There was no evidence of decline in information processing speed/attention in either group.CONCLUSIONS: Differences in cognitive performance between converters to AD dementia and subjects remaining non-demented could be established 7 years prior to diagnosis for episodic memory, with verbal fluency and executive functioning following several years later. Therefore, in addition to early episodic memory decline, decline in executive functions may also flag incident AD dementia. By contrast, change in information processing speed/attention seems less informative.
25385647,0,2014,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Mapping of long-range INS promoter interactions reveals a role for calcium-activated chloride channel ANO1 in insulin secretion.,We used circular chromatin conformation capture (4C) to identify a physical contact in human pancreatic islets between the region near the insulin (INS) promoter and the ANO1 gene, lying 68 Mb away on human chromosome 11, which encodes a Ca(2+)-dependent chloride ion channel. In response to glucose, this contact was strengthened and ANO1 expression increased, whereas inhibition of INS gene transcription by INS promoter targeting siRNA decreased ANO1 expression, revealing a regulatory effect of INS promoter on ANO1 expression. Knockdown of ANO1 expression caused decreased insulin secretion in human islets, establishing a physical proximity-dependent feedback loop involving INS transcription, ANO1 expression, and insulin secretion. To explore a possible role of ANO1 in insulin metabolism, we carried out experiments in Ano1(+/-) mice. We observed reduced serum insulin levels and insulin-to-glucose ratios in high-fat diet-fed Ano1(+/-) mice relative to Ano1(+/+) mice fed the same diet. Our results show that determination of long-range contacts within the nucleus can be used to detect novel and physiologically relevant mechanisms. They also show that networks of long-range physical contacts are important to the regulation of insulin metabolism.
25363687,0,2014,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Novel thiosemicarbazides induced apoptosis in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells via JNK signaling.,Abstract In this study, novel thiosemicarbazides and 1,3,4-oxadiazoles were synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer effects on human MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Among the synthesized derivatives studied, compound 2-(3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxybutanoyl)-N-phenylhydrazinecarbothioamide 4c showed the highest cytotoxicity against MCF-7 breast cancer cells as it reduced cell viability to approximately 15% compared to approximately 25% in normal breast epithelial cells. Therefore, we focused on 4c for further investigations. Our data showed that 4c induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells which was further confirmed by TUNEL assay. Western blotting analysis showed that compound 4c up-regulated the pro-survival proteins Bax, Bad and ERK1/2, while it down-regulated anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Akt and STAT-3. Additionally, 4c induced phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK in MCF-7 cells. Pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with 10 µM of JNK inhibitor significantly reduced 4c-induced apoptosis. Molecular docking results suggested that compound 4c showed a binding pattern close to the pattern observed in the structure of the lead fragment bound to JNK1. Collectively, the data of current study suggested that the thiosemicarbazide 4c might trigger apoptosis in human MCF-7 cells by targeting JNK signaling.
25362572,0,2014,J Antimicrob Chemother,Antifungal activity of 6-quinolinyl N-oxide chalcones against Paracoccidioides.,BACKGROUND: Chalcones are an important class of natural compounds that have been widely applied as synthons in synthetic organic chemistry and possess diverse and interesting biological properties.METHODS: We conducted tests with the synthetic substances 6-quinolinyl N-oxide chalcones 4c and 4e to determine their antifungal activity against several isolates of Paracoccidioides spp. and their activity in a murine model. We also determined whether the chalcones interacted with other drugs or interfered with the morphology of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb18) yeast cells.RESULTS: We verified that the substances were active against Paracoccidioides spp., but we did not show an interaction with the drugs tested when only the fractional inhibitory concentration index values were considered individually. We observed that the substances induced in vitro morphological changes. Compounds 4c and 4e showed activity similar to itraconazole in treated mice, as demonstrated by their ability to reduce the number of cfu recovered from the lungs. Histopathological analysis showed that animals treated with 4c presented fewer areas containing inflammatory infiltrate and larger areas of preserved lung tissue, whereas animals treated with itraconazole showed accumulation of inflammatory infiltrate and some granulomas. Mice treated with 4e exhibited inflammation that compromised the tissue.CONCLUSIONS: The results presented in this paper confirm the antifungal potential of the chalcones tested. The chalcone 4c was the more effective at controlling the disease in mice and this compound could be a candidate for future studies of the treatment of paracoccidioidomycosis.
25361885,0,2014,Ann Surg Oncol,Papilloma on core biopsy: excision vs. observation.,BACKGROUND: Intraductal papillomas (IPs) are commonly seen breast lesions with variable clinical presentation. For a palpable lesion and/or evidence of cellular atypia and/or pathologic nipple discharge, excision is warranted to rule out adjacent carcinoma, while for asymptomatic IPs lacking atypia current data for excision vs. observation are controversial. We reviewed outcomes of IPs diagnosed at our institution.METHODS: With IRB approval, we reviewed consecutive patients with IPs seen on core biopsy (CBx) between 2005 and 2013. All patients had an excision, with subspecialty breast pathology review of CBx and excisions. The rate of upgrade to cancer on excision was recorded. Differences between atypia and no-atypia groups were determined by two-tailed t test and Fisher's exact test.RESULTS: We identified 97 patients (age range 31-83 years) with IPs on CBx. Among 52 atypical IPs, DCIS was seen in 11 (upgrade 21 %). In 45 IPs without atypia, 3 cancers were seen (upgrade 6. %): 2 had palpable lesions and were found to have DCIS, and 1 invasive cancer was found in a non-palpable mammographically detected BIRADS 4C lesion, whose Cbx result was discordant. If the 2 palpable lesions are excluded, the upgrade rate for IPs without atypia is 2.2 %.CONCLUSIONS: This series shows a low upgrade rate for IP without atypia seen on CBx in the absence of a palpable mass and radiographic/pathologic discordance, suggesting that a surgical biopsy may not be necessary. Further prospective studies to better estimate the upgrade rate for IPs without atypia may be helpful.
25359595,0,2014,BMC Biol,Diet disparity among sympatric herbivorous cichlids in the same ecomorphs in Lake Tanganyika: amplicon pyrosequences on algal farms and stomach contents.,BACKGROUND: Lake Tanganyika, an ancient lake in the Great Rift Valley, is famous for the adaptive radiation of cichlids. Five tribes of the Cichlidae family have acquired herbivory, with five ecomorphs: grazers, browsers, scrapers, biters and scoopers. Sixteen species of the herbivorous cichlids coexist on a rocky littoral slope in the lake. Seven of them individually defend feeding territories against intruding herbivores to establish algal farms. We collected epiphyton from these territories at various depths and also gathered fish specimens. Algal and cyanobacteria community structures were analysed using the amplicon-metagenomic method.RESULTS: Based on 454-pyrosequencing of SSU rRNA gene sequences, we identified 300 phototrophic taxa, including 197 cyanobacteria, 57 bacillariophytes, and 31 chlorophytes. Algal farms differed significantly in their composition among cichlid species, even in the same ecomorph, due in part to their habitat-depth segregation. The algal species composition of the stomach contents and algal farms of each species differed, suggesting that cichlids selectively harvest their farms. The stomach contents were highly diverse, even between species in the same tribe, in the same feeding ecomorph.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the amplicon-metagenomic approach revealed food niche separation based on habitat-depth segregation among coexisting herbivorous cichlids in the same ecomorphs in Lake Tanganyika.
25347308,0,2014,J Org Chem,AlCl3-promoted selective Michael addition with allenoate and methyleneindolinone: synthesis of spirocyclic oxindole by using allenoate as a four-carbon component building block.,The AlCl3-promoted cyclization of readily available allenoates with methyleneindolinone is disclosed. The present strategy provides a rapid access to spirocyclic oxindole-cyclohexenones in an efficient manner. Remarkably, the allenoate is implemented as a four-carbon (4C) component to form the ring, which shows high synthetic efficiency. Flexibility of this method allows quick synthesis of spirocyclic oxindole-dihydropyrans by varying one of the components. It is also noteworthy that AlCl3 serves as the chlorine source as well as an effective catalyst to facilitate this interesting transformation.
25342555,0,2014,Molecules,Structural diversity of copper(II) complexes with N-(2-pyridyl)imidazolidin-2-ones(thiones) and their in vitro antitumor activity.,Six series of structurally different mono- and binuclear copper(II) complexes 5-10 were obtained by reacting N-(2-pyridyl)imidazolidin-2-ones (1a-l), N,N'-bis(2-pyridyl)imidazolidin-2-ones (2a,b), N-acyl-N'(2-pyridyl)imidazolodin-2-ones (3a-j) and N-(2-pyridyl)imidazolidine-2-thiones (4a-g) with copper(II) chloride at an ambient temperature. The coordination modes of the complexes obtained were established by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopic data and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The in vitro cytotoxic activities of both the free ligands and copper(II) complexes were evaluated using a crystal violet microtiter plate assay on five human tumor cell lines: LCLC-103H, A-427, SISO, RT-4 and DAN-G. The free ligands 1-4 at concentration attainable in cancer cells of 20 μM showed no meaningful cytotoxic effect with cell viability in the range of 88%-100%. The most potent copper(II) complex of 1-(6-ethoxy-2-pyridyl)imidazolidin-2-one (6b) exhibited selective cytotoxicity against A-427 lung cancer cell line, while the complexes of 1-(5-methyl-2-pyridyl)imidazolidine-2-thione (5h) and 1-(4-tert-butyl-2-pyridyl)imidazolidine-2-thione (5j) showed cytostatic effect against a whole panel of five human tumor cell lines. In conclusion, the only complexes that showed remarkably increased activity in comparison to the free ligands were those obtained from N-(2-pyridyl)imidazolidine-2-thiones 4c and 4e substituted with alkyl group at position 4 or 5 of pyridine ring.
25337892,0,2014,PLoS One,Identifying predictors of early growth response and adverse radiation effects of vestibular schwannomas to radiosurgery.,PURPOSE: To determine whether pre-treatment growth rate of vestibular schwannomas (VS) predict response to radiosurgery.METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all VS patients treated with 12Gy prescription dose between September 2005 and June 2011 at our institution using the Leksell Model 4C Gamma Knife Unit was conducted. Patients who had a minimum of 12-months clinical and radiological assessment before and after radiosurgery were included in this study. Tumor growth rates were calculated using specific growth rate (SGR). Tumor volumes were measured on FIESTA-MRI scans using ITK-SNAP v2.2.RESULTS: Following radiosurgery, twenty-seven (42.9%) patients showed a significant decrease in volume after one year, twenty-nine (46.0%) stabilized, and seven (11.1%) continued to grow. There was no correlation between VS pre-treatment SGRs with post-treatment SGRs (p = 0.34), and incidence of adverse radiation effects (ARE). The reduction in tumors' SGRs after radiosurgery was proportional to pre-treatment SGRs, although this correlation was not statistically significant (p = 0.19). Analysis of risk factors revealed a positive correlation between post-treatment SGRs and incidence of non-auditory complications, most of which were attributed to ARE (p = 0.047).CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment growth rate of VS does not predict tumor response to radiosurgery or incidence of ARE. VS with higher SGRs post-radiosurgery are more likely to experience ARE.
25335438,0,2014,Plant J,Pepper pathogenesis-related protein 4c is a plasma membrane-localized cysteine protease inhibitor that is required for plant cell death and defense signaling.,Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv) type III effector AvrBsT triggers programmed cell death (PCD) and activates the hypersensitive response (HR) in plants. Here, we isolated and identified the plasma membrane localized pathogenesis-related (PR) protein 4c gene (CaPR4c) from pepper (Capsicum annuum) leaves undergoing AvrBsT-triggered HR cell death. CaPR4c encodes a protein with a signal peptide and a Barwin domain. Recombinant CaPR4c protein expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited cysteine protease-inhibitor activity and ribonuclease (RNase) activity. Subcellular localization analyses revealed that CaPR4c localized to the plasma membrane in plant cells. CaPR4c expression was rapidly and specifically induced by avirulent Xcv (avrBsT) infection. Transient expression of CaPR4c caused HR cell death in pepper leaves, which was accompanied by enhanced accumulation of H2 O2 and significant induction of some defense-response genes. Deletion of the signal peptide from CaPR4c abolished the induction of HR cell death, indicating a requirement for plasma membrane localization of CaPR4c for HR cell death. CaPR4c silencing in pepper disrupted both basal and AvrBsT-triggered resistance responses, and enabled Xcv proliferation in infected leaves. H2 O2 accumulation, cell-death induction, and defense-response gene expression were distinctly reduced in CaPR4c-silenced pepper. CaPR4c overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants conferred greater resistance against infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. These results collectively suggest that CaPR4c plays an important role in plant cell death and defense signaling.
25319411,0,2014,J Vet Med Sci,PDE4 and PDE5 regulate cyclic nucleotide contents and relaxing effects on carbachol-induced contraction in the bovine abomasum.,The effects of various selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors on carbachol (CCh)-induced contraction in the bovine abomasum were investigated. Various selective PDE inhibitors, vinpocetine (type 1), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA, type 2), milrinone (type 3), Ro20-1724 (type 4), vardenafil (type 5), BRL-50481 (type 7) and BAY73-6691 (type 9), inhibited CCh-induced contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the PDE inhibitors, Ro20-1724 and vardenafil induced more relaxation than the other inhibitors based on the data for the IC50 or maximum relaxation. In smooth muscle of the bovine abomasum, we showed the expression of PDE4B, 4C, 4D and 5 by RT-PCR analysis. In the presence of CCh, Ro20-1724 increased the cAMP content, but not the cGMP content. By contrast, vardenafil increased the cGMP content, but not the cAMP content. These results suggest that Ro20-1724-induced relaxation was correlated with cAMP and that vardenafil-induced relaxation was correlated with cGMP in the bovine abomasum. In conclusion, PDE4 and PDE5 are the enzymes involved in regulation of the relaxation associated with cAMP and cGMP, respectively, in the bovine abomasum.
25305081,0,2014,Hum Mol Genet,PINK1 positively regulates HDAC3 to suppress dopaminergic neuronal cell death.,Deciphering the molecular basis of neuronal cell death is a central issue in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Dysregulation of p53 levels has been implicated in neuronal apoptosis. The role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in suppressing p53-dependent apoptosis has been recently emphasized; however, the molecular basis of modulation of p53 function by HDAC3 remains unclear. Here we show that PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), which is linked to autosomal recessive early-onset familial Parkinson's disease, phosphorylates HDAC3 at Ser-424 to enhance its HDAC activity in a neural cell-specific manner. PINK1 prevents H2O2-induced C-terminal cleavage of HDAC3 via phosphorylation of HDAC3 at Ser-424, which is reversed by protein phosphatase 4c. PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of HDAC3 enhances its direct association with p53 and causes subsequent hypoacetylation of p53. Genetic deletion of PINK1 partly impaired the suppressive role of HDAC3 in regulating p53 acetylation and transcriptional activity. However, depletion of HDAC3 fully abolished the PINK1-mediated p53 inhibitory loop. Finally, ectopic expression of phosphomometic-HDAC3(S424E) substantially overcomes the defective action of PINK1 against oxidative stress in dopaminergic neuronal cells. Together, our results uncovered a mechanism by which PINK1-HDAC3 network mediates p53 inhibitory loop in response to oxidative stress-induced damage.
25295751,0,2014,Molecules,Synthesis of new perhydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine derivatives and their evaluation in animal models of epilepsy.,A series of novel stereochemically pure derivatives of the investigative broad-spectrum anticonvulsant ADD408003 was designed and synthesized. Five-center four-component (U-5C-4CR) and four-center three-component (U-4C-3CR) variants of Ugi reaction were used in the key step of the synthetic pathways. The compounds obtained were evaluated for the anticonvulsant activitiy in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES), subcutaneous Metrazole (scMET) and minimal clonic seizure (6 Hz) animal models of epilepsy. The efficacies of most derivatives in the 6 Hz model of pharmacoresistant partial seizures were markedly higher than in the 'classical' MES and scMET models. The most active compounds, (4R,8aR)-3a, and (4S,8aS)-6 displayed median effective doses (ED50) of 47.90 and 126.19 mg/kg, respectively, for the 6 Hz test.
25284932,0,2014,Indian J Pharm Sci,Synthesis, in vitro Anticancer and Antimicrobial Evaluation of Novel Substituted Dihydropyrimidines.,A series of 1,4-dihydropyrimidine derivatives 3(a-t) were prepared from Biginelli reactions by using ethyl acetoacetate, substituted benzaldehyde and thiourea in the presence of piperidine and ethanol. The compounds 3(a-t) were reacted with dimethylsulphate, diethylsulphate, butyl bromide and benzyl chloride to give the new series of compounds 4(a-t). The structures of the newly synthesized compounds 4(a-t) were established by IR, (1)H NMR, Mass spectra and elemental analysis. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity by using Sulforhodamine B assay method against the growth of four humans cancer cell lines, antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and for antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. The compounds exhibited good anticancer activity and moderate antibacterial and antifungal activities. Compounds 4b, 4c, 4d, 4g, 4i, 4n, 4o, 4q and 4s showed significant anticancer activity when compared with the doxorubicin as a standard reference drug.
25280477,0,2014,J Mol Cell Biol,Hot spots of DNA double-strand breaks and genomic contacts of human rDNA units are involved in epigenetic regulation.,DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are involved in many cellular mechanisms, including replication, transcription, and genome rearrangements. The recent observation that hot spots of DSBs in human chromosomes delimit DNA domains that possess coordinately expressed genes suggests a strong relationship between the organization of transcription patterns and hot spots of DSBs. In this study, we performed mapping of hot spots of DSBs in a human 43-kb ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeated unit. We observed that rDNA units corresponded to the most fragile sites in human chromosomes and that these units possessed at least nine specific regions containing clusters of extremely frequently occurring DSBs, which were located exclusively in non-coding intergenic spacer (IGS) regions. The hot spots of DSBs corresponded to only a specific subset of DNase-hypersensitive sites, and coincided with CTCF, PARP1, and HNRNPA2B1 binding sites, and H3K4me3 marks. Our rDNA-4C data indicate that the regions of IGS containing the hot spots of DSBs often form contacts with specific regions in different chromosomes, including the pericentromeric regions, as well as regions that are characterized by H3K27ac and H3K4me3 marks, CTCF binding sites, ChIA-PET and RIP signals, and high levels of DSBs. The data suggest a strong link between chromosome breakage and several different mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of gene expression.
25278254,0,2014,Steroids,Steroidal pyrazolines and pyrazoles as potential 5α-reductase inhibitors: synthesis and biological evaluation.,Taking pregnenolone as the starting material, two series of pyrazolinyl and pyrazolyl pregnenolones were synthesized through different routes. The synthesis of the analogs of both series is multistep and proceeds in good overall yields. While the key step in the synthesis of pyrazolinyl pregnenolones is the heterocyclization of benzylidine derivatives (3) in presence of hydrazine hydrate, it is the condensation of 3β-hydroxy-21-hydroxymethylidenepregn-5-en-3β-ol-20-one (5) with phenylhydrazine in the synthesis of pyrazolyl derivatives. Compounds of both the series were tested for their 5α-reductase inhibitory activities. Amongst all the compounds screened for their 5α-reductase inhibitory activities, compound 4b, 4c and 6b were found to be the most active.
25277157,0,2014,Cent Nerv Syst Agents Med Chem,Molecular recognisation of 3a, 4-dihydro-3-H-indeno [1, 2-C] pyrazole-2- carboxamide/carbothioamide anticonvulsant analogues towards GABA-aminotransferase- an in silico approach.,Convulsion generally occurs as a result of the diminishing concentration of GABA below a threshold level in the brain. This degradation pathway of GABA is catalyzed by the γ-aminobutyric acid amino transferase. The objective of the current study is to propose the binding interaction of 3a, 4-Dihydro-3-H-indeno [1, 2-C] pyrazole-2-Carboxamide/ Carbothioamides anticonvulsant analogs with a three-dimensional structural model of the γ -aminobutyric acid amino transferase. For a flexible type of molecular docking, we proposed that these molecules could successfully bind to the active pocket of the enzyme with good predicted affinities in comparison to standard vigabatrin. In this series, 4b, 4c, 4i, 4f and 4a showed significant binding free energy of -9.64, -9.31, -9.01, -8.99 and -8.29 with predicted inhibitory constant values of 0.086, 0.149, 0.237, 0.257 and 0.831 µM, respectively.
25256486,0,2014,Carbohydr Polym,Facile synthesis of acyl chitosan isothiocyanates and their application to porphyrin-appended chitosan derivative.,Chitosan (1) was reacted with phenylisothiocyanate in 5% AcOH/H2O to give N-phenylthiocarbamoyl chitosan (2) with a degree of substitution (DS) of N-phenylthiocarbamoyl groups of 0.86 in 87.1% yield. The following acylation of compound 2 with hexanoyl chloride in the presence of pyridine afforded 3,6-di-O-2,3-hexanoyl chitosan isothiocyanate (4a) with a DS of the isothiocyanate groups of 0.70 in high yield, unexpectedly. Compound 4a exhibited high levels of reactivity toward various amines to give the corresponding N-thiocarbamoyl chitosan derivatives in high yields. Other acyl (decanoyl (4b), myristroyl (4c), stearoyl (4d), benzoyl (4e)) chitosan isothiocyanates were also prepared from chitosan (1) in high yields. To evaluate the potential applications of acyl chitosan isothiocyanates, N-(triphenylporphynyl)thiocarbamoyl chitosan derivative 6 with a DS of the triphenylporphynyl groups of 0.46 was prepared from compound 4b. The Langmuir-Blodgett monolayer film of compound 6 gave a good photon-to-electron conversion performance.
25254637,0,2014,Nat Commun,Two-dimensional layered transition metal disulphides for effective encapsulation of high-capacity lithium sulphide cathodes.,Fully lithiated lithium sulphide (Li2S) is currently being explored as a promising cathode material for emerging energy storage applications. Like their sulphur counterparts, Li2S cathodes require effective encapsulation to reduce the dissolution of intermediate lithium polysulphide (Li2Sn, n=4-8) species into the electrolyte. Here we report, the encapsulation of Li2S cathodes using two-dimensional layered transition metal disulphides that possess a combination of high conductivity and strong binding with Li2S/Li2Sn species. In particular, using titanium disulphide as an encapsulation material, we demonstrate a high specific capacity of 503 mAh g(-1)(Li2S) under high C-rate conditions (4C) as well as high areal capacity of 3.0 mAh cm(-2) under high mass-loading conditions (5.3 mg(Li2S) cm(-2)). This work opens up the new prospect of using transition metal disulphides instead of conventional carbon-based materials for effective encapsulation of high-capacity electrode materials.
25242386,0,2014,Int Immunopharmacol,Sendai virus C protein inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production through impairing interferon-β signaling.,The effect of Sendai virus (SeV) C protein on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production was examined using RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Infection of SeV inhibited LPS-induced NO production via downregulating the expression of an inducible NO synthase protein (iNOS). On the other hand, C gene-knockout 4C(-) SeV inhibited neither NO production nor iNOS expression. Wild type and 4C(-) SeV did not affect LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, and further LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Although wild type and 4C(-) SeV did not inhibit LPS-induced interferon (IFN)-β production, wild type SeV but not 4C(-) SeV inhibited the activation of STAT1/2 in the IFN-β signaling. SeV C protein inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO production. C protein inhibited the promotor activation of IFN-β and IFN-sensitive response element (ISRE) in response to LPS whereas the C mutant protein CF170S, which lacks the ability to block the STAT activation, did not inhibit it. Taken together, SeV C protein was suggested to inhibit LPS-induced NO production through impairing IFN-β signaling.
25233131,0,2014,Nano Lett,Activation with Li enables facile sodium storage in germanium.,Germanium is a promising sodium ion battery (NIB, NAB, SIB) anode material that is held back by its extremely sluggish kinetics and poor cyclability. We are the first to demonstrate that activation by a single lithiation-delithiation cycle leads to a dramatic improvement in the practically achievable capacity, in rate capability, and in cycling stability of Ge nanowires (GeNWs) and Ge thin film (GeTF). TEM and TOF-SIMS analysis shows that without activation, the initially single crystal GeNWs are effectively Na inactive, while the 100 nm amorphous GeTF sodiates only partially and inhomogeneously. Activation with Li induces amorphization in GeNWs reducing the barrier for nucleation of the NaxGe phase(s) and accelerates solid-state diffusion that aids the performance of both GeNWs and GeTF. Low rate (0.1C) Li activation also introduces a dense distribution of nanopores that lead to further improvements in the rate capability, which is ascribed to the lowered solid-state diffusion distances caused by the effective thinning of the Ge walls and by an additional Na diffusion path via the pore surfaces. The resultant kinetics are promising. Tested at 0.15C (1C = 369 mA/g, i.e. Na/Ge 1:1) for 50 cycles the GeNWs and GeTF maintain a reversible (desodiation) capacity of 346 and 418 mAh/g, respectively. They also demonstrate a capacity of 355 and 360 mAh/g at 1C and 284 and 310 mAh/g at 4C. Even at a very high rate of 10C the GeTF delivers 169 mAh/g. Preliminary results demonstrate that Li activation is also effective in promoting cycling stability of Sb blanket films.
25231765,0,2014,Echocardiography,Assessment of Quality of Fetal Heart Views by 3D/4D Ultrasonography Using Spatio-Temporal Image Correlation in the Second and Third Trimesters of Pregnancy.,OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of fetal heart views by three-dimensional/four-dimensional (3D/4D) ultrasonography using spatio-temporal image correlation (STIC) in the second and third trimester of pregnancy.METHODS: This prospective and cross-sectional study was conducted at a single referral service for the screening of congenital heart diseases (CHDs), with pregnant women at 20-30 weeks' gestation with a normal fetal heart. 3D/4D STIC were obtained from the fetal heart screening in the following views: four-chamber (4C), left and right ventricular outflow tracts (LVOT and RVOT), 3 vessels and trachea (3VT), aortic arch (AA), and ductal arch (DA). We categorized the images as satisfactory or unsatisfactory and performed McNemar's test to evaluate the differences between the two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography and 3D/4D STIC techniques. The inter-observer concordance was obtained by kappa coefficient.RESULTS: The rate of satisfactory fetal heart views using 3D/4D STIC was 54% by using 4 planes (4C, RVOT, LVOT, and 3VT) and 14% by using 6 planes (4C, RVOT, LVOT, 3VT, AA, and DA). In contrast, 100% of the 2D echocardiography images were satisfactory (McNemar's test, P &lt; 0.001). We observed moderate inter-observer concordance to both 4- and 6 planes (κ = 0.56 and 0.43, respectively).CONCLUSION: The quality of the main fetal heart views by 3D/4D STIC still present some limitations compared with the 2D echocardiography.
25231096,0,2014,Echocardiography,Best method for right atrial volume assessment by two-dimensional echocardiography: validation with magnetic resonance imaging.,AIM: Echocardiographic methods for estimating right atrial (RA) volume have not been standardized. Our aim was to evaluate two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic methods of RA volume assessment, using RA volume by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the reference.METHODS AND RESULTS: Right atrial volume was assessed in 51 patients (mean age 63 ± 14 years, 33 female) who underwent comprehensive 2D echocardiography and cardiac MRI for clinically indicated reasons. Echocardiographic RA volume methods included (1) biplane area length, using four-chamber view twice (biplane 4C-4C); (2) biplane area length, using four-chamber and subcostal views (biplane 4C-subcostal); and (3) single plane Simpson's method of disks (Simpson's). Echocardiographic RA volumes as well as linear RA major and minor dimensions were compared to RA volume by MRI using correlation and Bland-Altman methods, and evaluated for inter-observer reproducibility and accuracy in discriminating RA enlargement. All echocardiography volumetric methods performed well compared to MRI, with Pearson's correlation of 0.98 and concordance correlation ≥0.91 for each. For bias and limits of agreement, biplane 4C-4C (bias -4.81 mL/m(2) , limits of agreement ±9.8 mL/m(2) ) and Simpson's (bias -5.15 mL/m(2) , limits of agreement ±10.1 mL/m(2) ) outperformed biplane 4C-subcostal (bias -8.36 mL/m(2) , limits of agreement ±12.5 mL/m(2) ). Accuracy for discriminating RA enlargement was higher for all volumetric methods than for linear measurements. Inter-observer variability was satisfactory across all methods.CONCLUSIONS: Compared to MRI, biplane 4C-4C and single plane Simpson's are highly accurate and reproducible 2D echocardiography methods for estimating RA volume. Linear dimensions are inaccurate and should be abandoned.
25207570,0,2014,J Appl Clin Med Phys,Dose differences between the three dose calculation algorithms in Leksell GammaPlan.,The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dose differences introduced by the TMR 10 and the convolution dose calculation algorithms in GammaPlan version 10, as compared to the TMR classic algorithm in the previous versions of GammaPlan. Computed axial tomographic images of a polystyrene phantom and a human head were acquired using a GE LightSpeed VCT scanner. A treatment target with a prescription dose of 20 Gy to 50% isodose line was defined in the phantom or the head CT set. The treatment times for single collimator, single shot placements were calculated using the three dose calculation algorithms in GammaPlan version 10. Four comparative studies were conducted: i) the dose matrix position was varied every 10 mm along the x-, y-, z-axes of the stereotactic coordinate system inside the phantom and the treatment times were compared on each matrix for the three collimators of the Gamma Knife Perfexion and the four collimators of the 4C;ii) the study was repeated for the human head CT dataset; iii) the matrix position was varied every 20 mm in the X and the Y directions on the central slice (Z = 100mm) of the head CT and the shot times were compared on each matrix for the 8 mm collimator of both units; a total of 51 matrix positions were identified for each unit; iv) the above comparison was repeated for the head CT transverse slices with Z = 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 140, and 160 mm. A total of 271 matrix positions were studied. Based on the comparison of the treatment times needed to deliver 20 Gy at 50% isodose line, the equivalent TMR classic dose of the TMR 10 algorithm is roughly a constant for each collimator of the 4C unit and is 97.5%, 98.5%, 98%, and 100% of the TMR 10 dose for the 18 mm, 14 mm, 8 mm, and the 4 mm collimators, respectively. The numbers for the three collimators of the Perfexion change with the shot positions in the range from 99% to 102% for both the phantom and the head CT. The minimum, maximum, and the mean values of the equivalent TMR classic doses of the convolution algorithm on the 271 voxels of the head CT are 99.5%, 111.5%, 106.5% of the convolution dose for the Perfexion, and 99%, 109%, 104.5% for the 4C unit. We identified a maximum decrease in delivered dose of 11.5% for treatment in the superior frontal/parietal vertex region of the head CT for older calculations lacking inhomogeneity correction to account for the greater percentage of the average beam path occupied by bone. The differences in the inferior temporal lobe and the cerebellum/neck regions are significantly less, owing to the counter-balancing effects of both bone and the air cavity inhomogeneities. The dose differences between the TMR 10 and the TMR classic are within ± 2.5% for a single shot placement on both Perfexion and 4C. Dose prescriptions based on the experiences with the TMR classic may need to be adjusted to accommodate the up to 11.5% difference between the convolution and the TMR classic.
25207406,0,2014,J Appl Clin Med Phys,A simple method to prolong the service life of radioactive sources for external radiotherapy.,A radioactive source is usually replaced and disposed after being used for a certain amount of time (usually a half-life). In this study, a simple method is proposed to prolong its service life. Instead of replacing the used source with a new source of full activity, a new source of less activity is added in the source holder in front of the used one, so that the total activity of two sources is equal to the initial activity of the used source or even higher. Similarly, more sources can be added to the previous ones. Attenuation of front source(s) to the back source(s) was evaluated with exponential attenuation equation, and variation of source-focus distance (SFD) with inverse square law for Leksell 4C Gamma Knife, which served as an example of external radiotherapy units. When the number of front sources increased from 1 to 3, the relative air kerma decreased from 36.5% to 5.0%. Both the attenuation effect and SFD variation contributed to the decrease in air kerma, with the former being the major factor. If the height of the source can be decreased in some way, such as increasing the specific activity of sources, the sources can be used more efficiently. The method prolongs the service life of sources by several factors, and reduces the expense of source exchange and reclamation.
25188690,0,2014,Dalton Trans,1,3,5-Triferrocenyl-2,4,6-tris(ethynylferrocenyl)-benzene--a new member of the family of multiferrocenyl-functionalized cyclic systems.,The consecutive synthesis of 1,3,5-triferrocenyl-2,4,6-tris(ethynylferrocenyl)benzene (6c) is described using 1,3,5-Cl3-2,4,6-I3-C6 (2) as starting compound. Subsequent Sonogashira C,C cross-coupling of 2 with FcC≡CH (3) in the molar ratio of 1:4 afforded solely 1,3,5-Cl3-2,4,6-(FcC≡C)3-C6 (4c) (Fc = Fe(η(5)-C5H4)(η(5)-C5H5)). However, when 2 is reacted with 3 in a 1:3 ratio a mixture of 1,3,5-Cl3-2-(FcC≡C)-4,6-I2-C6 (4a) and 1,3,5-Cl3-2,4-(FcC≡C)2-6-I-C6 (4b) is obtained. Negishi C,C cross-coupling of 4c with FcZnCl (5) in the presence of catalytic amounts of [Pd(CH2C(CH3)2P(tC4H9)2)(μ-Cl)]2 gave 1,3-Cl2-5-Fc-2,4,6-(FcC≡C)3-C6 (6a), 1-Cl-3,5-Fc2-2,4,6-(FcC≡C)3-C6 (6b) and 1,3,5-Fc3-2,4,6-(FcC≡C)3-C6 (6c) of which 6b is the main product. Column chromatography allowed the separation of these organometallic species. The structures of 4a,b and 6a in the solid state were determined by single crystal X-ray diffractometry showing a π–π interacting dimer (4b) and a complex π–π pattern for 6a. The electrochemical properties of 4a–c and 6a–c were studied by cyclic voltammetry (=CV) and square wave voltammetry (=SWV). It was found that the FcC≡C-substituted benzenes 4a–c show only one reversible redox event, indicating a simultaneous oxidation of all ferrocenyl units, whereby 4c is most difficult to oxidise (4a, E°′1 = 190, ΔEp = 71; 4b, E°′1 = 195, ΔEp = 59; 4c, E°′1 = 390, ΔEp = 59 mV). In case of 4c, the oxidation states 4c(n+) (n = 2, 3) are destabilised by the partial negative charge of the electronegative chlorine atoms, which compensates the repulsive electrostatic Fc+–Fc+ interactions with attractive electrostatic Fc+–Cl(δ−) interactions. When ferrocenyl units are directly attached to the benzene C6 core, organometallic 6a shows three, 6b five and 6c six separated reversible waves highlighting that the Fc units can separately be oxidised. UV-Vis/NIR spectroscopy allowed to determine IVCT absorptions (=Inter Valence Charge Transfer) for 6c(n+) (n = 1, 2) (n = 1: νmax = 7860 cm(−1), εmax = 405 L mol(−1) cm(−1), Δν1/2 = 7070 cm(−1); n = 2: νmax = 9070 cm(−1), εmax = 620 L mol(−1) cm(−1), Δν1/2 = 8010 cm(−1)) classifying these mixed-valent species as weakly coupled class II systems according to Robin and Day, while for 6a,b only LMCT transitions (=ligand to metal charge transfer) could be detected.
25188601,0,2014,Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Optimal radiographical criteria after selective thoracic fusion for patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with a C lumbar modifier: does adherence to current guidelines predict success?,STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospective data.OBJECTIVE: To define optimal postoperative coronal parameters after selective thoracic fusions (STFs) and to test these parameters against recommended criteria for when to perform an STF.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have provided recommendations for when STF should be performed; however, clear parameters for target outcomes are lacking.METHODS: Patients with Lenke 1C to 4C curves with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis from a multicenter database who underwent STF with minimum 2 years of follow-up were included. Postoperative parameters included lumbar Cobb angle, trunk shift, coronal balance, percent lumbar correction, and deformity-flexibility quotient. First, the upper 95% confidence interval for each parameter was calculated (queried data threshold) and set as the limit of &quot;optimal&quot; outcomes. Second, an independent surgeon survey was performed, and in patients with unanimous surgeon agreement of &quot;success,&quot; the upper 95% confidence interval was determined (surgeon-derived threshold). Scoliosis Research Society-22 scores were compared between those above and below these 2 thresholds. Then, these outcomes were used to determine whether adherence to, or disregard for, previously published guidelines for STF were predictive of final outcome.RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were analyzed. Target postoperative parameters as determined by the queried data and surgeon-derived thresholds were similar and rounded to: deformity-flexibility quotient less than 4, lumbar Cobb angle less than 26°, lumbar correction more than 37%, coronal balance 2 cm or less, and trunk shift less than 1.5 cm. Patients within target parameters had significantly better Scoliosis Research Society-22 satisfaction scores. Neither preoperative apical vertebral translation ratio more than 1.2 nor Cobb angle ratio more than 1.2 predicted 2-year success. Preoperative lumbar curve less than 45° and lumbar bend less than 25° were associated with increased likelihood of optimal outcomes.CONCLUSION: Optimal postoperative outcomes for STF should include a lumbar Cobb angle less than 26°, coronal balance 2 cm or less, deformity-flexibility quotient less than 4, lumbar correction more than 37%, and trunk shift less than 1.5 cm. These findings suggest that performing an STF in patients with a preoperative lumbar Cobb angle less than 45° or a preoperative lumbar bend less than 25° will increase one's chances of success.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.
25184519,0,2014,Dalton Trans,Phosphinimine-substituted boranes and borenium ions.,The phosphinimines R3PNSiMe3 (R = t-Bu: 1a, R = Cy: 1b, R = Et: 1c, R = Ph: 1d) are reacted with a series of chloro and fluoroboranes (9Cl-9-BBN, (C6F5)2BCl, PhBCl2 and Mes2BF) to access a family of phosphinimine-substituted boranes (2a-d, 3b-d, 4c,d and 6a,b) via Me3SiX elimination (X = Cl, F). The steric and electronic factors governing the formation of monomeric or dimeric products (7c,d) are presented. In addition, in some cases a Lewis acid mediated exchange of Si-bonded methyl groups for a chloro-substituent was observed (5a,b). Based on the phosphinimine-substituted boranes, a series of borenium ion salts (8b-d, 9c, 10b-d) was prepared upon reaction with MeOTf. All compounds were fully characterized and a number of molecular structures were determined by X-ray diffraction.
25174364,0,2014,Yakugaku Zasshi,[Synthesis and structure of silver(I) coordination polymers with bis(pyridyl) ligands linked by an aromatic sulfonamide].,Aromatic sulfonamides exist in a synclinal conformation with the twisted structure arising from rotation around the S-N bond in both the solid state and in solution. Simple bidentate ligands containing the sulfonamide moiety can be extended to form elongated ligands, and optically active components can be added to form a versatile building block for the construction of coordination polymers with many structures. Mixing the simple ligands 1 and 2 and the elongated ligands 3 and 4 with different Ag(I) salts yielded the corresponding complexes [Ag(1)OTf]n (1a), [Ag(2)]n•nOTf(2a), [Ag(3)OTf]n (3a), [Ag(3)]n•nBF₄ (3b), [Ag(4)CH₃CN]n•nBF₄•nCHCl₃ (4b), and [Ag(4)]n•nSbF₆•nCH₄O (4c). Straight chains and racemic helical polymers were observed in the crystal structure of complexes 1a and 2a, respectively. In the crystal structures of complexes 3a and 4b, infinite 1D straight chains containing a T-shaped coordination geometry about the Ag(I) centers were formed by the reaction of ligands 3 or 4 with Ag(I) salts in CH₃CN/CHCl₃. A continuous 1D coordination polymer containing a racemic mixture of left- and right-handed helices formed in the crystal structure of complex 3b. Furthermore, a layered coordination polymer consisting of a racemic mixture of left- and right-handed polymers was observed from the crystal structure of complex 4c. The construction of optically pure left- or right-handed 1D helical polymers via the introduction of chiral functional groups on the nitrogen atom of the sulfonamide ligand is currently under investigation in our laboratory.
25160741,0,2014,Eur J Pharmacol,Phosphodiesterase isoenzymes in the human urethra: a molecular biology and functional study.,Experimental and clinical studies have suggested a role for phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes in the control of the human lower urinary tract. This study aimed to investigate the expression of PDE isoenzymes and the effects of PDE inhibitors (PDE-Is) in isolated human urethral smooth muscle (USM). The expression of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) specifically encoding for PDE isoenzymes and isoforms (1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 5A and 11A) was analyzed by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using a tissue bath technique, the effects of vinpocetine (PDE1-I), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine hydrochloride (EHNA-HCl=MEP1) (PDE2-I), rolipram (PDE4-I), sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil (PDE5-Is) (0.01-10µM) on the tension of USM induced by norepinephrine were investigated. The production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) was measured by means of radioimmunoassays. RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of PDE1B, PDE1C, PDE4A, PDE4C, PDE4D, PDE5A and PDE11A. The tension induced by norepinephrine (NE) was reversed by the PDE inhibitors with the following rank order of efficacy: rolipram (mean: -39%)≥sildenafil (-35%)&gt;vardenafil (-26%)&gt;tadalafil (-20%)&gt;vinpocetine (-16%)&gt;MEP1 (-2%). The relaxing effects of the drugs were paralleled by an elevation in tissue levels of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. Selective inhibitors of PDE4 and PDE5 can antagonize the tension induced by alpha-adrenergic stimulation of USM. PDE inhibition might represent an interesting option to facilitate the relaxation of the human outflow region.
25157198,0,2014,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Internal dose to active marrow and endosteum from radioactive iodine.,This study analyses the active marrow and endosteum dose differences between the new International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) male and female reference computational phantoms and the stylised phantom for two thyroid agents. The active marrow and endosteum doses from (131)I and (123)I were calculated for 0-55 % maximum thyroid uptakes using the MCNP-4C Monte Carlo code. The biokinetic models were taken from ICRP Publication 53. To evaluate the absorbed doses to red marrow and endosteum, the deposited energy was determined for the 19 spongiosa regions and 6 medullary cavities and was mass weighted using the mass fractions available in ICRP Publication 116. The results were then compared with the published values given in ICRP Publication 53. The poor anatomic realism of the stylised phantom used in ICRP Publication 53 leads to important dose differences between the ICRP voxel phantoms and the stylised phantom. The influence of the use of different bone material was also investigated. Underestimations of ∼60% were observed for active marrow doses of the stylised phantom compared with reference voxel phantoms. The results highlight the importance of the accuracy of the shape and inter-organ distances of the anthropomorphic model used.
25151170,0,2014,Methods Mol Biol,DamID as an approach to studying long-distance chromatin interactions.,How transcription is controlled by distally located cis-regulatory elements is an active area of research in biology. As such, there have been many techniques developed to probe these long-distance chromatin interactions. Here, we focus on one such method, called DamID (van Steensel and Henikoff, Nat Biotechnol 18(4):424-428, 2000). While other methods like 3C (Dekker et al., Science 295(5558):1306-1311, 2002), 4C (Simonis et al., Nat Genet 38(11):1348-1354, 2006; Zhao et al., Nat Genet 38(11):1341-1347, 2006), and 5C (Dostie et al., Genome Res 16(10):1299-1309, 2006) are undoubtedly powerful, the DamID method can offer some advantages over these methods if the genetic locus can be easily modified. The lack of tissue fixation, the low amounts of starting material required to perform the experiment, and the relatively modest hardware requirements make DamID experiments an interesting alternative to consider when examining long-distance chromatin interactions.
25149248,0,2014,Pestic Biochem Physiol,Insecticidal, repellent and fungicidal properties of novel trifluoromethylphenyl amides.,Twenty trifluoromethylphenyl amides were synthesized and evaluated as fungicides and as mosquito toxicants and repellents. Against Aedes aegypti larvae, N-(2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3,5-dinitrobenzamide (1e) was the most toxic compound (24 h LC50 1940 nM), while against adults N-(2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide (1c) was most active (24 h LD50 19.182 nM, 0.5 μL/insect). However, the 24 h LC50 and LD50 values of fipronil against Ae. aegypti larvae and adults were significantly lower: 13.55 nM and 0.787 × 10(-4) nM, respectively. Compound 1c was also active against Drosophila melanogaster adults with 24 h LC50 values of 5.6 and 4.9 μg/cm(2) for the Oregon-R and 1675 strains, respectively. Fipronil had LC50 values of 0.004 and 0.017 μg/cm(2) against the two strains of D. melanogaster, respectively. In repellency bioassays against female Ae. aegypti, 2,2,2-trifluoro-N-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)acetamide (4c) had the highest repellent potency with a minimum effective dosage (MED) of 0.039 μmol/cm(2) compared to DEET (MED of 0.091 μmol/cm(2)). Compound N-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)hexanamide (4a) had an MED of 0.091 μmol/cm(2) which was comparable to DEET. Compound 4c was the most potent fungicide against Phomopsis obscurans. Several trends were discerned between the structural configuration of these molecules and the effect of structural changes on toxicity and repellency. Para- or meta- trifluoromethylphenyl amides with an aromatic ring attached to the carbonyl carbon showed higher toxicity against Ae. aegypti larvae, than ortho- trifluoromethylphenyl amides. Ortho- trifluoromethylphenyl amides with trifluoromethyl or alkyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon produced higher repellent activity against female Ae. aegypti and Anopheles albimanus than meta- or para- trifluoromethylphenyl amides. The presence of 2,6-dichloro- substitution on the phenyl ring of the amide had an influence on larvicidal and repellent activity of para- trifluoromethylphenyl amides.
25147148,0,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis of novel 1,2,4-triazoles, triazolothiadiazines and triazolothiadiazoles as potential anticancer agents.,A series of new N-substituted-3-mercapto-1,2,4-triazoles (3a,b and 7a-d), triazolo[1,3,4]thiadiazines (5a,b) and triazolo[1,3,4]thiadiazoles (4a-d, 6 and 8a-d) have been synthesized starting from isonicotinic acid hydrazide. The structure of the newly synthesized compounds was confirmed on the basis of their spectral data and elemental analyses. All the compounds were screened for their in vitro anticancer activity against 6 human cancer cell lines and normal fibroblasts. Seven of the tested compounds (3a,b, 4c, 5a and 8b-d) exhibited significant cytotoxicity against most cell lines. Among these derivatives compound 4c exhibited equivalent cytotoxic effect to the standard CHS 828 against gastric cancer cell line (IC50 = 25 nM). Normal fibroblast cells (WI38) were affected to a much lesser extent (IC50 &gt; 10,000 nM).
25146886,0,2014,Plant J,Altered expression of Aurora kinases in Arabidopsis results in aneu- and polyploidization.,Aurora is an evolutionary conserved protein kinase family involved in monitoring of chromosome segregation via phosphorylation of different substrates. In plants, however, the involvement of Aurora proteins in meiosis and in sensing microtubule attachment remains to be proven, although the downstream components leading to the targeting of spindle assembly checkpoint signals to anaphase-promoting complex have been described. To analyze the three members of Aurora family (AtAurora1, -2, and -3) of Arabidopsis we employed different combinations of T-DNA insertion mutants and/or RNAi transformants. Meiotic defects and the formation of unreduced pollen were revealed including plants with an increased ploidy level. The effect of reduced expression of Aurora was mimicked by application of the ATP-competitive Aurora inhibitor II. In addition, strong overexpression of any member of the AtAurora family is not possible. Only tagged or truncated forms of Aurora kinases can be overexpressed. Expression of truncated AtAurora1 resulted in a high number of aneuploids in Arabidopsis, while expression of AtAurora1-TAPi construct in tobacco resulted in 4C (possible tetraploid) progeny. In conclusion, our data demonstrate an essential role of Aurora kinases in the monitoring of meiosis in plants.
25145936,0,2014,J Am Soc Nephrol,Urinary tract effects of HPSE2 mutations.,Urofacial syndrome (UFS) is an autosomal recessive congenital disease featuring grimacing and incomplete bladder emptying. Mutations of HPSE2, encoding heparanase 2, a heparanase 1 inhibitor, occur in UFS, but knowledge about the HPSE2 mutation spectrum is limited. Here, seven UFS kindreds with HPSE2 mutations are presented, including one with deleted asparagine 254, suggesting a role for this amino acid, which is conserved in vertebrate orthologs. HPSE2 mutations were absent in 23 non-neurogenic neurogenic bladder probands and, of 439 families with nonsyndromic vesicoureteric reflux, only one carried a putative pathogenic HPSE2 variant. Homozygous Hpse2 mutant mouse bladders contained urine more often than did wild-type organs, phenocopying human UFS. Pelvic ganglia neural cell bodies contained heparanase 1, heparanase 2, and leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains-2 (LRIG2), which is mutated in certain UFS families. In conclusion, heparanase 2 is an autonomic neural protein implicated in bladder emptying, but HPSE2 variants are uncommon in urinary diseases resembling UFS.
25142415,0,2014,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),An elegant microwave assisted one-pot synthesis of di(α-aminophosphonate) pesticides.,A new class of di(α-aminophosphonate) pesticides were prepared by the Kabachnik-Fields reaction under solvent- and catalyst-free conditions with microwave irradiation, and the products were obtained in good-to-excellent yields at shorter reaction time. These compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H, (13)C, (31)P NMR, and mass spectral data. Among them, compounds 4f, 4c, and 4h showed good pesticidal activity against Spodoptera litura, with 92.6, 91.3, and 89.3% mortality.
25133852,0,2014,Radiology,Malignancy risk stratification in thyroid nodules with nondiagnostic results at cytologic examination: combination of thyroid imaging reporting and data system and the Bethesda System.,PURPOSE: To evaluate the malignancy risks of thyroid nodules with nondiagnostic results at ultrasonography (US)-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy ( FNAB fine-needle aspiration biopsy ) and the criteria for selecting those for repeat US-guided FNAB fine-needle aspiration biopsy according to the thyroid imaging reporting and data system ( TIRADS thyroid imaging reporting and data system ).MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. Five hundred forty-eight nondiagnostic nodules were included. US features of internal composition, echogenicity, margin, calcifications, shape, and vascularity were evaluated, and thyroid nodules were classified according to TIRADS thyroid imaging reporting and data system . TIRADS thyroid imaging reporting and data system category 3 included nodules without any suspicious features of solidity, hypoechogenicity or marked hypoechogenicity, microlobulated or irregular margins, microcalcifications, and taller-than-wide shape. Categories 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 included nodules with one, two, three or four, or five suspicious US features. The malignancy risk was calculated.RESULTS: Of the 548 nodules, 40 (7.3%) were malignant and 508 (92.7%) were benign. The malignancy risks of categories 3 and 4a nodules were 0.8% and 1.8%, respectively, whereas the malignancy risks of categories 4b, 4c, and 5 nodules were 6.1%, 14.4%, and 31%. In the 294 nodules larger than 10 mm, the malignancy risks of categories 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 nodules were 0.9%, 1.3%, 0%, 15%, and 33%, respectively. In the 254 nodules measuring 10 mm or smaller, the malignancy risks of categories 3, 4a 4b, 4c, and 5 nodules were 0%, 2.7%, 14%, 14.3%, and 31%.CONCLUSION: Nondiagnostic thyroid nodules without suspicious US features and those with one suspicious feature can be followed up with US, but nondiagnostic nodules with two or more suspicious features should undergo repeat US-guided FNAB fine-needle aspiration biopsy.
25130070,0,2014,Chem Biol Drug Des,PEG mediated synthesis and biological evaluation of asymmetrical pyrazole curcumin analogues as potential analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents.,The new series of asymmetrical pyrazole curcumin analogues 4a-g were synthesized by using polyethylene glycol (PEG-400) as a green reaction medium and evaluated for their in vivo analgesic and in vitro antioxidant (H2 O2 , DPPH, Ferrous reducing power and Nitric oxide scavenging activity) and anti-inflammatory activities. All the compounds synthesized 4a-g showed the potential to demonstrate analgesic activity as compared to the standard ibuprofen. Among the tested series, compounds 4e and 4b exhibited good hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity as compared to the standard butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT). Compounds 4b, 4d, 4f, and 4g showed good DPPH free radical scavenging activity. Compounds 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e and 4g showed excellent ferrous-reducing power activity, whereas all the compounds showed better nitric oxide scavenging activity than standard ascorbic acid. Additionally, all the synthesized compounds were also screened for their in vitro anti-inflammatory activity. Compounds 4b, 4d, 4f and 4g showed good anti-inflammatory activity as compared to standard diclofenac sodium.
25119877,0,2014,Curr Gastroenterol Rep,Fecal impaction.,Fecal impaction (FI) is a common and potentially serious medical condition that occurs in all age groups. Children, incapacitated patients, and the institutionalized elderly are considered the highest at-risk populations. FI usually occurs in the setting of chronic or severe constipation, anatomic anorectal abnormalities, and neurogenic or functional gastrointestinal disorders. Generally, FI is a preventable disorder, and early recognition is important, as it is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and high health care costs. Evaluation with a careful history and physical examination, in conjunction with radiologic imaging, such as an acute abdominal series or computed tomography (CT), is imperative. Prompt identification and treatment minimize the risk of complications attributable to FI, which may include bowel obstruction leading to stercoral ulcer, perforation, peritonitis, or cardiopulmonary collapse with hemodynamic instability. Treatment options include manual fragmentation and extraction of the fecal mass, distal colonic cleansing using enemas and rectal lavage with the aid of a sigmoidoscope, and/or using water-soluble contrast media such as Gastrografin to both identify the extent of the impaction and aid in cleansing and removal. Surgical resection of the involved colon or rectum is reserved for peritonitis resulting from bowel perforation. Since recurrence is common, implementing preventive measures such as increasing daily water and fiber intake, limiting medications that decrease colonic motility, using secretagogues or prokinetic agents, and treating underlying anatomic defects are highly important.
25116598,0,2014,J Agric Food Chem,Small changes result in large differences: discovery of (-)-incrustoporin derivatives as novel antiviral and antifungal agents.,On the basis of the structure of natural product (-)-incrustoporin (1), a series of lactone compounds 4a-i and 5a-i were designed and synthesized from nitroolefin. The antiviral and antifungal activities of these compounds were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The small changes between 4 and 5 at the 3,4-position result in large differences in bioactivities. Compounds 4 exhibited significantly higher antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) than dehydro compounds 5. However, the antifungal activity of 4 is relatively lower than that of 5. Compounds 4a, 4c, and 4i with excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity emerged as new antiviral lead compounds. Compounds 5d-g showed superiority over the commercial fungicides chlorothalonil and carbendazim against Cercospora arachidicola Hor at 50 mg kg(-1). The present study provides fundamental support for the development and optimization of (-)-incrustoporin derivatives as potential inhibitors of plant virus and pathogenic fungi.
25095733,0,2014,Vet Parasitol,Fluorescent ester dye-based assays for the in vitro measurement of Neospora caninum proliferation.,Techniques for the measurement of parasite loads in different experimental models have evolved throughout the years. The quantification of stained slides using regular cytological stains is currently the most common technique. However, this modality of evaluation is labor-intensive, and the interpretation of the results is subjective because the successes of the assays mainly rely on the abilities of the professionals involved. Moreover, the novel genetic manipulation techniques that are commonly applied for closely related Toxoplasma gondii have not yet been developed for Neospora caninum. Thus, we aimed to develop a simple protocol for parasite quantification using pre-stained N. caninum tachyzoites and fluorescent probes based on ester compounds (i.e., CFSE and DDAO). For this purpose, we employed a quantification procedure based on flow cytometry analysis. Pre-stained parasites were also examined with a fluorescent microscope, which revealed that both dyes were detectable. Direct comparison of the numbers of CFSE+ and DDAO+ cells to the values obtained with classical cytology techniques yielded statistically comparable results that also accorded with genomic DNA amplification results. Although the fluorescence emitted by DDAO was more intense and provided better discrimination between the populations of parasitized cells, CFSE+ tachyzoites were detected for several days. In conclusion, this study describes a simple, fast, low-cost and reproducible protocol for N. caninum quantification that is based on parasite pre-staining with fluorescent ester-based probes.
25091928,0,2014,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of non-peptidic antagonists of neuropilin-1 receptor.,Neuropilins (NRPs) are VEGF-A165 co-receptors over-expressed in tumor cells, and considered as targets in angiogenic-related pathologies. We previously identified compound 1, the first non-peptidic antagonist of the VEGF-A165/NRP binding, which exhibits in vivo anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities. We report here the synthesis and biological evaluations of new antagonists structurally-related to compound 1. Among these molecules, 4a, 4c and 4d show cytotoxic effects on HUVEC and MDA-MB-31 cells, and antagonize VEGF-A165/NRP-1 binding. This study confirmed our key structure-activity relationships hypothesis and paved the way to compound 1 'hit to lead' optimization.
25089949,0,2014,Mar Drugs,Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel 3-alkylpyridine marine alkaloid analogs with promising anticancer activity.,Cancer continues to be one of the most important health problems worldwide, and the identification of novel drugs and treatments to address this disease is urgent. During recent years, marine organisms have proven to be a promising source of new compounds with action against tumoral cell lines. Here, we describe the synthesis and anticancer activity of eight new 3-alkylpyridine alkaloid (3-APA) analogs in four steps and with good yields. The key step for the synthesis of these compounds is a Williamson etherification under phase-transfer conditions. We investigated the influence of the length of the alkyl chain attached to position 3 of the pyridine ring on the cytotoxicity of these compounds. Biological assays demonstrated that compounds with an alkyl chain of ten carbon atoms (4c and 5c) were the most active against two tumoral cell lines: RKO-AS-45-1 and HeLa. Micronucleus and TUNEL assays showed that both compounds are mutagenic and induce apoptosis. In addition, Compound 5c altered the cellular actin cytoskeleton in RKO-AS-45-1 cells. The results suggest that Compounds 4c and 5c may be novel prototype anticancer agents.
25089762,0,2014,Inorg Chem,Practical synthesis of 1,12-difunctionalized o-carborane for the investigation of polar liquid crystals.,Two isomerically pure 1,12-difunctionalized derivatives of o-carborane, 12-iodo-1-vinyl (1b) and 12-iodo-1-phenyl (1c), are conveniently obtained on a practical scale in yields of 22% and 32%, respectively, by monoiodination of the corresponding o-carborane derivatives (4b and 4c) followed by separation of the regioisomers by crystallization (1b) and chromatography (1c). Subsequent functional group transformations gave access to other derivatives, including two liquid-crystalline compounds, in which o-carborane is a linear structural element. Regioselectivity of substitution on the carborane cage and on the benzene ring correlates with the inductive effect parameter of the substituent. The preparation of analogous derivatives of m-carborane was also investigated.

25078313,0,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of andrographolide analogues as anti-cancer agents.,A new family of andrographolide analogues were synthesized and screened in vitro against kidney (HEK-293) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells. The anti-cancer effects of the active analogues (2b, 2c and 4c) were determined by multiple cell based assays such as MTT, immunostaining, FACS, western blotting and transcriptional inhibition of NF-κB activity. Importantly, these compounds were found to possess higher anti-cancer potency than andrographolide and low toxicity to normal (VERO and MCF-10A) cells. Increased level of Bax/Bcl-xL ratio, caspase 3, and sub G1 population, higher expression level of tumor suppressor protein p53 and lower expression level of NF-κB suggested potent apoptotic property of the active analogues. Data revealed that the andrographolide derivative-mediated cell death in cancer cells was p53 dependent.
25077906,0,2014,Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Could structural and noncompensatory Lenke 3 and 4C lumbar curves be nonstructural and compensatory? Lenke 1, 2, 3, and 4 curve types were similar and could be considered collectively as a single indication for selective thoracic fusion.,STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective radiographical review.OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that the structural and noncompensatory Lenke 3 and 4C lumbar curves could be nonstructural and compensatory.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Historically, Lenke 3 and 4C curves were not recommended for selective thoracic fusion (STF) because the lumbar curve was considered structural and noncompensatory. However, consecutive series of Lenke 3 and 4C curves suggest successful treatment with STF.METHODS: Between 2001 and 2004, 2005 and 2008, and 2010 and 2012, 3 consecutive series of 108, 134, and 78 surgically treated Lenke 1, 2, 3, and 4C curves were reviewed, respectively. The coronal curve criteria for the curves treated with STF during each period were lumbar side bending Cobb angle less than 25° and meeting the Lenke ratio criteria, lumbar side bending Cobb angle 35° or less, and lumbar side bending Cobb angle 45° or less, respectively. The sagittal curve criteria for STF during each period was absence of junctional thoracolumbar kyphosis 20° or more between T10 and L2. The technique used for STF was the Guan-Din method. Radiographs of all the curves treated with STF were analyzed before and after surgery.RESULTS: Optimal instrumented thoracic and compensatory lumbar correction was obtained for all Lenke 1, 2, 3, and 4C curves treated with STF in each period. As the coronal criteria for STF were broadened, the extent of feasibility of STF was expanded and the rate of STF increased. Although Cobb angle, apical vertebral translation, and apical vertebral rotation magnitudes of Lenke 3 and 4C curves were larger and more severe than those of Lenke 1 and 2C curves, optimal compensatory correction could still be obtained for Lenke 3 and 4C curves.CONCLUSION: The structural and noncompensatory Lenke 3 and 4C lumbar curves were proven to be nonstructural and compensatory. Lenke 1, 2, 3, and 4C curves have similar natures and similar responses to the same technique (Guan-Din method) used for STF and could be considered collectively as a single indication for STF. The extent of feasibility of STF could be expanded from Lenke 1 and 2 curves to Lenke 1, 2, 3, and 4 curves.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.
25071784,0,2014,Front Immunol,Communication between Human Dendritic Cell Subsets in Tuberculosis: Requirements for Naive CD4(+) T Cell Stimulation.,Human primary dendritic cells (DCs) are heterogeneous by phenotype, function, and tissue localization and distinct from inflammatory monocyte-derived DCs. Current information regarding the susceptibility and functional role of primary human DC subsets to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is limited. Here, we dissect the response of different primary DC subsets to Mtb infection. Myeloid CD11c(+) cells and pDCs (C-type lectin 4C(+) cells) were located in human lymph nodes (LNs) of tuberculosis (TB) patients by histochemistry. Rare CD141(hi) DCs (C-type lectin 9A(+) cells) were also identified. Infection with live Mtb revealed a higher responsiveness of myeloid CD1c(+) DCs compared to CD141(hi) DCs and pDCs. CD1c(+) DCs produced interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-1β but not IL-12p70, a cytokine important for Th1 activation and host defenses against Mtb. Yet, CD1c(+) DCs were able to activate autologous naïve CD4(+) T cells. By combining cell purification with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and gene expression profiling on rare cell populations, we detected in responding CD4(+) T cells, genes related to effector-cytolytic functions and transcription factors associated with Th1, Th17, and Treg polarization, suggesting multifunctional properties in our experimental conditions. Finally, immunohistologic analyses revealed contact between CD11c(+) cells and pDCs in LNs of TB patients and in vitro data suggest that cooperation between Mtb-infected CD1c(+) DCs and pDCs favors stimulation of CD4(+) T cells.
25063943,0,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Cyclopalladated primary amines: a preliminary study of antiproliferative activity through apoptosis induction.,Twelve cyclometallated palladium(II) complexes containing primary aromatic amines [benzylamine (a), (R)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine (b) and 2-phenylaniline (c)] as anionic bidentate (C,N)(-) ligands have been evaluated against a panel of human adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549 lung, MDA-MB231 and MCF7 breast, and the cisplatin resistant HCT116 colon). The results revealed a remarkable antiproliferative activity of the triphenylphosphane mononuclear compounds 3-4 (series a, b, c) and the best inhibition was provided for 3c and 4c with the 2-phenylaniline ligand and a six membered chelate ring. Interestingly, 3c and 4c were 14 and 19 times more potent than cisplatin for the inhibition of the cisplatin resistant HCT116 human adenocarcinoma cell line, respectively. Cyclopalladated complexes 3c and 4c exercise their antiproliferative activity over A549 cells mainly through the induction of apoptosis (38 and 31-fold increase in early apoptotic cells, respectively).
25062099,0,2014,J Am Chem Soc,Palladium/copper-catalyzed aerobic intermolecular cyclization of enediyne compounds and alkynes: interrupting cycloaromatization for (4 + 2) cross-benzannulation.,A tandem coupling-ketooxygenation reaction of readily accessible enediyne-carboxylic compounds with inner alkynes has been developed that utilizes the PdCl2/CuBr2 catalytic system under an O2 atmosphere and assembles a class of isoindolinones and o-acylbenzoic acids. The two oxygen atoms are regioselectively incorporated into enediyne units at the 1- and 6-positions from atmospheric molecular oxygen and H2O, respectively, during the present process. This study uncovered a formal [4C + 2C] benzannulation-diketonization of enediynes and alkynes via a coupling and decoupling strategy.
25055284,0,2014,AJR Am J Roentgenol,Dense breasts: a review of reporting legislation and available supplemental screening options.,OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this article are to discuss the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) and what it means for patients, define breast density and explain how it is measured, review the new state-based legislation regarding the reporting of dense breast tissue directly to patients and the possibility of an adjunct screening examination, describe possible supplemental screening options and the advantages and disadvantages of each, and outline the current shortcomings and unanswered questions regarding new legislation.CONCLUSION: Breast density is now established as an independent risk factor for developing breast cancer irrespective of other known risk factors. Women with breast density in the upper quartile have an associated four to five times greater risk of developing breast cancer relative to women with breast density in the lower quartile. Many states have enacted or proposed legislation requiring mammographers to report to patients directly if they have dense breast tissue and recommend discussing the possibility of a supplemental screening examination with their physicians. However, there is currently no consensus as to whether a supplemental screening examination should be pursued or which modality to use. Possible supplemental screening modalities include ultrasound, MRI, digital breast tomosynthesis, and molecular breast imaging. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved an automated breast ultrasound system for screening whole-breast ultrasound in patients with dense breasts. However, many questions are still unanswered including the impact on morbidity and mortality, cost-effectiveness, and insurance coverage.
25053377,0,2014,Med Teach,4C/ID in medical education: How to design an educational program based on whole-task learning: AMEE Guide No. 93.,Medical education increasingly stresses that medical students should be prepared to take up multiple roles as a health professional. This requires the integrated acquisition of multiple competences such as clinical reasoning and decision making, communication skills and management skills. To promote such complex learning, instructional design has focused on the use of authentic, real-life learning tasks that students perform in a real or simulated task environment. The four-component instructional design model (4C/ID) model is an instructional design model that starts from the use of such tasks and provides students with a variety of learning tools facilitating the integrated acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes. In what follows, we guide the reader on how to implement educational programs based on the 4C/ID model and illustrate this with an example from general practice education. The developed learning environment is in line with the whole-task approach, where a learning domain is considered as a coherent, integrated whole and where teaching progresses from offering relatively simple, but meaningful, authentic whole tasks to more complex tasks. We describe the steps that were taken, from prototype over development to implementation, to build five learning modules (patient with diabetes; the young child with fever; axial skeleton; care for the elderly and physically undefined symptoms) that all focus on the integrated acquisition of the Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists roles in general practice. Furthermore, a change cycle for educational innovation is described that encompasses practice-based challenges and pitfalls about the collaboration between different stakeholders (students, developers and teachers) and the transition from traditional, fragmented and classroom-based learning to integrated and blended learning based on sound instructional design principles.
25052780,0,2014,Amino Acids,Transport mechanism and regulatory properties of the human amino acid transporter ASCT2 (SLC1A5).,The kinetic mechanism of the transport catalyzed by the human glutamine/neutral amino acid transporter hASCT2 over-expressed in P. pastoris was determined in proteoliposomes by pseudo-bi-substrate kinetic analysis of the Na(+)-glutamineex/glutaminein transport reaction. A random simultaneous mechanism resulted from the experimental analysis. Purified functional hASCT2 was chemically cross-linked to a stable dimeric form. The oligomeric structure correlated well with the kinetic mechanism of transport. Half-saturation constants (Km) of the transporter for the other substrates Ala, Ser, Asn and Thr were measured both on the external and internal side. External Km were much lower than the internal ones confirming the asymmetry of the transporter. The electric nature of the transport reaction was determined imposing a negative inside membrane potential generated by K(+) gradients in the presence of valinomycin. The transport reaction resulted to be electrogenic and the electrogenicity originated from external Na(+). Internal Na(+) exerted a stimulatory effect on the transport activity which could be explained by a regulatory, not a counter-transport, effect. Native and deglycosylated hASCT2 extracted from HeLa showed the same transport features demonstrating that the glycosyl moiety has no role in transport function. Both in vitro and in vivo interactions of hASCT2 with the scaffold protein PDZK1 were revealed.
25040055,0,2014,J Microsc,Accessing osteocyte lacunar geometrical properties in human jaw bone on the submicron length scale using synchrotron radiation μCT.,The architectural properties of the osteocyte cell network provide a valuable basis for understanding the mechanisms of bone remodelling, mineral homeostasis, ageing and pathologies. Recent advances in synchrotron microtomography enable unprecedented three-dimensional imaging of both the bone lacunar network and the extracellular matrix. Here, we investigate the three-dimensional morphological properties of osteocyte lacunae in human healthy and bisphosphonate-related osteonecrotic jaw bone based on synchrotron X-ray computed tomography images, with a spatial isotropic voxel size of 300 nm. Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw is a relatively new disease with increasing incidence, which remains poorly understood. A step forward in elucidating this malady is to assess whether, and how, the morphology of the osteocyte lacunar network is modified in the affected jaw tissue. We evaluate thousands of cell lacunae from five specimens of which three originate from patients diagnosed with bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis. In this exploratory study, we report three-dimensional quantitative results on lacunar volumes (296-502 μm(3)), shape (approximated by an ellipsoidal shape with principal axes a &gt; b &gt; c, such that a = 2.2b and a = 4c) and spatial distribution (i.e., 50% of the mineralized matrix volume is located within 12 μm to the closest lacunar boundary) at submicron resolution on such specimens. We observe that the average lacunar volumes of the bisphosphonate-related osteonecrotic jaw specimens were within the range of volumes found in the two specimens originating from healthy donors and conclude that lacunar volumes are not the key element in the course of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrotic jaw. In three out of five specimens we observe lacunar volume sizes in segmented osteons to be significantly different compared to lacunar volumes in the adjacent tissue regions. Furthermore, we quantify the number of lacunae containing small dense objects (on average 9%). In contrast to lacunar morphology we report the lacunar density (16,000-50,000 per mm(3)) to be different in jaw bone tissue compared to what has been reported in femoral sites.
25036754,0,2014,Ultrasonography,Interobserver agreement on the interpretation of automated whole breast ultrasonography.,PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the interobserver agreement on lesion characterization and the final assessment of automated whole breast ultrasonography (ABUS) images.METHODS: Between March and August 2012, 172 women underwent bilateral ABUS before biopsy guided by handheld ultrasonography (HHUS) and mammography. A total of 206 breast lesions were confirmed histopathologically by biopsy. Three-dimensional volume data from ABUS scans were analyzed by two radiologists without the knowledge of HHUS results or patient clinical information. The two readers described the type, shape, orientation, margin, echogenicity, posterior acoustic features, and categorization of the final assessment of detected breast lesions. Kappa statistics were used to analyze the described characteristics of the breast lesions detected by both of the two readers.RESULTS: Of the 206 histopathologically confirmed lesions, reader 1 detected 166 lesions and reader 2 detected 150 lesions. A total of 145 lesions were detected by both readers using ABUS images. There was substantial agreement on shape (κ=0.707), and moderate agreement on type, margin, mass orientation, echogenicity, and posterior acoustic features (κ=0.592, 0.438, 0.472, 0.524, and 0.541, respectively). Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System final assessment values yielded a kappa value of 0.3971 when category subdivisions 4A, 4B, and 4C were included. With respect to the C2, C3, C4, and C5 categories, the interobserver agreement was moderate (κ=0.505).CONCLUSION: ABUS is a promising diagnostic tool with a good interobserver agreement, comparable to that of HHUS.
25027939,0,2014,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Design and synthesis of γ-butyrolactone derivatives as potential spermicidal agents.,A series of γ-butyrolactone derivatives has been designed and synthesized from commercially available 2-acetyl butyrolactone (3-acetyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one, 1) by aminoalkylating its active methylene followed by condensation with different aldehydes. Compounds having amino group were further converted to their respective tartrate salts and were evaluated for spermicidal activity against human sperm in vitro. Compounds showing appreciable spermicidal activity at ⩽0.5% [3c, 4d (0.5%); 2c, 3d (0.1%); 2d, 4c (0.05%)] were tested for safety studies against human cervical (HeLa) cell line. These compounds were found safer than, Nonoxynol-9. One of the two most active compounds was also found to be the safest (IC50=961 μg/ml; 4c), while the second compound exhibited lower safety against HeLa (IC50=269 μg/ml; 2d). The compound 4c significantly reduced the number of free thiols on human sperm. All the compounds were inactive against Trichomonas vaginalis.
25027079,0,2014,Indian J Med Res,A 4-compartment model based validation of air displacement plethysmography, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, skinfold technique &amp; bio-electrical impedance for measuring body fat in Indian adults.,BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVES: Many methods are available for measuring body fat of an individual, each having its own advantages and limitations. The primary objective of the present study was to validate body fat estimates from individual methods using the 4-compartment (4C) model as reference. The second objective was to obtain estimates of hydration of fat free mass (FFM) using the 4C model.METHODS: The body fat of 39 adults (19 men and 20 women) aged 20-40 yr was estimated using air displacement plethysmography (ADP), dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), 4-skinfold technique and bio-electrical impedance (BIA). Total body water was estimated using isotope dilution method.RESULTS: All the methods underestimated body fat when compared to 4C model, except for DEXA and the mean difference from the reference was lowest for DEXA and ADP. The precision of the fat mass estimated from 4C model using the propagation of error was 0.25 kg, while the mean hydration factor obtained by the 4C model was found to be 0.74 ± 0.02 in the whole group of men and women.INTERPRETATIONS &amp; CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that DEXA and ADP methods can provide reasonably accurate estimates of body fat, while skinfold and bio-electrical impedance methods require the use of population specific equations.
25016372,0,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Zwitterionic pyrimidinium adducts as antioxidants with therapeutic potential as nitric oxide scavenger.,A variety of zwitterionic adducts were synthesized by using means green chemistry method. The products contain the biologically active barbituric acid moiety embedded in zwitterion products. Both features are pharmaceutically relevant. The chemical structures were deduced by (1)H-, (13)C-, NMR and HRMS spectral analysis, and X-ray diffraction techniques. In vitro evaluation for the antioxidant activities were carried out towards the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) radical, known to regulate a mechanism of signals for various cellular functions. NO also play an important role as a mediator of various pathological conditions responsible for cellular damages such as strokes, cancers, diabetes, chronic heart failure and inflammatory disease and various neurodegenerative disorders. All tested compounds were found to be more potent nitric oxide scavengers as compared to standard drug ascorbic acid (IC50 = 618 ± 2.0 μM). Compounds 4c and e exhibiting several hundred fold more activity against nitric oxide radical with IC50 values of 69 ± 1.66 and 70.1 ± 0.89 μM respectively, as compared to standard drug ascorbic acid (IC50 = 618 ± 2.0 μM).
25010852,0,2014,J Org Chem,Long chalcogen-chalcogen bonds in electron-rich two and four center bonds: combination of π- and σ-aromaticity to a three-dimensional σ/π-aromaticity.,Quantum chemical calculations were carried out by applying density functional theory to study the two center-three electron (2c-3e) bonds between the sulfur centers of cyclic dithioethers. Calculated were the S-S distance, the stabilization energy, and the energy of the σ → σ* transition. The extension of the calculations to two (2c-3e) bonds in one molecule shows that a rearrangement to one σ bond and two lone pairs on sulfur is usually more favorable. Exceptions are [H2S2(+)]2, the dimer of the 1,2-dithia-3,5-diazolyl radical (27a), the dimer of the 1,2,4-trithia-3,5-diazolyl radical cation (26a(2+)), and its Selena congeners and derivatives. In the case of [H2S2(+)]2, the (4c-6e) bond between the chalcogen centers is a good description of this dimer. To describe the binding situation in the dimer 26a(2+) and 27a, the concept of a &quot;simple&quot; (4c-6e) bond was extended. Our calculations reveal a strong σ-aromaticity within the plane of the four sulfur centers in addition to a strong π-conjugation within the five-membered rings. The whole phenomenon can best be described as a three-dimensional σ/π-aromaticity within the 14π dimers.
25001596,0,2014,Sci Rep,Electronic structure, dielectric response, and surface charge distribution of RGD (1FUV) peptide.,Long and short range molecular interactions govern molecular recognition and self-assembly of biological macromolecules. Microscopic parameters in the theories of these molecular interactions are either phenomenological or need to be calculated within a microscopic theory. We report a unified methodology for the ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) calculation that yields all the microscopic parameters, namely the partial charges as well as the frequency-dependent dielectric response function, that can then be taken as input for macroscopic theories of electrostatic, polar, and van der Waals-London dispersion intermolecular forces. We apply this methodology to obtain the electronic structure of the cyclic tripeptide RGD-4C (1FUV). This ab initio unified methodology yields the relevant parameters entering the long range interactions of biological macromolecules, providing accurate data for the partial charge distribution and the frequency-dependent dielectric response function of this peptide. These microscopic parameters determine the range and strength of the intricate intermolecular interactions between potential docking sites of the RGD-4C ligand and its integrin receptor.
24996139,0,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Identification, pharmacological evaluation and binding mode analysis of novel chromene and chromane based σ1 receptor ligands.,A set of aminoethyl substituted chromenes 3 and chromanes 4, originally developed as antiprotozoal drugs was evaluated as novel types of σ1 receptor ligands. Analysis of SAR showed that chromenes 3 have a higher σ1 affinity than chromanes 4. A distance of four bond lengths between the basic amino moiety and the phenyl ring (3c), an alicyclic N-substituent such as the cyclohexylmethyl moiety (3l), and methylation of the secondary amine to afford a tertiary amine (3n) result in very high σ1 affinity and selectivity over the σ2 subtype. Compounds 3a-n and 4a-e were docked into the putative binding site of the σ1 receptor model and the relevant binding mode was analyzed and scored. Specifically, for the best σ1 ligand 3n, a salt bridge between Asp126 and the protonated amino group, an H-bond between the receptor backbone NH group (Ala122-Glu123) and the methoxy moiety of 3n, a lipophilic protein cavity encasing the chromene ring, and a T-shaped π-π stacking between the indole ring of Trp121 and the phenyl ring of 3n represent the most important ligand/protein stabilizing interactions. The binding pose of 3n was compared with the binding poses of the non-methylated chromene 3c, the saturated chromane 4c, and the N-cyclohexylmethyl derivative 3l. The contribution of the single amino acids to the overall free binding enthalpy was analyzed.
24973029,0,2014,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and evaluation of iminocoumaryl and coumaryl derivatized glycosides as galectin antagonists.,A collection of iminocoumarylmethyl glycoside derivatives have been prepared by copper-catalyzed multi-component reaction of carbohydrate propargyl derivatives, sulfonyl azides, and salicylaldehyde or o-hydroxy acetophenone. The method is simple, versatile to all three components, and exceptionally high yielding. The carbohydrate N-sulfonyl iminocoumarine hybrid molecules were evaluated for binding galectin-1, -2, -3, -4N, -4C, -7, -8N, -9N, and 9C using a competitive fluorescence polarization assay. Selective compounds were identified against galectin-3, 7, 8N, and 9N with up to 40-fold affinity enhancements relative to methyl α-d-galactopyranoside due to the coumarylmethyl moieties.
24955256,0,2014,ISRN Org Chem,Synthesis and biological activities of 4-aminoantipyrine derivatives derived from betti-type reaction.,The present work deals with the synthesis and evaluation of biological activities of 4-aminoantipyrine derivatives derived from a three-component Betti reaction. The synthesis was initiated by the condensation of aromatic aldehyde, 4-aminoantipyrine, and 8-hydroxyquinoline in presence of fluorite as catalyst in a simple one-step protocol. The reactions were stirred at room temperature for 10-15 min achieving 92-95% yield. The structures of synthesized derivatives were established on the basis of spectroscopic and elemental analysis. All derivatives 4(a-h) were screened in vivo and in vitro for anti-inflammatory and anthelmintic activity against a reference drug, Diclofenac and Albendazole, respectively. The screening results show that compounds 4c, 4d, 4f, and 4h were found to possess potential anti-inflammatory activity while compounds 4a, 4b, 4e, and 4g are potent anthelmintic agents when compared with reference drugs, respectively. The bioactivity of these derivatives has also been evaluated with respect to Lipinski's rule of five using molinspiration cheminformatics software.
24950489,0,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines and imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines as new inhibitors of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.,Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays an important role in the regulation of embryonic development and tumorigenesis. Since its deregulation results in severe human diseases, especially cancer, the Wnt signaling pathway constitutes a promising platform for pharmacological targeting of cancer. In this study we synthesized a series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines and imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines and identified some derivatives that were able to inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in a luciferase reporter assay and cell proliferation in selected cancer cell lines, endowed with APC or β-catenin gene mutations. The most active compounds significantly downregulate the expression of Wnt target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1. Further studies indicated that these compounds function independently of GSK-3β activity. More importantly, in vivo experiments, carried out on a Wnt-reporter zebrafish model indicate, in particular for compounds 4c and 4i as the most active compounds, an activity comparable to that of the reference compound IWR1, suggesting their potential use not only as small molecule inhibitors of the Wnt/β-catenin signal in Wnt driven cancers, but also in other Wnt-related diseases.
24941129,0,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Design, synthesis and antiproliferative activity of functionalized flavone-triazole-tetrahydropyran conjugates against human cancer cell lines.,Under optimized reaction conditions, an efficient synthetic method has been developed to afford the functionalized flavone-triazole-tetrahydropyran conjugates via click reactions. The Cu-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction gave the pure products, 5-iodo- and 5-H-1-(tetrahydropyran)-1,2,3-triazol-4-(3-methoxylflavone) derivatives in excellent yield (90-98%) within 1-3 h. Further, Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling of 5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles with phenylboronic acids afforded 5-phenyl-1-(tetrahydropyran)-1,2,3-triazol-4-(3-methoxylflavone) derivatives in excellent yield (93-95%) in 4-5 h. Products (3a-l, 4a-j) were screened in vitro for their anti-proliferative activity against three human cancer cell lines (MDA-MB 231, KCL22 and Hela). Compounds 3c, 3g, 3i, 3j, 4c and 4h have shown better cytotoxicity (IC50 0.61-1.68 μM) than the reference drugs. Compounds 4e (IC50 0.70 μM), 3j (IC50 0.61 μM) and 4d (IC50 0.65 μM) exhibited anti-proliferative activity better than the reference drugs against the MDA-MB 231 cells, KCL22 cells and HeLa cells respectively.
24931360,0,2014,Dalton Trans,1,2,3-Triazolylidene ruthenium(II)(η⁶-arene) complexes: synthesis, metallation and reactivity.,Three bis(1,2,3-triazolylidene) silver(I) complexes were synthesized, and the ruthenium complexes ([RCH2N2(NMe)C2Ph)]RuCl2(p-cymene) (R = C6H2Me3 4a₁, C6H2iPr3 4b₁) were isolated as major products with the minor C(sp(2))-H activated products ([RCH2N2(NMe)C2C6H4)]RuCl(p-cymene) (R = C6H2Me3 4a₂, C6H2iPr3 4b₂). In the related case where R = Ph, the species ([PhCH2N2(NMe)C2Ph)]RuCl2(p-cymene) 4c₁ was obtained with two C(sp(2))-H activated products [PhCH2N2(NMe)C2C6H4)]RuCl(p-cymene) 4c₂ and [(C6H4)CH2N2(NMe)C2Ph)]RuCl(p-cymene) 4c₃ derived from metallation of the N and C-bound arene rings. Heating a solution of 4a₁ at 45 °C over three weeks resulted in a ruthenium(II)(1,2,3-triazolylidene) complex [(C6H2Me3)CH2N2(NMe)C2Ph)]RuCl2 5a, where the pendant mesityl group on the triazolylidene moiety displaced the p-cymene ligand. The complexes 4a₁, 4b₁, 4c₁ and 5a displayed moderate catalytic activities in base-free oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes and oxidative homocoupling of benzyl amines to imines using oxygen as oxidant.
24928727,0,2014,Steroids,Syntheses and antiproliferative effects of D-homo- and D-secoestrones.,Substituted and/or heterocyclic d-homoestrone derivatives were synthetized via the intramolecular cyclization of a δ-alkenyl-d-secoaldehyde, -d-secoalcohol or -d-secocarboxylic acid of estrone 3-benzyl ether. The d-secoalcohol was modified at three sites in the molecule. The in vitro antiproliferative activities of the new d-homo- and d-secoestrone derivatives were determined on HeLa, MCF-7, A431 and A2780 cells through use of MTT assay. d-Homoalcohols 3 and 5 displayed cell line-selective cytostatic effects against ovarian and cervical cell lines, respectively. Two d-secoestrones (6 and 12c) proved to be effective, with IC50 values comparable with those of the reference agent cisplatin. A selected compound (6) was tested by tubulin polymerization assay and its cancer specificity was additionally determined by using noncancerous human fibroblast cells.
24927051,0,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis, biological evaluation and docking study of 3-aroyl-1-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)thiourea derivatives as 15-lipoxygenase inhibitors.,A series of 3-aroyl-1-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)thiourea derivatives containing sulfonamide moiety were designed and synthesized as 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) inhibitors. Most synthesized compounds showed potent activity against soybean 15-LOX with IC50 values less than 25 μM. The most potent compound 4c (3-methylbenzoyl derivative) with IC50 value of 1.8 μM was 10-fold more potent than quercetin. Interestingly, compound 4c also showed the highest antioxidant activity, as determined by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Its capacity for reducing ferric ion was more than ascorbic acid. The viability assay of the selected compound 4c against oxidative stress-induced cell death in differentiated PC12 cells revealed that compound 4c significantly protected neurons against cell death in low concentrations.
24907401,0,2014,Exp Neurol,Cytokine signaling by grafted neuroectodermal stem cells rescues motoneurons destined to die.,Following an injury to their axons close to the cell body, adult motoneurons generally die. This type of injury, typically caused by avulsion of the spinal ventral root, initiates the activation of astrocytes and microglial cells and the extracellular space becomes loaded with excessive amounts of excitotoxic glutamate. We have provided evidence that, following ventral root avulsion and reimplantation, murine embryonic neuroectodermal stem cells (NE-GFP-4C) grafted into the rat spinal cord rescue the vast majority of the motoneurons that would otherwise die, and enable them to reinnervate peripheral targets. Stem cell grafts produced the modulatory cytokines IL-1-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha and MIP-1-alpha, but not neurotrophic factors. The neurons and astrocytes in the ventral horn of grafted animals also produced IL-6 and MIP-1-alpha, indicating a strong interaction between the graft and the host tissue. The infusion of function-blocking antibodies against all cytokines into the grafted cords completely abolished their motoneuron-rescuing effect, while neutralization of only IL-10 suggested its strong effectivity as concerns motoneuron survival and a milder effect on reinnervation. It is suggested that, apart from the anti-inflammatory function of IL-10, the pro-inflammatory cytokines produced exert a strong modulatory function in the CNS, promoting the prevention of neuronal cell death.
24900842,0,2014,ACS Med Chem Lett,Novel delta opioid receptor agonists with oxazatricyclodecane structure.,We synthesized compounds 4a,c-f,h,i containing the oxazatricyclodecane structure from a novel rearrangement reaction product 2a. All the prepared compounds 4a,c-f,h,i exhibited full agonistic activities for the δ opioid receptor (DOR). Among them, the N-methyl derivative 4c was highly selective, and the most effective DOR agonist in functional assays. Subcutaneous administration of 4c produced dose-dependent and NTI (selective DOR antagonist)-reversible antinociception lacking any convulsive behaviors in the mice acetic acid writhing tests. The N-methyl derivative 4c is expected to be a promising lead compound for selective DOR agonists with a novel chemotype.
24900611,0,2014,ACS Med Chem Lett,Adamantyl derivative as a potent inhibitor of Plasmodium FK506 binding protein 35.,FKBP35, FK506 binding protein family member, in Plasmodium species displays a canonical peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity and is intricately involved in the protein folding process. Inhibition of PfFKBP35 by FK506 or its analogues were shown to interfere with the in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum. In this study, we have synthesized adamantyl derivatives, Supradamal (SRA/4a) and its analogues SRA1/4b and SRA2/4c, which demonstrate submicromolar inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum FK506 binding domain 35 (FKBD35) PPIase activity. SRA and its analogues not only inhibit the in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain but also show stage specific activity by inhibiting the trophozoite stage of the parasite. SRA/4a also inhibits the Plasmodium vivax FKBD35 PPIase activity and our crystal structure of PvFKBD35 in complex with the SRA provides structural insights in achieving selective inhibition against Plasmodium FKBPs.
24898646,0,2014,J Alzheimers Dis,The influence of co-morbidity and frailty on the clinical manifestation of patients with Alzheimer's disease.,Co-morbidity and frailty are common in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may contribute to the heterogeneity in clinical manifestations of the disease. We cross-sectionally investigated whether co-morbidity and frailty were independently associated with the clinical manifestation of AD in the 4C-Dementia study; a multicenter, longitudinal study in newly diagnosed AD patients. Clinical manifestation was operationalized using a composite of cognitive performance (neuropsychological assessment), activities of daily living (Disability Assessment for Dementia; DAD) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory). As predictors of prime interest, co-morbidity was determined using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS-G) and frailty by the Fried criteria. In total, 213 AD patients participated (mean age 75 ± 10 years; 58% females). In linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, education, and disease duration, CIRS-G (β = -0.21, p &lt; 0.01) and frailty (β = -0.34, p &lt; 0.001) were separately associated with clinical AD manifestation. However, CIRS-G (β = -0.12, p = 0.12) lost statistical significance when both were combined (frailty: β = -0.31, p &lt; 0.001). Models with the individual components of clinical AD manifestation as dependent variables show significant associations between cognitive performance and CIRS-G (β = -0.22, p = 0.01), and between DAD and frailty (β = -0.37, p &lt; 0.001). Our findings indicate that physical health and clinical AD manifestation are associated. This association may be responsible for part of the heterogeneity in the presentation of AD. This emphasizes the importance of adequate assessment of co-morbid medical conditions and frailty in patients with AD.
24883143,0,2014,Pol J Radiol,Wegener's granulomatosis of the breast: A case report.,BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis and detection of malignant lesions in mammography poses a challenge for many diagnosticians. Although mammography continues to be the best and cost-effective way to detect breast cancer, it has its limitations due in part to the radiological appearance of changes of a very rare condition. We are presented with changes that have met well-known radiologic criteria for the diagnosis of malignancy, yet they turn out to be benign, because they belong to a group of extraordinary lesions.CASE REPORT: In June 2010, a 56-year-old woman found a lump in her right breast. Mammography performed at another medical center, revealed a change 12 mm in diameter, rated as BI-RADS 4C. Physical examination revealed a palpable lesion, 15 mm in diameter. Ultrasonography revealed hypoechogenic change with ill-defined outlines, size 14×10 mm - BI-RADS 5. Fine needle aspiration biopsy was done and revealed no atypical cells. The patient underwent an open surgical biopsy and a histopathological diagnosis was suggested to be a type of Wegener's granulomatosis. Exclusion of cancer enabled the continuation of medical treatment of the underlying disease. There were no changes in the breast in follow-up studies.CONCLUSIONS: The differential diagnosis of breast tumors should include rare conditions that can sometimes mimic breast cancer. One of them is Wegener's granulomatosis. Both, the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, require the cooperation of specialists from various fields, including clinicians, pathologists and radiologists.
24878197,0,2014,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and evaluation of (18)F-labeled tertiary benzenesulfonamides for imaging carbonic anhydrase IX expression in tumours with positron emission tomography.,Three tertiary benzenesulfonamide inhibitors 4a-c were radiolabeled with (18)F and evaluated for imaging carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) expression with positron emission tomography. All three inhibitors exhibit &lt;10 nM affinity for CA IX with no measurable affinity for CA II. Despite good affinity/selectivity to CA IX and excellent stability in plasma, uptake of [(18)F]4a-c in CA IX-expressing HT-29 tumours was low without significant contrast. [(18)F]4a,b were excreted rapidly, while [(18)F]4c exhibited significant in vivo defluorination leading to high bone uptake. Due to minimal uptake in HT-29 tumours compared to normal organs/tissues, (18)F-labeled benzenesulfonamides [(18)F]4a-c are not suitable as CA IX imaging agents.
24868553,0,2014,Biomed Res Int,In vitro larvicidal and antioxidant activity of dihydrophenanthroline-3-carbonitriles.,Many naturally occurring and synthetic compounds containing dihydrocyanopyridine and cyanopyran moiety show pharmacological properties. The aim of this study is to investigate the larvicidal and antioxidant potential of dihydrophenanthroline-3-carbonitrile derivatives 4a-f. A novel series of 2-amino-10-chloro-4,12-diphenyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[j][1,7]phenanthroline-3-carbonitrile derivatives were synthesized by reacting different substituted acridine chalcones through Michel addition. The compounds were synthesized in excellent yields and the structures were corroborated on the basis of FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and ESI Mass analysis data. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus larvae. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity was studied by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay method. From the antioxidant assay, the compound 4c was reported with profound antioxidant potential.
24865860,0,2014,J Digit Imaging,Efficacy of a checklist-style structured radiology reporting template in reducing resident misses on cervical spine computed tomography examinations.,The increasing use of medical checklists to promote patient safety raises the question of their utility in diagnostic radiology. This study evaluates the efficacy of a checklist-style reporting template in reducing resident misses on cervical spine CT examinations. A checklist-style reporting template for cervical spine CTs was created at our institution and mandated for resident preliminary reports. Ten months after implementation of the template, we performed a retrospective cohort study comparing rates of emergent pathology missed on reports generated with and without the checklist-style reporting template. In 1,832 reports generated without using the checklist-style template, 25 (17.6%) out of 142 emergent findings were missed. In 1,081 reports generated using the checklist-style template, 13 (11.9%) out of 109 emergent findings were missed. The decrease in missed pathology was not statistically significant (p = 0.21). However, larger differences were noted in the detection of emergent non-fracture findings, with 17 (28.3%) out of 60 findings missed on reports without use of the checklist template and 5 (9.3%) out of 54 findings missed on reports using the checklist template, representing a statistically significant decrease in missed non-fracture findings (p = 0.01). The use of a checklist-style structured reporting template resulted in a statistically significant decrease in missed non-fracture findings on cervical spine CTs. The lack of statistically significant change in missed fractures was expected given that residents' search patterns naturally include fracture detection. Our findings suggest that the use of checklists in structured reporting may increase diagnostic accuracy.
24858395,0,2014,Genetica,Genetic response of Paspalum plicatulum to genome duplication.,Paspalum plicatulum is a perennial rhizomatous grass with natural diploid and polyploid cytotypes. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of sequence polymorphisms arising immediately after genome autoduplication in this species. Two mixoploid plants (4C and 7D) were previously obtained through colchicine treatment of seeds generated by open pollination of a diploid plant (H14-2x). Diploid and tetraploid sectors from both mixoploids were dissected to generate two ploidy series (4C-2x/4C-4x and 7D-2x/7D-4x). Molecular fingerprints were generated from the maternal plant H14-2x, both ploidy series (4C-2x/4C-4x and 7D-2x/7D-4x), and a tetraploid plant (C1) produced by selfing 7D-4x. Our results indicate that immediately after polyploidization P. plicatulum suffers genetic rearrangements affecting ~28-38 % of the genome. Band gain and loss were equally prevalent at a statistically significant level. At least 5.62 % of the genome experimented recurrent genetic variation in a non-random basis with a confidence of 94.88 %. A significant proportion of novel bands (36 out of 195; 18.4 %) was detected in the C1 tetraploid plant. Half of these bands were not amplified in either H14-2x or 7D-4x, while the remainders were present in H14-2x but absent in 7D-4x. Our results indicate the occurrence of a considerable number of genetic changes in P. plicatulum immediately after polyploidization, some of which were recurrently detected in different independent events. Moreover, we confirmed that after polyploidization, lost ancestral alleles were spontaneously recovered in further generations, a phenomenon previously reported by other research groups.
24857975,0,2014,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Destabilization of the medial meniscus leads to subchondral bone defects and site-specific cartilage degeneration in an experimental rat model.,OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate subchondral bone changes using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and regional differences in articular cartilage degeneration, focusing on changes of cartilage covered by menisci, in the early phase using a destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model.METHOD: The DMM model was created as an experimental rat osteoarthritis (OA) model (12 weeks old; n = 24). At 1, 2, and 4 weeks after surgery, the rats were sacrificed, and knee joints were scanned using a Micro-CT system. Histological sections of the medial tibial plateau, which was divided into inner, middle, and outer regions, were prepared and scored using the modified OARSI scoring system. The cartilage thickness was also calculated, and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), Col2-3/4c, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was assessed immunohistochemically.RESULTS: Subchondral bone defects were observed in the middle region, in which the cartilage thickness decreased over time after surgery, and these defects were filled with MMP13- and VEGF-expressing fibrous tissue. The OARSI score increased over time in the middle region, and the score was significantly higher in the middle region than in the inner and outer regions at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after surgery. Col2-3/4c and MMP13 expression was observed primarily in the meniscus-covered outer region, in which the cartilage thickness increased over time.CONCLUSION: Loss of meniscal function caused cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone defects in the early phase site-specifically in the middle region. Furthermore, our results might indicate cartilage covered by menisci is easily degraded resulting in osmotic swelling of the cartilage in early OA.
24856380,0,2014,Bosn J Basic Med Sci,Retrospective mutational analysis of NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1 and LAMB2 in children with steroid-resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis - a single-centre experience.,The aim of our study was to examine NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1 and LAMB2 mutations, previously reported in two thirds of patients with nephrotic syndrome with onset before the age of one year old. Genomic DNA samples from Polish children (n=33) with Steroid-Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome (SRNS) due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), manifesting before the age of 13 years old, underwent retrospective analysis of NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1 (exons 8, 9 and adjacent exon/intron boundaries) and LAMB2. No pathogenic NPHS1 or LAMB2 mutations were found in our FSGS cohort. SRNS-causing mutations of NPHS2 and WT1 were detected in 7 of 33 patients (21%), including those with nephrotic syndrome manifesting before one year old: five of seven patients. Four patients had homozygous c.413G&gt;A (p.Arg138Gln) NPHS2 mutations; one subject was homozygous for c.868G&gt;A (p.Val290Met) NPHS2. A phenotypic female had C&gt;T transition at position +4 of the WT1 intron 9 (c.1432+4C&gt;T) splice-donor site, and another phenotypic female was heterozygous for G&gt;A transition at position +5 (c.1432+5G&gt;A). Genotyping revealed a female genotypic gender (46, XX) for the first subject and male (46, XY) for the latter. In addition, one patient was heterozygous for c.104dup (p.Arg36Profs*34) NPHS2; two patients carried a c.686G&gt;A (p.Arg229Gln) NPHS2 non-neutral variant. Results indicate possible clustering of causative NPHS2 mutations in FSGS-proven SRNS with onset before age one year old, and provide additional evidence that patients with childhood steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis should first undergo analysis of NPHS2 coding sequence and WT1 exons 8 and 9 and surrounding exon/intron boundary sequences, followed by gender genotyping.

24852157,0,2014,Pediatr Clin North Am,Convergence insufficiency and vision therapy.,There is no standard meaning of the term &quot;vision therapy&quot;, and for this reason it is often a controversial topic between some members of the ophthalmic and optometric community. Most pediatric ophthalmologists avoid using the term because it is nonspecific. Convergence Insufficiency (CI) is a binocular visual problem that causes problems and symptoms with near fixation. There is consensus among eye care professionals that convergence therapy is effective in treating CI. Convergence therapy is not effective in treating learning disabilities, but can sometimes relieve symptoms that might be a barrier to reading.
24852153,0,2014,Pediatr Clin North Am,Retinopathy of prematurity.,Premature infants born at 30 weeks' gestational age or younger, or 1500 g or smaller, are screened for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Guidelines for supplemental oxygen in neonatal intensive care units have decreased but not eliminated the incidence of severe ROP. The underlying cause for ROP is prematurity and low birth weight, and with the survival of smaller and younger babies, ROP continues to be a significant problem facing premature infants. Threshold ROP is treated with retinal photocoagulation, but newer treatments such as intraocular injections of bevacizumab (Avastin) are being used alone or in conjunction with laser.
24852151,0,2014,Pediatr Clin North Am,Periocular hemangiomas and lymphangiomas.,Infantile hemangiomas are the most common benign tumor of childhood. Lymphangiomas are benign hamartomatous vascular tumors. Both lesions can be problematic when located in the periocular region. Pediatricians must be familiar with the characteristics of each which would necessitate referral to an ophthalmologist or other subspecialist for evaluation, including obstruction of the visual axis which can lead to amblyopia of the affected eye. Additional potential complications include proptosis, ocular motility limitation, optic nerve injury, and poor eyelid closure with or without corneal surface disease. All children with periocular hemangiomas or lymphangiomas should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation.
24849271,0,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of some 2-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-1-arylethanones: antibacterial, DNA photocleavage, and anticancer activities.,In continuation of our efforts to find new biologically active agents, regioselective synthesis of a series of 2-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-1-arylethanones 4a-k has been achieved under facile, extremely mild and greener reaction conditions with excellent yields. Moreover, one pot multicomponent reaction has also been reinvestigated under previously reported solvent conditions to prepare 4a-b and found that the reaction generates significant amount of side products. The chemical structures of 4a-k were established on the basis of a combined use of IR, NMR ((1)H, (13)C) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. All the compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial, DNA photocleavage and anticancer activities. Among all, 2-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-1-(naphth-2-yl)ethanone 4j displayed good inhibitory profile against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus which was about 50% and 25% of the Ampicillin (standard drug), respectively. The compounds, 4a and 4f showed relatively moderate inhibition against Psuedomonas aeruginosa and E. coli. In DNA photocleavage study, compounds 4c and 4d were found to be highly active and completely degraded both forms of DNA (SC and OC), even at a very low concentration of 1 μg (4c) under irradiation of UV light. However, 4h and 4f resulted in complete DNA degradation at 30 μg concentration. Moreover, 4h showed fluorescence at 15 μg concentration and increased the intensity of both bands of DNA (SC and OC) as compared to control. On the other hand, to valorize the biological potential, the compounds were screened for their cytotoxic activity on colon (HCT116 and HT29), prostate (DU145), ovarian (SKOV3) and lung (A549) cancer cell lines. The compound 4j was found to be cytotoxic to all the cancer cell lines, except SKOV3, with more selectivity towards the colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, HT29) and A549 lung cancer cell line. On A549 lung cancer cell line, 4j and 4k exhibited similar potency as carboplatin in inhibiting cell viability.
24842301,0,2014,Oncol Rep,Integrated analysis using methylation and gene expression microarrays reveals PDE4C as a prognostic biomarker in human glioma.,Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor promoters is generally accepted to indicate poor prognosis in glioma; however, the DNA methylation patterns associated with different glioma prognoses remain to be elucidated. In the present study, promoter methylation and gene expression microarrays were used to screen candidate genes between different grades of glioma. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan‑Meier (KM) method. Promoter methylation and protein expression of phosphodiesterase 4C (PDE4C) was examined in different grade gliomas and the correlation between PDE4C and wild-type (WT) p53 was evaluated in glioma cell lines. In addition, gene ontology and gene set variation analysis were used to examine PDE4C function. We found PDE4C exhibited promoter hypermethylation in high-grade glioma samples and hypomethylation in low-grade glioma, with PDE4C expression levels showing the reverse. This indicated PDE4C may be a candidate glioma biomarker. Through studies of PDE4C methylation and expression status in an independent cohort of 124 patient samples (56 low-grade and 63 high-grade glioma and 5 normal brain), we identified PDE4C as having significant promoter methylation and lower expression in high-grade glioma. Hypermethylation and reduced PDE4C protein expression were associated with grade progression and overall survival. In glioma cell lines, PDE4C was upregulated by demethylation treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine and WT p53 expression was downregulated after PDE4C siRNA suppression. Finally, we found PDE4C promoted apoptosis and inhibited migration in a U87 cell line. On the basis of these observations and the results from subset analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that PDE4C may function as a tumor suppressor by promoting apoptosis through the WT p53 pathway and inhibiting cell migration. The data show that PDE4C is downregulated through promoter hypermethylation in glioma.
24836064,0,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Tamiphosphor monoesters as effective anti-influenza agents.,Oseltamivir is a potent neuraminidase inhibitor for influenza treatment. By replacing the carboxylate group in oseltamivir with phosphonate monoalkyl ester, a series of tamiphosphor derivatives were synthesized and shown to exhibit high inhibitory activities against influenza viruses. Our molecular modeling experiments revealed that influenza virus neuraminidase contains a 371-cavity near the S1-site to accommodate the alkyl substituents of tamiphosphor monoesters to render appreciable hydrophobic interactions for enhanced affinity. Furthermore, guanidino-tamiphosphor (TPG) monoesters are active to the oseltamivir-resistant mutant. TPG monohexyl ester 4e having a more lipophilic alkyl substituent showed better cell permeability and intestinal absorption than the corresponding monoethyl ester 4c, but both compounds showed similar bioavailability. Intranasal administration of TPG monoesters at low dose greatly improved the survival rate of mice infected with lethal dose of H1N1 influenza virus, whereas 4c provided better protection of the infected mice than oseltamivir and other phosphonate congeners by oral administration.
24834527,0,2014,Hypertension,Response to intima-media thickness in children--need for more parameters.,
24819602,0,2014,Dalton Trans,Titanium imido complexes stabilised by bis(iminophosphoranyl)methanide ligands: the influence of N-substituents on solution dynamics and reactivity.,Terminal titanium imido complexes of the general formula [Ti(N(t)Bu)Cl{CH(Ph2PNR)2}] 4 (R = Ph, (i)Pr, (t)Bu) are reported. These compounds were synthesized from the corresponding Li adducts 3 of BIPMH (bis(iminophosphoranyl)methanide) and Mountford's complex [Ti(N(t)Bu)Cl2(Py)3]. The crystal structures of two of the Ti complexes (R = Ph, (t)Bu) and two of the Li compounds (R = (i)Pr, (t)Bu) are reported. Dynamic solution NMR spectroscopy reveals a dynamic isomerisation process in the case of the Ti complex 4c (R = (t)Bu). DFT studies showed that this dynamic process comes from steric repulsion between the imido ligand and the (t)Bu N-substituents on the BIPMH ligand. Complexes 4 were tested in alkyne hydroamination; 4a (R = Ph) displayed modest catalytic activity in the reaction of aniline with phenylacetylene.
24810116,0,2014,Eur J Dent Educ,Developing clinical reasoning in the classroom - analysis of the 4C/ID-model.,OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to provide a theoretical rationale for the implementation of the four-component instructional design model for complex learning (4C/ID-model) at the University of Pretoria with the aim of systematically developing the clinical reasoning of undergraduate dental students in a classroom setting.METHODS: Recent literature provides a rationale for the use of the 4C/ID-model to teach clinical reasoning in terms of four strategic teaching and learning needs: (i) the need for authenticity in the learning process; (ii) the need to manage cognitive load during the learning process; (iii) the need for repeated practice; (iv) a need for valid assessment, feedback and reflection.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature review indicated that the 4C/ID-model makes provision for teaching and learning in an authentic context and proposes systematically structured methods that could be practically applied to manage cognitive load during repetitive exercises. The model also makes provision for cognitive feedback following assessment in order to eliminate misconceptions about content and to develop the cognitive strategies of the learner.CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the literature review above, it is recommended that the 4C/ID-model be considered as a basis for classroom teaching and learning to develop competence in clinical reasoning in undergraduate dental students, even at pre-clinical level. The model may also have an application in medical education.
24803385,0,2014,Curr Cardiol Rep,Universal MI definition update for cardiovascular disease.,The new third universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI) is based on troponin elevation together with ischemic symptoms, ischemic ECG changes, and imaging evidence. MIs are classified into five types as to whether they are spontaneous, secondary to imbalance between coronary artery blood supply and demand, related to sudden death, or related to revascularization procedures. The definition is based on a rise and/or fall in troponin levels occurring in a clinical setting. There have been modifications over previous definitions with adding intracoronary thrombus as a criterion, adding a new type of MI type 4c, and raising the cutpoint for the diagnosis of MI related to percutaneous coronary intervention to five times the 99(th) percentile upper reference limit and requiring evidence of ischemia or angiographic complications. In clinical practice, trials, and registries, different definitions are used. There is a need for consistency with regard to the definition of MI and the universal definition should be implemented.
24784450,0,2014,J Org Chem,Synthesis of methoxy-substituted picenes: substitution position effect on their electronic and single-crystal structures.,A series of picenes having methoxy groups was synthesized through Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura couplings or Wittig reaction/intramolecular cyclization sequences, and their physicochemical properties and single-crystal structures were evaluated. The substitution position effects between the outer 1,12-, 2,11-, and 4,9-position and the inner 3,10-position are quite different; the former showed the same electronic structure as that of picene, but the latter results in a HOMO geometry different from those of picene and other methoxy picenes. In addition, crystal structures of four types of methoxy-substituted picenes 4a-c,e strongly depend on their substitution position and number of methoxy groups, which dramatically changes the structures from the fully anisotropic 1D π-stacked structure to a unique 3D herringbone structure due to steric hindrance of methoxy groups. The calculations of transfer integrals based on their single-crystal structures reveal that the methoxy picenes have intermolecular overlaps less effective than that of the parent nonsubstituted picene. These results are attributed not only to the packing structure but also to electronic structures such as the HOMO distribution. The preliminary OFET of the representative 4c,e showed hole mobilities significantly lower than that of picene due to their less effective intermolecular overlaps, as predicted by the calculated transfer integrals.
24773347,0,2014,Med Chem,Synthesis and biological activity of anthrapyrazoles derivatives as potential antitumor agents.,We have synthesized a series of anthrapyrazoles derivatives. The biological results indicated that these derivatives exhibited potent in vitro cytotoxicity against different cancer cell lines (human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and BEL-7402, human colonic carcinoma HCT-116 and HT-29) and drug-resistant human hepatoma cell line (SMMC-7721). Among them, the polyamine-based anthrapyrazole derivatives 4c and 4f-g showed superior cytotoxicity than that of Mitoxantrone both on cancer cell lines and the drug-resistant subline. However, the DNA relaxation assay revealed that they had insignificant topoisomerase II inhibition. These results clearly indicate that polyamine side chains will have a profound effect on the cytotoxicity of anthrapyrazoles derivatives.
24745932,0,2014,Inorg Chem,Valence state driven site preference in the quaternary compound Ca5MgAgGe5: an electron-deficient phase with optimized bonding.,The quaternary phase Ca5Mg0.95Ag1.05(1)Ge5 (3) was synthesized by high-temperature solid-state techniques, and its crystal structure was determined by single-crystal diffraction methods in the orthorhombic space group Pnma-Wyckoff sequence c(12) with a = 23.1481(4) Å, b = 4.4736(1) Å, c = 11.0128(2) Å, V = 1140.43(4) Å(3), Z = 4. The crystal structure can be described as linear intergrowths of slabs cut from the CaGe (CrB-type) and the CaMGe (TiNiSi-type; M = Mg, Ag) structures. Hence, 3 is a hettotype of the hitherto missing n = 3 member of the structure series with the general formula R(2+n)T2X(2+n), previously described with n = 1, 2, and 4. The member with n = 3 was predicted in the space group Cmcm-Wyckoff sequence f(5)c(2). The experimental space group Pnma (in the nonstandard setting Pmcn) corresponds to a klassengleiche symmetry reduction of index two of the predicted space group Cmcm. This transition originates from the switching of one Ge and one Ag position in the TiNiSi-related slab, a process that triggers an uncoupling of each of the five 8f sites in Cmcm into two 4c sites in Pnma. The Mg/Ag site preference was investigated using VASP calculations and revealed a remarkable example of an intermetallic compound for which the electrostatic valency principle is a critical structure-directing force. The compound is deficient by one valence electron according to the Zintl concept, but LMTO electronic structure calculations indicate electronic stabilization and overall bonding optimization in the polyanionic network. Other stability factors beyond the Zintl concept that may account for the electronic stabilization are discussed.
24736527,0,2014,Epigenetics,The clustering of CpG islands may constitute an important determinant of the 3D organization of interphase chromosomes.,We used the 4C-Seq technique to characterize the genome-wide patterns of spatial contacts of several CpG islands located on chromosome 14 in cultured chicken lymphoid and erythroid cells. We observed a clear tendency for the spatial clustering of CpG islands present on the same and different chromosomes, regardless of the presence or absence of promoters within these CpG islands. Accordingly, we observed preferential spatial contacts between Sp1 binding motifs and other GC-rich genomic elements, including the DNA sequence motifs capable of forming G-quadruplexes. However, an anchor placed in a gene/CpG island-poor area formed spatial contacts with other gene/CpG island-poor areas on chromosome 14 and other chromosomes. These results corroborate the two-compartment model of the spatial organization of interphase chromosomes and suggest that the clustering of CpG islands constitutes an important determinant of the 3D organization of the eukaryotic genome in the cell nucleus. Using the ChIP-Seq technique, we mapped the genome-wide CTCF deposition sites in the chicken lymphoid and erythroid cells that were used for the 4C analysis. We observed a good correlation between the density of CTCF deposition sites and the level of 4C signals for the anchors located in CpG islands but not for an anchor located in a gene desert. It is thus possible that CTCF contributes to the clustering of CpG islands observed in our experiments.
24722946,0,2014,Acta Neurochir (Wien),Visual field findings after a ruptured intracranial aneurysm.,BACKGROUND: Visual field defects (VFDs) negatively affect activities of daily living and rehabilitation following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH). The aim here was to assess VFDs in patients with aSAH and their associations with age, gender, aSAH severity, and clinical outcome.METHODS: Patients admitted to Helsinki University Central Hospital and treated during 2011 were participants in this prospective study. Findings obtained with the Octopus 900 perimeter (Haag-Streit Inc, Koenic, Switzerland), the Goldmann perimeter (Haag-Streit Inc, Bern, Switzerland), or the confrontation visual field test on admission and 3 days, 14 days, 2 to 4 months, and 6 months postoperatively were assigned to 16 classes. Associations between post-chiasmal VFDs and relevant clinical, radiological, and demographic data were analysed with uni- and multivariate logistic regression.RESULTS: Of 105 survivors at 6 months, 20 (19 %) had VFDs occurring for aneurysm- or operation-related reasons; homonymous hemianopias or quadrantanopias were the most common finding, occurring in 16 patients (15 %). Posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy presented in two patients (2 %). Ten survivors (10 %) no longer fulfilled visual field requirements for driving licences. Significant associations emerged between VFDs at 6 months and the Hunt and Hess (H&amp;H), World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS), and Fisher grades on admission, presence of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), hydrocephalus, or postoperative infarction, and higher modified Rankin Scale scores at 6 months. Multivariate logistic regression showed the H&amp;H grade and presence of ICH to independently predict VFDs.CONCLUSIONS: Assessing VFDs is advisable, especially among patients with poor-grade aSAH (H&amp;H grade IV or V) and ICH.
24722585,0,2014,Dalton Trans,Limiting nuclearity in formation of polynuclear metal complexes through [2 + 3] cycloaddition: synthesis and magnetic properties of tri- and pentanuclear metal complexes.,A tridentate ligand p-chloro-2-{(2-(dimethylamino)ethylimino)methyl}phenol (HL) was used to generate an octahedral nickel complex [Ni(L)Cl(H2O)2] 1 which was further converted into a square-planar nickel complex [Ni(L)(N3)] 2. The [2 + 3] cycloaddition reaction between metal coordinated azide 2 and different organonitriles under microwave irradiation afforded tri- and pentanuclear nickel(II) complexes 4a-4c. Reaction with benzonitrile and 3-cyano pyridine furnished the trinuclear species [Ni3L2(5-phenyltetrazolato)4(DMF)2] 4a and [Ni3L2{5-(3-pyridyl)-tetrazolato}4(DMF)2]·2H2O 4b, respectively. The nickel centers were found to be linearly disposed to each other and the complex is formed by a 2,3-tetrazolate bridge and a phenoxo bridge between central and terminal nickel atoms. Compound 2 when treated with 1,2-dicyanobenzene under identical conditions furnished a pentanuclear complex [Ni5L4{5-(2-cyanophenyl)-tetrazolato}4(OH)2(H2O)2]·3H2O·DMF 4c. In this pentanuclear compound two dimeric nickel units are connected to the central nickel center by a μ3-hydroxo bridge and a tetrazolate ligand operating via a relatively rare 1,2,3-bridging mode. The compounds were characterized by IR, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and single crystal X-ray crystallography. The magnetic susceptibility data for compounds 4a-4c show dominant antiferromagnetic interactions between the nickel centers for all the complexes. DFT calculations were performed to investigate the magnetic parameter in one of the complexes 4b by a broken symmetry approach.
24721833,0,2014,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and cellular characterization of novel isoxazolo- and thiazolohydrazinylidene-chroman-2,4-diones on cancer and non-cancer cell growth and death.,Coumarins are extensively studied anticoagulants that exert additional effects such as anticancerogenic and even anti-inflammatory. In order to find new drugs with anticancer activities, we report here the synthesis and the structural analysis of new coumarin derivatives which combine the coumarin core and five member heterocycles in hydrazinylidene-chroman-2,4-diones. The derivatives were prepared by derivatization of the appropriate heterocyclic amines which were used as electrophiles to attack the coumarin ring. The structures were characterized by spectroscopic techniques including IR, NMR, 2D-NMR and MS. These derivatives were further characterized especially in terms of a potential cytotoxic and apoptogenic effect in several cancer cell lines including the breast and prostate cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, PC-3, LNCaP, and the monocytic leukemia cell line U937. Cell viability was determined after 48 h and 72 h of treatment with the novel compounds by MTT assay and the 50% inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) were determined. Out of the 8 novel compounds screened for reduced cell viability, 4c, 4d and 4e were found to be the most promising and effective ones having EC50 values that were several fold reduced when compared to the reference substance 4-hydroxycoumarin. However, the effects were cancer cell line dependent. The breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, the prostate cancer LNCaP cells, and U937 cells were most sensitive, MCF-7 cells were less sensitive, and PC-3 cells were more resistant. Reduced cell viability was accompanied by increased apoptosis as shown by PARP-1 cleavage and reduced activity of the survival protein kinase Akt. In summary, this study has identified three novel coumarin derivatives that in comparison to 4-hydroxycoumarin have a higher efficiency to reduce cancer cell viability and trigger apoptosis and therefore may represent interesting novel drug candidates.
24710628,0,2014,Dalton Trans,Biomimetic polyorganosiloxanes: model compounds for new materials.,The chemistry of N-organosilylalkyl-substituted heterocyclic bases (thymine, adenine and cytosine) is described, covering the structures of model compounds, the synthesis of substituted oligo-siloxanes and a preliminary report of the synthesis of a poly(organosiloxane) with pendant N-alkyl(heterocycle) functionalities. N-Alkenylthymines CH2=CH(CH2)(n)T (T = thymine, n = 1 (1), 2 (2), 3 (3)) have been prepared and 2 hydrosilylated to form PhMe2Si(CH2)4T (5). Alternatively, 5 was prepared by reaction of PhMe2Si(CH2)4Br (6) with (O,O-SiMe3)2T, a method which has also been used to prepare PhMe2Si(CH2)4A (7) and PhMe2Si(CH2)4C (8) (A = adenine, C = cytosine). Model di- and tri-siloxanes [Br(CH2)4(Me)2Si]2O (10), Me3SiOSi(Me)2(CH2)4Br (11), PhMe2SiOSi(Me)2(CH2)4Br (12) and (Me3SiO)2(Me)Si(CH2)4Br (13) have been prepared by hydrosilylation of H2C[double bond, length as m-dash]C(H)(CH2)4Br with an appropriate hydrosiloxane and used to prepare Me3SiO(Me)2Si(CH2)4T (14), Me3SiO(Me)2Si(CH2)4A (15) (both from 11), and (Me3SiO)2(Me)Si(CH2)4T (16), (Me3SiO)2(Me)Si(CH2)4A (17) (both from 13). 10 reacts with thymine to give a mixture of the pyrimidocyclophane cyclo-T-N,N-[(CH2)4(Me)2Si]2O (19) and [T(CH2)4Si(Me)2]2O (20), while cytosine reacts similarly to form cyclo-C-N,N-[(CH2)4(Me)2Si]2O (21; as an imine) and [C(CH2)4Si(Me)2]2O (22); adenine only generates [A(CH2)4Si(Me)2]2O (18) in an analogous synthesis. Using a related protocol, polymeric {[MeSi(O)(CH2)4Br]2[Me2SiO]98}n (23) has been converted to {[MeSi(O)(CH2)4T]2[Me2SiO]98}n (24) and {[MeSi(O)(CH2)4A]2[Me2SiO]98}n (25). The structures of 4, 5, 8, 19 and 21, along with a 2 : 1 adduct of 5 with Ni(dithiobiuret)2 (9) are reported.
24703473,0,2014,Acad Radiol,Technical compliance to standard guidelines for lumbar puncture and myelography: survey of academic neuroradiology attendings and fellows.,RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To assess technical compliance among neuroradiology attendings and fellows to standard guidelines for lumbar puncture and myelography to minimize procedural complications such as iatrogenic meningitis and spinal headache.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We surveyed academic neuroradiology attendings and fellows in the e-mail directory of the Association of Program Directors in Radiology. We queried use of face masks, use of noncutting needles, and dural puncture practices. All data were collected anonymously.RESULTS: A total of 110 survey responses were received: 75 from neuroradiology attendings and 34 from fellows, which represents a 14% response rate from a total of 239 fellows. Forty-seven out of 101 (47%) neuroradiologists do not always wear a face mask during myelograms, and 50 out of 105(48%) neuroradiologists do not always wear a face mask during lumbar punctures, placing patients at risk for iatrogenic meningitis. Ninety-six out of 106 neuroradiologists (91%) use the Quincke cutting needle by default, compared to only 17 out of 109 neuroradiologists (16%) who have ever used noncutting needles proven to reduce spinal headache. Duration of postprocedure bed rest does not influence incidence of spinal headache and may subject patients to unnecessary monitoring. Only 15 out of 109 (14%) neuroradiologists in our study do not prescribe bed rest. There was no statistically significant difference in practice between attendings and fellows.CONCLUSIONS: Iatrogenic meningitis and spinal headache are preventable complications of dural puncture that neuroradiologists can minimize by conforming to procedural guidelines. Wearing face masks and using noncutting spinal needles will reduce patient morbidity and lower hospitalization costs associated with procedural complications.
24701732,0,2014,J Med Assoc Thai,Multicompartment model comparison of body fat assessment in Thai adolescents.,OBJECTIVE: To examine the limits of agreement of percent body fat (%BF) assessed by different compartment models (2C and 3C compared to 4C).MATERIAL AND METHOD: Fifty-one healthy Thai adolescents (25 males and 26 females) aged 16 to 19 years volunteered in the present study. Underwater weighing (UWW) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) were used for measurement of %BF for 2C and 3C models. UWW was also used for body density, DEXA for bone mineral content and protein content, and deuterium oxide dilution method for total body water (TBW), used in Lohman's equation for 4C model.RESULTS: Body density total body water; bone mineral density, and fat free mass were significantly higher in males than in females, whereas females had significantly higher fat than males (p &lt; 0.001). Compared to %BF4C, %BF(UWW) did not show significant deviations from the line of identity in males and females (R2 = 0.85 and 0.75 respectively), whereas %BF(DEXA) showed significant deviations from the line of identity in females (R2 = 0.59), but not in males (R2 = 0.60). Bland &amp; Altman analysis demonstrated that UWW and DEXA tended to underestimate %BF in leaner adolescents and overestimate %BF in fatter adolescents.CONCLUSION: Percent body fat using underwater weighing (2C model) may be used interchangeable with the 4C model in both genders. However; DEXA (3C model) can only be used in males and not in females, which require further research. A regression equation to relate 2C and 3C models to 4C was developed to enable a better estimation of percent body fat in Thai adolescents.
24693404,0,2014,Iran Red Crescent Med J,Association of mammographic density with pathologic findings.,BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and is the first cause of death due to cancer among women. Mammography is the best screening method and mammographic density, which determines the percentage of fibro glandular tissue of breast, is one of the strongest risk factors of breast cancer. Because benign and malignant lesions may present as dense lesions in mammography so it is necessary to take a core biopsy of any suspicious lesions to evaluate pathologic findings.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the association between mammographic density and histopathological findings in Iranian population. Moreover, we assessed the correlation between mammographic density and protein expression profile. We indeed, determined the accuracy and positive predictive value and negative predictive value of mammographic reports in our center.PATIENTS AND METHOD: This study is a cross-sectional study carried out among 131 eligible women who had referred to imaging center for mammographic examination and had been advised to take biopsy of breast tissue. All participants of the study had filled out the informed consent. Pathologic review was performed blinded to the density status. Patients were divided into low density breast tissue group (ACR density group 1-2) and high density breast tissue group (ACR 3, 4) and data was compared between these two groups. Statistical analysis performed using SPSS for windows, version 11.5. We used chi-square, t-test, and logistic regression test for analysis and Odds Ratio calculated where indicated.RESULTS: In patients with high breast densities, malignant cases (61.2%) were significantly more in comparison to patients with low breast densities (37.3%) (P= 0.007, OR=2.66 95% CI=1.29-5.49). After adjusting for age, density was associated with malignancy in age groups &lt;46 years (P=0.007), and 46-60 years (P=0.024) but not in age group &gt;60yrs (P=0.559). Adjusting for menopausal status, density showed association with malignancy in both pre-menopause (P=0.041) and menopause (P=0.010) patients. Using logistic regression test, only age and density showed independent association with risk of breast cancer. No association was found between density and protein profile expression. Mammographic method has a false negative percent of 10.3% for negative BI-RADS group and a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 69.6% for positive BI-RADS group. PPVs for BI-RADS 4a, 4b, 4c and 5 were 16%, 87.5%, 84.6%, and 91.5% respectively. NPVs for BI-RADS 1, 2 and 3 were 66.7%, 95.8% and 90.0% respectively.CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found that increasing in mammographic density is associated with an increase in malignant pathology reports. Expression of ER, PR and HER-2 receptors didn't show association with density. Our mammographic reports had a sensitivity of 94.1% and a specificity of 55.6%, which shows that our mammography is an acceptable method for screening breast cancer in this center.
24686206,0,2014,Steroids,Heterocyclic ring extension of estrone: synthesis and cytotoxicity of fused pyran, pyrimidine and thiazole derivatives.,The one pot reaction of estrone with the aromatic aldehydes 2a-c and either of malononitrile or ethyl cyanoacetate afforded the fused pyran derivatives 4a-f. On the other hand, carrying the same reaction using thiourea instead of the cyanomethylene reagent gave the fused pyrimidine derivatives 6a-c. The latter compounds reacted with phenacyl bromide to give the thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives 8a-c. The reaction of the title compound with bromine gave the monobromo derivative 13 which in turn reacted with either thiourea or cyanothioacetamide to give the thiazole derivatives 14 and 16, respectively. The cytotoxicity of the newly synthesized products was evaluated against six human cancer and normal cell lines where the results showed that compounds 4c, 4f, 6b, 8b, 8c, 10, 13, 16, 18c and 19c exhibited optimal cytotoxic effect against the cancer cell lines, with IC50's in the nM range.
24681981,0,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis, crystal structure and biological evaluation of some novel 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b]-1,3,4-thiadiazoles and 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b]-1,3,4-thiadiazines.,Nitrogen-containing heterocycles are of particular interest and significant importance for the discovery of potent bioactive agents in pharmaceutical industry. The present study reports the synthesis of a library of new conjugated heterocycles including 3,6-disubstituted-1,2,4-triazolo-[3,4-b]-1,3,4-thiadiazoles (4a-g and 5a-e) and 3,6-disubstituted-1,2,4-triazolo-[3,4-b]-1,3,4-thiadiazines (6a-h), by cyclocondensation reaction of 4-amino-5-(pyridin-4-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol 3 with various substituted aromatic acids and phenacyl bromides, respectively. The structures of newly synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy and in case of 4c by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Newly synthesized triazolothiadiazoles and thiadiazines were screened for acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterases and alkaline phosphatase inhibition. Almost all of the compounds showed good to excellent activities against acetylcholinesterase more than the reference drugs. Compound 5d exhibited IC50 value 0.77 ± 0.08 μM against acetylcholinesterase and 4a showed IC50 9.57 ± 1.42 μM against butyrylcholinesterase. Among all the tested compounds, 4a also proved as excellent inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase with IC50 0.92 ± 0.03 μM. These heteroaromatic hybrid structures were also tested for their anticancer activity against lung carcinoma (H157) and kidney fibroblast (BHK-21) cell lines and leishmanias. Variable cell growth inhibitory activities were obtained and many compounds exhibit potent %inhibition.
24675799,0,2014,Dalton Trans,Synthesis and characterisation of the complete series of B-N analogues of triptycene.,The reaction between the bisborate Li2[o-C6H4(BH3)2] and 2 equivalents of an appropriate pyrazole derivative (Hpz(R)) in the presence of Me3SiCl yields o-phenylene-bridged pyrazaboles HB(μ-pz(R))2(μ-o-C6H4)BH (3a-3e; Hpz(R) = 4-iodopyrazole (3a), 4-(trimethylsilyl)pyrazole (3b), 3,5-dimethylpyrazole (3c), 3,5-di(tert-butyl)pyrazole (3d), 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole (3e)). The synthesis approach thus provides access to uncharged B-N triptycenes bearing (i) functionalisable groups, (ii) electron-donating or -withdrawing substituents and (iii) pyrazole rings of varying steric demand. Treatment of p-R*C6H4BBr2 with the potassium tris(pyrazol-1-yl)borates K[HBpz3] or K[p-R*C6H4Bpz3] yields cationic pyrazolyl-bridged pyrazaboles [p-BrC6H4B(μ-pz)3BH]Br ([4a]Br) and [p-R*C6H4B(μ-pz)3Bp-C6H4R*]Br (R* = Br ([4b]Br), I ([4c]Br), SiMe3 ([4d]Br)), which can be regarded as full B-N analogues of triptycene. The B-H bonds of 3b and [4a]Br are unreactive towards tBuC[triple bond, length as m-dash]CH even at temperatures of 80 °C, thereby indicating an appreciable thermal stability of the corresponding B-N cage bonds. Most of the cage compounds are sufficiently inert towards water to allow quick aqueous workup. However, NMR spectroscopy in CD3OD solution reveals degradation of 3b or [4a]Br to the corresponding pyrazoles and o-C6H4(B(OCD3)2)2 or p-BrC6H4B(OCD3)2/B(OCD3)3. The diphenylated species [4b]Br is significantly more stable under the same measurement conditions; even after 76 d, most of the material degrades only to the stage of the syn/anti-pyrazaboles p-BrC6H4(CD3O)B(μ-pz)2B(OCD3)p-C6H4Br (11a/11b). A derivatisation of [4c]Br with nBu3SnC≡CtBu through Stille-type coupling reactions furnishes the alkynyl derivative [p-tBuC≡CC6H4B(μ-pz)3Bp-C6H4C≡CtBu]Br ([4e]Br). Larger B-N aggregates are also accessible: treatment of the tetrakisborate Li4[1,2,4,5-C6H2(BH3)4] with 4 equivalents of Hpz(R) in the presence of Me3SiCl leads to the corresponding B-N pentiptycenes (Hpz(R) = 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole (14a), 4-(trimethylsilyl)pyrazole (14b), 3,5-dimethylpyrazole (14c), 3,5-di(tert-butyl)pyrazole (14d)).
24658688,0,2014,Dalton Trans,Star shaped ferrocenyl truxenes: synthesis, structure and properties.,This article reports the design and synthesis of star shaped, C3-symmetric ferrocenyl substituted truxenes by the Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling and cycloaddition reaction. The single photon absorption and electrochemical properties indicate significant electronic interaction between ferrocene and truxene core. The bathochromic shift in the absorption spectra of truxenes 4a-4c and 5a is a function of enhanced conjugation. The incorporation of tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) results in a strong charge transfer band in truxene 5a. The single crystal structure of truxene 4a is presented, which shows interesting supramolecular interactions.
24656144,0,2014,Cell Commun Signal,Prostaglandin E2 alters Wnt-dependent migration and proliferation in neuroectodermal stem cells: implications for autism spectrum disorders.,Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a natural lipid-derived molecule that is involved in important physiological functions. Abnormal PGE2 signalling has been associated with pathologies of the nervous system. Previous studies provide evidence for the interaction of PGE2 and canonical Wnt signalling pathways in non-neuronal cells. Since the Wnt pathway is crucial in the development and organization of the brain, the main goal of this study is to determine whether collaboration between these pathways exists in neuronal cell types. We report that PGE2 interacts with canonical Wnt signalling through PKA and PI-3K in neuroectodermal (NE-4C) stem cells. We used time-lapse microscopy to determine that PGE2 increases the final distance from origin, path length travelled, and the average speed of migration in Wnt-activated cells. Furthermore, PGE2 alters distinct cellular phenotypes that are characteristic of Wnt-induced NE-4C cells, which corresponds to the modified splitting behaviour of the cells. We also found that in Wnt-induced cells the level of β-catenin protein was increased and the expression levels of Wnt-target genes (Ctnnb1, Ptgs2, Ccnd1, Mmp9) was significantly upregulated in response to PGE2 treatment. This confirms that PGE2 activated the canonical Wnt signalling pathway. Furthermore, the upregulated genes have been previously associated with ASD. Our findings show, for the first time, evidence for cross-talk between PGE2 and Wnt signalling in neuronal cells, where PKA and PI-3K might act as mediators between the two pathways. Given the importance of PGE2 and Wnt signalling in prenatal development of the nervous system, our study provides insight into how interaction between these two pathways may influence neurodevelopment.
24636420,0,2014,Anal Chim Acta,Enantioseparation performance of novel benzimido-β-cyclodextrins derivatized by ionic liquids as chiral stationary phases.,Four novel β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) derivatives functionalized by ionic liquids, in which the substituents and cyclodextrin cavity are linked by a CH2-N=C group, were successfully prepared, and the corresponding chiral stationary phases (CSPs) based on silica gel, namely mono-6-deoxy-6-(p-N,N,N-trimethylaminobenzimide)-β-CD nitrate CSP (4a), mono-6-deoxy-6-(p-N,N,N-trimethylaminobenzimide)-β-CD tosylate CSP (4b), mono-6-deoxy-6-(p-N-methylimidazolemethylbenzimide)-β-CD nitrate CSP (4c) and mono-6-deoxy-6-(p-N-methylimidazolemethylbenzimide)-β-CD tosylate CSP (4d), were applied in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A large number of analytes including chiral 1-phenyl-2-nitroethanol derivatives, aromatic alcohols and ferrocene derivatives were investigated to evaluate the separation performance of the four CSPs, and excellent enantioseparations were obtained for most of the analytes. For 1-phenyl-2-nitroethanol derivatives and aromatic alcohols, the cationic substituent with smaller volume on β-CD derivative was beneficial for the enantioseparation of most compounds. Furthermore, the anion structures on these CSPs play an important role in the separation of solutes. The analytes with smaller molecular volume were more effectively separated on CSP 4b with the tosylate anion by offering hydrogen-bonding and π-π interactions, while the nitrate anions on CSPs 4a and 4c were more favorable for the separation of the compounds with larger volumes due to the weaker steric bulk. The enantiomeric separation results of ferrocene derivatives further showed good separation capability of CSPs 4b and 4c. The cooperation of cationic and anionic substituents on β-CD derivatives is essential for the separation of these chiral compounds.
24619010,0,2014,Phys Chem Chem Phys,Chemical bonding in electron-deficient boron oxide clusters: core boronyl groups, dual 3c-4e hypervalent bonds, and rhombic 4c-4e bonds.,We explore the structural and bonding properties of the electron-deficient boron oxide clusters, using a series of B3On(-/0/+) (n = 2-4) clusters as examples. Global-minimum structures of these boron oxide clusters are identified via unbiased Coalescence Kick and Basin Hopping searches, which show a remarkable size and charge-state dependence. An array of new bonding elements are revealed: core boronyl groups, dual 3c-4e hypervalent bonds (ω-bonds), and rhombic 4c-4e bonds (o-bonds). In favorable cases, oxygen can exhaust all its 2s/2p electrons to facilitate the formation of B-O bonds. The current findings should help understand the bonding nature of low-dimensional boron oxide nanomaterials and bulk boron oxides.
24614092,0,2014,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,Vestibular impairment in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C.,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C (CMT4C) is a hereditary neuropathy with prominent unsteadiness. The objective of the current study is to determine whether the imbalance in CMT4C is caused only by reduced proprioceptive input or if vestibular nerve involvement is an additional factor. We selected 10 CMT4C patients and 10 age-matched and sex-matched controls. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of the vestibular system, including video Head Impulse Test, bithermal caloric test, galvanic stimulation test and skull vibration-induced nystagmus test. None of the patients experienced dizziness, spontaneous or gaze-evoked nystagmus, but all had significant vestibular impairment when tested when compared to controls. Seven had completely unexcitable vestibular systems and abnormal vestibuloocular reflex. There was no correlation between the degree of vestibulopathy and age or clinical severity. Significant vestibular impairment is a consistent finding in CMT4C and is present early in disease evolution. The profound imbalance that is so disabling in these patients may result from a combination of proprioceptive loss and vestibular neuropathy, and this would modify the recommended rehabilitation strategies.
24602793,0,2014,Eur J Med Chem,Identification of human presequence protease (hPreP) agonists for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,Amyloid-β (Aβ), a neurotoxic peptide, is linked to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increased Aβ content within neuronal cell mitochondria is a pathological feature in both human and mouse models with AD. This accumulation of Aβ within the mitochondrial landscape perpetuates increased free radical production and activation of the apoptotic pathway. Human Presequence Protease (hPreP) is responsible for the degradation of mitochondrial amyloid-β peptide in human neuronal cells, and is thus an attractive target to increase the proteolysis of Aβ. Therefore, it offers a potential target for Alzheimer's drug design, by identifying potential activators of hPreP. We applied structure-based drug design, combined with experimental methodologies to investigate the ability of various compounds to enhance hPreP proteolytic activity. Compounds 3c &amp;4c enhanced hPreP-mediated proteolysis of Aβ (1-42), pF₁β (2-54) and fluorogenic-substrate V. These results suggest that activation of hPreP by small benzimidazole derivatives provide a promising avenue for AD treatment.
24601636,0,2014,J Org Chem,Regioselective internal carbonylation of the 2-aza-21-carbaporphyrin: access to configurationally stable chiral porphyrinoids.,Reaction of paraformaldehyde with meso-tetraaryl-2-aza-21-carbaporphyrins (NCP) in the presence of a basic catalyst afforded fused lactam derivatives comprising a &gt;C═O bridge linking the internal carbon C21 with one of the internal nitrogens. The isomer 2 with C21-C(O)-N24 bridge is formed with about 9-fold molar excess over that with C21-C(O)-N22 bridge (3). The (1)H NMR and UV-vis spectral characteristics indicate aromatic character of the derivatives. For meso-tetrakis(3',5'-dimethoxy)- and meso-tetrakis(3',4',5'-trimethoxy)-21,24-carbonyl-NCP an efficient external ring fusion by linking C3, i.e., the external carbon of the confused pyrrole, with an ortho carbon of the adjacent aryl was observed under acidic conditions, yielding derivatives 4c and 4d, comprising a linear system of five fused rings. The chirality and configurational stability of these carbonylated systems were established by a chiral stationary phase HPLC and circular dichroism. The interaction of 2 with chiral acids and alcohols leading to the formation of diastereomers was observed by (1)H NMR. Slow racemization of 2 under acidic conditions was established by HPLC and (1)H NMR and a mechanism for this process was proposed.
24598712,0,2014,Neurology,Pathogenic variants in TUBB4A are not found in primary dystonia.,OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of TUBB4A, recently associated with DYT4 dystonia in a pedigree with &quot;whispering dysphonia&quot; from Norfolk, United Kingdom, to the etiopathogenesis of primary dystonia.METHODS: High-resolution melting and Sanger sequencing were used to inspect the entire coding region of TUBB4A in 575 subjects with primary laryngeal, segmental, or generalized dystonia.RESULTS: No pathogenic variants, including the exon 1 variant (c.4C&gt;G) identified in the DYT4 whispering dysphonia kindred, were found in this study.CONCLUSION: The c.4C&gt;G DYT4 mutation appears to be private, and clinical testing for TUBB4A mutations is not justified in spasmodic dysphonia or other forms of primary dystonia. Moreover, given its allelic association with leukoencephalopathy hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum and protean clinical manifestations (chorea, ataxia, dysarthria, intellectual disability, dysmorphic facial features, and psychiatric disorders), DYT4 should not be categorized as a primary dystonia.
24558069,0,2014,Ann Surg Oncol,Malignancy risk stratification in thyroid nodules with benign results on cytology: combination of thyroid imaging reporting and data system and Bethesda system.,BACKGROUND: The indications of repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for thyroid nodules with benign results of the Bethesda system were investigated.METHODS: A total of 1,398 nodules were classified according to the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS). TIRADS category 3 included nodules without solidity, hypoechogenicity or marked hypoechogenicity, microlobulated or irregular margins, microcalcifications, and taller-than-wide shape on ultrasonography (US). Categories 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 included nodules with one, two, three or four, or five suspicious US features, respectively. The malignancy risks, and odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Analyses were performed for all nodules, nodules &gt;10 mm, and nodules ≤10 mm.RESULTS: Of 1.398 nodules, 43 (3.1 %) were malignanct. The malignancy risks of benign nodules with categories 3, 4a, and 4b were 0.7, 1.2, and 0.7 %, respectively, whereas those for nodules with categories 4c and 5 were 9.8 and 22.2 %, respectively. The ORs of nodules with categories 4c and 5 were 19.4 (95 % CI 5.0-76.2) and 50.6 (95 % CI 10.4-245.0), respectively. In nodules &gt;10 mm, the malignancy risks of categories 4c and 5 were 2.7 and 20 %, respectively, and the ORs were 10.7 (95 % CI 1.2-93.7) and 236.1 (95 % CI 12.6-4426.4), respectively. In nodules ≤ 10 mm, the malignancy risks of categories 4c and 5 were 12.6 and 22.6 %, respectively, and the ORs were 10.1 (95 % CI 1.3-78.0) and 18.9 (95 % CI 2.1-168.9), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat US-guided FNA should be considered in benign thyroid nodules with three or more suspicious US features regardless of size.
24553450,0,2014,Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Guan-Din method: a novel surgical technique for selective thoracic fusion to maximize the rate of selective thoracic fusion and compensatory correction.,STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective radiographical review.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of selective thoracic fusion (STF) by using the Guan-Din method for the treatment of major thoracic compensatory lumbar (MTCL) curves.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Performing STF for MTCL curves is to minimize the loss of lumbar motion and the risk of lumbar degeneration or pain. Surgical treatment of MTCL curves aims to maximize the rate of STF for MTCL curves while optimizing instrumental thoracic and compensatory lumbar correction. The Guan-Din method has been demonstrated to be able to enhance the lumbar curve's capacity for spontaneous correction and broaden the current curve criteria of MTCL curves for STF.METHODS: Between 2004 and 2010, 510 consecutive surgically treated MTCL curves were reviewed. Of these MTCL curves, who met the criteria of lumbar side bending Cobb 35° or less and without global thoracic hyperkyphosis and/or thoracolumbar kyphosis (T10-L2 ≤20°), were treated with STF using the Guan-Din method. Radiographs were analyzed before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the most recent follow-up (range, 2-8 yr).RESULTS: Curve types of 510 MTCL curves according to Lenke system were as follows: 1A (n = 91), 2A (n = 74), 3A (n = 6), 4A (n = 2), 1B (n = 93), 2B (n = 34), 3B (n = 8), 4B (n = 5), 1C (n = 84), 2C (n = 26), 3C (n = 72), and 4C (n = 15). Of the 510 MTCL curves, 458 (90%) curves were treated with STF. A mean 73% thoracic correction and 63% lumbar correction was obtained at the most recent follow-up. Of the 197 surgically treated MTCL curves with a lumbar C modifier, 148 (75%) curves that contained 57 Lenke 1C and 2C curves and 40 Lenke 3C and 4C curves that did not meet Lenke curve criteria for STF, were successfully treated with STF. A mean 67% thoracic correction and 57% lumbar correction was obtained at the most recent follow-up. The rate of STF and the magnitude of correction of MTCL curves in this study were significantly greater than those in all other reports. No significant change in global coronal and sagittal imbalance was observed.CONCLUSION: The rate of STF and the compensatory correction of MTCL curves could be maximized by using the Guan-Din method as the method for STF.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.
24552126,0,2014,Org Lett,3-Center-5-electron boryl radicals with σ(0)π(1) ground state electronic structure.,Five- and six-membered boron heterocycle-based three-center-five-electron (3c-5e) type boryl radicals with unusual σ(0)π(1) ground state electronic structures are predicted theoretically. Compared to σ(1)π(0) analogs, their unique electronic structure leads to both lower reactivity toward H-atoms and stronger coordination with Lewis bases. The corresponding Lewis base-stabilized four-center-seven-electron (4c-7e) type boryl radicals are even more unreactive toward H-atoms than the conventional 4c-7e ones.
24526453,0,2014,J Appl Genet,The genetics of resistance to powdery mildew in cultivated oats (Avena sativa L.): current status of major genes.,The genetics of resistance to powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. avenae of four cultivated oats was studied using monosomic analysis. Cultivar 'Bruno' carries a gene (Pm6) that shows a recessive mode of inheritance and is located on chromosome 10D. Cultivar 'Jumbo' possesses a dominant resistance gene (Pm1) on chromosome 1C. In cultivar 'Rollo', in addition to the gene Pm3 on chromosome 17A, a second dominant resistance gene (Pm8) was identified and assigned to chromosome 4C. In breeding line APR 122, resistance was conditioned by a dominant resistance gene (Pm7) that was allocated to chromosome 13A. Genetic maps established for resistance genes Pm1, Pm6 and Pm7 employing amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers indicated that these genes are independent of each other, supporting the results from monosomic analysis.
24499256,0,2014,Int J Clin Pract,Is Clostridium difficile associated with the '4C' antibiotics? A retrospective observational study in diabetic foot ulcer patients.,AIMS: Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic cytotoxin-producing bacterium that can cause infectious diarrhoea, pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. The major risk factors for developing C. difficile infection include recent or current antimicrobial use, diabetes, age over 65, proton pump inhibitor use, immunosuppression and previous infection with C. difficile. Most diabetic foot ulcers are polymicrobial.METHODS: As a result guidelines advise treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics which include the '4C's' (clindamycin, cephalosporins, co-amoxiclav and ciprofloxacin) which are associated with a higher risk of C. difficile infection. Retrospective observational data (June 2008 to January 2012) for the diabetes foot ulcers were gathered from the Diabetes/Podiatry Clinic database in NHS Ayrshire and Arran and cross-matched with the NHS Ayrshire and Arran Microbiology database. There were 111 patients with mean age 59 years (range 24-94 years), 33 type 1 patients, 78 type 2 patients, mean duration of diabetes 16 years (6 months-37 years) and mean HbA1c 67 mmol/mol (54-108 mmol/mol) [8.3% (7.1-12%)].RESULTS: The total number of days antimicrobials prescribed for all patients was 7938 (mean number of antimicrobial days per patient = 71.5 days). There was one case of C. difficile infection of 111 patients giving an incidence of 1.25 cases per 10,000 patient-days of antibiotics/1 case per 209 foot ulcers.CONCLUSIONS: Large doses, numbers and greater duration of antibiotic therapy all result in a greater degree of normal gut flora depletion. It is possible that the alterations in gut flora in diabetic foot ulcer patients protect them from antibiotic-induced C. difficile overgrowth.
24484681,0,2014,Nutrition,The four-compartment model of body composition in obese Chilean schoolchildren, by pubertal stage: comparison with simpler models.,OBJECTIVES: We assessed the agreement of body fat and fat-free mass measured by simpler methods against the four-compartment model (4C).METHODS: In 60 obese schoolchildren (body mass index ≥95th percentile) between the ages of 8 and 13 y who were recruited from one school in Chile, multicompartmental body composition was estimated with the use of isotopic dilution, plethysmography (BodPod), radiographic absorptiometry (DEXA), and anthropometric equations. These results were compared to those of the 4C model, which is considered the gold standard.RESULTS: For body fat, the 4C model showed the best agreement with DEXA for boys in Tanner stages I and II (r = 0.971) and with isotopic dilution for boys in Tanner stages III and IV (r = 0.984). The best agreement in girls occurred with isotopic dilution, regardless of pubertal stage (r = 0.948 for Tanner stages I and II; r = 0.978 for Tanner stages III and IV). Both isotopic dilution and the Huang, Ellis, and Deurenberg anthropometric equations underestimated body fat in boys; by contrast, DEXA, BodPod, and the Slaughter equation overestimated body fat in boys. All of the equations underestimated body fat in girls. For fat-free mass in both boys and girls, the 4C model showed the best agreement with isotopic dilution, regardless of pubertal stage. The Huang equation showed the best agreement for boys (r = 0.730 for Tanner stages I and II; r = 0.695 for Tanner stages III and IV) and for girls in Tanner stages I and II (r = 0.884). The Ellis equation had the best agreement for girls in Tanner stages III and IV (r = 0.917).CONCLUSIONS: For obese Chilean children of both sexes, isotopic dilution and DEXA were the two-compartment methods that had the best agreement with the gold-standard 4C model for both body fat and fat-free mass; these were followed by the Huang and Ellis anthropometric equations.
24465835,0,2014,PLoS One,Nuclear DNA content variation in life history phases of the Bonnemasoniaceae (Rhodophyta).,Nuclear DNA content in gametophytes and sporophytes or the prostrate phases of the following species of Bonnemaisoniaceae (Asparagopsis armata, Asparagopsis taxiformis, Bonnemaisonia asparagoides, Bonnemaisonia clavata and Bonnemaisonia hamifera) were estimated by image analysis and static microspectrophotometry using the DNA-localizing fluorochrome DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dilactate) and the chicken erythrocytes standard. These estimates expand on the Kew database of DNA nuclear content. DNA content values for 1C nuclei in the gametophytes (spermatia and vegetative cells) range from 0.5 pg to 0.8 pg, and for 2C nuclei in the sporophytes or the prostrate phases range from 1.15-1.7 pg. Although only the 2C and 4C values were observed in the sporophyte or the prostrate phase, in the vegetative cells of the gametophyte the values oscillated from 1C to 4C, showing the possible start of endopolyploidy. The results confirm the alternation of nuclear phases in these Bonnemaisoniaceae species, in those that have tetrasporogenesis, as well as those that have somatic meiosis. The availability of a consensus phylogenetic tree for Bonnemaisoniaceae has opened the way to determine evolutionary trends in DNA contents. Both the estimated genome sizes and the published chromosome numbers for Bonnemaisoniaceae suggest a narrow range of values consistent with the conservation of an ancestral genome.
24459259,0,2014,Genome Announc,Draft Genome Sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAM34-4C, a Lactic Acid-Assimilating Industrial Yeast Strain.,We determined the genome sequence of industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain NAM34-4C, which would be useful for bioethanol production. The approximately 11.5-Mb draft genome sequence of NAM34-4C will provide remarkable insights into metabolic engineering for effective production of bioethanol from biomass.
24459063,0,2014,Diabetes Metab Res Rev,Effect of linagliptin compared with glimepiride on postprandial glucose metabolism, islet cell function and vascular function parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving ongoing metformin treatment.,BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of linagliptin compared with glimepiride on alpha and beta cell function and several vascular biomarkers after a standardized test meal.METHODS: Thirty-nine patients on metformin alone (age, 64 ± 7 years; duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 7.8 ± 4.5years, 27 male, 12 female; HbA1c , 57.2 ± 6.9 mmol/mol; mean ± SD) were randomized to receive linagliptin 5 mg (n = 19) or glimepiride (n = 20) for a study duration of 12 weeks. Glucagon-like peptide 1, blood glucose, insulin, intact proinsulin, glucagon, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), cyclic guanosinmonophosphat and asymetric dimethylarginin levels were measured in the fasting state and postprandial at 30-min intervals for a duration of 5 h. The areas under the curve (AUC0-300 min ) were calculated for group comparisons.RESULTS: HbA1c , fasting and postprandial glucose levels improved in both groups. An increase in postprandial insulin (22595 ± 5984 pmol/L*min), postprandial intact proinsulin (1359 ± 658 pmol/L*min), postprandial glucagon (317 ± 1136 pg/mL*min) and postprandial PAI-1 levels (863 ± 467 ng/mL*min) could be observed during treatment with glimepiride, whereas treatment with linagliptin was associated with a decrease in postprandial insulin (-8007 ± 4204 pmol/L*min), intact proinsulin (-1771 ± 426 pmol/L*min), postprandial glucagon (-1597 ± 1831 pg/mL*min) and PAI-1 levels (-410 ± 276 ng/mL*min).CONCLUSIONS: Despite an improvement in blood glucose control in both groups, linagliptin reduced postprandial insulin, proinsulin, glucagon and PAI-levels. These results indicate an improvement in postprandial alpha and beta cell function, as well as a reduced postprandial vascular risk profile during treatment with linagliptin.
24456490,0,2014,J Med Chem,Synthesis and anti-renal fibrosis activity of conformationally locked truncated 2-hexynyl-N(6)-substituted-(N)-methanocarba-nucleosides as A3 adenosine receptor antagonists and partial agonists.,Truncated N(6)-substituted-(N)-methanocarba-adenosine derivatives with 2-hexynyl substitution were synthesized to examine parallels with corresponding 4'-thioadenosines. Hydrophobic N(6) and/or C2 substituents were tolerated in A3AR binding, but only an unsubstituted 6-amino group with a C2-hexynyl group promoted high hA2AAR affinity. A small hydrophobic alkyl (4b and 4c) or N(6)-cycloalkyl group (4d) showed excellent binding affinity at the hA3AR and was better than an unsubstituted free amino group (4a). A3AR affinities of 3-halobenzylamine derivatives 4f-4i did not differ significantly, with Ki values of 7.8-16.0 nM. N(6)-Methyl derivative 4b (Ki = 4.9 nM) was a highly selective, low efficacy partial A3AR agonist. All compounds were screened for renoprotective effects in human TGF-β1-stimulated mProx tubular cells, a kidney fibrosis model. Most compounds strongly inhibited TGF-β1-induced collagen I upregulation, and their A3AR binding affinities were proportional to antifibrotic effects; 4b was most potent (IC50 = 0.83 μM), indicating its potential as a good therapeutic candidate for treating renal fibrosis.
24454015,0,2014,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,Redetermination of Dy3Ni from single-crystal X-ray data.,The classification of the title compound, tridysprosium nickel, into the Fe3C (or Al3Ni) structure type has been deduced from powder X-ray diffraction data with lattice parameters reported in a previous study [Lemaire &amp; Paccard (1967 ▶). Bull. Soc. Fr. Mineral. Cristallogr. 40, 311-315]. The current re-investigation of Dy3Ni based on single-crystal X-ray data revealed atomic positional parameters and anisotropic displacement parameters with high precision. The asymmetric unit consists of two Dy and one Ni atoms. One Dy atom has site symmetry .m. (Wyckoff position 4c) and is surrounded by twelve Dy and three Ni atoms. The other Dy atom (site symmetry 1, 8d) has eleven Dy and three Ni atoms as neighbours, forming a distorted Frank-Kasper polyhedron. The coordination polyhedron of the Ni atom (.m., 4c) is a tricapped trigonal prism formed by nine Dy atoms.
24448887,0,2014,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis and anticonvulsant activity evaluation of 7-alkoxy[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b]benzothiazol-3(2H)-ones.,A new series of 7-alkoxy[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b]benzothiazol-3(2H)-ones were synthesized and evaluated for their anticonvulsant activities. Among these compounds, 7-propoxy[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b]benzothiazol-3(2H)-one (4c) and 7-butoxy[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b]benzothiazol-3(2H)-one (4d) showed the highest activity against maximal electroshock (MES)-induced tonic extension [effective dose (ED)50 : 11.4 and 13.6 mg/kg, respectively]. It is worth mentioning that compound 4d showed especially low neurotoxicity, which led to a high protective index (PI &gt;51). The orally anticonvulsant activity data of compound 4d further confirmed its efficacy, in an MES test, and its high safety with a PI value of 50.2. In addition, the potency of compound 4h against seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, and bicuculline in the chemical-induced seizure tests suggested that compound 4d may exert its anticonvulsant activity through affecting the GABAergic system.
24446205,0,2014,Drug Res (Stuttg),Synthesis and antitubercular activity of novel 3,5-diaryl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole derivatives.,Novel 3,5-diaryl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole derivatives were efficiently synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB). The chemical structures of the compound were elucidated by elemental analysis, FTIR, (1)H NMR, and mass spectral data. Most of the title compounds have exhibited significant antitubercular activity. Compounds 4g, 4h, 4l, 4n and 4o showed pronounced antitubercular activity comparable to the reference isoniazid, whereas, compounds 4a, 4c, 4j, 4k, and 4p displayed good antitubercular activity. 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-p-tolylpyrazol-1-yl-(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazol-5-yl)methanone (4g) was found to be the most promising compound with MIC values of 0.39 µg/ml.
24440598,0,2014,Int J Psychophysiol,A few observations on linking VEP responses to the magno- and parvocellular systems by way of contrast-response functions.,It has been proposed that magno- and parvocellular contributions to Visually Evoked Potentials (VEPs) can be isolated, or differentiated, by noting the contrast-response relationships of the responses. This suggestion is examined quantitatively by determining the similarity between various sets of VEP data that have been attributed to the magno- and parvocellular systems and previously reported contrast-response functions for different kinds of neurons (magno- and parvocellular neurons and V1, V4, and MT cells) and combinations of the contrast-response functions for these neurons. It is found that other neurons, or combinations of other neurons, typically give better fits to the data than do magno- and parvocellular cells. Thus, to attribute VEP responses to the magno- or parvocellular systems based on contrast-responses properties faces difficulties.
24428747,0,2014,J Phys Chem A,Complexes between planar boron clusters and transition metals: a photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio study of CoB12(-) and RhB12(-).,Small boron clusters are known to be planar, and may be used as ligands to form novel coordination complexes with transition metals. Here we report a combined photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio study of CoB12(-) and RhB12(-). Photoelectron spectra of the two doped-B12 clusters show similar spectral patterns, suggesting they have similar structures. Global minimum searches reveal that both CoB12(-) and RhB12(-) possess half-sandwich-type structures with the quasi-planar B12 moiety coordinating to the metal atom. The B12 ligand is found to have similar structure as the bare B12 cluster with C3v symmetry. Structures with Co or Rh inserted into the quasi-planar boron framework are found to be much higher in energy. Chemical bonding analyses of the two B12 half sandwiches reveal two sets of σ bonds on the boron unit: nine classical two-center-two-electron (2c-2e) σ bonds on the periphery of the B12 unit and four 3c-2e σ bonds within the boron unit. Both σ and π bonds are found between the metal and the B12 ligand: three M-B single σ bonds and one delocalized 4c-2e π bond. The exposed metal sites in these complexes can be further coordinated by other ligands or become reaction centers as model catalysts.
24423830,0,2014,J Appl Clin Med Phys,Comparing gamma knife and cyberknife in patients with brain metastases.,The authors compared the relative dosimetric merits of Gamma Knife (GK) and CyberKnife (CK) in 15 patients with 26 brain metastases. All patients were initially treated with the Leksell GK 4C. The same patients were used to generate comparative CK treatment plans. The tissue volume receiving more than 12 Gy (V12), the difference between V12 and tumor volume (V12net), homogeneity index (HI), and gradient indices (GI25, GI50) were calculated. Peripheral dose falloff and three conformity indices were compared. The median tumor volume was 2.50 cm3 (range, 0.044-19.9). A median dose of 18 Gy (range, 15-22) was prescribed. In GK and CK plans, doses were prescribed to the 40-50% and 77-92% isodose lines, respectively. Comparing GK to CK, the respective parametric values (median ± standard deviation) were: minimum dose (18.2 ± 3.4 vs. 17.6 ± 2.4 Gy, p = 0.395); mean dose (29.6 ± 5.1 vs. 20.6 ± 2.8 Gy, p &amp;lt; 0.00001); maximum dose (40.3 ± 6.5 vs. 22.7 ± 3.3 Gy, p &amp;lt; 0.00001); and HI (2.22 ± 0.19 vs. 1.18 ± 0.06, p &amp;lt; 0.00001). The median dosimetric indices (GK vs. CK, with range) were: RTOG_CI, 1.76 (1.12-4.14) vs. 1.53 (1.16-2.12), p = 0.0220; CI, 1.76 (1.15-4.14) vs. 1.55 (1.18-2.21), p = 0.050; nCI, 1.76 (1.59-4.14) vs. 1.57 (1.20-2.30), p = 0.082; GI50, 2.91 (2.48-3.67) vs. 4.90 (3.42-11.68), p &amp;lt; 0.00001; GI25, 6.58 (4.18-10.20) vs. 14.85 (8.80-48.37), p &amp;lt; 0.00001. Average volume ratio (AVR) differences favored GK at multiple normalized isodose levels (p &amp;lt; 0.00001). We concluded that in patients with brain metastases, CK and GK resulted in dosimetrically comparable plans that were nearly equivalent in several metrics, including target coverage and minimum dose within the target. Compared to GK, CK produced more homogenous plans with significantly lower mean and maximum doses, and achieved more conformal plans by RTOG_CI criteria. By GI and AVR analyses, GK plans had sharper peripheral dose falloff in most cases.
24413258,0,2014,J Inorg Biochem,Synthesis and ESI mass spectrometric analysis of the association of mercury(II) with multi-cysteinyl peptides.,In order to gain more insight into the associations of mercury(II) with cysteinyl peptides, we investigated the effect of increasing cysteinyl residues on complex type formations. Three series of di-, tri-, and tetra-cysteinyl peptides, D[CGD]nCG (CP 2A, CP 3A, and CP 4A), E[CEG]nCG (CP 2B, CP 3B, and CP 4B) and E[CDG]nCG (CP 2C, CP 3C, and CP 4C), where n=1, 2, or 3, were prepared by microwave-assisted solid phase peptide synthesis. Complexes formed in different relative ratios of mercury(II) to cysteinyl peptides were characterized by electrospray orbitrap mass spectrometry utilizing complex specific mercury isotopic patterns. In equimolar mercury(II) to peptide ratio, all three series of di-, tri-, and tetra-cysteinyl peptides form predominantly the 1:1Hg(peptide) complex type, indicating that the intervening amino acid residues do not elicit preferential complex type formation. However, in non-equivalent mercury(II) to peptide ratio, the number of cysteinyl residues has a significant effect on the Hg:peptide stoichiometry in the complex formed. For example, in four times excess peptide, the 1:2Hg(peptide)2 and 1:1Hg(peptide) complexes are formed for di-cysteinyl peptides but not for the tri- and tetra-cysteinyl peptides. In contrast, the 2:1Hg2(peptide) and 1:1Hg(peptide) complexes are formed for the tri- and tetra-cysteinyl peptides. In excess mercury(II), CP 4C formed exclusively the 2:1Hg2(peptide) complex. The exact number of deprotonations observed for each complex could be derived from its signature mercury isotope pattern and monoisotopic peak mass. These multi-cysteinyl peptides present an attractive option for mercury chelation or environmental heavy metal remediation.
24380676,0,2014,Brain Res,Changes in the GRIP 1&amp;2 scaffolding proteins in the cerebellum of the ataxic stargazer mouse.,Glutamate receptor-interacting proteins (GRIP1&amp;2) and protein-interacting with C kinase-1 (PICK1) are synaptic scaffold proteins associated with the stabilization and recycling of synaptic GluA2-, 3- and 4c-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). PICK1-mediated phosphorylation of GluA serine880 uncouples GRIP1&amp;2 leading to AMPAR endocytosis, important in mediating forms of synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. Ataxic and epileptic stargazer mice possess a mutation in the CACNG2 gene encoding the transmembrane AMPAR-regulatory protein (TARP)-γ2 (stargazin). TARPs are AMPAR-auxiliary subunits required for efficient AMPAR trafficking to synapses. Stargazin is abundantly expressed in the cerebellum and its loss results in severe deficits in AMPAR trafficking to cerebellar synapses, particularly at granule cell (GC) synapses, leading to the ataxic phenotype of stargazers. However, how the stargazin mutation impacts on the expression of other AMPAR-interacting scaffold proteins is unknown. This study shows a significant increase in GRIP1&amp;2, but not PICK1, levels in whole tissue and synapse-enriched extracts from stargazer cerebella. Post-embedding immunogold-cytochemistry electron microscopy showed GRIP1&amp;2 levels were unchanged at mossy fiber-GC synapses in stargazers, which are silent due to virtual total absence of synaptic and extrasynaptic GluA2/3-AMPARs. These results indicate that loss of synaptic AMPARs at this excitatory synapse does not affect GRIP1&amp;2 expression within the postsynaptic region of mossy fiber-GC synapses. Interestingly, increased GRIP and reduced GluA2-AMPARexpression also occur in cerebella of autistic patients. Further research establishing the role of elevated cerebellar GRIP1&amp;2 in stargazers may help identify common cellular mechanisms in the comorbid disorders ataxia, epilepsy and autism leading to more effective treatment strategies.
25861932,0,2014,Biotechniques,Comparative analysis of T4 DNA ligases and DNA polymerases used in chromosome conformation capture assays.,Three-dimensional (3-D) genome organization in the nuclear space affects various genomic functions. Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C-seq) is a powerful technique that allows researchers to measure long-range chromosomal interactions with a locus of interest across the entire genome. This method relies on enzymatic cleavage of cross-linked chromatin and consecutive ligation to create ligation junctions between physically adjacent loci, followed by PCR amplification of locus-specific associating loci. The enzymes used must meet 4C standards because variations in their efficiency and performance may affect the quality of the obtained data. Here we systematically compare the efficiency and reliability of different T4 DNA ligases and PCR DNA polymerases, assessing the most critical and technically challenging steps in 4C. The results of this analysis enable the use of cost-effective enzymes with superior specificity and efficiency for 4C and save time in screening for appropriate primers. This information provides users with flexibility in their experimental design and guidelines for adapting and testing any enzyme of choice for obtaining standardized results.
23657480,70,2013,Nat Rev Genet,Exploring the three-dimensional organization of genomes: interpreting chromatin interaction data.,How DNA is organized in three dimensions inside the cell nucleus and how this affects the ways in which cells access, read and interpret genetic information are among the longest standing questions in cell biology. Using newly developed molecular, genomic and computational approaches based on the chromosome conformation capture technology (such as 3C, 4C, 5C and Hi-C), the spatial organization of genomes is being explored at unprecedented resolution. Interpreting the increasingly large chromatin interaction data sets is now posing novel challenges. Here we describe several types of statistical and computational approaches that have recently been developed to analyse chromatin interaction data.
24335803,34,2013,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Cohesin and CTCF differentially affect chromatin architecture and gene expression in human cells.,Recent studies of genome-wide chromatin interactions have revealed that the human genome is partitioned into many self-associating topological domains. The boundary sequences between domains are enriched for binding sites of CTCC-binding factor (CTCF) and the cohesin complex, implicating these two factors in the establishment or maintenance of topological domains. To determine the role of cohesin and CTCF in higher-order chromatin architecture in human cells, we depleted the cohesin complex or CTCF and examined the consequences of loss of these factors on higher-order chromatin organization, as well as the transcriptome. We observed a general loss of local chromatin interactions upon disruption of cohesin, but the topological domains remain intact. However, we found that depletion of CTCF not only reduced intradomain interactions but also increased interdomain interactions. Furthermore, distinct groups of genes become misregulated upon depletion of cohesin and CTCF. Taken together, these observations suggest that CTCF and cohesin contribute differentially to chromatin organization and gene regulation.
23747203,33,2013,Cell Stem Cell,Klf4 organizes long-range chromosomal interactions with the oct4 locus in reprogramming and pluripotency.,Epigenetic mechanisms underlying somatic reprogramming have been extensively studied, but little is known about the nuclear architecture of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Using circular chromosome conformation capture with high-throughput sequencing (4C-seq) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we identified chromosomal regions that colocalize frequently with the Oct4 locus in PSCs. These PSC-specific long-range interactions are established prior to transcriptional activation of endogenous Oct4 during reprogramming to induced PSCs and are facilitated by Klf4-mediated recruitment of cohesin. Depletion of Klf4 leads to unloading of cohesin at the Oct4 enhancer and disrupts long-range interactions prior to loss of Oct4 transcription and subsequent PSC differentiation, suggesting a causative role for Klf4 in facilitating long-range interactions independent of its transcriptional activity. Taken together, our results delineate the basic nuclear organization at the Oct4 locus in PSCs and suggest a functional role for Klf4-mediated higher-order chromatin structure in maintaining and inducing pluripotency.
23411633,17,2013,Nat Protoc,Multiplexed chromosome conformation capture sequencing for rapid genome-scale high-resolution detection of long-range chromatin interactions.,Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology is a powerful and increasingly popular tool for analyzing the spatial organization of genomes. Several 3C variants have been developed (e.g., 4C, 5C, ChIA-PET, Hi-C), allowing large-scale mapping of long-range genomic interactions. Here we describe multiplexed 3C sequencing (3C-seq), a 4C variant coupled to next-generation sequencing, allowing genome-scale detection of long-range interactions with candidate regions. Compared with several other available techniques, 3C-seq offers a superior resolution (typically single restriction fragment resolution; approximately 1-8 kb on average) and can be applied in a semi-high-throughput fashion. It allows the assessment of long-range interactions of up to 192 genes or regions of interest in parallel by multiplexing library sequencing. This renders multiplexed 3C-seq an inexpensive, quick (total hands-on time of 2 weeks) and efficient method that is ideal for the in-depth analysis of complex genetic loci. The preparation of multiplexed 3C-seq libraries can be performed by any investigator with basic skills in molecular biology techniques. Data analysis requires basic expertise in bioinformatics and in Linux and Python environments. The protocol describes all materials, critical steps and bioinformatics tools required for successful application of 3C-seq technology.
23448316,15,2013,J Med Chem,Antitrypanosomal lead discovery: identification of a ligand-efficient inhibitor of Trypanosoma cruzi CYP51 and parasite growth.,Chagas disease is caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosomal cruzi , and current drugs are lacking in terms of desired safety and efficacy profiles. Following on a recently reported high-throughput screening campaign, we have explored initial structure-activity relationships around a class of imidazole-based compounds. This profiling has uncovered compounds 4c (NEU321) and 4j (NEU704), which are potent against in vitro cultures of T. cruzi and are greater than 160-fold selective over host cells. We report in vitro drug metabolism and properties profiling of 4c and show that this chemotype inhibits the T. cruzi CYP51 enzyme, an observation confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. We compare the binding orientation of 4c to that of other, previously reported inhibitors. We show that 4c displays a significantly better ligand efficiency and a shorter synthetic route over previously disclosed CYP51 inhibitors, and should therefore be considered a promising lead compound for further optimization.
23339658,13,2013,BMC Genomics,Reassessment of the Listeria monocytogenes pan-genome reveals dynamic integration hotspots and mobile genetic elements as major components of the accessory genome.,BACKGROUND: Listeria monocytogenes is an important food-borne pathogen and model organism for host-pathogen interaction, thus representing an invaluable target considering research on the forces governing the evolution of such microbes. The diversity of this species has not been exhaustively explored yet, as previous efforts have focused on analyses of serotypes primarily implicated in human listeriosis. We conducted complete genome sequencing of 11 strains employing 454 GS FLX technology, thereby achieving full coverage of all serotypes including the first complete strains of serotypes 1/2b, 3c, 3b, 4c, 4d, and 4e. These were comparatively analyzed in conjunction with publicly available data and assessed for pathogenicity in the Galleria mellonella insect model.RESULTS: The species pan-genome of L. monocytogenes is highly stable but open, suggesting an ability to adapt to new niches by generating or including new genetic information. The majority of gene-scale differences represented by the accessory genome resulted from nine hyper variable hotspots, a similar number of different prophages, three transposons (Tn916, Tn554, IS3-like), and two mobilizable islands. Only a subset of strains showed CRISPR/Cas bacteriophage resistance systems of different subtypes, suggesting a supplementary function in maintenance of chromosomal stability. Multiple phylogenetic branches of the genus Listeria imply long common histories of strains of each lineage as revealed by a SNP-based core genome tree highlighting the impact of small mutations for the evolution of species L. monocytogenes. Frequent loss or truncation of genes described to be vital for virulence or pathogenicity was confirmed as a recurring pattern, especially for strains belonging to lineages III and II. New candidate genes implicated in virulence function were predicted based on functional domains and phylogenetic distribution. A comparative analysis of small regulatory RNA candidates supports observations of a differential distribution of trans-encoded RNA, hinting at a diverse range of adaptations and regulatory impact.CONCLUSIONS: This study determined commonly occurring hyper variable hotspots and mobile elements as primary effectors of quantitative gene-scale evolution of species L. monocytogenes, while gene decay and SNPs seem to represent major factors influencing long-term evolution. The discovery of common and disparately distributed genes considering lineages, serogroups, serotypes and strains of species L. monocytogenes will assist in diagnostic, phylogenetic and functional research, supported by the comparative genomic GECO-LisDB analysis server (http://bioinfo.mikrobio.med.uni-giessen.de/geco2lisdb).
24109239,10,2013,J Virol,Merkel cell polyomavirus small T antigen targets the NEMO adaptor protein to disrupt inflammatory signaling.,Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive nonmelanoma skin cancer arising from epidermal mechanoreceptor Merkel cells. In 2008, a novel human polyomavirus, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), was identified and is strongly implicated in MCC pathogenesis. Currently, little is known regarding the virus-host cell interactions which support virus replication and virus-induced mechanisms in cellular transformation and metastasis. Here we identify a new function of MCPyV small T antigen (ST) as an inhibitor of NF-κB-mediated transcription. This effect is due to an interaction between MCPyV ST and the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) adaptor protein. MCPyV ST expression inhibits IκB kinase α (IKKα)/IKKβ-mediated IκB phosphorylation, which limits translocation of the NF-κB heterodimer to the nucleus. Regulation of this process involves a previously undescribed interaction between MCPyV ST and the cellular phosphatase subunits, protein phosphatase 4C (PP4C) and/or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) Aβ, but not PP2A Aα. Together, these results highlight a novel function of MCPyV ST to subvert the innate immune response, allowing establishment of early or persistent infection within the host cell.
23468662,10,2013,PLoS Genet,CELF family RNA-binding protein UNC-75 regulates two sets of mutually exclusive exons of the unc-32 gene in neuron-specific manners in Caenorhabditis elegans.,An enormous number of alternative pre-mRNA splicing patterns in multicellular organisms are coordinately defined by a limited number of regulatory proteins and cis elements. Mutually exclusive alternative splicing should be strictly regulated and is a challenging model for elucidating regulation mechanisms. Here we provide models of the regulation of two sets of mutually exclusive exons, 4a-4c and 7a-7b, of the Caenorhabditis elegans uncoordinated (unc)-32 gene, encoding the a subunit of V0 complex of vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPases. We visualize selection patterns of exon 4 and exon 7 in vivo by utilizing a trio and a pair of symmetric fluorescence splicing reporter minigenes, respectively, to demonstrate that they are regulated in tissue-specific manners. Genetic analyses reveal that RBFOX family RNA-binding proteins ASD-1 and FOX-1 and a UGCAUG stretch in intron 7b are involved in the neuron-specific selection of exon 7a. Through further forward genetic screening, we identify UNC-75, a neuron-specific CELF family RNA-binding protein of unknown function, as an essential regulator for the exon 7a selection. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays specify a short fragment in intron 7a as the recognition site for UNC-75 and demonstrate that UNC-75 specifically binds via its three RNA recognition motifs to the element including a UUGUUGUGUUGU stretch. The UUGUUGUGUUGU stretch in the reporter minigenes is actually required for the selection of exon 7a in the nervous system. We compare the amounts of partially spliced RNAs in the wild-type and unc-75 mutant backgrounds and raise a model for the mutually exclusive selection of unc-32 exon 7 by the RBFOX family and UNC-75. The neuron-specific selection of unc-32 exon 4b is also regulated by UNC-75 and the unc-75 mutation suppresses the Unc phenotype of the exon-4b-specific allele of unc-32 mutants. Taken together, UNC-75 is the neuron-specific splicing factor and regulates both sets of the mutually exclusive exons of the unc-32 gene.
24369119,9,2013,Biochim Biophys Acta,Recombinant PNPLA3 protein shows triglyceride hydrolase activity and its I148M mutation results in loss of function.,The patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3, also called adiponutrin, ADPN) is a membrane-bound protein highly expressed in the liver. The genetic variant I148M (rs738409) was found to be associated with progression of chronic liver disease. We aimed to establish a protein purification protocol in a yeast system (Pichia pastoris) and to examine the human PNPLA3 enzymatic activity, substrate specificity and the I148M mutation effect. hPNPLA3 148I wild type and 148M mutant cDNA were cloned into P. pastoris expression vectors. Yeast cells were grown in 3L fermentors. PNPLA3 protein was purified from membrane fractions by Ni-affinity chromatography. Enzymatic activity was assessed using radiolabeled substrates. Both 148I wild type and 148M mutant proteins are localized to the membrane. The wild type protein shows a predominant lipase activity with mild lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase activity (LPAAT) and the I148M mutation results in a loss of function of both these activities. Our data show that PNPLA3 has a predominant lipase activity and I148M mutation results in a loss of function.
24055367,8,2013,Cell,Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation regulates insulator function and intrachromosomal interactions in Drosophila.,Insulators mediate inter- and intrachromosomal contacts to regulate enhancer-promoter interactions and establish chromosome domains. The mechanisms by which insulator activity can be regulated to orchestrate changes in the function and three-dimensional arrangement of the genome remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila insulator proteins are poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated and that mutation of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Parp) gene impairs their function. This modification is not essential for DNA occupancy of insulator DNA-binding proteins dCTCF and Su(Hw). However, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of K566 in CP190 promotes protein-protein interactions with other insulator proteins, association with the nuclear lamina, and insulator activity in vivo. Consistent with these findings, the nuclear clustering of CP190 complexes is disrupted in Parp mutant cells. Importantly, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation facilitates intrachromosomal interactions between insulator sites measured by 4C. These data suggest that the role of insulators in organizing the three-dimensional architecture of the genome may be modulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.
23965963,8,2013,Int J Mol Sci,Exploring the role of genetic variability and lifestyle in oxidative stress response for healthy aging and longevity.,Oxidative stress is both the cause and consequence of impaired functional homeostasis characterizing human aging. The worsening efficiency of stress response with age represents a health risk and leads to the onset and accrual of major age-related diseases. In contrast, centenarians seem to have evolved conservative stress response mechanisms, probably derived from a combination of a diet rich in natural antioxidants, an active lifestyle and a favorable genetic background, particularly rich in genetic variants able to counteract the stress overload at the level of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. The integration of these factors could allow centenarians to maintain moderate levels of free radicals that exert beneficial signaling and modulator effects on cellular metabolism. Considering the hot debate on the efficacy of antioxidant supplementation in promoting healthy aging, in this review we gathered the existing information regarding genetic variability and lifestyle factors which potentially modulate the stress response at old age. Evidence reported here suggests that the integration of lifestyle factors (moderate physical activity and healthy nutrition) and genetic background could shift the balance in favor of the antioxidant cellular machinery by activating appropriate defense mechanisms in response to exceeding external and internal stress levels, and thus possibly achieving the prospect of living a longer life.
23429698,8,2013,J Med Microbiol,Prevalence of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli and its virulence-related genes in a case-control study among children from north-eastern Brazil.,Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is an important agent that causes endemic and epidemic diarrhoeal diseases worldwide. Several EAEC virulence-related genes (VRGs) have been described but their role in the clinical outcome of infection is not completely defined. This study investigated the prevalence of EAEC and potential associations of its VRGs with risk of or protection from diarrhoeal diseases in children from urban communities in north-eastern Brazil. The case-control study included 166 children, who had their stools evaluated for the EAEC diagnostic genes (aaiC and aatA) using PCR. Positive samples were further analysed by multiplex PCR and identified 18 VRGs. EAEC was found in the same proportion in both groups (41%). The plasmid-borne gene encoding a hexosyltransferase homologue (capU) was the most frequently detected (89.6%), followed by dispersin protein (aap, 58.2%) and EAEC HilA homologue (eilA, 57.8%). The AAF/III fimbrial subunit (agg3A) gene was observed at lower frequency (1.5%). Plasmid-encoded toxin (pet) or AAF/II fimbrial subunit (aafA) was associated significantly with disease. AAF/IV fimbrial subunit (agg4A) or hypothetical plasmid-encoded haemolysin (orf61) was detected significantly more in controls than in children with diarrhoea. In addition, one set of genes in combination, aaiC and agg3/4C but lacking agg4A and orf61, was associated with diarrhoea cases; and another one, orf61 in the absence of pet and aafA, was correlated with control children. These data confirm a high prevalence, endemicity and heterogeneity of EAEC strains in the developing urban areas of north-eastern Brazil. Statistical correlation between cases and controls was seen with either isolated or combined sets of genes, suggesting that the pathophysiology of EAEC infection involves a complex and dynamic modulation of several VRGs.
24325589,7,2013,Mol Pharm,NA,Glycosylation frequently improves the biokinetics and clearance properties of macromolecules in vivo and could therefore be used for the design of radiopharmaceuticals for positron emission tomography (PET). Recently, we have developed a click chemistry method for (18)F-fluoroglycosylation of alkyne-bearing RGD-peptides targeting the integrin receptor. To investigate whether this strategy could yield an (18)F-labeled RGD glycopeptide with favorable biokinetics, we generated a series of new RGD glycopeptides, varying the 6-fluoroglycosyl residue from monosaccharide to disaccharide units, which provided the glucosyl ([(19)F]6Glc-RGD, 4b), galactosyl ([(19)F]Gal-RGD, 4c), maltosyl ([(19)F]Mlt-RGD, 4e), and cellobiosyl ([(19)F]Cel-RGD, 4f) conjugated peptides in high yields and purities of &gt;97%. All of these RGD glycopeptides showed high affinity to αvβ3 (11-55 nM), αvβ5 (6-14 nM), and to αvβ3-positive U87MG cells (90-395 nM). (18)F-labeling of the various carbohydrate precursors (1a-f) using cryptate-assisted reaction conditions (CH3CN, 85 °C, 10 min) gave (18)F-labeled glycosyl azides in radiochemical yields (RCYs) of up to 84% ([(18)F]2b). The deacetylation and subsequent click reaction with the alkyne-bearing cyclic RGD peptide proceeded in one-pot reactions with RCYs as high as 81% in 15-20 min at 60 °C, using a minimal amount of peptide precursor (100 nmol). Optimization of the radiosynthesis strategy gave a decay-uncorrected RCY of 16-24% after 70-75 min (based on [(18)F]fluoride). Due to their high-yield radiosyntheses, the glycopeptides [(18)F]6Glc-RGD and [(18)F]Mlt-RGD were chosen for comparative biodistribution studies and dynamic small-animal PET imaging using U87MG tumor-bearing nude mice. [(18)F]6Glc-RGD and [(18)F]Mlt-RGD showed significantly decreased liver and kidney uptake by PET relative to the 2-[(18)F]fluoroglucosyl analog [(18)F]2Glc-RGD, and showed specific tumor uptake in vivo. Notably, [(18)F]Mlt-RGD revealed uptake and retention in the U87MG tumor comparable to that of [(18)F]Galacto-RGD. Both [(18)F]6Glc-RGD and [(18)F]Mlt-RGD were obtained by a reliable and easy click chemistry-based procedure, much more rapidly than was [(18)F]Galacto-RGD. Due to its favorable biodistribution and tissue clearance in vivo, [(18)F]Mlt-RGD represents a viable alternative radiotracer for imaging integrin expression in solid tumors by PET.
23798416,7,2013,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Ligands that interact with putative MOR-mGluR5 heteromer in mice with inflammatory pain produce potent antinociception.,The low effectiveness of morphine and related mu opioid analgesics for the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain is a result of opioid-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines and glutamate that lower the pain threshold. In this regard, the use of opioids with metabotropic glutamate-5 receptor (mGluR5) antagonist has been reported to increase the efficacy of morphine and prevent the establishment of adverse effects during chronic use. Given the presence of opioid receptors (MORs) and mGluR5 in glia and neurons, together with reports that suggest coexpressed MOR/mGluR5 receptors in cultured cells associate as a heteromer, the possibility that such a heteromer could be a target in vivo was addressed by the design and synthesis of a series of bivalent ligands that contain mu opioid agonist and mGluR5 antagonist pharmacophores linked through spacers of varying length (10-24 atoms). The series was evaluated for antinociception using the tail-flick and von Frey assays in mice pretreated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or in mice with bone cancer. In LPS-pretreated mice, MMG22 (4c, 22-atom spacer) was the most potent member of the series (intrathecal ED50 ∼9 fmol per mouse), whereas in untreated mice its ED50 was more than three orders of magnitude higher. As members of the series with shorter or longer spacers have ≥500-fold higher ED50s in LPS-treated mice, the exceptional potency of MMG22 may be a result of the optimal bridging of protomers in a putative MOR-mGluR5 heteromer. The finding that MMG22 possesses a &gt;10(6) therapeutic ratio suggests that it may be an excellent candidate for treatment of chronic, intractable pain via spinal administration.
23549118,7,2013,Sci Rep,The interactomes of POU5F1 and SOX2 enhancers in human embryonic stem cells.,The genes POU5F1 and SOX2 are critical for pluripotency and reprogramming, yet the chromosomal organization around these genes remains poorly understood. We assayed long-range chromosomal interactions on putative enhancers of POU5F1 and SOX2 genes in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using 4C-Seq technique. We discovered that their frequent interacting regions mainly overlap with early DNA replication domains. The interactomes are associated with active histone marks and enriched with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine sites. In hESCs, genes within the interactomes have elevated expression. Additionally, some genes associated with the POU5F1 enhancer contribute to pluripotency. Binding sites for multiple DNA binding proteins, including ATF3, CTCF, GABPA, JUND, NANOG, RAD21 and YY1, are enriched in both interactomes. The RARG locus, frequently interacting with the POU5F1 locus, has abundant RAD21 binding sites co-localized with other protein binding sites. Thus the interactomes of these two pluripotency genes could be an important part of the regulatory network in hESCs.
23402883,7,2013,Mutat Res,Melatonin ameliorates bisphenol A-induced DNA damage in the germ cells of adult male rats.,Bisphenol A (BPA) is a well-known endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that has received particular attention because of its widespread distribution in humans. Due to its chemical similarity to diethylstilbestrol, which is carcinogenic to mammals, the possible genotoxicity of BPA has already largely been evaluated. However, the results are still inconclusive and controversial. To investigate the genotoxic effects of BPA in rat germ cells and the potential protective action of melatonin against these effects, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered BPA at a dose of 200mg/kg body weight per day for ten consecutive days with or without melatonin pretreatment. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the testes were evaluated. Subsequently, their spermatocytes were isolated, and DNA damage was assessed using an alkaline comet assay and the meiotic spread method. BPA administration did not significantly affect the weights of rats and their reproductive organs, and no alteration in sperm count was found. However, we demonstrated that BPA administration induced a significant increase in TBARS levels and a decrease in SOD activity that were concomitant with an increase in DNA migration within male germ cells and γH2AX foci formation on the autosomes of pachytene spermatocytes. Furthermore, a decrease in the proportion of 4C-cells was observed. These BPA effects were significantly alleviated by melatonin pretreatment. Nevertheless, the genotoxic effects of BPA were not accompanied by apoptosis in germ cells and morphological changes in the testes. These results indicate that BPA exposure may induce DNA damage accumulation in germ cells via oxidative stress. Moreover, melatonin may be a promising pharmacological candidate for preventing the potential genotoxicity of BPA following occupational or environmental exposure.
23825666,6,2013,PLoS One,Evolutionary dynamics of the accessory genome of Listeria monocytogenes.,Listeria monocytogenes, a foodborne bacterial pathogen, is comprised of four phylogenetic lineages that vary with regard to their serotypes and distribution among sources. In order to characterize lineage-specific genomic diversity within L. monocytogenes, we sequenced the genomes of eight strains from several lineages and serotypes, and characterized the accessory genome, which was hypothesized to contribute to phenotypic differences across lineages. The eight L. monocytogenes genomes sequenced range in size from 2.85-3.14 Mb, encode 2,822-3,187 genes, and include the first publicly available sequenced representatives of serotypes 1/2c, 3a and 4c. Mapping of the distribution of accessory genes revealed two distinct regions of the L. monocytogenes chromosome: an accessory-rich region in the first 65° adjacent to the origin of replication and a more stable region in the remaining 295°. This pattern of genome organization is distinct from that of related bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. The accessory genome of all lineages is enriched for cell surface-related genes and phosphotransferase systems, and transcriptional regulators, highlighting the selective pressures faced by contemporary strains from their hosts, other microbes, and their environment. Phylogenetic analysis of O-antigen genes and gene clusters predicts that serotype 4 was ancestral in L. monocytogenes and serotype 1/2 associated gene clusters were putatively introduced through horizontal gene transfer in the ancestral population of L. monocytogenes lineage I and II.
23537223,6,2013,J Phys Chem B,A strongly absorbing class of non-natural labels for probing protein electrostatics and solvation with FTIR and 2D IR spectroscopies.,A series of non-natural infrared probes is reported that consist of a metal-tricarbonyl modified with a -(CH2)n- linker and cysteine-specific leaving group. They can be site-specifically attached to proteins using mutagenesis and similar protocols for EPR spin labels, which have the same leaving group. We characterize the label's frequencies and lifetimes using 2D IR spectroscopy in solvents of varying dielectric. The frequency range spans 10 cm(-1), and the variation in lifetimes ranges from 6 to 19 ps, indicating that these probes are very sensitive to their environments. Also, we attached probes with -(CH2)-, -(CH2)3-, and -(CH2)4- linkers to ubiquitin at positions 6 and 63 and collected spectra in aqueous buffer. The frequencies and lifetimes were correlated for 3C and 4C linkers, as they were in the solvents, but did not correlate for the 1C linker. We conclude that lifetime measures solvation, whereas frequency reflects the electrostatics of the environment, which in the case of the 1C linker is a measure of the protein electrostatic field. We also labeled V71C α-synuclein in buffer and membrane-bound. Unlike most other infrared labels, this label has extremely strong cross sections and thus can be measured with 2D IR spectroscopy at sub-millimolar concentrations. We expect that these labels will find use in studying the structure and dynamics of membrane-bound, aggregated, and kinetically evolving proteins for which high signal-to-noise at low protein concentrations is imperative.
24121463,5,2013,Sci Rep,The boundary of the meristematic and elongation zones in roots: endoreduplication precedes rapid cell expansion.,Plant roots consist of a meristematic zone of mitotic cells and an elongation zone of rapidly expanding cells, in which DNA replication often occurs without cell division, a process known as endoreduplication. The duration of the cell cycle and DNA replication, as measured by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxy-uridine (EdU) incorporation, differed between the two regions (17 h in the meristematic zone, 30 h in the elongation zone). Two distinct subnuclear patterns of EdU signals, whole and speckled, marked nuclei undergoing DNA replication at early and late S phase, respectively. The boundary region between the meristematic and elongation zones was analysed by a combination of DNA replication imaging and optical estimation of the amount of DNA in each nucleus (C-value). We found a boundary cell with 4C nuclei exhibiting the whole pattern of EdU signals. Analyses of cells in the boundary region revealed that endoreduplication precedes rapid cell elongation in roots.
24019942,5,2013,PLoS One,Genomic interaction profiles in breast cancer reveal altered chromatin architecture.,Gene transcription can be regulated by remote enhancer regions through chromosome looping either in cis or in trans. Cancer cells are characterized by wholesale changes in long-range gene interactions, but the role that these long-range interactions play in cancer progression and metastasis is not well understood. In this study, we used IGFBP3, a gene involved in breast cancer pathogenesis, as bait in a 4C-seq experiment comparing normal breast cells (HMEC) with two breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, an ER positive cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple negative cell line). The IGFBP3 long-range interaction profile was substantially altered in breast cancer. Many interactions seen in normal breast cells are lost and novel interactions appear in cancer lines. We found that in HMEC, the breast carcinoma amplified sequence gene family (BCAS) 1-4 were among the top 10 most significantly enriched regions of interaction with IGFBP3. 3D-FISH analysis indicated that the translocation-prone BCAS genes, which are located on chromosomes 1, 17, and 20, are in close physical proximity with IGFBP3 and each other in normal breast cells. We also found that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a gene implicated in tumorigenesis, interacts significantly with IGFBP3 and that this interaction may play a role in their regulation. Breakpoint analysis suggests that when an IGFBP3 interacting region undergoes a translocation an additional interaction detectable by 4C is gained. Overall, our data from multiple lines of evidence suggest an important role for long-range chromosomal interactions in the pathogenesis of cancer.
23840610,5,2013,PLoS One,Epidemics and Frequent Recombination within Species in Outbreaks of Human Enterovirus B-Associated Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease in Shandong China in 2010 and 2011.,The epidemiology and molecular characteristics of human enterovirus B (HEV-B) associated with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) outbreaks in China are not well known. In the present study, we tested 201 HEV isolates from 233 clinical specimens from patients with severe HFMD during 2010-2011 in Linyi, Shandong, China. Of the 201 isolates, 189 were fully typed and 18 corresponded to HEV-B species (six serotypes CVA9, CVB1, CVB4, Echo 6, Echo 25 and Echo 30) using sensitive semi-nested polymerase chain reaction analysis of VP1 gene sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on the VP1 region showed that eight E30SD belonged to a novel sub-genogroup D2; E25SD belonged to a novel sub-genogroup D6; E6SD belonged to sub-lineage C6 and five CVB1SD belonged to subgroup 4C; and B4SD belonged sub-lineage D2. The full viral genomes of the CVB1SD, E6SD, E25SD and E30SD isolates were sequenced. Analysis of phylogenetic and similarity plots indicated that E25SD recombined with E25-HN-2, E30FDJS03 and E4AUS250 at noncontiguous P2A-P3D regions, while E30SD, E30FDJ03, E25-HN-2 and E9 DM had shared sequences in discrete regions of P2 and P3. Both E6SD and B1SD shared sequences with E1-HN, B4/GX/10, B5-HN, and A9-Alberta in contiguous regions of most of P2 and P3. Genetic algorithm recombination detection analysis further confirmed the existence of multiple potential recombination points. In conclusion, analysis of the complete genomes of E25SD, E30SD, CVB1SD and E6SD isolated from HFMD patients revealed that they formed novel subgenogroup. Given the prevalence and recombination of these viruses in outbreaks of HFMD, persistent surveillance of HFMD-associated HEV-B pathogens is required to predict potential emerging viruses and related disease outbreaks.
23825381,4,2013,J Antimicrob Chemother,Community-associated Clostridium difficile infection among older people in Tayside, Scotland, is associated with antibiotic exposure and care home residence: cohort study with nested case-control.,OBJECTIVES: To estimate the risks of community-associated Clostridium difficile infection (CA-CDI) among the population aged ≥ 65 years associated with antibiotic exposure and care home residence.POPULATION AND METHODS: We linked cases from a prospective study in Tayside, Scotland from 1 November 2008 to 31 October 2009 to population datasets to conduct a cohort study and a nested, matched (1 : 10 by age and gender) case-control study.RESULTS: There were 79,039 eligible residents. CA-CDI incidence was 20.3/10,000 person years. In the cohort study, after adjustment, we found a significantly increasing risk of CA-CDI with increasing age and comorbidity, prior hospital admission, care home residence [hazard ratio (HR) 1.96, 95% CI 1.14-3.34] and baseline antibiotic exposure (1.94, 1.35-2.77). In separate adjusted models, '4C' antibiotics (clindamycin, co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin; 2.75, 1.78-4.26) and fluoroquinolones (3.33, 1.95-5.67) had higher associated risks. We matched 62 CA-CDI cases without recent (prior 3 months) hospital admission to 620 controls. In adjusted logistic regression models, exposure to any antibiotics increased the risk of CA-CDI (OR 6.04, 95% CI 3.19-11.43). Exposure to 4C antibiotics or fluoroquinolones had higher associated risks: adjusted OR 11.60 (95% CI 5.57-24.15) and 13.04 (4.91-34.64), respectively. Risk of CA-CDI increased with cumulative antibiotic exposure. Subgroup analysis of 42 cases with C. difficile cultured and 420 controls amplified all associations between antibiotic exposure and CA-CDI. Care home residence independently increased the risk of CA-CDI in all models.CONCLUSIONS: Our results have two important implications. First, they validate the classification of 4C antibiotics and fluoroquinolones in primary care as high risk for CA-CDI. Second, they demonstrate the importance of prior antibiotic exposure and place of residence for risk assessment by primary care prescribers.
23817494,4,2013,Hypertension,Carotid artery intima-media thickness and distensibility in children and adolescents: reference values and role of body dimensions.,Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and carotid artery distensibility are reliable screening methods for vascular alterations and the assessment of cardiovascular risk in adult and pediatric cohorts. We sought to establish an international reference data set for the childhood and adolescence period and explore the impact of developmental changes in body dimensions and blood pressure (BP) on carotid wall thickness and elasticity. cIMT, the distensibility coefficient, the incremental modulus of elasticity, and the stiffness index β were assessed in 1155 children aged 6 to 18 years and sex-specific reference charts normalized to age or height were constructed from 1051 nonobese and nonhypertensive children. The role of body dimensions, BP, and family history, as well as the association between cIMT and distensibility, was investigated. cIMT increased and distensibility decreased with age, height, body mass index, and BP. A significant sex difference was apparent from the age of 15 years. Age- and height-normalized cIMT and distensibility values differed in children who are short or tall for their age. By stepwise multivariate analysis, standardized systolic BP and body mass index were independently positively associated with cIMT SD scores (SDS). Systolic BP SDS independently predicted all distensibility measures. Distensibility coefficient SDS was negatively and β SDS positively associated with cIMT SDS, whereas incremental modulus of elasticity was independent of cIMT. Morphological and functional aspects of the common carotid artery are particularly influenced by age, body dimensions, and BP. The reference charts established in this study allow to accurately compare vascular phenotypes of children with chronic conditions with those of healthy children.
23400313,4,2013,Gene Regul Syst Bio,Extensive ethnogenomic diversity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) polymorphisms.,Nitric oxide (NO) is highly reactive, produced in endothelial cells by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and has been implicated in sickle cell pathophysiology. We evaluated the distribution of functionally significant eNOS variants (the T786C variant in the promoter region, the Glu298Asp variant in exon 7, and the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in intron 4) in Africans, African Americans and Caucasians. The C-786 variant was more common in Caucasians than in Africans and African Americans. Consistent with other findings, the Asp-298 variant had the highest frequency in Caucasians followed by African Americans, but was completely absent in Africans. The very rare intron 4 allele, eNOS 4c, was found in some Africans and African Americans, but not in Caucasians. eNOS 4d allele was present in 2 Africans. These findings suggest a consistent and widespread genomic diversity in the distribution of eNOS variants in Africans, comparative to African Americans and Caucasians.
24265791,3,2013,PLoS One,Structural variation-associated expression changes are paralleled by chromatin architecture modifications.,Copy number variants (CNVs) influence the expression of genes that map not only within the rearrangement, but also to its flanks. To assess the possible mechanism(s) underlying this &quot;neighboring effect&quot;, we compared intrachromosomal interactions and histone modifications in cell lines of patients affected by genomic disorders and control individuals. Using chromosome conformation capture (4C-seq), we observed that a set of genes flanking the Williams-Beuren Syndrome critical region (WBSCR) were often looping together. The newly identified interacting genes include AUTS2, mutations of which are associated with autism and intellectual disabilities. Deletion of the WBSCR disrupts the expression of this group of flanking genes, as well as long-range interactions between them and the rearranged interval. We also pinpointed concomitant changes in histone modifications between samples. We conclude that large genomic rearrangements can lead to chromatin conformation changes that extend far away from the structural variant, thereby possibly modulating expression globally and modifying the phenotype.</AbstractText>: Copy number variants (CNVs) influence the expression of genes that map not only within the rearrangement, but also to its flanks.

24014450,3,2013,Wiley Interdiscip Rev Dev Biol,Chromatin looping and organization at developmentally regulated gene loci.,Developmentally regulated genes are often controlled by distant enhancers, silencers and insulators, to implement their correct transcriptional programs. In recent years, the development of 3C and derived techniques (4C, 5C, HiC, ChIA-PET, etc.) has confirmed that chromatin looping is an important mechanism for the transfer of regulatory information in mammalian cells. At many developmentally regulated gene loci, transcriptional activation is indeed accompanied by the formation of chromatin loops between genes and distant enhancers. Similarly, dynamic looping between insulator elements and changes in local 3D organization may be observed upon variation in transcriptional activity. Chromatin looping also occurs at silent gene loci, where its function remains less understood. In lineage-committed cells, partial 3D configurations are detected at loci that are activated at later stages. However, these partial configurations usually lack promoter-enhancer loops that accompany transcriptional activation, suggesting they have structural functions. Definitive evidence for a repressive role of chromatin looping is still lacking. Chromatin loops have been reported at repressed loci but, alternatively, they may act as a distraction for active loops. Together, these mechanisms allow fine-tuning of regulatory programs, thus providing further diversity in the transcriptional control of developmentally regulated gene loci.
24004329,3,2013,J Am Chem Soc,Nickel pyridinethiolate complexes as catalysts for the light-driven production of hydrogen from aqueous solutions in noble-metal-free systems.,A series of mononuclear nickel(II) thiolate complexes (Et4N)Ni(X-pyS)3 (Et4N = tetraethylammonium; X = 5-H (1a), 5-Cl (1b), 5-CF3 (1c), 6-CH3 (1d); pyS = pyridine-2-thiolate), Ni(pySH)4(NO3)2 (2), (Et4N)Ni(4,6-Y2-pymS)3 (Y = H (3a), CH3 (3b); pymS = pyrimidine-2-thiolate), and Ni(4,4'-Z-2,2'-bpy)(pyS)2 (Z = H (4a), CH3 (4b), OCH3 (4c); bpy = bipyridine) have been synthesized in high yield and characterized. X-ray diffraction studies show that 2 is square planar, while the other complexes possess tris-chelated distorted-octahedral geometries. All of the complexes are active catalysts for both the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic production of hydrogen in 1/1 EtOH/H2O. When coupled with fluorescein (Fl) as the photosensitizer (PS) and triethylamine (TEA) as the sacrificial electron donor, these complexes exhibit activity for light-driven hydrogen generation that correlates with ligand electron donor ability. Complex 4c achieves over 7300 turnovers of H2 in 30 h, which is among the highest reported for a molecular noble metal-free system. The initial photochemical step is reductive quenching of Fl* by TEA because of the latter's greater concentration. When system concentrations are modified so that oxidative quenching of Fl* by catalyst becomes more dominant, system durability increases, with a system lifetime of over 60 h. System variations and cyclic voltammetry experiments are consistent with a CECE mechanism that is common to electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen production. This mechanism involves initial protonation of the catalyst followed by reduction and then additional protonation and reduction steps to give a key Ni-H(-)/N-H(+) intermediate that forms the H-H bond in the turnover-limiting step of the catalytic cycle. A key to the activity of these catalysts is the reversible dechelation and protonation of the pyridine N atoms, which enable an internal heterocoupling of a metal hydride and an N-bound proton to produce H2.
23844282,3,2013,J Obes,A PRISMA-driven systematic review of predictive equations for assessing fat and fat-free mass in healthy children and adolescents using multicomponent molecular models as the reference method.,Simple methods to assess both fat (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) are required in paediatric populations. Several bioelectrical impedance instruments (BIAs) and anthropometric equations have been developed using different criterion methods (multicomponent models) for assessing FM and FFM. Through childhood, FFM density increases while FFM hydration decreases until reaching adult values. Therefore, multicomponent models should be used as the gold standard method for developing simple techniques because two-compartment models (2C model) rely on the assumed adult values of FFM density and hydration (1.1 g/cm(3) and 73.2%, respectively). This study will review BIA and/or anthropometric-based equations for assessing body composition in paediatric populations. We reviewed English language articles from MEDLINE (1985-2012) with the selection of predictive equations developed for assessing FM and FFM using three-compartment (3C) and 4C models as criterion. Search terms included children, adolescent, childhood, adolescence, 4C model, 3C model, multicomponent model, equation, prediction, DXA, BIA, resistance, anthropometry, skinfold, FM, and FFM. A total of 14 studies (33 equations) were selected with the majority developed using DXA as the criterion method with a limited number of studies providing cross-validation results. Overall, the selected equations are useful for epidemiological studies, but some concerns still arise on an individual basis.
23748562,3,2013,Nucleic Acids Res,Allelic exclusion of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus is independent of its nuclear localization in mature B cells.,In developing B cells, the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus is thought to move from repressive to permissive chromatin compartments to facilitate its scheduled rearrangement. In mature B cells, maintenance of allelic exclusion has been proposed to involve recruitment of the non-productive IgH allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin. Here, we used an allele-specific chromosome conformation capture combined with sequencing (4C-seq) approach to unambigously follow the individual IgH alleles in mature B lymphocytes. Despite their physical and functional difference, productive and non-productive IgH alleles in B cells and unrearranged IgH alleles in T cells share many chromosomal contacts and largely reside in active chromatin. In brain, however, the locus resides in a different repressive environment. We conclude that IgH adopts a lymphoid-specific nuclear location that is, however, unrelated to maintenance of allelic exclusion. We additionally find that in mature B cells-but not in T cells-the distal VH regions of both IgH alleles position themselves away from active chromatin. This, we speculate, may help to restrict enhancer activity to the productively rearranged VH promoter element.
23735002,3,2013,Parasit Vectors,SAG2A protein from Toxoplasma gondii interacts with both innate and adaptive immune compartments of infected hosts.,BACKGROUND: Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that causes relevant clinical disease in humans and animals. Several studies have been performed in order to understand the interactions between proteins of the parasite and host cells. SAG2A is a 22 kDa protein that is mainly found in the surface of tachyzoites. In the present work, our aim was to correlate the predicted three-dimensional structure of this protein with the immune system of infected hosts.METHODS: To accomplish our goals, we performed in silico analysis of the amino acid sequence of SAG2A, correlating the predictions with in vitro stimulation of antigen presenting cells and serological assays.RESULTS: Structure modeling predicts that SAG2A protein possesses an unfolded C-terminal end, which varies its conformation within distinct strain types of T. gondii. This structure within the protein shelters a known B-cell immunodominant epitope, which presents low identity with its closest phyllogenetically related protein, an orthologue predicted in Neospora caninum. In agreement with the in silico observations, sera of known T. gondii infected mice and goats recognized recombinant SAG2A, whereas no serological cross-reactivity was observed with samples from N. caninum animals. Additionally, the C-terminal end of the protein was able to down-modulate pro-inflammatory responses of activated macrophages and dendritic cells.CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, we demonstrate herein that recombinant SAG2A protein from T. gondii is immunologically relevant in the host-parasite interface and may be targeted in therapeutic and diagnostic procedures designed against the infection.
23648141,3,2013,Liver Int,Loss of exon 4 in a human T-cell factor-4 isoform promotes hepatic tumourigenicity.,BACKGROUND: T-cell factor (TCF) proteins represent key transcription factors that activate Wnt/β-catenin signalling. We have reported that a pair of TCF-4 isoforms (TCF-4C and TCF-4D) exhibit differential TCF transcriptional activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, although their structure differs by only the presence (TCF-4D) or absence (TCF-4C) of exon 4.AIM: To demonstrate a regulatory role of exon 4 in HCC development.METHODS: TCF-4C and TCF-4D expression profiles were examined in 27 pairs of human HCC and adjacent liver tissues. The functional role of the TCF-4 isoforms was evaluated in OUMS-29 (an immortalized hepatocyte-derived) and HAK-1A (a well-differentiated HCC) cell lines using stable clones overexpressing the TCF-4 isoforms.RESULTS: TCF-4C was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared with corresponding peritumour and normal liver tissues; in contrast, there was no difference in TCF-4D expression. TCF-4C clones derived from both cell lines exhibited increased TCF activity, Wnt-responsive target genes, cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs compared with TCF-4D clones. Capability of cell migration and colony formation was significantly higher in TCF-4C than TCF-4D clones. In a nude mice xenograft model, the HAK-1A-derived TCF-4C clone rapidly developed tumours compared with the TCF-4D clone. TCF-4C clone-derived tumours exhibited upregulation of Wnt-responsive target genes compared with the slow developing and small TCF-4D-derived tumours.CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the TCF-4C isoform lacking exon 4 is associated with a malignant phenotype compared with the exon 4-harbouring TCF-4D isoform, indicating that exon 4 of TCF-4 plays a prominent role in HCC development.
23417455,3,2013,Acta Neurochir Suppl,Do we really still need an open surgery for treatment of patients with vestibular schwannomas?,BACKGROUND: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) should be considered a standard treatment option for small and medium-sized vestibular schwannomas (VSs). It results in a tumor control rate similar to that seen with microsurgery and provides better preservation of facial nerve function and hearing.METHODS: From December 2002 to April 2011, a total of 260 patients with VS underwent GKS using Leksell Gamma Knife model 4C with an automatic positioning system. There were 30 Koos stage I tumors, 112 stage II, 100 stage III, and 18 stage IV. All patients were treated with the use of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging; creation of the highly precise conformal and selective multi-isocenter dose planning with small collimators, carefully sparing adjacent cranial nerves of any excessive irradiation; and creation of a wide 80 % isodose area within the tumor while applying a low marginal dose (mean 11.9 Gy) at the 50 % isodose line.RESULTS: Among 182 patients who were followed for more than 3 years after treatment, the tumor control and shrinkage rates were 98.4 % and 76.4 %, respectively. Volume reduction of &gt;50 % was marked in 54.9 % of VSs. Preservation of facial nerve function and hearing at the pretreatment level was noted in 97.8 % and 87.9 %, respectively. There was marked improvement of facial nerve function and hearing after GKS in 2.2 % and 3.8 %, respectively. There was no major morbidity.CONCLUSION: Due to contemporary technological and methodological achievements GKS can be focused not only on growth control but on shrinking the VS, with possible reversal of the neurological deficit.
23285073,3,2013,PLoS One,Causative species and serotypes of shigellosis in mainland China: systematic review and meta-analysis.,BACKGROUND: Shigella, the causative agent of shigellosis, is a major global public health concern, particularly in developing countries with poor sanitation. A comprehensive and current understanding of the prevalent species and serotypes of shigellosis is essential for both disease prevention and vaccine development. However, no current data are available on the causative species/serotypes of shigellosis in mainland China during the past decade.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Relevant studies addressing the prevalent species of shigellosis in mainland China from January 2001 to December 2010 were identified from PubMed and the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (in Chinese) until April 2012. A total of 131 eligible articles (136 studies) were included in this review. Meta-analyses showed that the prevalences of S. flexneri and S. sonnei were 76.2% (95% CI, 73.7%-78.5%) and 21.3% (95% CI, 19.0%-23.7%), respectively. Stratified analyses indicated a decrease in the prevalence of S. flexneri cases and an increase in the prevalence of S. sonnei cases concurrent with the rapid economic growth experienced by China in recent years. Moreover, significantly higher rates of S. sonnei were observed in the East, North and Northeast regions of China, as compared to the rest of the country. These phenomena imply the possible association between the prevalent species of Shigella and regional economic status; however, additional factors also exist and require further investigations. Moreover, the two major serotypes S. flexneri 2a and 4c accounted for 21.5% (95% CI, 16.7%-27.4%) and 12.9% (95% CI 9.8%-16.9%) of S. flexneri infections, respectively, in the past decade. However, these results were found to be frequently heterogeneous (p for Q tests &lt;0.01).CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an updated review of the causative agents of shigellosis in mainland China and focuses on the importance of strengthening prevention and research efforts on S. sonnei and the newly emerged S. flexneri serotype 4c.
23280790,3,2013,Ann Neurol,A predictive clinical-genetic model of tissue plasminogen activator response in acute ischemic stroke.,OBJECTIVE: Wide interindividual variability exists in response to tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) treatment in the acute phase of ischemic stroke. We aimed to find genetic variations associated with hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and mortality rates after t-PA. We then generated a clinical-genetic model for predicting t-PA response.METHODS: Our prospective study used SNPlex to genotype 140 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 97 candidate genes in 3 patient cohorts. The cohorts included 1,172 patients who were treated with t-PA; 20.9% of them developed HT as evaluated by systematic brain computed tomography scan, and 10.6% died. A predictive model was generated by logistic regression (LR). Functional studies included real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, nephelometry, and Western blot for alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) and activated partial thromboplastin time measurement for coagulation factor XII (FXII).RESULTS: Replication analysis revealed that the SNP rs669 (Val1000Ile) in A2M was associated with HT, and rs1801020 (-4C&gt;T) of F12 was associated with in-hospital death. The rs669 SNP withstood Bonferroni correction for HT (p &lt; 3.57E-4). LR-based scores predicted HT occurrence (p = 9.13E-15) and in-hospital mortality (p = 8.7E-9) and were validated in an independent cohort. Val1000Ile modified A2M serum levels at baseline and after t-PA infusion, but not mRNA expression or protein structure; -4C&gt;T affected FXII activity both prior to and after t-PA treatment.INTERPRETATION: Two functional polymorphisms were consistently associated with t-PA safety. Our validated LR-based score predicts t-PA safety in the Spanish population.
24254229,2,2013,Chromosome Res,Chromosome conformation capture-on-chip analysis of long-range cis-interactions of the SOX9 promoter.,Evolutionarily conserved transcription factor SOX9 is essential for the differentiation of chondrocytes and the development of testes. Heterozygous point mutations and genomic deletions involving SOX9 lead to campomelic dysplasia (CD), a skeletal malformation syndrome often associated with sex reversal. Chromosomal rearrangements with breakpoints mapping up to 1.6 Mb up- and downstream to SOX9, and likely disrupting its distant cis-regulatory elements, have been described in patients with milder forms of CD. Based on the location of these aberration breakpoints, four clusters upstream of SOX9 have been defined. Interestingly, we found that each of these intervals overlaps a gene encoding long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), suggesting that lncRNAs may contribute to long-range regulation of SOX9 expression. One of the four upstream regions, RevSex (517-595 kb 5' to SOX9), is associated with sex reversal, and was suggested to harbor a testis-specific and sex-determining enhancer. Another sex-determining interval was mapped to a gene desert &gt;1.3 Mb downstream of SOX9. We have performed chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) analysis in Sertoli cells and lymphoblasts to verify the proposed long-range interactions of the SOX9 promoter and to identify potential novel regulatory elements that might be responsible for sex reversal in patients with CD. We identified several novel potentially cis-interacting regions both up- and downstream to SOX9, with some of them overlapping lncRNA genes. Our data point to lncRNAs as likely mediators of some of these regulatory interactions.
24123162,2,2013,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Discovery of 2-phenyl-N-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)acetamide derivatives as apoptosis inducers via the caspase pathway with potential anticancer activity.,In the current research of medicinal chemistry, apoptosis induction is one of the novel strategies for the development and discovery of novel anticancer therapeutics. In the present study, a new series of 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives (4a-4p) were synthesized and their in vitro anticancer activities were evaluated against three cancer cell lines: PC3 (prostate cancer), MCF7 (breast cancer), and SKNMC (neuroblastoma). These cell lines were utilized in MTT assays and the obtained results were compared to doxorubicin. Apoptosis induction was also investigated through exploration of the activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9. According to the obtained results, compounds 4b (3-Cl) and 4c (4-Cl) demonstrated the best caspase activation. In fact, compounds 4b and 4c enhanced the activity of caspases 3 and 9 in the MCF7 cell line.
24095093,2,2013,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,The application of Heck reaction in the synthesis of guaianolide sesquiterpene lactones derivatives selectively inhibiting resistant acute leukemic cells.,A series of guaianolide-type sesquiterpene lactones derivatives with arylation of α-methylene-γ-lactone moiety was synthesized using Heck reactions, and was evaluated for their activities against acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell line HL-60 and doxorubicin-resistant cell line HL-60/A. Although all compounds were significantly less active against HL-60 than the parent molecules, surprisingly, compounds 3a, 4c-4e, 5e, and 8d exhibited high potency against doxorubicin-resistant cell line HL-60/A (IC50=6.2-19 μM), and their activities against HL-60/A were comparable to that of their parent molecules. In view of their novel activities against HL-60/A, compound 5e with inhibitory activity against HL-60/A (IC50=6.2±0.5 μM) was selected for study its preliminary mechanism. The result reveals that compound 5e can obviously induce apoptosis.
23868100,2,2013,Kidney Blood Press Res,Modeling of oxidized PTH (oxPTH) and non-oxidized PTH (n-oxPTH) receptor binding and relationship of oxidized to non-oxidized PTH in children with chronic renal failure, adult patients on hemodialysis and kidney transplant recipients.,BACKGROUND: The biological properties of oxidized and non-oxidized PTH are substantially different. Oxidized PTH (oxPTH) loses its PTH receptor-stimulating properties, whereas non-oxidized PTH (n-oxPTH) is a full agonist of the receptor. This was described in more than 20 well published studies in the 1970(s) and 80(s). However, PTH oxidation has been ignored during the development of PTH assays for clinical use so far. Even the nowadays used third generation assay systems do not consider oxidation of PTH We recently developed an assay to differentiate between oxPTH and n-oxPTH. In the current study we established normal values for this assay system. Furthermore, we compare the ratio of oxPTH to n-oxPTH in different population with chronic renal failure: 620 children with renal failure stage 2-4 of the 4C study, 342 adult patients on dialysis, and 602 kidney transplant recipients. In addition, we performed modeling of the interaction of either oxPTH or n-oxPTH with the PTH receptor using biophysical structure approaches.RESULTS: The children had the highest mean as well as maximum n-oxPTH concentrations as compared to adult patients (both patients on dialysis as well as kidney transplant recipients). The relationship between oxPTH and n-oxPTH of individual patients varied substantially in all three populations with renal impairment. The analysis of n-oxPTH in 89 healthy control subjects revealed that n-oxPTH concentrations in patient with renal failure were higher as compared to healthy adult controls (2.25-fold in children with renal failure, 1.53-fold in adult patients on dialysis, and 1.56-fold in kidney transplant recipients, respectively). Computer assisted biophysical structure modeling demonstrated, however, minor sterical- and/or electrostatic changes in oxPTH and n-oxPTH. This indicated that PTH oxidation may induce refolding of PTH and hence alters PTH-PTH receptor interaction via oxidation induced three-dimensional structure alteration of PTH.CONCLUSION: A huge proportion of circulating PTH measured by current state-of-the-art assay systems is oxidized and thus not biologically active. The relationship between oxPTH and n-oxPTH of individual patients varied substantially. Non-oxidized PTH concentrations are 1.5 - 2.25 fold higher in patients with renal failure as compared to health controls. Measurements of n-oxPTH may reflect the hormone status more precise. The iPTH measures describes most likely oxidative stress in patients with renal failure rather than the PTH hormone status. This, however, needs to be demonstrated in further clinical studies. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.
23775312,2,2013,Chromosoma,Mitosis as an anti-cancer drug target.,Suppression of cell proliferation by targeting mitosis is one potential cancer intervention. A number of existing chemotherapy drugs disrupt mitosis by targeting microtubule dynamics. While efficacious, these drugs have limitations, i.e. neuropathy, unpredictability and development of resistance. In order to overcome these issues, a great deal of effort has been spent exploring novel mitotic targets including Polo-like kinase 1, Aurora kinases, Mps1, Cenp-E and KSP/Eg5. Here we summarize the latest developments in the discovery and clinical evaluation of new mitotic drug targets.
23768145,2,2013,Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,Advance in dietary polyphenols as α-glucosidases inhibitors: a review on structure-activity relationship aspect.,The dietary polyphenols as α-glucosidases inhibitors have attracted great interest among researchers. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the research reports on the structure-activity relationship of dietary polyphenols inhibiting α-glucosidases. The molecular structures that influence the inhibition are the following: (1) The hydroxylation and galloylation of flavonoids including catechins improve the inhibitory activity. (2) The glycosylation of hyroxyl group and hydrogenation of the C2=C3 double bond on flavonoids weaken the inhibition. (3) However, cyaniding glycosides show higher inhibition against than cyanidin. Proanthocyanidins oligomers exhibit a stronger inhibitory activity than their polymers. (4) The hydroxylation on B ring and the glycosylation of stilbenes reduce the inhibitory activity. (5) Caffeoylquinic acids display strong inhibition against α-glucosidases. However, hydroxycinnamic acid, ferulic acid, and gallic acid hardly inhibited α-glucosidases. (6) The coupled galloyl structures attached to C-3 and C-6 of the 4C(1) glucose core of ellagitanin gave basic inhibitory activity. (7) The mono-glycosylation of chalcones slightly lowers the inhibition. However, the diglycosylation of chalcones significantly decreased the activity.
23756778,2,2013,Biochim Biophys Acta,Large scale production of the active human ASCT2 (SLC1A5) transporter in Pichia pastoris--functional and kinetic asymmetry revealed in proteoliposomes.,The human glutamine/neutral amino acid transporter ASCT2 (hASCT2) was over-expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified by Ni(2+)-chelating and gel filtration chromatography. The purified protein was reconstituted in liposomes by detergent removal with a batch-wise procedure. Time dependent [(3)H]glutamine/glutamine antiport was measured in proteoliposomes which was active only in the presence of external Na(+). Internal Na(+) slightly stimulated the antiport. Optimal activity was found at pH7.0. A substantial inhibition of the transport was observed by Cys, Thr, Ser, Ala, Asn and Met (≥70%) and by mercurials and methanethiosulfonates (≥80%). Heterologous antiport of [(3)H]glutamine with other neutral amino acids was also studied. The transporter showed asymmetric specificity for amino acids: Ala, Cys, Val, Met were only inwardly transported, while Gln, Ser, Asn, and Thr were transported bi-directionally. From kinetic analysis of [(3)H]glutamine/glutamine antiport Km values of 0.097 and 1.8mM were measured on the external and internal sides of proteoliposomes, respectively. The Km for Na(+) on the external side was 32mM. The homology structural model of the hASCT2 protein was built using the GltPh of Pyrococcus horikoshii as template. Cys395 was the only Cys residue externally exposed, thus being the potential target of SH reagents inhibition and, hence, potentially involved in the transport mechanism.
23705979,2,2013,BMC Genomics,Comparative analysis of 4C-Seq data generated from enzyme-based and sonication-based methods.,BACKGROUND: Circular chromosome conformation capture, when coupled with next-generation sequencing (4C-Seq), can be used to identify genome-wide interaction of a given locus (a &quot;bait&quot; sequence) with all of its interacting partners. Conventional 4C approaches used restriction enzyme digestion to fragment chromatin, and recently sonication approach was also applied for this purpose. However, bioinformatics pipelines for analyzing sonication-based 4C-Seq data are not well developed. In addition, data consistency as well as similarity between the two methods has not been explored previously. Here we present a comparative analysis of 4C-Seq data generated by both methods, using an enhancer element of Pou5f1 gene in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.RESULTS: From biological replicates, we found good correlation (r&gt;0.6) for inter-chromosomal interactions identified in either enzyme or sonication method. Compared to enzyme approach, sonication method generated less distal intra-chromosomal interactions, possibly due to the difference in chromatin fragmentation. From all mapped interactions, we further applied statistical models to identify enriched interacting regions. Interestingly, data generated from the two methods showed 30% overlap of the reproducible interacting regions. The interacting sites in the reproducible regions from both methods are similarly enriched with active histone marks. In addition, the interacting sites identified from sonication-based data are enriched with ChIP-Seq signals of transcription factors Oct4, Klf4, Esrrb, Tcfcp2i1, and Zfx that are critical for reprogramming and pluripotency.CONCLUSIONS: Both enzyme-based and sonication-based 4C-Seq methods are valuable tools to explore long-range chromosomal interactions. Due to the nature of sonication-based method, correlation analysis of the 4C interactions with transcription factor binding should be more straightforward.
23659478,2,2013,Inorg Chem,Striking difference in antiproliferative activity of ruthenium- and osmium-nitrosyl complexes with azole heterocycles.,Ruthenium nitrosyl complexes of the general formulas (cation)(+)[cis-RuCl4(NO)(Hazole)](-), where (cation)(+) = (H2ind)(+), Hazole = 1H-indazole (Hind) (1c), (cation)(+) = (H2pz)(+), Hazole = 1H-pyrazole (Hpz) (2c), (cation)(+) = (H2bzim)(+), Hazole = 1H-benzimidazole (Hbzim) (3c), (cation)(+) = (H2im)(+), Hazole = 1H-imidazole (Him) (4c) and (cation)(+)[trans-RuCl4(NO)(Hazole)](-), where (cation)(+) = (H2ind)(+), Hazole = 1H-indazole (1t), (cation)(+) = (H2pz)(+), Hazole = 1H-pyrazole (2t), as well as osmium analogues of the general formulas (cation)(+)[cis-OsCl4(NO)(Hazole)](-), where (cation)(+) = (n-Bu4N)(+), Hazole =1H-indazole (5c), 1H-pyrazole (6c), 1H-benzimidazole (7c), 1H-imidazole (8c), (cation)(+) = Na(+); Hazole =1H-indazole (9c), 1H-benzimidazole (10c), (cation)(+) = (H2ind)(+), Hazole = 1H-indazole (11c), (cation)(+) = H2pz(+), Hazole = 1H-pyrazole (12c), (cation)(+) = (H2im)(+), Hazole = 1H-imidazole (13c), and (cation)(+)[trans-OsCl4(NO)(Hazole)](-), where (cation)(+) = n-Bu4N(+), Hazole = 1H-indazole (5t), 1H-pyrazole (6t), (cation)(+) = Na(+), Hazole = 1H-indazole (9t), (cation)(+) = (H2ind)(+), Hazole = 1H-indazole (11t), (cation)(+) = (H2pz)(+), Hazole = 1H-pyrazole (12t), have been synthesized. The compounds have been comprehensively characterized by elemental analysis, ESI mass spectrometry, spectroscopic techniques (IR, UV-vis, 1D and 2D NMR) and X-ray crystallography (1c·CHCl3, 1t·CHCl3, 2t, 3c, 6c, 6t, 8c). The antiproliferative activity of water-soluble compounds (1c, 1t, 3c, 4c and 9c, 9t, 10c, 11c, 11t, 12c, 12t, 13c) in the human cancer cell lines A549 (nonsmall cell lung carcinoma), CH1 (ovarian carcinoma), and SW480 (colon adenocarcinoma) has been assayed. The effects of metal (Ru vs Os), cis/trans isomerism, and azole heterocycle identity on cytotoxic potency and cell line selectivity have been elucidated. Ruthenium complexes (1c, 1t, 3c, and 4c) yielded IC50 values in the low micromolar concentration range. In contrast to most pairs of analogous ruthenium and osmium complexes known, they turned out to be considerably more cytotoxic than chemically related osmium complexes (9c, 9t, 10c, 11c, 11t, 12c, 12t, 13c). The IC50 values of Os/Ru homologs differ by factors (Os/Ru) of up to ~110 and ~410 in CH1 and SW480 cells, respectively. ESI-MS studies revealed that ascorbic acid may activate the ruthenium complexes leading to hydrolysis of one M-Cl bond, whereas the osmium analogues tend to be inert. The interaction with myoglobin suggests nonselective adduct formation; i.e., proteins may act as carriers for these compounds.
23614461,2,2013,ACS Chem Biol,NA,Rosmarinic acid (RA) and lithospermic acid B (LAB) are two typical phenolic acids with significant bioactivities that may contribute to the therapeutic effects of Salvia miltiorrhiza. Precise knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway leading to RA and LAB is a necessary prerequisite to optimize the production of important phenolic compounds in S. miltiorrhiza. In vivo isotopic labeling experiments using [ring-(13)C]-phenylalanine, combined with dynamic measurements of metabolite levels by UPLC/Q-TOF, were used to investigate the metabolic origin of phenolic acids in S. miltiorrhiza. These data indicate the in vivo phenolic biosynthetic pathway: two intermediates from the general phenylpropanoid pathway and the tyrosine-derived pathway, 4-coumaroyl-CoA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid (DHPL), are coupled by the ester-forming enzyme rosmarinic acid synthase (SmRAS) to form 4-coumaroyl-3',4'-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid (4C-DHPL). The 3-hydroxyl group is introduced late in the pathway by a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase (SmCYP98A14) to form RA. Subsequently, RA is transformed to a phenoxyl radical by oxidation, and two phenoxyl radicals unite spontaneously to form LAB. The results indicate aspects of the complexity of phenolic acid biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza and expand an understanding of phenylpropanoid-derived metabolic pathways. The candidate genes for the key enzymes that were revealed provide a substantial foundation for follow-up research on improving the production of important phenolic acids through metabolic engineering in the future.
23522389,2,2013,Mol Cancer,Timp1 interacts with beta-1 integrin and CD63 along melanoma genesis and confers anoikis resistance by activating PI3-K signaling pathway independently of Akt phosphorylation.,BACKGROUND: Anoikis resistance is one of the abilities acquired along tumor progression. This characteristic is associated with metastasis development, since tumorigenic cells must survive independently of cell-matrix interactions in this process. In our laboratory, it was developed a murine melanocyte malignant transformation model associated with a sustained stressful condition. After subjecting melan-a melanocytes to 1, 2, 3 and 4 cycles of anchorage impediment, anoikis resistant cells were established and named 1C, 2C, 3C and 4C, respectively. These cells showed altered morphology and PMA independent cell growth, but were not tumorigenic, corresponding to pre-malignant cells. After limiting dilution of 4C pre-malignant cells, melanoma cell lines with different characteristics were obtained. Previous data from our group showed that increased Timp1 expression correlated with anoikis-resistant phenotype. Timp1 was shown to confer anchorage-independent growth capability to melan-a melanocytes and render melanoma cells more aggressive when injected into mice. However, the mechanisms involved in anoikis regulation by Timp1 in tumorigenic cells are not clear yet.METHODS: The β1-integrin and Timp1 expression were evaluated by Western blotting and CD63 protein expression by flow cytometry using specific antibodies. To analyze the interaction among Timp1, CD63 and β1-integrin, immunoprecipitation assays were performed, anoikis resistance capability was evaluated in the presence or not of the PI3-K inhibitors, Wortmannin and LY294002. Relative expression of TIMP1 and CD63 in human metastatic melanoma cells was analyzed by real time PCR.RESULTS: Differential association among Timp1, CD63 and β1-integrins was observed in melan-a melanocytes, 4C pre-malignant melanocytes and 4C11- and 4C11+ melanoma cells. Timp1 present in conditioned medium of melanoma cells rendered melan-a melanocytes anoikis-resistant through PI3-K signaling pathway independently of Akt activation. In human melanoma cell lines, in which TIMP1 and beta-1 integrin were also found to be interacting, TIMP1 and CD63 levels together was shown to correlate significantly with colony formation capacity.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that Timp1 is assembled in a supramolecular complex containing CD63 and β1-integrins along melanoma genesis and confers anoikis resistance by activating PI3-K signaling pathway, independently of Akt phosphorylation. In addition, our data point TIMP1, mainly together with CD63, as a potential biomarker of melanoma.
23419346,2,2013,Infect Genet Evol,Hepatitis C virus infections in the Democratic Republic of Congo exhibit a cohort effect.,The prevalence and genetic diversity of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human pegivirus (HPgV) in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa is poorly characterized, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo--the largest country in the region and one of the most populous. To address this situation we conducted a molecular epidemiological survey of HCV and HPgV (previously named GB Virus C or hepatitis G virus) in samples collected in 2007 from 299 males from the DRC, whose ages ranged from 21 to 71 years old. Samples were tested for the presence of HCV antibodies by ELISA and reactive samples were subsequently tested for HCV RNA using RT-PCR in which both the HCV Core and NS5B genome regions were amplified. Remaining samples were tested for HPgV RNA and the HPgV NS3 genome region of positive samples was amplified. For HCV, 13.7% of the samples were seropositive (41/299) but only 3.7% were viremic (11/299). HPgV RNA was found in 12.7% (33/259) of samples. HCV viremia was strongly associated with age; the percentage of samples that contained detectable HCV RNA was ~0.5% in those younger than 50 and 13% in those older than 50. Our study represents the first systematic survey of HCV genetic diversity in the DRC. HCV sequences obtained belonged to diverse lineages of genotype 4, including subtypes 4c, 4 k, 4 l and 4r, plus one unclassified lineage that may constitute a new subtype. These data suggest that HCV in the DRC exhibits an age 'cohort effect', as has been recently reported in neighbouring countries, and are consistent with the hypothesis that HCV transmission rates were higher in the mid-twentieth century, possibly as a result of parenteral, iatrogenic, or other unidentified factors. Different HCV subtypes were associated with individuals of different ages, implying that HCV infection in the DRC may have arisen through multiple separate HCV epidemics with different causes.
23342049,2,2013,PLoS One,Acute inactivation of PSD-95 destabilizes AMPA receptors at hippocampal synapses.,Postsynatptic density protein (PSD-95) is a 95 kDa scaffolding protein that assembles signaling complexes at synapses. Over-expression of PSD-95 in primary hippocampal neurons selectively increases synaptic localization of AMPA receptors; however, mice lacking PSD-95 display grossly normal glutamatergic transmission in hippocampus. To further study the scaffolding role of PSD-95 at excitatory synapses, we generated a recombinant PSD-95-4c containing a tetracysteine motif, which specifically binds a fluorescein derivative and allows for acute and permanent inactivation of PSD-95. Interestingly, acute inactivation of PSD-95 in rat hippocampal cultures rapidly reduced surface AMPA receptor immunostaining, but did not affected NMDA or transferrin receptor localization. Acute photoinactivation of PSD-95 in dissociated neurons causes ∼80% decrease in GluR2 surface staining observed by live-cell microscopy within 15 minutes of PSD-95-4c ablation. These results confirm that PSD-95 stabilizes AMPA receptors at postsynaptic sites and provides insight into the dynamic interplay between PSD-95 and AMPA receptors in live neurons.
24321835,1,2013,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel substituted 1,3,4-thiadiazole and 2,6-di aryl substituted imidazo [2,1-b] [1,3,4] thiadiazole derivatives.,A new series of N-[5-(4-(alkyl/aryl)-3-nitro-phenyl)-[1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethyl-propionamide 4 (a-l) and 6-(4-Methoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-alkyl/aryl)-3-nitro-phenyl)-Imidazo [2,1-b] [1,3,4] thiadiazole 6 (a-l) were synthesized starting from 5-(4-Fluoro-3-nitro-phenyl)-[1,3,4] thiadiazole-2-ylamine. The synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, NMR, mass spectral and elemental analysis. All the compounds were tested for antibacterial and antifungal activities. The antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by well plate method (zone of inhibition). Compounds 4a, 4c and 6e, 6g displayed appreciable activity at the concentration 0.5-1.0 mg/mL.
24300519,1,2013,Pharmaceutics,Proteoliposomes as tool for assaying membrane transporter functions and interactions with xenobiotics.,Proteoliposomes represent a suitable and up to date tool for studying membrane transporters which physiologically mediate absorption, excretion, trafficking and reabsorption of nutrients and metabolites. Using recently developed reconstitution strategies, transporters can be inserted in artificial bilayers with the same orientation as in the cell membranes and in the absence of other interfering molecular systems. These methodologies are very suitable for studying kinetic parameters and molecular mechanisms. After the first applications on mitochondrial transporters, in the last decade, proteoliposomes obtained with optimized methodologies have been used for studying plasma membrane transporters and defining their functional and kinetic properties and structure/function relationships. A lot of information has been obtained which has clarified and completed the knowledge on several transporters among which the OCTN sub-family members, transporters for neutral amino acid, B0AT1 and ASCT2, and others. Transporters can mediate absorption of substrate-like derivatives or drugs, improving their bioavailability or can interact with these compounds or other xenobiotics, leading to side/toxic effects. Therefore, proteoliposomes have recently been used for studying the interaction of some plasma membrane and mitochondrial transporters with toxic compounds, such as mercurials, H2O2 and some drugs. Several mechanisms have been defined and in some cases the amino acid residues responsible for the interaction have been identified. The data obtained indicate proteoliposomes as a novel and potentially important tool in drug discovery.
24278484,1,2013,PLoS One,Reciprocal regulation of development of neutrophil-dendritic cell hybrids in mice by IL-4 and interferon-gamma.,Neutrophils contribute to innate host immunity by functioning as professional phagocytes, whereas dendritic cells (DCs) are prototypic antigen presenting cells (APCs) responsible for the induction of adaptive immune responses. We have demonstrated recently that neutrophils trans-differentiate into a unique population, termed &quot;neutrophil-DC hybrids,&quot; expressing surface markers of both neutrophils and DCs and exhibiting dual functionality of both phagocytes and APCs. Although the hybrid cells emerged in significant numbers in murine bone marrow (BM) culture in the presence of GM-CSF, mechanisms regulating their development remained mostly unknown. In this study, we tested a total of 61 cytokines for their potentials to regulate neutrophil-DC hybrid formation using a newly developed BM micro-culture system combined with semi-automated FACS analysis. Several cytokines including GM-CSF were found to promote the generation of neutrophil-DC hybrids defined by the phenotype of CD11c(+)/MHC II(+)/Ly6G(+). When tested in the presence of GM-CSF, hybrid cell development was enhanced by IL-4 and suppressed by interferon-γ (IFNγ) in dose-dependent fashions. We next determined in vivo impacts of IL-4 and IFNγ on the development of neutrophil-DC hybrids in thioglycollate-induced peritonitis lesions. Intraperitoneal administrations of IL-4/anti-IL-4 antibody complex (IL-4C) significantly increased the number of hybrids recovered from the lesions. By contract, recovery of hybrids was reduced by recombinant IFNγ. With regard to function, those hybrid cells recovered from IL-4C-treated mice and IFNγ-treated mice showed potent abilities to capture E.coli. These observations imply that emergence of neutrophil-DC hybrids in inflammatory sites is tightly regulated by local cytokine milieus.
24170740,1,2013,J Exp Bot,Osmotic stress-induced polyamine oxidation mediates defence responses and reduces stress-enhanced grapevine susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea.,Abiotic factors inducing osmotic stress can influence the plant immune response and resistance to pathogen infections. In this study, the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG)- and sucrose-induced osmotic stress on polyamine (PA) homeostasis and the basal immune response in grapevine plantlets before and after Botrytis cinerea infection was determined. Pharmacological approaches were also addressed to assess the contribution of osmotic stress-induced PA oxidation to the regulation of defence responses and the susceptibility of grapevine to B. cinerea. Following osmotic stress or pathogen infection, PA homeostasis was linked to enhanced activity of diamine oxidases (CuAO) and PA oxidases (PAO) and the production of 1,3-diaminopropane. These responses paralleled the accumulation of the main stilbenic phytoalexins, resveratrol and ε-viniferin and upregulation of gene transcripts including STS (a stilbene synthase), PR-2 (a β-1,3-glucanase), PR3-4c (acidic chitinase IV), and PR-5 (a thaumatin-like protein), as well as NCED2 involved in abscisic acid biosynthesis. It was also demonstrated that leaves pre-exposed to osmotic stress and later inoculated with B. cinerea showed enhanced PA accumulation and attenuation of CuAO and PAO activities. This was consistent with the impaired production of phytoalexins and transcript levels of defence- and stress-related genes following infection, and the enhanced susceptibility to B. cinerea. Pharmacological experiments revealed that, under osmotic stress conditions, CuAO and PAO were involved in PA homeostasis and in the regulation of defence responses. Specific inhibition of CuAO and PAO in osmotically stressed leaves strongly attenuated the induction of defence responses triggered by B. cinerea infection and enhanced susceptibility to the pathogen. Taken together, this study reveals a contribution of PA catabolism to the resistance state through modulation of immune response in grapevine following osmotic stress and/or after B. cinerea infection.
24164120,1,2013,Hand Surg,Short to medium results using the remotion total wrist replacement for rheumatoid arthritis.,We present the clinical outcome of patients who underwent RE-MOTION Total Wrist Replacement (TWR) for the treatment of Rheumatoid arthritis involving the wrist. Ten patients were available for follow-up, ranging from one to five years after index surgery. Two patients required surgical intervention for wound breakdown, including one patient who required a radial forearm flap for skin coverage. No patients required revision surgery or conversion to fusion. Patients who did not have complications gained statistically significant pain relief and improvement in mean overall flexion. In this small case series with short to medium results patients reported an improvement in terms of flexion and pain. Despite this, the question of efficacy of TWR compared to fusion in the long term remains unanswered due to the high rate of complications.
24084291,1,2013,Infect Genet Evol,Lineage diversification and recombination in type-4 human astroviruses.,Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are important enteric pathogens and can be classified genetically and antigenically into eight types. During surveillance of HAstVs in Italy, type-4 HAstVs were detected only sporadically and found to cluster into two distinct genetic groups. Upon sequence analysis of the 3' end of the polymerase gene (ORF1b) and of the full-length ORF2, the 2008 type-4 HAstV strains were characterised as a novel ORF2 genetic lineage, designated as 4c. The 2008 type-4 HAstVs also shared the ORF1b gene with similar HAstV-4c strains detected globally, thus displaying a conserved ORF1b/ORF2 asset. By interrogation of the databases, this novel lineage 4c accounted for 60.8% of the type-4 strains identified worldwide and the vast majority of recent type-4 HAstVs. The 2002 type-4 HAstVs displayed a type-4b ORF2, whereas in the ORF1b they resembled type-1 HAstVs. This inconsistency suggests a possible recombinant origin, with the RNA switch taking place upstream the ORF1b/ORF2 junction region. Also, recombination likely played a role in the diversification of the ORF2 of the three type-4 lineages. Multi-target analysis is required for appropriate characterisation and identification of recombinant HAstVs.
24066795,1,2013,Mol Pharm,Poly(aminoether)-gold nanorod assemblies for shRNA plasmid-induced gene silencing.,Gold nanorods (GNRs) have emerged as promising nanomaterials for biosensing, imaging, photothermal hyperthermia treatments, and therapeutic delivery for several diseases. We generated poly(aminoether)-GNR nanoassemblies using a layer-by-layer deposition approach based on the 1,4C-1,4Bis polymer from a library recently synthesized in our laboratory. Subtoxic concentrations of 1,4C-1,4Bis-GNR nanoassemblies were employed to deliver expression vectors that express shRNA (&quot;shRNA plasmid&quot;) against firefly luciferase gene to knock down expression of the protein constitutively expressed in prostate cancer cells. The role of hydrodynamic size and zeta potential in determining nanoassembly mediated luciferase silencing was investigated. Finally, the theranostic potential of 1,4C-1,4Bis-GNR nanoassemblies was demonstrated using live cell two-photon induced luminescence bioimaging. Our results indicate that poly(aminoether)-GNR nanoassemblies are a promising theranostic platform for delivery of therapeutic payloads capable of simultaneous gene silencing and bioimaging.
24066277,1,2013,Front Oncol,Cabazitaxel-induced stabilization of microtubules enhances radiosensitivity in ovarian cancer cells.,BACKGROUND: Up to 40% of women with ovarian cancer have short disease-free intervals due to molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance. New therapeutic strategies are sought. Ovarian cancers are sensitive to radiochemotherapy. The taxane cabazitaxel (XRP6258, Jevtana) promotes tubulin assembly and stabilizes microtubules against depolymerization in cells, acting similarly in mechanism to paclitaxel. Here, sequences of cabazitaxel-radiation co-administration are tested for drug-alone cytotoxicity and optimal radiosensitization.MATERIALS AND METHODS: SKOV3, OVCAR3, and TOV-112D ovarian cancer cells were administered cabazitaxel 24 h before (first), 18 h before (second), together (third), or 24 h after (fourth) a single radiation dose, and then, investigated by clonogenic assay and flow cytometric assays. Radiation dose-cell survival data were fitted by two-stage multivariate analyses of variance. High-content flow cytometry partitioned cabazitaxel effects into G2-phase versus M-phase events by DNA content, cyclin A2, and phospho-S10-histone H3 (PHH3). Paclitaxel served as a comparator.FINDINGS: Cabazitaxel cytotoxicity and radiosensitization were dose dependent. Cabazitaxel added 24 h before radiation was the most lethal schedule. DNA content measurements by flow cytometry showed that cabazitaxel-treated cells accumulated in the radiosensitive G2/M 4C DNA complement compartment. Cytometry also showed that surviving cabazitaxel-induced cell cycle arrested cells resolve the arrest by entering 4C or by 8C DNA complement cell cycles.INTERPRETATION: The radiosensitizing effect of cabazitaxel was schedule dependent, due to cell cycle redistribution, and best when cabazitaxel was given 24 h before radiation. Clinical trials of administering both cabazitaxel and radiation should be explored in women with chemoresistant ovarian cancer.
23999041,1,2013,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and study of benzothiazole conjugates in the control of cell proliferation by modulating Ras/MEK/ERK-dependent pathway in MCF-7 cells.,By applying a methodology, a series of benzothiazole-pyrrole based conjugates (4a-r) were synthesized and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity. Compounds such as 4a, 4c, 4e, 4g-j, 4m, 4n, 4o and 4r exhibited significant cytotoxic effect in the MCF-7 cell line. Cell cycle effects were examined for these conjugates at 2 μM as well as 4 μM concentrations and FACS analysis show an increase of G2/M phase cells with concomitant decrease of G1 phase cells thereby indicating G2/M cell cycle arrest by them. Interestingly 4o and 4r are effective in causing apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, 4o showed down regulation of oncogenic expression of Ras and its downstream effector molecules such as MEK1, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and VEGF. The apoptotic aspect of this conjugate is further evidenced by increased expression of caspase-9 in MCF-7 cells. Hence these small molecules have the potential to control both the cell proliferation as well as the invasion process in the highly malignant breast cancers.

23960847,1,2013,Saudi Pharm J,Synthesis and anticancer activity of some fused pyrimidines and related heterocycles.,On account of the reported anticancer of pyrimidine and condensed pyrimidine, a new pyrimido [3,2-b]-1,2,4,5-tetrazine 3a , b , 5c , d , 6, 9, pyrimido [3,2-b]-1,2,4-triazine 10, 11, pyrimido [3,2-b]-1,2,4-triazole 12 and pyrimidine derivatives 1,2a , b , 4c , d , 8, 13, 14, 15 and 16 were synthesized through different chemical reactions. Structures of all synthesized compounds were supported by spectral and elemental analyses. The obtained compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antitumor activity against human liver cancer cell line (HEPG2).
23919811,1,2013,Gut Pathog,Changing trends and serotype distribution of Shigella species in Beijing from 1994 to 2010.,Shigella species are a common cause of acute diarrheal disease in China. In this study, we characterized the changing trends and serotype distribution of Shigella species in Beijing from 1994 to 2010. A total of 5999 Shigella strains were isolated and serotyped from the 302nd Hospital in Beijing. The annual number of Shigella isolates reached a peak (n = 1192; 19.84%) in 1996 and then decreased annually, reaching the lowest point (n = 24; 0.41%) in 2010. S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei were the most frequently isolated Shigella, with their respective isolates making up 53.3% and 27.6% of the total. Isolates of S. flexneri 4c, 4a, and x made up 3% respectively of the total isolates. Significant decreases in percentage of S. flexneri over time were observed. S. sonnei surpassed S. flexneri 2a as the predominant serotype in 2000. Most isolates were recovered from July to September; 13.6% of the isolates were recovered from children aged 0 to 5 years, and 16% were recovered from those aged 21 to 25 years. S. flexneri 2a and 5 were recovered mostly from males (33.41%, p &lt; 0.001; and 0.46%, p &lt; 0.001%; respectively), whereas S. flexneri 2b and 6, and S. sonnei were most often isolated from females. Continuous monitoring of Shigella showed that all 4 species and 27 serotypes were present in Beijing, China, during the study period. The emergence of S. sonnei and the overall decreasing isolation rate of Shigella in Beijing can potentially aid in the development of vaccine and control strategies for shigellosis in the city.
23912240,1,2013,Protein J,Cloning, large scale over-expression in E. coli and purification of the components of the human LAT 1 (SLC7A5) amino acid transporter.,The high yield expression of the human LAT1 transporter has been obtained for the first time using E. coli. The hLAT1 cDNA was amplified from HEK293 cells and cloned in pH6EX3 vector. The construct pH6EX3-6His-hLAT1 was used to express the 6His-hLAT1 protein in the Rosetta(DE3)pLysS strain of E. coli. The highest level of expression was detected 8 h after induction by IPTG at 28 °C. The expressed protein was collected in the insoluble fraction of cell lysate. On SDS-PAGE the apparent molecular mass of the polypeptide was 40 kDa. After solubilization with sarkosyl and denaturation with urea the protein carrying a 6His N-terminal tag was purified by Ni(2+)-chelating affinity chromatography and identified by anti-His antibody. The yield of the over-expressed protein after purification was 3.5 mg/L (cell culture). The human CD98 cDNA amplified from Imagene plasmid was cloned in pGEX-4T1. The construct pGEX-4T1-hCD98 was used to express the GST-hCD98 protein in the Rosetta(DE3)pLysS strain of E. coli. The highest level of expression was detected in this case 4 h after induction by IPTG at 28 °C. The expressed protein was accumulated in the soluble fraction of cell lysate. The molecular mass was determined on the basis of marker proteins on SDS-PAGE; it was about 110 kDa. GST was cleaved from the protein construct by incubation with thrombin for 12 h and the hCD98 was separated by Sephadex G-200 chromatography (size exclusion). hCD98 showed a 62 kDa apparent molecular mass, as determined on the basis of molecular mass markers using SDS-PAGE. The yield of CD98 was 2 mg/L of cell culture.
23891183,1,2013,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta antagonists inhibit hepatitis C virus RNA replication.,It has been reported that ligand-mediated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (hPPARα) is involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication, whereas hPPARγ is not, and the effect of hPPARδ is unknown. Here, we show that hPPARδ-selective antagonists effectively inhibit HCV RNA replication. We describe the design, synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of a series of biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid-type hPPARδ antagonists, including previously reported compounds, as candidate anti-HCV agents. A representative compound (4c) dose-dependently inhibited HCV RNA replication (EC50 0.22 μM), while exhibiting relatively weak cytotoxicity to the host cells (CC50 2.5 μM). It also showed an additive and dose-dependent effect on the inhibition of HCV RNA replication by pegylated interferon alpha (Peg-IFNα) alone and by both Peg-IFNα and ribavirin (currently the clinical treatment of choice for HCV infection). Thus, combination of a hPPARδ antagonist with current therapy may improve the efficacy of treatment for HCV infection.
23880884,1,2013,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,Prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis and risk factors in women treated at public health units in Brazil: a transversal study.,BACKGROUND: Studies have revealed high prevalence rates of Trichomonas vaginalis in men and women worldwide. In Brazil, where reporting is not mandatory, the true prevalence rate is unknown. This study determined the prevalence of the parasite in women attending public health units in the city of Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brazil, identifying possible risk factors for infection, and also compared three diagnostic techniques for detecting the parasite.METHODS: Samples of vaginal secretions collected from 742 women attending public health units were analyzed by direct wet mount examination, culture and smear test. Epidemiological questionnaires were administered.RESULTS: Of the total of 742 samples analyzed, 19 (2.6%) tested positive for T. vaginalis. The variables significantly associated with infection were: being of black ethnicity, smoking, having knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases and presenting clinical signs. The culture method was considered the gold standard test.CONCLUSIONS: Although there are programs to control other sexually transmitted diseases, there are none for trichomoniasis. The results of this study indicate the presence of T. vaginalis in the female population, and points to the need for more research in Brazil to gain a better understanding of the profile and epidemiology of the parasite.
23833711,1,2013,Sci Pharm,Synthesis and Biological Activity of New Thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles Containing a Naphthoquinone Moiety.,Novel 11-substituted 3,11-dihydro-2H-benzo[6,7]thiochromeno[2,3-d][1,3]-thiazole-2,5,10-triones 4a-i were synthesized in 75-90% yields via the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of 5-arylidene-4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinones with 1,4-naphthoquinone. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antineoplastic and antimycobacterial activities. A moderate selectivity against melanoma cancer cells (GI50 (UACC-257-melanoma) = 0.22 μM) was demonstrated for 4i, whereas derivatives 4a, 4c, 4g, and 4h showed promising antimycobacterial activity at a low toxicity level.
23810666,1,2013,J Biosci Bioeng,Isolation and characterization of a mutant recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain with high efficiency xylose utilization.,A recombinant xylose-utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain carrying one copy of heterologous XYL1 and XYL2 from Pichia stipitis and endogenous XKS1 under the control of the TDH3 promoter in the chromosomal DNA was constructed from the industrial haploid yeast strain NAM34-4C, which showed thermotolerance and acid tolerance. The recombinant S. cerevisiae strain SCB7 grew in minimal medium containing xylose as the sole carbon source, and its shortest generation time (G(short)) was 5 h. From this strain, four mutants showing rapid growth (G(short) = 2.5 h) in the minimal medium were isolated. The mutants carried four mutations that were classified into three linkage groups. Three mutations were dominant and one mutation was recessive to the wild type allele. The recessive mutation was in the PHO13 gene encoding para-nitrophenyl phosphatase. The other mutant genes were not linked to TAL1 gene encoding transaldolase. When the mutants and their parental strain were used for the batch fermentation in a complex medium at pH 4.0 containing 30 g/L xylose at 35 °C with shaking (60 rpm) and an initial cell density (Absorbance at 660 nm) of 1.0, all mutants showed efficient ethanol production and xylose consumption from the early stage of the fermentation culture. In two mutants, within 24 h, 4.8 g/L ethanol was produced, and the ethanol yield was 47%, which was 1.4 times higher than that achieved with the parental strain. The xylose concentration in the medium containing the mutant decreased linearly at a rate of 1 g/L/h until 24 h.
23734950,1,2013,Stem Cells Dev,Retinoid machinery in distinct neural stem cell populations with different retinoid responsiveness.,Retinoic acid (RA) is present at sites of neurogenesis in both the embryonic and adult brain. While it is widely accepted that RA signaling is involved in the regulation of neural stem cell differentiation, little is known about vitamin A utilization and biosynthesis of active retinoids in the neurogenic niches, or about the details of retinoid metabolism in neural stem cells and differentiating progenies. Here we provide data on retinoid responsiveness and RA production of distinct neural stem cell/neural progenitor populations. In addition, we demonstrate differentiation-related changes in the expression of genes encoding proteins of the retinoid machinery, including components responsible for uptake (Stra6) and storage (Lrat) of vitamin A, transport of retinoids (Rbp4, CrbpI, CrabpI-II), synthesis (Rdh10, Raldh1-4), degradation of RA (Cyp26a1-c1) and RA signaling (Rarα,β,γ, Rxrα,β,γ). We show that both early embryonic neuroectodermal (NE-4C) stem cells and late embryonic or adult derived radial glia like progenitors (RGl cells) are capable to produce bioactive retinoids but respond differently to retinoid signals. However, while neuronal differentiation of RGl cells can not be induced by RA, neuron formation by NE-4C cells is initiated by both RA and RA-precursors (retinol or retinyl acetate). The data indicate that endogenous RA production, at least in some neural stem cell populations, may result in autocrine regulation of neuronal differentiation.
23681549,1,2013,Mol Biol Rep,p∆TubHA4C, a new versatile vector for constitutive expression in Drosophila.,Several vectors for gene expression are available in Drosophila, a hub for genetics and genomics innovation. However, the vectors for ubiquitous expression have a complex structure, including coding exons, that makes in-frame cloning of cDNAs very complicated. In this report we describe a new Drosophila expression vector (p∆TubHA4C) for ubiquitous expression of coding sequences under the control of a minimal 0.9 kb promoter of α1 tubulin (α1t). This plasmid was designed to include optimized multiple cloning sites (polylinker) to provide flexibility in cloning strategies. We also added the option of double labeling the expressed proteins with two C-terminal tags, the viral epitope hemagglutinin and a synthetic tetracysteine (4C) tag that binds small fluorescent compounds. This dual tag allows both in situ and biochemical detection of the desired protein. In particular, the new 4C tag technology combines easy fluorescent labeling with small arsenical compounds in live or fixed cells and tissues, while producing minimal alterations to the tagged protein due to its small size. To demonstrate the potent and ubiquitous expression under the control of the ∆Tub promoter, bacterial lacZ was expressed and monitored in cell culture and transgenic flies. We found that the modified 0.9 kb ΔTub promoter induced similar expression levels to the intact 2.6 kb α1t promoter, supporting the inclusion of all critical regulatory elements in the new and flexible ∆TubHA4C vector.
23668989,1,2013,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,New azole antagonists with high affinity for the P2Y(1) receptor.,Five-membered-ring heterocyclic urea mimics have been found to be potent and selective antagonists of the P2Y1 receptor.

23654295,1,2013,J Contin Educ Nurs,From lecture to learning tasks: use of the 4C/ID model in a communication skills course in a continuing professional education context.,This article describes the use of four-component instructional design (4C/ID), a model to plan educational interventions for complex learning. This model was used to design a continuing education course on communication skills for health professionals in a context that is hierarchical and communal. The authors describe the 4C/ID model and provide an example of its application in designing the course. In the 4C/ID model, learning tasks serve as the backbone of the course, with lectures and other supportive information organized around them. The 4C/ID model is different from traditional models that base the course on lectures on different topics and connect part-task assignments to these topics. The use of the 4C/ID model to develop the educational intervention moves the paradigm from lectures to learning tasks to better prepare learners for real practice.
23650635,1,2013,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,High-resolution analysis of cis-acting regulatory networks at the α-globin locus.,We have combined the circular chromosome conformation capture protocol with high-throughput, genome-wide sequence analysis to characterize the cis-acting regulatory network at a single locus. In contrast to methods which identify large interacting regions (10-1000 kb), the 4C approach provides a comprehensive, high-resolution analysis of a specific locus with the aim of defining, in detail, the cis-regulatory elements controlling a single gene or gene cluster. Using the human α-globin locus as a model, we detected all known local and long-range interactions with this gene cluster. In addition, we identified two interactions with genes located 300 kb (NME4) and 625 kb (FAM173a) from the α-globin cluster.
23649240,1,2013,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,Improvement of ethanol production from D-lactic acid by constitutive expression of lactate transporter Jen1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,To improve ethanol production from D-lactate, Jen1p, a monocarboxylate-proton symporter, was constitutively expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAM34-4C. The mutant produced 2.4 g/L of ethanol, approximately 2.4 times higher than that of the wild-type strain. A monocarboxylate/proton symporter gene (JEN1) null mutant was also constructed. It produced 0.19 g/L of ethanol, 5 times lower than that of the wild-type strain.
23628615,1,2013,Food Microbiol,Molecular subtyping and virulence gene analysis of Listeria monocytogenes isolates from food.,A total of 67 Listeria monocytogenes isolates from 698 raw meat samples were characterized for molecular serogroup identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. Approximately one third (32.8%) of the isolates belonged to molecular serogroup 1/2a, 3a, followed by 1/2c, 3c (26.9%), 1/2b, 3b, 7 (22.4%), 4b, 4d, 4e (16.4%) and 4a, 4c (1.5%). Most of the L. monocytogenes isolates were susceptible to 14 antimicrobials tested but several were resistant to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin. An additional 30 L. monocytogenes isolates from chicken and produce in our collection were also included to determine the presence of significant virulence markers. All 97 isolates carried inlC and inlJ except for a lineage III isolate 110-1. Most Listeriolysin S (LLS)-carrying isolates (11/12) belonged to lineage I, whereas the remaining one isolate belonged to lineage III. Five 4b, 4d, 4e isolates including two from turkey and three from produce belonged to Epidemic Clone I (ECI). Four molecular serogroup associated mutation types that lead to premature stop codons (PMSCs) in inlA were identified. PFGE and inlA sequence analysis results were concordant, and different virulence potential within 1/2a, 3a and 4b, 4d, 4e isolates were observed. The study revealed that a subset of isolates from meat and produce belonged to ECI, harbored inlC, inlJ and LLS, and produced full length InlA, suggesting that they be capable of causing human illness.
23589875,1,2013,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,High-performance hollow sulfur nanostructured battery cathode through a scalable, room temperature, one-step, bottom-up approach.,Sulfur is an exciting cathode material with high specific capacity of 1,673 mAh/g, more than five times the theoretical limits of its transition metal oxides counterpart. However, successful applications of sulfur cathode have been impeded by rapid capacity fading caused by multiple mechanisms, including large volume expansion during lithiation, dissolution of intermediate polysulfides, and low ionic/electronic conductivity. Tackling the sulfur cathode problems requires a multifaceted approach, which can simultaneously address the challenges mentioned above. Herein, we present a scalable, room temperature, one-step, bottom-up approach to fabricate monodisperse polymer (polyvinylpyrrolidone)-encapsulated hollow sulfur nanospheres for sulfur cathode, allowing unprecedented control over electrode design from nanoscale to macroscale. We demonstrate high specific discharge capacities at different current rates (1,179, 1,018, and 990 mAh/g at C/10, C/5, and C/2, respectively) and excellent capacity retention of 77.6% (at C/5) and 73.4% (at C/2) after 300 and 500 cycles, respectively. Over a long-term cycling of 1,000 cycles at C/2, a capacity decay as low as 0.046% per cycle and an average coulombic efficiency of 98.5% was achieved. In addition, a simple modification on the sulfur nanosphere surface with a layer of conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), allows the sulfur cathode to achieve excellent high-rate capability, showing a high reversible capacity of 849 and 610 mAh/g at 2C and 4C, respectively.
23585301,1,2013,Drug Res (Stuttg),Design, synthesis and evaluation of some novel pyrazoline derivatives as potential anti-inflammatory and antitumor agents.,A new series of pyrazoline derivatives was designed and synthesized with the objective of developing agents with anti-inflammatory activity together with chemoprevention of hepatobiliary malignancies. The prepared compounds were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity using carrageenan-induced granuloma bioassay, using celecoxib as a reference drug. Ulcerogenic effect and acute toxicity profiles (ALD50) for the most active compounds were also determined. Compound 5c was proved to display anti-inflammatory activity better than celecoxib. Compounds 4b, 5d, 5c and 8 were found to be safer than indomethacin with respect to ulcerogenic effect and were well tolerated by the experimental animals with high safety margin (ALD50 &gt;300 mg/Kg). Moreover, histopathological examination was carried out to detect the anti-inflammatory effect of the tested compounds on the livers of carrageenan-injected rats. On the other hand, compounds 4b, 4c, 4d, 5b, 5c, 5d, 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 8 and 9 were selected by the NCI to be evaluated for their anticancer activities but none has passed to the 5-dose assay. In addition, the ligand-receptor interactions of the most active compounds with COX-2 were investigated by performing docking studies using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) version 2008.10.
23553667,1,2013,Glia,Sh3tc2 deficiency affects neuregulin-1/ErbB signaling.,Mutations in SH3TC2 trigger autosomal recessive demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4C (CMT4C) neuropathy. Sh3tc2 is specifically expressed in Schwann cells and is necessary for proper myelination of peripheral axons. In line with the early onset of neuropathy observed in patients with CMT4C, our analyses of the murine model of CMT4C revealed that the myelinating properties of Sh3tc2-deficient Schwann cells are affected at an early stage. This early phenotype is associated with changes in the canonical Nrg1/ErbB pathway involved in control of myelination. We demonstrated that Sh3tc2 interacts with ErbB2 and plays a role in the regulation of ErbB2 intracellular trafficking from the plasma membrane upon Nrg1 activation. Interestingly, both the loss of Sh3tc2 function in mice and the pathological mutations present in CMT4C patients affect ErbB2 internalization, potentially altering its downstream intracellular signaling pathways. Altogether, our results indicate that the molecular mechanism for the axonal size sensing is disturbed in Sh3tc2-deficient myelinating Schwann cells, thus providing a novel insight into the pathophysiology of CMT4C neuropathy.
23540948,1,2013,Eur J Radiol,Simple rules for ultrasonographic subcategorization of BI-RADS®-US 4 breast masses.,OBJECTIVES: To evaluate an objective method for ultrasonographic (US) subcategorization of BI-RADS(®)-US 4 breast masses based on clear and simple rules in order for woman to benefit from a more complete and homogeneous breast mass analysis.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we selected 330 women, with 339 US breast masses, classified as BI-RADS(®)-US 4. Three physicians experienced in breast imaging independently reviewed all US images, assessing mass shape, margins, orientation, echo texture and vascularity. These experts further subdivided the masses into subcategories 4a, 4b and 4c, according to simple US rules. Inter-observer agreement was calculated for US features categories and for final subcategory assessment. We also estimated the positive predictive value (PPV) for BI-RADS(®)-US subcategories 4a, 4b and 4c assigned by each of the three observers.RESULTS: Pathological examination of all masses confirmed 144 (42%) malignant and 195 (58%) benign tumors. Moderate agreement was obtained for mass shape, margins, vascularity and for final BI-RADS(®)-US 4 subcategory. Substantial agreement was obtained for the description of mass orientation and echo texture. The PPV for subcategories 4a, 4b and 4c were, 17%, 45% and 85%, respectively, for the first observer and 20%, 38% and 79% and 17%, 40% and 85% for the other two observers.CONCLUSION: Standardization of a US subcategorization of BI-RADS(®)-US 4 breast masses seems to be feasible, with substantial inter-observer agreement and progressive increase in the PPV in the subcategories 4a, 4b and 4c, provided that clear and simple classification rules are defined.
23446549,1,2013,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,Photophysics and light-activated biocidal activity of visible-light-absorbing conjugated oligomers.,The photophysical properties of three cationic π-conjugated oligomers were correlated with their visible light activated biocidal activity vs S. aureus. The oligomers contain three arylene units (terthiophene, 4a; thiophene-benzotriazole-thiophene, 4b; thiophene-benzothiadiazole-thiophene, 4c) capped on each end by cationic -(CH2)3NMe3(+) groups. The oligomers absorb in the visible region due to their donor-acceptor-donor electronic structure. Oligomers 4a and 4b have high intersystem crossing and singlet oxygen sensitization efficiency, but 4c has a very low intersystem crossing efficiency and it does not sensitize singlet oxygen. The biocidal activity of the oligomers under visible light varies in the order 4a &gt; 4b ≈ 4c.
23422922,1,2013,Eur J Clin Nutr,Impact of body-composition methodology on the composition of weight loss and weight gain.,OBJECTIVES: We intended to (i) to compare the composition of weight loss and weight gain using densitometry, deuterium dilution (D₂O), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the four-compartment (4C) model and (ii) to compare regional changes in fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and skeletal muscle as assessed by DXA and MRI.METHODS: Eighty-three study participants aged between 21 and 58 years with a body mass index range of 20.2-46.8 kg/m(2) had been assessed at two different occasions with a mean follow-up between 23.5 and 43.5 months. Body-weight changes within &lt; 3% were considered as weight stable, a gain or a loss of &gt;3% of initial weight was considered as a significant weight change.RESULTS: There was a considerable bias between the body-composition data obtained by the individual methods. When compared with the 4C model, mean bias of D₂O and densitometry was explained by the erroneous assumption of a constant hydration of FFM, thus, changes in FM were underestimated by D₂O but overestimated by densitometry. Because hydration does not normalize after weight loss, all two-component models have a systematic error in weight-reduced subjects. The bias between 4C model and DXA was mainly explained by FM% at baseline, whereas FFM hydration contributed to additional 5%. As to the regional changes in body composition, DXA data had a considerable bias and, thus, cannot replace MRI.CONCLUSIONS: To assess changes in body composition associated with weight changes, only the 4C model and MRI can be used with confidence.
23419456,1,2013,J Biosci Bioeng,Ethanol production from D-lactic acid by lactic acid-assimilating Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAM34-4C.,The lactic acid-assimilating yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAM34-4C grew rapidly in minimal D-lactate medium (pH 3.5) at 35°C, compared with minimal L-lactate medium. A laboratory strain, S. cerevisiae S288C, did not grow in either medium at pH 3.5. Strain NAM34-4C produced remarkably high levels of ethanol in YPDL medium at pH 3.5, but not at pH 5.5, when D-lactate was provided as the carbon source. Optimal cultivation conditions for ethanol production from D-lactate by strain NAM34-4C were as follows: shaking speed, 60 rpm; initial pH, 3.0; cultivation temperature, 35°C; yeast extract, 5 g/L; peptone, 10 g/L; and D-lactate, 30 g/L. Under these conditions, strain NAM34-4C produced 2.7 g/L ethanol, which is 18% of the theoretical maximal yield (0.51 3 initial D-lactate concentration).
23419149,1,2013,BMC Gastroenterol,Genetic polymorphisms of epidermal growth factor in relation to risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: two case-control studies.,BACKGROUND: Earlier, we reported a highly statistically significant association between T-helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokine genotypes and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk among natives of southern Guangxi, China, a hyperendemic region for HCC. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays a critical role in malignant transformation of hepatocytes and tumor progression. A polymorphism in the EGF gene (61A &gt; G) results in elevation of EGF in liver tissues and blood. Epidemiological data are sparse on the possible association between EGF genetic polymorphism and HCC risk.METHODS: The EGF 61A &gt; G polymorphism, multiple Th1 and Th2 genotypes, and environmental risk factors for HCC were determined on 117 HCC cases and 225 healthy control subjects among non-Asians of Los Angeles County, California, a low-risk population for HCC, and 250 HCC cases and 245 controls of southern Guangxi, China.RESULTS: Following adjustment for all known or suspected HCC risk factors, non-Asians in Los Angeles who possessed at least one copy of the high activity 61*G allele of the EGF gene showed a statistically non-significant, 78% increased risk of HCC compared with those possessing the EGF A/A genotype. This EGF-HCC risk association significantly strengthened among heavy users of alcohol [odds ratio (OR) = 3.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93-12.76, P = 0.065)], and among individuals carrying the high-risk Th1/Th2 genotypes for HCC (OR = 3.34, 95% CI = 1.24-9.03, P = 0.017). No association between EGF genotype and HCC risk was observed among Chinese in southern Guangxi, China.CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphism in the EGF gene resulting in elevated level of EGF, may contribute to HCC risk among low-risk non-Asians in Los Angeles.
23417461,1,2013,Acta Neurochir Suppl,Gamma knife treatment strategy for metastatic brain tumors.,From 1993 to 2011, a total of 3,095 patients with brain metastases underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) at Tokyo Women's Medical University. Follow-up information on 2,283 of these patients was available for retrospective analysis. The cases were separated into three groups according to the treatment period, the model of the Gamma Knife used, main goals of treatment, and technical nuances of radiosurgery. In the latest cohort of patients treated with the Leksell Gamma Knife model 4C with automatic positioning system, an optimized treatment strategy was applied. It was based on highly selective dose planning, with the use of multiple small isocenters located within the bulk of the mass, which was done for prevention of the excessive irradiation of the perilesional brain and avoidance of its posttreatment edema. In cases of large cystic tumors, selective coverage of the contrast-enhancing capsule with chain-like application of multiple small isocenters was done. Introduction of the new treatment strategy did not affect the 1-year tumor control rate, which was consistently &gt;90 %. However, it did result in a statistically significant reduction of severe posttreatment peritumoral brain edema (from 15.5 % to 6.3 %; P &lt; 0.0001). In conclusion, recent technical and methodological achievements of GKS seemingly do not affect its high efficacy in cases of brain metastasis with regard to tumor control. However, it may result in a prominent reduction of treatment-associated -morbidity, which is particularly important in patients with large and/or critically located neoplasm.
23337102,1,2013,J Reprod Dev,Valproic acid treatment from the 4-cell stage improves Oct4 expression and nuclear distribution of histone H3K27me3 in mouse cloned blastocysts.,We examined effects of treatment with valproic acid (0, 0.2, 1 or 2 mM, VPA), an inhibitor of class I and IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs), of mouse somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos for 24 h from 48 h (4-cell stage), 24 h (2-cell stage) or immediately after oocyte activation on blastocyst formation rates and qualities of the resultant blastocysts. Blastocyst formation rates (33.4-37.0%) were not improved by VPA treatments compared with the untreated control (35.1-36.4%). However, immunofluorescence staining revealed that Oct4 expression levels, evaluated from percentages of embryos expressing Oct4 strongly and having more than 10 Oct4-positive cells, in blastocysts from SCNT embryos treated with 1 mM VPA for 24 h from the 4-cell stage (VPA-4C) were highest among all the groups and that the proportion of cells with a normal nuclear distribution of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a marker of the state of X-chromosome inactivation, significantly increased in the VPA-4C group (36.6%) compared with the control group (12.4%, P&lt;0.05). Treatments with scriptaid and sodium butyrate, inhibitors of class I and IIa/b HDACs, for 24 h from the 4-cell stage also had beneficial effects on SCNT blastocysts. These findings indicate that treatment with 1 mM VPA from the 4-cell stage improves the Oct4 expression and nuclear distribution of H3K27me3 in mouse SCNT blastocysts and suggest that the inhibition of class I and IIa HDACs from the 4-cell stage plays an important role in these effects.
23336070,1,2013,Sci Rep,Cell sorting in a Petri dish controlled by computer vision.,Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) applying flow cytometry to separate cells on a molecular basis is a widespread method. We demonstrate that both fluorescent and unlabeled live cells in a Petri dish observed with a microscope can be automatically recognized by computer vision and picked up by a computer-controlled micropipette. This method can be routinely applied as a FACS down to the single cell level with a very high selectivity. Sorting resolution, i.e., the minimum distance between two cells from which one could be selectively removed was 50-70 micrometers. Survival rate with a low number of 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and NE-4C neuroectodermal mouse stem cells was 66 ± 12% and 88 ± 16%, respectively. Purity of sorted cultures and rate of survival using NE-4C/NE-GFP-4C co-cultures were 95 ± 2% and 62 ± 7%, respectively. Hydrodynamic simulations confirmed the experimental sorting efficiency and a cell damage risk similar to that of normal FACS.
23331174,1,2013,Org Lett,14-Membered macrocyclic ring-derived toolbox: the identification of small molecule inhibitors of angiogenesis and early embryo development in zebrafish assay.,A highly practical and modular synthesis to obtain a diverse 14-membered ring-based macrocyclic toolbox is achieved. These compounds were further tested in zebrafish assays related to early embryonic development, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis, respectively. 1.4c was identified as an antiangiogenesis agent.
23323953,1,2013,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Synthesis and carbonic anhydrase inhibitory properties of novel 1,4-dihydropyrimidinone substituted diarylureas.,Abstract A new series of 1,4-dihydropyrimidinone (DHPM) substituted diaryl urea and thiourea derivatives were synthesized and their inhibitory effects on the activity of purified human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) I and II were evaluated. 4-Nitrophenyl-1,4-DHPM was prepared with dimedone, nitrobenzaldehyde and urea or thiourea and nitro group was reduced to amine derivative. The compound was reacted with isocyanates and isothiocyanates to get the final products. The results showed that all the synthesized compounds inhibited the carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme activity; 4c (IC50=66.23 µM for hCA I) and 4f (IC50=63.09 µM for hCA II) have the most inhibitory effect. The synthesized compounds are very bulky to be able to bind near the zinc ion and they much more probably bind as the coumarins and activators.
23299870,1,2013,Eur J Clin Nutr,Tracking fat-free mass changes in elderly men and women using single-frequency bioimpedance and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry: a four-compartment model comparison.,OBJECTIVES: To compare single estimations of fat-free mass (FFM) and to track FFM using single-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) compared with a four-compartment (4C) model in healthy elderly Americans.METHODS: Thirty-four men and thirty-eight women (Caucasian, ≥ 65 years) were included in the study. Subjects participated in either the control group or the exercise group. All testing and training took place during the 21-week investigation. Body composition assessments using nine BIA equations, DXA and a 4C model were performed during weeks 1, 12 and 24 of the study.RESULTS: Single estimations for DXA and BIA produced high r values (0.79-0.95) and low standard error of estimate values (1.62-3.3 kg), producing subjective ratings of 'ideal' for men and 'excellent' for women. Both DXA and two BIA equations revealed the same significance when comparing groups and times with the 4C model. Individual accuracy for tracking changes was similar among BIA equations and DXA compared with the 4C model, with a total agreement of 25% for BIA and 27% for DXA compared with the 4C model.CONCLUSIONS: The current data in combination with the reliability errors for both BIA and DXA FFM estimations suggest that individual results should be interpreted with caution if FFM changes are &lt;5 kg. However, DXA and BIA are both valid methods that can be used interchangeably to estimate FFM at a single time point or for tracking changes in FFM in small groups (15-22) of healthy American older adults.
23305610,1,2013,Echocardiography,Left atrial deformation parameters predict left atrial appendage function and thrombus in patients in sinus rhythm with suspected cardioembolic stroke: a speckle tracking and transesophageal echocardiography study.,The aim of this study was to evaluate left atrial deformations using speckle tracking echocardiography for predicting left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus in patients with suspected cardioembolic stroke who were in normal sinus rhythm. A total of 153 ischemic stroke patients (89 males, 64 females) in sinus rhythm who were suspected of having cardioembolism were included in the study. The patients underwent conventional two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram and 2D speckle tracking echocardiogram of the left atrium. Left atrial peak strain (LA-4C-RES) and left atrial precontraction strain (LA-4C-PUMP) were measured. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of thrombus in the LAA in transesophageal echocardiography. Both LA-4C-RES and LA-4C-PUMP values were found to be significantly lower in patients with LAA thrombus (11.8 ± 1.4% vs. 33 ± 12%, P &lt; 0.001 and 5.8 ± 1.3% vs. 14.2 ± 5.3%, P &lt; 0.001, respectively). A good inverse correlation was present between LA-4C-RES values and LAA morphologic parameters (with LAA area: r = -0.70, P &lt; 0.001, with LAA length: r = -0.60, P &lt; 0.001), and a good positive correlation was present with LAA emptying velocity with pulse Doppler (r = 0.74, P &lt; 0.001). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the LA-4C-RES was 0.94 (0.90-0.98, P &lt; 0.001), for the LA-4C-PUMP, the area was 0.92 (0.87-0.96, P &lt; 0.001) to predict LAA thrombus. Left atrial deformation parameters measured by 2D speckle tracking method was found to predict impaired LAA functions and the presence of LAA thrombus in ischemic stroke patients with suspected cardioembolism, but who are in sinus rhythm.
23302085,1,2013,Anim Sci J,Interaction between lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in airag, an alcoholic fermented milk.,The interaction between nine lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and five yeast strains isolated from airag of Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region, China was investigated. Three representative LAB and two yeasts showed symbioses were selected and incubated in 10% (w/v) reconstituted skim milk as single and mixed cultures to measure viable count, titratable acidity, ethanol and sugar content every 24 h for 1 week. LAB and yeasts showed high viable counts in the mixed cultures compared to the single cultures. Titratable acidity of the mixed cultures was obviously enhanced compared with that of the single cultures, except for the combinations of Lactobacillus reuteri 940B3 with Saccharomyces cerevisiae 4C and Lactobacillus helveticus 130B4 with Candida kefyr 2Y305. C. kefyr 2Y305 produced large amounts of ethanol (maximum 1.35 g/L), whereas non-lactose-fermenting S. cerevisiae 4C produced large amounts of ethanol only in the mixed cultures. Total glucose and galactose content increased while lactose content decreased in the single cultures of Leuconostoc mesenteroides 6B2081 and Lb. helveticus 130B4. However, both glucose and galactose were completely consumed and lactose was markedly reduced in the mixed cultures with yeasts. The result suggests that yeasts utilize glucose and galactose produced by LAB lactase to promote cell growth.
23301233,1,2013,Oral Health Prev Dent,Adaptation and psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF-4C+).,PURPOSE: The Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF-4C+) constitutes a theory-grounded, reliable and valid instrument, which, due to its modular structure, allows different uses such as assessing dental anxiety levels, establishing preliminary dental phobia diagnoses and identifying feared stimuli. This study aimed to develop a Spanish version of the original IDAF-4C+ and evaluate its psychometric properties.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 231 Spanish undergraduate students (70.6% female; mean age 21.4 years) completed a questionnaire comprising the Spanish version of the IDAF-4C+ and other measures related to dental anxiety. The structure, reliability and validity of the adapted IDAF-4C+ were analysed.RESULTS: The adapted IDAF-4C fear module yielded a single-factor structure and demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and test-retest reliability. It shared a greater amount of variance with phobia diagnoses than the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) and a single-item measure of dental fear (SIDF). Moreover, the IDAF-4C was moderately to highly correlated with the MDAS and the SIDF measure, as well as with variables connected with dental anxiety such as negative dental thoughts, having had a negative dental experience and negative affect. The frequency of dental visits was also linked to IDAF-4C scores, and IDAF-stimulus items involving cognitive vulnerability, interpersonal and cost concerns were associated with dental attendance.CONCLUSION: The Spanish version of IDAF-4C+ presents similar psychometric properties to the original version which, considering the advantages of this instrument, qualifies the adapted one for its use in different research and applied contexts.
23295050,1,2013,Liver Int,Early on-treatment change in liver stiffness predicts development of liver-related events in chronic hepatitis B patients receiving antiviral therapy.,AIMS: Monitoring fibrosis is mandatory for detailed prognostification in patients with chronic liver disease. We developed optimized cut-offs for liver stiffness (LS) values, based on the histological subclassification of cirrhosis, and investigated whether early on-treatment changes in LS values can predict long-term prognosis in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related advanced liver fibrosis receiving antiviral therapy.METHODS: Between 2005 and 2008, 103 patients with F3 or F4 fibrosis on liver biopsy were enrolled prospectively. Cirrhosis was subclassified into three groups (F4A, F4B and F4C) according to Laennec system. The primary end-point was occurrence of liver-related event (LRE), including decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death.RESULTS: Suggested LS cut-offs for predicting F4B-FC (vs. F3-F4A) and F4C (vs. F3-F4B) were 11.6 and 18.2 kPa respectively. As proportions of patients with LRE occurrence increased according to histological subclassifications stage F3-4A vs. F4B-4C (7.4% vs. 17.1%) and stage F3-4B vs. F4C (13.8% vs. 18.8%), they also increased according to LS cut-off value of 11.6 kPa (5.9% vs. 23.1%) and 18.2 kPa (9.8% vs. 33.3%) respectively (all P &lt; 0.05). Similarly, according to stratified LS values (&lt;11.6, 11.6-18.2 and ≥18.2 kPa), overall incidence of LREs and each constituent event increased significantly (all P &lt; 0.05). In addition, the observed changes in LS values between baseline and 6 months of follow-up showed significant correlations with LRE development.CONCLUSIONS: Stratified LS values based on Laennec system and dynamic changes in LS values on follow-up may be helpful in assessing risk of LREs in subjects with HBV-related advanced liver fibrosis receiving antiviral therapy.
23292567,1,2013,Behav Res Methods,On using isoluminant stimuli to separate magno- and parvocellular responses in psychophysical experiments-a few words of caution.,Isoluminant (or equiluminant) color stimuli (i.e., those that contain variations only in chromaticity) have been employed in attempts to separate magno- and parvocellular responses in psychophysical and noninvasive electrophysiological experiments. The justification for this has been the assumption that magnocellular cells, unlike parvocellular neurons, do not respond to stimuli varying only in hue. However, several problems are associated with this notion: (1) under many conditions, magnocellular neurons are not fully silenced at isoluminance, and (2) in many circumstances, parvocellular responses are substantially reduced at isoluminance. To rely upon isoluminant stimuli to &quot;bias&quot; stimuli toward the parvocellular system also faces obstacles. Therefore, caution is required when attempting to use isoluminant color to separate magno- and parvocellular responses.
23291121,1,2013,Eur J Med Chem,Antioxidant activities of thiosemicarbazones from substituted benzaldehydes and N-(tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-galactopyranosyl)thiosemicarbazide.,Reaction of N-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl)thiosemicarbazide and different substituted benzaldehydes gave some new substituted benzaldehyde N-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl)thiosemicarbazones. The reaction was performed using conventional and microwave-assisted heating methods. The structures of thiosemicarbazones were confirmed by spectroscopic (IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and ESI-MS) method. The antioxidant activity of these thiosemicarbazones was evaluated in vitro and in vivo, and it's shown that some of these compounds had significant antioxidant activity. Amongst the compounds screened for antioxidant activity, thiosemicarbazones 4a, 4b and 4c showed good antioxidant activity on DPPH. The compounds 4g, 4i, 4l caused significant elevation of SOD activity and 4e, 4g, 4i, 4l had higher catalase activity, and only compounds 4c and 4f expressed the GSH-Px activity.

The Zn(II) atoms are connected by the bridging ligands into a layer parallel to (101). O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds link the layers and the dimethyl-formamide solvent mol-ecules. π-π inter-actions between the pyridine and benzene rings [centroid-centroid distances = 3.7428 (17) and 3.7619 (17) Å] and intra-layer O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds are also present.
24369248,0,2013,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,[Changes of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, titin, and nebulin expressions in the diaphragm of rats with liver cirrhosis].,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular mechanisms of diaphragm injury in rats with liver cirrhosis.METHODS: Thirty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into control group (n=10) and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis group (LC group, n=20). In the 9th week, the rat body weight and diaphragm to body weight ratio were measured, and the parameters of diaphragm contractility including peak twitch tension (Pt), maximum tetanic tension (Po), time to peak contraction (CT), half relaxation time (1/2RT), and force-frequency curve were assessed using a Medlab-U/4C biological signal collecting system. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malondiadehyde (MDA) content in the diaphragm were detected. The mRNA expression levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) and cytoskeletal proteins (titin and nebulin) in the diaphragm were detected by RT-PCR, and the diaphragm ultrastructure was examined with electron microscopy.RESULTS: Compared with those in the control group, body weight, diaphragm to body weight ratio, Pt, Po, and tetanic force under the stimulus frequency of 10, 20, 40, 60, 100 Hz were all significantly decreased (P&lt;0.01), while CT and 1/2RT were significantly prolonged in LC group (P&lt;0.01). SOD and SDH activities were significantly lowered (P&lt;0.01) while the contents of MDA and MPO activity were significantly increased in LC group (P&lt;0.01) with significantly decreased SERCA, titin and nebulin mRNA expressions in the diaphragm (P&lt;0.01). Electron microscopy of the diaphragm in LC group revealed myofibrillar degeneration, absence of the Z line, and mitochondria swelling and edema.CONCLUSION: Liver cirrhosis increases free radicals and aggravates inflammatory response and lipid peroxidation in the diaphragm, thus leading to mitochondrial damages and decreased expressions of cytoskeletal proteins and SERCA to cause diaphragmatic dysfunction.
24366623,0,2013,Biocontrol Sci,Synthesis of thiazole derivatives and evaluation of their antiamoebic activity and cytotoxicity.,Five ethyl (5-alkyl-2-amino-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) acetates (designated compounds 4a-e) incorporating octyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, and hexadecyl alkyl chains, respectively, were prepared by reacting 4-alkyl-4-bromo-3-oxobutyric acid ethyl esters (3a-e) with thiourea in dried acetonitrile. Compounds 3a-e were synthesized by reacting alkylated ethyl acetoacetates with bromine. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by mass spectrometry, NMR, and elemental analysis. Compounds 4a-c demonstrated good in vitro antiamoebic activity against Acanthamoeba polyphaga exposed to 10 mg L(-1) for 6 h at 28 °C. Compound 4b showed the highest antiamoebic activity among the tested compounds, comparable to that of chlorhexidine dihydrochloride (CHX), decreasing the number of viable cells to below the detection limit of 1 cell mL(-1). The activity of compounds 4a and 4c was similar to that of the commercial antifungal agent fluconazole (Flu). The cytotoxic and hemolytic activity of the compounds was assayed against human neonate dermal fibroblasts and sheep erythrocytes, respectively. Compounds 4a-c were less cytotoxic than Flu and CHX. Our results suggest that compound 4b, which is composed of a 2-amino-thiazole attached to a decyl group and an ethyl ester moiety, is a particularly safe and effective alternative amoebicidal agent.
24359779,0,2013,Chin J Nat Med,Triterpenes from Euphorbia hirta and their cytotoxicity.,AIM: To investigate the chemical constituents of the stems, leaves and roots of Euphorbia hirta, and to test for the cytotoxic and antimicrobial potentials of the major constituents of the plant.METHODS: The compounds were isolated by silica gel chromatography and their structures were elucidated by NMR spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity tests were conducted using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, while the antimicrobial tests employed the agar well method.RESULTS: The air-dried stems of E. hirta afforded taraxerone 1, a mixture of 25-hydroperoxycycloart-23-en-3β-ol (2a) and 24-hydroperoxycycloart-25-en-3β-ol (2b) (sample 2) in a 2 : 1 ratio, and another mixture of cycloartenol (3a), lupeol (3b), α-amyrin (3c) and β-amyrin (3d) (sample 3) in a 0.5 : 4 : 1 : 1 ratio. The air-dried leaves of E. hirta yielded sample 2 in a 3 : 2 ratio, sample 3 in a 2 : 3 : 1 : 1 ratio, phytol and phytyl fatty acid ester, while the roots afforded sample 2 in a 2 : 1 ratio, sample 3 in a 2 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio, a mixture of cycloartenyl fatty acid ester 4a, lupeol fatty acid ester 4b, α-amyrin fatty acid ester 4c and β-amyrin fatty acid ester 4d (sample 4) in a 3 : 2 : 1 : 1 ratio, linoleic acid, β-sitosterol and squalene. Compound 1 from the stems, sample 2 from the leaves, and sample 3 from the stems were assessed for cytotoxicity against a human cancer cell line, colon carcinoma (HCT 116). Sample 2 showed good activity with an IC50 value of 4.8 μg·mL(-1), while 1 and sample 3 were inactive against HCT 116. Sample 2 was further tested for cytotoxicity against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (A549). It showed good activity against this cell line with an IC50 value of 4.5 μg·mL(-1). Antimicrobial assays were conducted on 1 and sample 2. Results of the study indicated that 1 was active against the bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, but was inactive against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Sample 2 was active against the bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and fungi: Candida albicans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. It was inactive against Bacillus subtilis and Aspergillus niger.CONCLUSIONS: The triterpenes: 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d were obtained from the stems, roots and leaves of E. hirta. Taraxerol (1) was only isolated from the stems, the leaves yielded phytol and phytyl fatty acid esters, while the roots afforded 4a-4d, linoleic acid, β-sitosterol, and squalene. Triterpene 1 and sample 2 were found to exhibit antimicrobial activities. Thus, these compounds are some of the active principles of E. hirta which is used in wound healing and the treatment of boils. The cytotoxic properties of sample 2 imply that triterpenes 2a and 2b contribute to the anticancer activity of E. hirta.
24359491,0,2013,Inorg Chem,Synthesis and structural analysis of (imido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes containing imidazolin-2-iminato- and imidazolidin-2-iminato ligands, and their use as catalyst precursors for ethylene (co)polymerization.,A series of (imido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes containing 1,3-imidazolin-2-iminato or 1,3-imidazolidin-2-iminato ligands of the type, V(NR')Cl2(L) [R' = 2,6-Me2C6H3, L = 1,3-R2(CHN)2C═N (1a-c,e) or 1,3-R2(CH2N)2C═N (2a-d), R = (t)Bu (a), 2,6-Me2C6H3 (b), 2,6-(i)Pr2C6H3 (c), C6H5 (d), 2,6-(Ph2CH)2-4-MeC6H2 (e); L = 1,3-(2,6-(i)Pr2C6H3)2(CHN)2C═N, R' = 1-adamantyl (Ad, 3c), C6H5 (4c); L = 1,3-(2,6-(i)Pr2C6H3)2(CH2N)2C═N, R' = Ad (5c)], were prepared and characterized. The molecular structures of 1a, 2a,c,d, 3c, 4c, and 5c were determined by X-ray crystallography. All complexes showed high catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization especially in the presence of Et2AlCl cocatalyst; the 2,6-R2C6H3 analogues (R = Me, (i)Pr; 1b,c, 2b,c) exhibited higher catalytic activities than the (t)Bu analogues (1a, 2a), which display rather unique (small) V-N-C(imido) bond angles in the solid state. A good correlation between the activity and the (51)V NMR chemical shift was found for the (arylimido)vanadium precatalysts (1a-c,e, 2a-d, and 4c). These complexes showed high catalytic activity for the copolymerization of ethylene with norbornene (NBE), affording ultrahigh molecular weight copolymers with uniform molecular weight distributions. The activities were affected by the imido ligand as well as by the substituents in the anionic ligand, and the 2,6-(i)Pr2C6H3 analogues (especially 2c and 4c) showed the higher activities. The complexes 2c and 4c also showed high activities with efficient comonomer incorporation for the ethylene copolymerization with 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB) in the presence of Et2AlCl; both the comonomer incorporation and the molecular weight in the resulting polymers were affected by the comonomer employed (NBE vs ENB).
24357432,0,2013,Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol,Cost-effectiveness of prenatal screening strategies for congenital heart disease.,OBJECTIVE: The economic implications of strategies to improve prenatal screening for congenital heart disease (CHD) in low-risk mothers have not been explored. The aim was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of different screening methods.METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model of CHD prenatal screening strategies (four-chamber screen (4C), 4C + outflow, nuchal translucency (NT) or fetal echocardiography) populated with probabilities from the literature. The model included whether initial screens were interpreted by a maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist and different referral strategies if they were read by a non-MFM specialist. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per defect detected. Costs were obtained from Medicare National Fee estimates. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken on model variables commensurate with their degree of uncertainty.RESULTS: In base-case analysis, 4C + outflow referred to an MFM specialist was the least costly strategy per defect detected. The 4C screen and the NT screen were dominated by other strategies (i.e. were more costly and less effective). Fetal echocardiography was the most effective, but most costly. On simulation of 10 000 low-risk pregnancies, 4C + outflow screen referred to an MFM specialist remained the least costly per defect detected. For an additional $580 per defect detected, referral to cardiology after a 4C + outflow was the most cost-effective for the majority of iterations, increasing CHD detection by 13 percentage points.CONCLUSIONS: The addition of examination of the outflow tracts to second-trimester ultrasound increases detection of CHD in the most cost-effective manner. Strategies to improve outflow-tract imaging and to refer with the most efficiency may be the best way to improve detection at a population level.
24355209,0,2013,Daru,Synthesis and molecular modeling of six novel monastrol analogues: evaluation of cytotoxicity and kinesin inhibitory activity against HeLa cell line.,BACKGROUND AND THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: A common approach in cancer chemotherapy is development of drugs that interrupt the mitosis phase of cell division. Dimethylenastron is a known kinesin inhibitor. In this study, six novel dimethylenastron analogues (4a-f), in which 3-hydroxyphenyl substituent has been replaced with substituted benzylimidazolyl, were synthesized through Biginelli reaction.METHODS: Six novel Biginelli compounds (4a-f) were synthesized through one step Biginelli reaction of imidazole aldehydes (3a-c), dimedone and urea or thioura. In vitro cytotoxicities of prepared compounds were investigated using MTT assay. Furthermore the ELIPA kit was implemented to study inhibitory effects of synthesized compounds on ATPase activity of kinesin by measuring of organic phosphate.RESULTS: Our results indicated that analogue 4c is the most toxic and analogues 4f, 4b and dimethylenasteron were less cytotoxic in compare with other analogues. On the other hand, analogue 4a, 4b, 4c and 4e showed stronger Kinesin inhibition as compared with analogue 4f and dimethylenasteron. None of synthesized compounds were as potent kinesin inhibitor as Taxol. Docking analysis revealed that hydrogen bond formation and hydrophobic interactions were the key factors affecting inhibitory effects of these compounds.CONCLUSION: Newly synthesized compounds were found to have moderate to good cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cell. Our results may be helpful in further design of dihydropyrimidine as potential anticancer agents.
24355111,0,2013,Daru,Synthesis and psychobiological evaluation of modafinil analogs in mice.,BACKGROUND AND THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Modafinil, a novel wake-promoting agent with low potential for abuse and dependence, has a reliable structure to find some novel derivatives with better activity and lower potential for abuse and risk of dependency. This study was designed to evaluate psychobiological activity of some novel N-aryl modafinil derivatives.METHODS: Seven novel N-aryl modafinil derivatives were synthesized through three reactions: a) preparation of benzhydrylsulfanyl acetic acid through reaction of benzhydrol with thioglycolic acid, b) formation of desired amide by adding the substituted aniline to activated acid with EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl amino propyl) carbodiimide). This reaction was catalyzed by HOBt (N- hydroxylbenzotriazole), and c) oxidation of sulfur to sulfoxide group with H2O2. Then, their psychobiological effect on the performance of male albino mice were compared to that of modafinil as following: wakefulness by determining the effects of derivatives on phenobarbital-induced loss of the righting reflex (LOPR); exploratory activity by measuring activity in the open field test (OFT); depression by measuring immobility time (IT) during forced swimming test (FST) and the anxiogenic and anxiolytic like effects by using elevated plus-maze test (EPM). All tests were videotaped and analyzed for the frequency and duration of the behaviors during the procedures.CONCLUSIONS: 2-(Benzhydrylsulfonyl)-N-(4-chlorophenyl)acetamide (4c) showed comparable result in LOPR test. However, all analogs were found to be stimulant except 2-(benzhydrylsulfinyl)-N-phenylacetamide (4a). Also 4c led the most exploratory activity in mice among derivatives. FST results showed that 4a had the longest IT while modafinil, 2-(benzhydrylsulfinyl)-N-(3-chlorophenyl) acetamide (4b) and 2-(benzhydrylsulfinyl)-N-(4-ethylphenyl) acetamide (4d) had the shortest IT. In EPM, all derivatives showed anxiogenic-like behavior since they decreased open arms time and open arms entries and simultaneously increased close arms time.
24352257,0,2013,Photochem Photobiol Sci,Design and synthesis of novel anthracene derivatives as n-type emitters for electroluminescent devices: a combined experimental and DFT study.,Six novel anthracene-oxadiazole derivatives, 4a (2-(4-(anthracen-9-yl)phenyl)-5-p-tolyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole), 4b (2-(4-(anthracen-9-yl)phenyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole), 4c (2-(4-(anthracen-9-yl)phenyl)-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole), 8a (2-(4-(anthracen-9-yl)phenyl)-5-m-tolyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole), 8b (2-(3-(anthracen-9-yl)phenyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole) and 8c (2-(3-(anthracen-9-yl)phenyl)-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole) have been synthesized and characterized for use as emitters in organic light emitting devices (OLEDs). They show good thermal stability (T(d), 297-364 °C) and glass transition temperatures (T(g)) in the range of 82-98 °C, as seen from the thermo gravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetric studies. The solvatochromism phenomenon and electrochemical properties have been studied in detail using UV-Vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. TD-DFT calculations have been carried out to understand the electrochemical and photophysical properties. The spatial structures of 4b and 8c are further confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Un-optimized non-doped electroluminescent devices were fabricated using these anthracene derivatives as emitters with the following device configuration: ITO (120 nm)/α-NPD (30 nm)/4a-4c or 8a-8c(35 nm)/BCP (6 nm)/Alq3 (28 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (150 nm). Among all the six compounds, 8a displays the maximum brightness of 1728 cd m(-2) and current efficiency 0.89 cd A(-1). Furthermore, as an electron transporter, 8a exhibited superior performance (current efficiency is 11.7 cd A(-1)) than the device using standard Alq3 (current efficiency is 8.69 cd A(-1)), demonstrating its high potential for employment in OLEDs. These results indicate that the new anthracene-oxadiazole derivatives could play an important role in the development of OLEDs.
24346505,0,2013,Dalton Trans,Methanetrisamidines in coordination chemistry--syntheses, structures and CH-NH tautomerism.,Methanetrisamidines {HC[C(NR)NHR]3} (R = i-Pr 1a; Ph 1b) were reacted with different metal complexes. Reaction of 1a with NiCl2(H2O)6 occurred with protonation of 1a and formation of {[C(C(NHi-Pr)2)3](2+)[NiCl4](2-)} 2, whereas the reaction with CuCl gave [C(C(N(i-Pr)CuCl)NHi-Pr)2(C(NHi-Pr)2)] 3. The formation of 2 and 3, which contain the N-H tautomeric form of 1a, occurred with H-migration from carbon to nitrogen. In contrast, reactions of 1b with [M(NCMe)3(CO)3] (M = Cr, Mo, W) yielded octahedral complexes fac-[M(CO)3CH(C(NHPh)NPh)3] (M = Cr 4a, Mo 4b, W 4c), in which the C-H tautomeric form is preserved. 1b is a rather strong σ-donor ligand as was shown by IR spectroscopy. The structures of 2, 3 and 4a were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction.
24338980,0,2013,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,An unusual example of hypervalent silicon: a five-coordinate silyl group bridging two palladium or nickel centers through a nonsymmetrical four-center two-electron bond.,Pd and Ni dimers supported by PSiP ligands in which two hypervalent five-coordinate Si atoms bridge the two metal centers are reported. Crystallographic characterization revealed a rare square-pyramidal geometry at Si and an unusual asymmetric M2 Si2 core (M=Pd or Ni). DFT calculations showed that the unusual structure of the core is also found in a model in which the phosphine and Si centers are not part of a pincer group, thus indicating that the observed geometry is not imposed by the PSiP ligand. NBO analysis showed that an asymmetric four-center two-electron (4c-2e) bond stabilizes the hypervalent Si atoms in the M2 Si2 core.
24335636,0,2013,Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Effect of anterior mobilization and shortening in the correction of rigid idiopathic thoracic scoliosis.,STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of patients with anterior release and posterior correction instrumentation in a 2-stage procedure for rigid thoracic scoliosis.OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of the anterior release and shortening alone as well as its role in the overall correction.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: With segmental transpedicular instrumentation the need for an additional anterior mobilization became rare. However, its effect on sagittal profile was not sufficiently acknowledged.METHODS: Twenty-two patients with rigid thoracic scoliosis (Lenke 1A, n = 3; 2A, n = 6; 2B, n = 2; 2C, n = 1; 4B, n = 1; 4C, n = 9 patients) were operated in a 2-stage procedure with anterior release followed by posterior correction. The anterior release included convex resection of the rib heads and shortening of the anterior column by resection of the discs and the convex anterolateral endplates in a mean of 8 (4-11) segments.After 14 days (6-27), the posterior instrumentation and correction was done.RESULTS: The preoperative thoracic scoliosis measured a mean of 80°, upper thoracic 42°, and lumbar 49°. The thoracic curve corrected in bending 20° (25%), upper thoracic 10° (24%), and lumbar 26° (53%). The mean thoracic kyphosis (T5-T12) was 11°, lumbar lordosis was -41°.After the anterior release and shortening, thoracic scoliosis improved to 50°, thoracic kyphosis increased to 32°.After the posterior surgery the following values were noted: thoracic scoliosis 10°, upper thoracic 9°, lumbar 8°, thoracic kyphosis 25°, and lumbar lordosis -41°. The results were maintained at follow-up.CONCLUSION: Anterior shortening results in a spontaneous correction of the thoracic scoliosis and hypokyphosis. In this series, the Cobb angle reduced 38% from a mean of 80° to a mean of 50°. Thoracic kyphosis increased from 11° to 32°. This correction was achieved without any corrective force or instrumentation. The second-stage posterior correction is facilitated and nearly complete correction is achieved with a residual curve on average of 10° with a physiological sagittal profile.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.
24324638,0,2013,PLoS One,The kinetics of G2 and M transitions regulated by B cyclins.,B cyclins regulate G2-M transition. Because human somatic cells continue to cycle after reduction of cyclin B1 (cycB1) or cyclin B2 (cycB2) by RNA interference (RNAi), and because cycB2 knockout mice are viable, the existence of two genes should be an optimization. To explore this idea, we generated HeLa BD™ Tet-Off cell lines with inducible cyclin B1- or B2-EGFP that were RNAi resistant. Cultures were treated with RNAi and/or doxycycline (Dox) and bromodeoxyuridine. We measured G2 and M transit times and 4C cell accumulation. In the absence of ectopic B cyclin expression, knockdown (kd) of either cyclin increased G2 transit. M transit was increased by cycB1 kd but decreased by cycB2 depletion. This novel difference was further supported by time-lapse microscopy. This suggests that cycB2 tunes mitotic timing, and we speculate that this is through regulation of a Golgi checkpoint. In the presence of endogenous cyclins, expression of active B cyclin-EGFPs did not affect G2 or M phase times. As previously shown, B cyclin co-depletion induced G2 arrest. Expression of either B cyclin-EGFP completely rescued knockdown of the respective endogenous cyclin in single kd experiments, and either cyclin-EGFP completely rescued endogenous cyclin co-depletion. Most of the rescue occurred at relatively low levels of exogenous cyclin expression. Therefore, cycB1 and cycB2 are interchangeable for ability to promote G2 and M transition in this experimental setting. Cyclin B1 is thought to be required for the mammalian somatic cell cycle, while cyclin B2 is thought to be dispensable. However, residual levels of cyclin B1 or cyclin B2 in double knockdown experiments are not sufficient to promote successful mitosis, yet residual levels are sufficient to promote mitosis in the presence of the dispensible cyclin B2. We discuss a simple model that would explain most data if cyclin B1 is necessary.
24295530,0,2013,Rehabil Psychol,Efficacy of a powered wheelchair simulator for school aged children: a randomized controlled trial.,PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of a custom-made wheelchair simulation in training children to use a powered wheelchair (PWC).DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial employing the 4C/ID-model of learning. Twenty-eight typically developing children (13M, 15F; mean age 6 years, SD 6 months) were assessed on their operation of a PWC using a functional evaluation rating scale. Participants were randomly assigned to intervention (8 × 30-minute training sessions using a joystick operated wheelchair simulation) or control conditions (no task), and were reassessed on their PWC use after the intervention phase. Additional data from the simulation on completion times, errors, and total scores were recorded for the intervention group.RESULTS: Analysis of variance showed a main effect of time, with planned comparisons revealing a statistically significant change in PWC use for the intervention (p = .022) but not the control condition. Although the intervention group showed greater improvement than the controls, this did not reach statistical significance. Multiple regression analyses showed that gender was predictive of pretest (p = .005) functional ability.IMPLICATIONS: A simulated wheelchair task appears to be effective in helping children learn to operate a PWC. Greater attention should be given to female learners who underperformed when compared with their male counterparts. This low-cost intervention could be easily used at home to reduce PWC training times in children with motor disorders.
24293928,0,2013,J Maxillofac Oral Surg,Role of Arthrocentesis in the Management of Acute Closed Lock of TM Joint: A Pilot study.,The following study was conducted in Meenakshi Ammal Dental College on 32 patients. The objective of our study was to assess the efficacy of arthrocentesis for the management of acute closed lock of TMJ. All patients presented with a history of sudden and persistent difficulty in mouth opening and associated TMJ pain. A total of 27 female and 5 male patients were treated using arthrocentesis and lavage under local anesthesia. Patients were assessed for pain and jaw function using visual analogue scales, VAS I (Fig. 4b), VAS II (Fig. 4c), respectively and mouth opening MMO (Fig. 4a) for a period of 6 months. Our results showed satisfactory relief in pain and improved mouth opening in 30 patients. The results proved that arthrocentesis is a very useful technique for treatment of acute closed lock of TMJ. However to arrive at a definitive conclusion a long term evaluation is required.
24251691,0,2013,J Agric Food Chem,Antimicrobial evaluation of a set of heterobicyclic methylthiadiazole hydrazones: synthesis, characterization, and SAR studies.,To exploit the potential antimicrobial activities of azabicyclic skeleton based compounds, a set of 2r,4c-diaryl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one-4-methyl-1,2,3-thiadazole-5-carbonyl hydrazones were synthesized. Unambiguous structural elucidation has been carried out by investigating IR, H(1), C(13) NMR, and elemental analysis. 2D NMR spectra ((1)H-(1)H COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY) were recorded for a representative compound, 12, to confirm the proposed structure for 9-15. Antimicrobial activity assessment of synthesized hydrazones 9-15 has been evaluated by screening against selective strains. Both bacteria and fungi of various forms along with standard drug have been taken for the analysis. Difference in the potency of activity against the strains has been evaluated on the basis of SAR, and it has been revealed that substitution of electron-withdrawing halogens (chloro, fluoro, and bromo) at para positions of the phenyl (10, 12, and 13) enhanced the antifungal and antibacterial activities against tested organisms compared to other hydrazone derivatives.
24227907,0,2013,Mediators Inflamm,PGE 2 desensitizes β -agonist effect on human lung fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction through upregulating PDE4.,In the current study, we investigated the effect of a long-acting β -agonist (salmeterol) and a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor (cilomilast) on human lung fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction. Higher concentrations of salmeterol (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) inhibited fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction. No effect was observed with cilomilast alone (up to 10(-5) M). In the presence of 10(-8) M salmeterol, however, cilomilast could significantly inhibit fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-7) ~10(-5) M). Blockade of endogenous PGE2 by indomethacin further potentiated the inhibitory effect of salmeterol on fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction, but it did not affect cilomilast's effect. Pretreatment with PGE2 abolished the inhibitory effect of salmeterol, but it potentiated the inhibitory effect of cilomilast on fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction. Finally, indomethacin slightly inhibited PDE4C expression, while PGE2 stimulated the expression of PDE4A and -4C in human lung fibroblasts. These findings suggest that long-acting β -agonist and PDE4 inhibitor have a synergistic effect in regulating fibroblast tissue repair functions and that PGE2 can modulate the effect of β -agonist and PDE4 inhibitor at least in part through the mechanism of regulating PDE4 expression.
24214666,0,2013,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Green synthesis and biological evaluation of new di-α-aminophosphonate derivatives as cytotoxic agents.,A series of novel di-α-aminophosphonate derivatives were synthesized by a one-pot method in the presence of PEG-H2 O under ultrasonic irradiation and were characterized by IR, (1) H NMR, (13) C NMR, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against the human lung cancer cell line H1299 and the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 in vitro by the MTT method. All compounds showed moderate cytotoxic activity on both cell lines, and compounds 4b and 4c showed marked activity.
24200642,0,2013,Respir Physiol Neurobiol,Transcutaneous CO(2) plateau as set-point for respiratory drive during upper airway flow-limitation.,Upper airway flow-limitation is often but not always associated with prolonged gradually increasing respiratory effort. We investigated the changes in transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (tcCO(2)) during episodes of upper airway flow limitation during sleep with or without respiratory effort response. Seventy-seven episodes of progressive flow-limitation were analyzed in 36 patients with sleep-disordered breathing. TcCO(2) and arterial oxyhaemoglobin saturation (SaO2) were measured during steady breathing and during episodes of flow-limitation with and without effort response. After lights-off tcCO(2) increased and leveled-off at plateau, when breathing stabilized. During flow-limitation tcCO(2) increased at rate of 4.0kPa/h. Flow-limitation with increasing respiratory effort associated with tcCO(2) increase above the plateau (terminating at 105.2%, p&lt;0.001), whereas flow-limitation without effort response associated with tcCO(2) increase starting below the plateau (95.8%, p&lt;0.001). We conclude that the nocturnal tcCO(2) plateau indicates the level above which the increasing respiratory effort is triggered as response to upper airway flow-limitation. We propose that flow-limitation below the tcCO(2) plateau is an event related to stabilization of sleep and breathing.
24177882,0,2013,Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,Synthesis, spectral characterization, self-assembly and biological studies of N-acyl-2-pyrazolines bearing long alkoxy side chains.,A series of new pyrazoline derivatives (1b-4c) bearing N-acyl arms and nine to twelve carbon long alkoxy side chains was synthesized and characterized on the basis of spectroscopic data and microanalysis. The nature of self-assembly to understand the interplay of alkoxy chain crystallization and various supramolecular interactions was investigated using single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Interesting self-assembled supramolecular structures of 1b and 4c were observed in the crystal lattice owing to various CH⋯O, H⋯H, CH⋯π, lonepair⋯π and π⋯π interactions. Further, all the synthesized compounds (1b-4c) were screened for their in vitro antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities. Compounds 2b, 3b, 2c and 3c showed significant to moderate antifungal activity against Microsporum canis whereas most of the other compounds were found inactive against all the five tested fungal strains. Good anti-inflammatory activity was observed for compounds 1b with IC50 value 331 μM compared to 273 μM for Indomethacine, a standard reference drug. The bio-activity data demonstrates the relationship between lipophilicity, solubility and bioavailability.
24161391,0,2013,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Two distinct WT1 mutations identified in patients and relatives with isolated nephrotic proteinuria.,Wilms' tumor type 1 gene (WT1) encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays a key role during genitourinary development and in adult kidney. Mutations in exons 8 and 9 are associated with Denys-Drash Syndrome, whereas those occurring in the intron 9 donor splice site are associated with Frasier Syndrome. Familial cases of WT1 mutations are rare with only few cases described in the literature, whereas cases of WT1 mutations associated with isolated nephrotic proteinuria with or without focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) are even rarer. Exons 8 and 9 of WT1 gene were analyzed in two non-related female patients and their parents. Patient 1, who presented with isolated nephrotic proteinuria and histologic pattern of FSGS, is heterozygous for the mutation c.1227+4C&gt;T. This mutation was inherited from her mother, who had undergone kidney transplant due to FSGS. Patient 2 is heterozygous for the novel c.1178C&gt;T transition inherited from her father. The putative effect of this nucleotide substitution on WT1 protein is p.Ser393Phe mutation located within the third zinc-finger domain. The patient and her father presented, respectively, isolated nephrotic proteinuria and chronic renal failure. These data highlight the importance of the inclusion of WT1 gene mutational analysis in patients with isolated nephrotic proteinuria, especially when similar conditions are referred to the family.
24155763,0,2013,J Breast Cancer,The clinical utility of automated breast volume scanner: a pilot study of 139 cases.,PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of automated breast volume scanner (ABVS) for detecting and diagnosing the breast lesions.METHODS: From December 2010 to January 2012, bilateral whole breast examinations were performed with ABVS for 139 women. Based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories, the breast lesions were evaluated on coronal multiplanar reconstruction images using the ABVS workstation. Then, the imaging results were compared with those on conventional handheld ultrasound (HHUS) images. Histological diagnoses were performed on BI-RADS category 4 and 5 lesions.RESULTS: A total of 453 lesions were detected by ABVS. On the HHUS, 33 new lesions were detected but 69 lesions were not detected. BI-RADS category 2 and 3 matched to those on ABVS at 73.5% (61/83) and 85.4% (276/323). In 47 lesions of BI-RADS category 4 or 5, there was an exact match to those on ABVS. In addition, 47 lesions were classified as BI-RADS category 4 and 5, for which an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy was performed. The malignant lesions of BI-RADS category 4 and 5 showed the following: 2/27 (7.4%) in 4A, 4/5 (80%) in 4B, 2/2 (100%) in 4C, and 13/13 (100%) in 5. The ABVS showed 21 true positives and a positive predictive value of 44.7% (21/47).CONCLUSION: There was considerable agreement in the assessment of the breast lesions by ABVS and HHUS. The ABVS had advantages of high diagnostic accuracy, examiner-independence, multislice visualization of the whole breast and less time-consuming. Our results indicate that ABVS might be a useful modality in diagnosing breast lesions.
24147988,0,2013,J Phys Chem A,Face-capping μ3-BO in B6(BO)7-: boron oxide analogue of B6H7- with rhombic 4c-2e bonds.,Using the first-principle approaches, we predict a B6(BO)7(-) cluster with a face-capping μ(3)-BO, which is the boron oxide analogue of closo-B6H7(-) with a face-capping μ(3)-H. Detailed topological analysis of electron density clearly reveals the existence of three rhombic 4c-2e bonds around the B/H apex in both C3v B6(BO)7(-) and C3v B6H7(-), which possesses similar electron densities at their bond and ring critical points. The adaptive natural density partitioning (AdNDP) analysis provides a direct and visual picture of the B-B-B-B/H 4c-2e bonds for the first time. Adiabatic and vertical electron detachment energies of the concerned monoanions are calculated to facilitate their future photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and characterizations. The presence of the B6(BO)7(-) and B6H7(-) clusters extends the BO/H isolobal analogy to the whole μ(n)-BO/H series (n = 1, 2, and 3) and enriches the chemistry of boronyl.
24128410,0,2013,Eur J Med Chem,New diarylamides and diarylureas possessing 8-amino(acetamido)quinoline scaffold: synthesis, antiproliferative activities against melanoma cell lines, kinase inhibition, and in silico studies.,Synthesis of a new series of diarylureas and diarylamides possessing 4-aryl-8-amino(acetamido)quinoline scaffold is described. Their in vitro antiproliferative activities against ten melanoma cell lines were tested. Compounds 1l, 2l, 3c, and 4c showed the highest potency against A375P cell line with IC50 values in sub-micromolar scale. Compound 4c was equipotent to Vemurafenib against A375P. In addition, compounds 1l, 2a, and 2l showed high potency over the NCI-9 tested melanoma cell line panel. The IC50 values of compounds 1l and 2l were in 2-digit nanomolar scale over four and five cell lines, respectively. Compound 2l showed high, dose-dependent inhibition of ERK kinase. ADME profiling showed that compounds 1l, 2l, 3c, 4c, and 5b are estimated to be orally bioavailable.
24113380,0,2013,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Different phosphorylation rates among vertebrate cone visual pigments with different spectral sensitivities.,Cone photoreceptor subtypes having different spectral sensitivities exhibit different recovery kinetics in their photoresponses in some vertebrates. Phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) is essential for the rapid inactivation of light-activated visual pigment, which is the rate-limiting step of the cone photoresponse recovery in salamander. In this study we compared the rate of light-dependent phosphorylation by GRK7 of carp green- and blue-sensitive cone visual pigments. Blue pigment was phosphorylated significantly less effectively than green pigment, suggesting that the difference in the pigment phosphorylation rate is responsible for the difference in photoresponse kinetics among cone photoreceptor subtypes.
24109721,0,2013,Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,4D model generator of the human lung, &quot;Lung4Cer&quot;.,We have developed a free software applications which generates 4D (= 3D + time) lung models for the purpose of studying lung anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. The coinage of 4C is originated from Japanese words, Catachi (= shape, structure) and Calacli (= machine, function). Lung4Cer makes 4D finite element models from the trachea to alveoli, which allow airflow simulation by means of computational fluid dynamics. Visualization of the generated models is expected to use a popular free software application, ParaView. There are several versions of Lung4Cer from basic lung morphology to advanced airflow computations simulating various clinical pulmonary function tests (PFT4Cer). All versions are designed so as to be operated on a common PC. Users can select model types and the element number according to their purposes and available computer resources.
24109253,0,2013,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,K0.78Na0.22MoO2AsO4.,The title compound, potassium sodium dioxidomolybden-um(VI) arsenate, K0.78Na0.22MoO2AsO4, was synthesized by a solid-state reaction route. The structure is built up from corner-sharing MoO6 octa-hedra and AsO4 tetra-hedra, creating infinite [MoAsO8]∞ chains running along the b-axis direction. As, Mo and all but one O atom are on special positions (4c) with m symmetry and K (occupancy 0.78) is on a position (4a) of -1 in the tunnels. The possible motion of the alkali cations has been investigated by means of the bond-valance sum (BVS) model. The simulation shows that the Na(+) motion appears to be easier mainly along the b-axis direction. Structural relationships between the different compounds of the AMoO2AsO4 (A = Ag, Li, Na, K, Rb) series and MXO8 (M = V; X = P, As) chains are discussed.
24107231,0,2013,J Am Chem Soc,Photoinduced solid state conversion of a radical σ-dimer to a π-radical pair.,Irradiation in the solid state of the hypervalent 4c-6e S···S-S···S bridged σ-dimer of a bisdithiazolyl radical leads to its photodissociation into a pair of π-radicals. The transformation has been monitored by optical spectroscopy, single crystal X-ray diffraction, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. As a result of the large electronic reorganization involved in the dimer-to-radical interconversion, the photogenerated S = 1/2 radical state is remarkably thermally stable, persisting to 242 K before reverting to the S = 0 dimer.
24092392,0,2013,World J Microbiol Biotechnol,High-level soluble expression of one model olfactory receptor (ODR-10) in Escherichia coli cell-free system.,High-level production of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is usually difficult to achieve in heterologous cell systems. The inherent hydrophobicity of these receptors could cause aggregation and possible cytotoxicity. Cell-free (CF) expression has become a highly promising tool for the fast and efficient production of integral membrane proteins. Here we reported the CF production of an olfactory receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans, odorant response abnormal protein 10 (ODR-10), a member of GPCRs, using the Escherichia coli extracts. Different expression vectors were investigated and 175 μg/ml total ODR-10 was achieved with pIVEX2.4c. To obtain soluble ODR-10, different detergents and liposome with varied concentrations were respectively added into the CF system. High-level expression of soluble ODR-10 (150 μg/ml) was attained with the addition of 1.5 % polyoxyethylene-(20)-cetyl-ether (Brij58) into the CF system. Furthermore, the yield of total ODR-10 was improved to 350 μg/ml by supplementing liposomes into the CF system, and the maximal concentration of the soluble receptor (102 μg/ml) was achieved in this liposome-assisted CF system. Both strategies produced ODR-10 efficiently by using CF system, and the direct reconstitution of the in vitro expressed receptor into liposomes will be preferred for its potential applications in many areas.
24090340,0,2013,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,Porous graphitic carbon loading ultra high sulfur as high-performance cathode of rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries.,Porous graphitic carbon of high specific surface area of 1416 m(2) g(-1) and high pore volume of 1.11 cm(3) g(-1) is prepared by using commercial CaCO3 nanoparticles as template and sucrose as carbon source followed by 1200 °C high-temperature calcination. Sulfur/porous graphitic carbon composites with ultra high sulfur loading of 88.9 wt % (88.9%S/PC) and lower sulfur loading of 60.8 wt % (60.8%S/PC) are both synthesized by a simple melt-diffusion strategy, and served as cathode of rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries. In comparison with the 60.8%S/PC, the 88.9%S/PC exhibits higher overall discharge capacity of 649.4 mAh g(-1)(S-C), higher capacity retention of 84.6% and better coulombic efficiency of 97.4% after 50 cycles at a rate of 0.1C, which benefits from its remarkable specific capacity with such a high sulfur loading. Moreover, by using BP2000 to replace the conventional acetylene black conductive agent, the 88.9% S/PC can further improve its overall discharge capacity and high rate property. At a high rate of 4C, it can still deliver an overall discharge capacity of 387.2 mAh g(-1)(S-C). The porous structure, high specific surface area, high pore volume and high electronic conductivity that is originated from increased graphitization of the porous graphitic carbon can provide stable electronic and ionic transfer channel for sulfur/porous graphitic carbon composite with ultra high sulfur loading, and are ascribed to the excellent electrochemical performance of the 88.9%S/PC.
24090308,0,2013,Inorg Chem,Electronic structures and spin density distributions of BrO2 and (HO)2BrO radicals. Mechanisms for avoidance of hypervalency and for spin delocalization and spin polarization.,The results are reported of an ab initio study of bromine dioxide BrO2, 1, and of the T-shaped trans- and cis-dihydroxides 2 and 3 of dihydrogen bromate (HO)2BrO. The thermochemistry has been explored of potential synthetic routes to (HO)2BrO involving water addition to BrO2, hydroxyl addition to bromous acid HOBrO, 4, protonation/reduction of bromic acid HOBrO2, 5, via tautomers 6-8 of protonated bromic acid, and by reduction/protonation of bromic acid via radical anion [HOBrO2](-), 9. The potential energy surface analyses were performed at the MP2(full)/6-311G* level (or better) and with the consideration of aqueous solvation at the SMD(MP2(full)/6-311G*) level (or better), and higher-level energies were computed at levels up to QCISD(full,T)/6-311++G(2df,2pd)//MP2. The addition of RO radical to bromous acid or bromite esters and the reduction of protonated bromic acid or protonated bromate esters are promising leads for possible synthetic exploration. Spin density distributions and molecular electrostatic potentials were computed at the QCISD(full)/6-311G*//MP2(full)/6-311G* level to characterize the electronic structures of 1-3. Both radicals employ maximally occupied (pseudo) π-systems to transfer electron density from bromine to the periphery. While the formation of the (3c-5e) π-system suffices to avoid hypervalency in 1, the formation of the (4c-7e) π-system in 2 or 3 still leaves the bromine formally hypervalent and (HO)2BrO requires delocalization of bromine density into σ*-SMOs over the trans O-Br-O moiety. Molecular orbital theory is employed to describe the mechanisms for the avoidance of hypervalency and for spin delocalization and spin polarization. The (4c-7e) π-system in 2 is truly remarkable in that it contains five π-symmetric spin molecular orbitals (SMO) with unique shapes.
24082347,0,2013,Indian J Pharm Sci,Synthesis, Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity of New Heterocyclic Hybrids Based on 2,5-Dimethylpyrrole and Pyrrole Scaffolds.,A series of 4-(2,5-dimethylpyrrol-1-yl)/4-pyrrol-1-yl benzoic acid hydrazide analogs, some derived triazoles, azetidinones, thiazolidinones, and pyrroles have been synthesized in good yields and structures of these compounds were established by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, mass spectral, and elemental analysis. These compounds were evaluated for their preliminary in vitro antibacterial, antifungal, and antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 Rv strain by the broth dilution assay method. Twenty one of these compounds displayed good antimicrobial activity, with a MIC value of 1-4 μg/ml. Several compounds 4c, 8-10, 15b-15h, and 16b-16d exhibited good in vitro antitubercular activity with MIC value 1-2 μg/ml. Further, some title compounds were also assessed for their cytotoxic activity (IC50) against mammalian Vero cell lines and A549 (lung adenocarcinoma) cell lines using the MTT assay method. The results revealed that these compounds exhibit antitubercular activity at non-cytotoxic concentrations.
24080101,0,2013,Bioorg Med Chem,New non-symmetrical choline kinase inhibitors.,Identification of novel and selective anticancer agents remains an important and challenging goal in pharmacological research. Choline kinase (ChoK) is the first enzyme in the CDP-choline pathway that synthesizes phosphatidylcholine (PC), the major phospholipid in eukaryotic cell membranes. In the present paper, a new family of non-symmetrical monocationic compounds is developed including a 3-aminophenol moiety, bound to 4-(dimethylamino)- or 4-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pyridinium cationic heads through several linkers. The most promising compounds in these series as ChoK inhibitors are 3f and 4f, while compounds 3c, 3d and 4c are the better antiproliferative agents. The analysis of the biological data observed in the described series of compounds mays represents a platform for the design of more active molecules.
24061322,0,2013,Acta Chim Slov,New Pyrazolo[1',5':1,6]pyrimido[4,5-d]pyridazin-4(3H)-ones Fluoroderivatives as Human A1 Adenosine Receptor Ligands.,In this paper we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new series of pyrazolo[1',5':1,6]pyrimido[4,5-d]pyridazin-4(3H)-ones as human A1 adenosine receptor ligands. The tricyclic scaffold was modified at position 6 and 9 by introducing small alkyl chains and substituted phenyls. The most interesting compounds showed Ki for A1 in the submicromolar range (0.105-0.244 µM) and the most interesting term (compound 4c) combined an appreciable affinity for A1 (Ki = 0.132 µM) with a good selectivity toward A2A (43% inhibition at 10 µM) and A3 (46% inhibition at 10 µM).
24050837,0,2013,Inorg Chem,Quaternary supertetrahedra-layered telluride CsMnInTe3: why does this type of chalcogenide tilt?,Dark-red CsMnInTe3 is synthesized by a solid-state approach using CsCl as the reactive flux. This layered compound is constructed by T3 supertetrahedra and crystallizes in the space group C2/c with a = 12.400(7) Å, b = 12.400(7) Å, c = 24.32(2) Å, β = 97.31(2)°, and V = 927.07(6) Å(3). The electrostatic interactions cause tilting of the supertetrahedra layers, and the value of the tilting angle is fixed by a structure index, β' = 180° - arccos(a/4c). Such an index is valid for all of the members in this family known to date.
24030202,0,2013,Dalton Trans,Copper(II) and triphenylphosphine copper(I) ethylene glycol carboxylates: synthesis, characterisation and copper nanoparticle generation.,Ethylene glycol-functionalised copper(II) carboxylates Cu[O2CCR2(OC2H4)nOCH3]2 (n = 0-3; R = H, Me) (2a-e) have been prepared by the reaction of [Cu2(OAc)4·2H2O] with CH3O(C2H4O)nCR2CO2H (1a-e). Upon reduction of 2a-e with triphenylphosphine, the corresponding tris(triphenylphosphine)copper(I) complexes 3a-e were obtained, which could be converted to the bis(triphenylphosphine)copper(I) complexes 4a-e by removal of one phosphine ligand. Based on IR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray structure analysis the binding motif of the carboxylato group on the copper ion is discussed. DSC, TG and TG-MS experiments were performed to analyse the thermal decomposition mechanism of 2-4. Complex 4c was used as a precursor for the generation of copper nanoparticles by thermal decomposition in hexadecylamine without the need of any further reactants. Depending on the precursor concentration, spherical copper nanoparticles with a mean diameter ranging from 10 to 85 nm as well as nanorods with a length of up to 1.3 μm (aspect ratios ranging between 2 and 32) were obtained. Electron diffraction analysis of the rods suggested that they consist of five domains which are arranged around a fivefold rotational axis.
24018790,0,2013,No Shinkei Geka,NA,The author's own experience of 1,036 surgeries on 944 glioma cases in the period between 1993 to 2011(mostly at the University Hospital Zurich)are presented. Glioblastoma cases were the most frequent, amounting to ca. 30% of cases as is shown in Fig.4A. They were operated on 1.3 times on the average but the most frequent repetition-surgery was in cases with fibrillary astrocytomas(Fig.1), as these tended to transform into secondary glioblastomas which needed surgery again. The latter amounting to 10% of glioblastoma cases that had transformed from astrocytoma in the course of 3.8 years on the average(Fig.4B). With modern &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; treatment of glioma(Table), survival term for glioblastoma patients has clearly improved. This can be seen by comparison of figures between generations(Fig.4C, D):Prof. Krayenbuhl's era(macrosurgery±RT), Prof. Yasargil's era(microsurgery+RT)and the most recent part of my treatment(microsurgery+ &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; treatment). Representative cases of various glioma are presented in which &quot;cured&quot; cases of glioblastoma are also included.

Side-effects include transient erythema and oedema.</AbstractText>: Cryosurgery is a safe and effective therapeutic tool for a wide variety of cutaneous and mucocutaneous disorders. Side-effects include transient erythema and oedema.OBJECTIVE: A series of three patients presenting localized contact wheals minutes after contact with liquid nitrogen in the absence of clinical manifestations of cold urticaria is presented.METHODS: Specific cold diagnostic provocation tests with liquid nitrogen challenge test, ice cube test and Tempt-test® were performed.RESULTS: The three patients showed an immediate wheal after cold contact with liquid nitrogen. The ice cube test, the temperature thresholds and the critical stimulation thresholds at 4◦C assessed with the Tempt-test 3.1® were negative. The induced wheals showed pathological features of urticaria. Eight patients suffering from acquired cold urticarial developed also liquid nitrogen induced wheals but none of the healthy controls.CONCLUSION: A peculiar subset of cold urticaria secondary to exposure to ultra-freeze temperatures developing in patients treated with cryotherapy is reported. The concept of “ultra-freeze urticaria” is proposed.
24015694,0,2013,J Am Coll Nutr,Evaluation of methods to assess reduced body fat in patients with anorexia nervosa.,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate skinfold anthropometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to estimate percentage of body fat (%BF) in adolescent patients with anorexia nervosa (AN).METHODS: We examined 80 female AN patients (age 15.6 ± 1.4 years) and 31 healthy, normal weight sex- and age-matched controls with DXA and skinfold anthropometry to estimate %BF. Reference values for %BF of the same participants were obtained from a 4-compartment (4C) model, which was based on measurements of total body protein (with in vivo neutron activation), total body water (with deuterium dilution), and mineral content (with DXA). We compared the different methods to assess %BF with Bland-Altman analysis of agreement.RESULTS: In the AN group, average %BF was well predicted with DXA and skinfold measurements in combination with the Deurenberg equation based on 2 skinfolds (DXA 13.9 ± 6.2 %BF; skinfold 14.5 ± 4.3 vs 14.1 ± 6.8 %BF by the 4C model). In the control group, average %BF was closely predicted by skinfold measurements in combination with the Slaughter formula (26.1 ± 4.5 vs 25.2 ± 5.2 %BF by the 4C model) but was overestimated with DXA (31.3 ± 5.8 %BF). When compared with the 4C model, all methods under investigation showed considerable limits of agreement when predicting %BF in any given individual.CONCLUSIONS: In our group of patients with AN, the Deurenberg skinfold model and DXA were similar in performance; however, DXA overestimated %BF in healthy subjects.
23996628,0,2013,J Appl Genet,Founder mutations in NDRG1 and HK1 genes are common causes of inherited neuropathies among Roma/Gypsies in Slovakia.,Autosomal recessive forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) account for less than 10 % of all CMT cases, but are more frequent in the populations with a high rate of consanguinity. Roma (Gypsies) are a transnational minority with an estimated population of 10 to 14 million, in which a high degree of consanguineous marriages is a generally known fact. Similar to the other genetically isolated founder populations, the Roma harbour a number of unique or rare autosomal recessive disorders, caused by &quot;private&quot; founder mutations. There are three subtypes of autosomal recessive CMT with mutations private to the Roma population: CMT4C, CMT4D and CMT4G. We report on the molecular examination of four families of Roma origin in Slovakia with early-onset demyelinating neuropathy and autosomal recessive inheritance. We detected mutation p.R148X (g.631C&gt;T) in the NDRG1 (NM_006096.3) gene in two families and mutation g.9712G&gt;C in the HK1 (NM_033498) gene in the other two families. These mutations cause CMT4D and CMT4G, respectively. The success of molecular genetic analysis in all families confirms that autosomal recessive forms of CMT caused by mutations on the NDRG1 and HK1 genes are common causes of inherited neuropathies among Slovak Roma. Providing genetic analysis of these genes for patients with Roma origin as a common part of diagnostic procedure would contribute to a better rate of diagnosed cases of demyelinating neuropathy in Slovakia and in other countries with a Roma minority.
23995358,0,2013,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo),Synthesis of new nicotinic acid derivatives and their evaluation as analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents.,A series of 2-substituted phenyl derivatives of nicotinic acid 4a-l were synthesized and evaluated for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. Compounds including 2-bromophenyl substituent, 4a, c, and d, proved to display distinctive analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities in comparison to mefenamic acid as a reference drug. Compound 4c could be identified as the most biologically active member within this study with an interesting dual anti-inflammatory analgesic profile. Effect of the compounds 4a-l on the serum level of certain inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 was also determined.
23954239,0,2013,Eur J Med Chem,Hybrid benzofuran-bisindole derivatives: new prototypes with promising anti-hyperlipidemic activities.,A series of different benzofuran-bisindole hybrids were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for their antioxidant and in vivo for antidyslipidemic activity in triton WR-1339 induced hyperlipidemic rats. Among the series, compounds 4a, 4c, 4h and 4j showed significant decrease in plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), phospholipids (PL) and triglycerides (TG) followed by increase in post heparin lipolytic activity (PHLA). In addition, the active hybrids possessed moderate antioxidant properties and increased the plasma lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity, which plays a key role in lipoprotein metabolism contributing to an increased level of HDL-C in serum. These results indicate that these hybrids constitute novel prototypes for the management of dyslipidemia.
23950098,0,2013,Drug Res (Stuttg),Pyrimidine-5-carbonitriles II: synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel 6-alkyl-2,4-disubstituted pyrimidine-5-carbonitriles.,New series of 6-alkyl-2,4-disubstituted pyrimidine-5-carbonitriles namely, 6-alkyl-2-thiouracil-5-carbonitriles 4c,d, 6-alkyl-2-arylmethylsulfanyl-3,4-dihydro-4-oxopyrimidine-5-carbonitriles 5a-p, 6-alkyl-2-(2-methoxyethylsulfanyl)-3,4-dihydro-4-oxopyrimidine-5-carbonitriles 6a-d, 6-alkyl-2-benzyloxymethylsulfanyl-3,4-dihydro-4-oxopyrimidine-5-carbonitriles 7a-c, 6-alkyl-2-(5-nitrofuran-2-ylmethylsulfanyl)-3,4-dihydro-4-oxopyrimidine-5-carbonitriles 8a-d, 6-alkyl-4-arylthio-2-(benzylsulfanyl)pyrimidine-5-carbonitriles 10a, b and 2-benzylsulfanyl-4-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]-6-pentylpyrimidine-5-carbonitrile 11, were synthesized and tested for in vitro activities against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the yeast-like pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. Compounds 4d, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 5f, 5g, 5h, 5i, 5j, 5k, 5 l, 5p, 7a, 7b, 7c, 8a, 8b, 8c, 8d and 11 -displayed marked antibacterial activity particularly against the tested Gram-positive bacteria.

23920438,0,2013,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Novel cycloalkylthiophene-imine derivatives bearing benzothiazole scaffold: synthesis, characterization and antiviral activity evaluation.,A series of novel cycloalkylthiophene-imine derivatives containing benzothiazole unit were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their anti-viral activities. The bio-evaluation results indicated that some of the target compounds (such as 5g, 5i, 5u) exhibited good to moderate antiviral effect on CVB5, ADV7 and EV71 viruses, however, these compounds did not have inhibition activity against H1N1 virus. Especially, the compounds 4c and 4d also exhibited high antiviral activities, which provide a new and efficient approach to evolve novel multi-functional antiviral agents by rational integration of active pharmacophores.
23907329,0,2013,Dalton Trans,Synthesis of bis(N-arylcarboximidoylchloride)pyridine cobalt(II) complexes and their catalytic behavior for 1,3-butadiene polymerization.,A new family of bis(N-arylcarboximidoylchloride)pyridine cobalt(II) complexes with the general formula [2,6-(ArN=CCl)2C5H3N]CoCl2 (Ar = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2, 4a; 2,6-(i)Pr2C6H3, 4b; 2,6-Me2C6H3, 4c; C6H5, 4d; 4-Cl-2,6-Me2C6H2, 4e) and a typical Brookhart-Gibson-type reference complex [2,6-(2,4,6-Me3C6H2N=CMe)2C5H3N]CoCl2 (5a) were synthesized and characterized. Determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis, complexes 4a, 4c-e, and 5a adopted a trigonal bipyramidal configuration, and 4b adopted a distorted square pyramidal geometry. In combination with ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), all the complexes were highly active towards 1,3-butadiene polymerization, affording polybutadiene with predominant cis-1,4 content (up to 96%). 4a with chlorine atoms at the imine groups exhibited higher catalytic activity than did 5a, indicating that the incorporation of chlorine atoms into the ligand improves the activity. The activity of the complexes in 1,3-butadiene polymerization was in the order of 4a &gt; 4c ∼ 4e ∼ 4b &gt; 4d, which is consistent with the trend of spatial opening degree around the metal center in the complexes as revealed by crystallographic data. Screening polymerization conditions proved that EASC was the most efficient among the cocatalysts examined.

23883229,0,2013,AJR Am J Roentgenol,Does formal instruction about the BI-RADS ultrasound lexicon result in improved appropriate use of the lexicon?,OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to determine whether formal instruction regarding the BI-RADS ultrasound lexicon results in improved appropriate use of the lexicon.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety test questions depicting the features outlined by the 2003 BI-RADS lexicon were identified in our PACS. Informed consent was obtained from 34 radiology residents. The participants took the preinstruction test and then had 1 hour of formal instruction regarding the BI-RADS ultrasound lexicon, which included images depicting the different sonographic features and final assessment (including subcategories 4a, 4b, and 4c). The participants then completed the postinstruction test, which examined the same content. Test scores were calculated for both the pre- and postinstruction tests and then were compared by a linear mixed model and Wilcoxon signed rank tests.RESULTS: The participants' postinstruction test scores showed significant improvement in the overall use of the BI-RADS ultrasound lexicon (p &lt; 0.0001). There was also significant improvement in the following specific areas: final assessment (p = 0.0005), margin (p = 0.0003), orientation (p = 0.0104), and lesion boundary (p = 0.0050). The categories for which test scores did not show significant improvement were echo pattern (p = 0.07), posterior acoustic features (p = 0.50), shape (p = 0.98), and subset of the final assessment (p = 0.24).CONCLUSION: Formal instruction regarding the BI-RADS ultrasound lexicon results in improved lesion characterization and final assessment.
23869859,0,2013,J Integr Neurosci,A few observations on metacontrast stimuli.,Metacontrast is a form of visual masking in which the target and mask are non-overlapping. In metacontrast, the masking effect is typically largest when the mask is presented some time after the target. This is known as Type-B masking. The present report examines to what extent Type-B metacontrast masking can be explained based on the stimuli involved. The assumption is made that the visibility of the target is, at least in part, determined by the correlation between the amplitude spectrum of the target-and-mask combination and that of the target alone. It is found that the correlation is higher when the stimuli are presented at the same time relative to when they are presented at different times. This relationship follows from the stimuli alone. Thus, one would expect the masking to be weakest when the two stimuli are simultaneous. Type-B correlation functions, in which the largest reductions occur only when the mask is presented after the target, can be obtained by further assuming a temporal integration window with a rapid onset and a shallow decline. In agreement with psychophysical masking studies; the analyses yield functions that are most similar to Type-B masking for moderate mask intensities and become less Type-B like at higher mask intensities. The effects of dark adaptation and spatial separation of target and mask are also modeled.
23849804,0,2013,J Biosci Bioeng,Potent L-lactic acid assimilation of the fermentative and heterothallic haploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAM34-4C.,We screened an industrial thermotolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, KF7, as a potent lactic-acid-assimilating yeast. Heterothallic haploid strains KF7-5C and KF7-4B were obtained from the tetrads of the homothallic yeast strain KF7. The inefficient sporulation and poor spore viability of the haploid strains were improved by two strategies. The first strategy was as follows: (i) the KF7-5C was crossed with the laboratory strain SH6710; (ii) the progenies were backcrossed with KF7-5C three times; and (iii) the progenies were inbred three times to maintain a genetic background close to that of KF7. The NAM12 diploid between the cross of the resultant two strains, NAM11-9C and NAM11-13A, showed efficient sporulation and exhibited excellent growth in YPD medium (pH 3.5) at 35°C with 1.4-h generation time, indicating thermotolerance and acid tolerance. The second strategy was successive intrastrain crosses. The resultant two strains, KFG4-6B and KFG4-4B, showed excellent mating capacity. A spontaneous mutant of KFG4-6B, KFG4-6BD, showed a high growth rate with a generation time of 1.1 h in YPD medium (pH 3.0) at 35°C. The KFG4-6BD strain produced ascospores, which were crossed with NAM11-2C and its progeny to produce tetrads. These tetrads were crossed with KFG4-4B to produce NAM26-14A and NAM26-15A. The latter strain had a generation time of 1.6 h at 35°C in pH 2.5, thus exhibiting further thermotolerance and acid tolerance. A progeny from a cross of NAM26-14A and NAM26-15A yielded the strain NAM34-4C, which showed potent lactic acid assimilation and high transformation efficiency, better than those of a standard laboratory strain.
23847068,0,2013,Chem Biodivers,Cyclopaldic acid, seiridin, and sphaeropsidin A as fungal phytotoxins, and larvicidal and biting deterrents against Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae): structure-activity relationships.,Aedes aegypti L. is the major vector of the arboviruses responsible for dengue fever, one of the most devastating human diseases. From a preliminary screening of fungal phytotoxins, cyclopaldic acid (1), seiridin (2), sphaeropsidin A (4), and papyracillic acid (5) were evaluated for their biting deterrent and larvicidal activities against Ae. aegypti L. Because compounds 1, 2, 4, and 5 exhibited mosquito biting deterrent activities and 1 and 4 demonstrated larvicidal activities, further structureactivity relationship studies were initiated on these toxins. In biting-deterrence bioassays, 1, 2, 4, and 5, 3,8-didansylhydrazone of cyclopaldic acid, 1F, 5-azidopentanoate of cyclopaldic acid A, 1G, the reduced derivative of cyclopaldic acid, 1 H, isoseiridin (3), 2'-O-acetylseiridin (2A), 2'-oxoseiridin (2C), 6-O-acetylsphaeropsidin A (4A), 8,14-methylensphaeropsidin A methyl ester (4B), and sphaeropsidin B (4C) showed activities higher than the solvent control. Sphaeropsidin B (4C) was the most active compound followed by 2A, while the other compounds were less active. Biting-deterrence activity of compound 4C was statistically similar to DEET. In the larvicidal screening bioassays, only compounds 1 and 4 demonstrated larvicidal activities. Based on LD50 values, compound 4 (LD50 36.8 ppm) was significantly more active than compound 1 (LD50 58.2 ppm). However, the activity of these compounds was significantly lower than permethrin.
23831810,0,2013,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis, in vitro antifungal activity and in silico study of 3-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)flavanones.,A series of novel 3-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)flavanones were synthesized based on the N-phenethylazole pharmacophore of azole antifungals. The results of antifungal assay revealed that 4'-fluoroflavanone derivative 4c exhibited the best profile of activity against Candida and Saccharomyces strains. Compound 4c was 4-16 times more potent than reference drug fluconazole against Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The molecular docking study with lanosterol 14α-demethylase, in silico toxicity risks and drug-likeness predictions were used to better define of title compounds as antifungal agents. The favorable drug-like property of compound 4c makes 3-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)flavanone prototype as a promising lead for the future development of azole antifungal agents.
23831694,0,2013,Eur J Med Chem,Microwave-assisted synthesis of some new pyrazolopyridines and their antioxidant, antitumor and antimicrobial activities.,The chemical behavior of 4-(dimethylaminomethylene)-1-phenyl-3-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-5(4H)-one (enaminone) (2) toward some active methylene reagents has been reported to give pyrazolopyridine derivatives. All the reactions were carried out by conventional heating and microwave irradiation technique. The antioxidant activity of the prepared compounds was studied using 1,1-phenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Compounds (4c) and (4d) showed the highest activity. The antitumor activity against liver and breast cell lines was tested. Compounds (6), (9) and (11) showed the highest activity for liver cell line while compounds (6) and (9) showed the highest activity for breast cell line. Compounds (4a-d) were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and antifungal activity.
23822717,0,2013,Mol Pharm,A carrier-mediated prodrug approach to improve the oral absorption of antileukemic drug decitabine.,Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, DAC) is a novel DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, acute and chronic myeloid leukemia. However, it exhibits a low oral bioavailability (only 9% in mice), because of low permeability across the intestine membrane and rapid metabolism to inactive metabolite. To utilize the carrier-mediated prodrug approach for improved absorption of decitabine, a series of amino acid-decitabine conjugates were synthesized to target the intestinal membrane transporter, hPepT1. The Caco-2 permeability of the prodrugs was screened, and two l-val (aliphatic, compound 4a) and l-phe (aromatic, compound 4c) prodrugs with higher permeability were selected for further studies. The uptake of Gly-Sar by Caco-2 cells could be competitively inhibited by compounds 4a and 4c, with IC50 being 2.20 ± 0.28 mM and 3.46 ± 0.16 mM, respectively. The uptake of compounds 4a and 4c was markedly increased in the leptin-treated Caco-2 cells compared with the control Caco-2 cells, suggesting that hPepT1-mediated transport contributes to oral absorption of compounds 4a and 4c. The prodrugs were evaluated for their stability in various phosphate buffers, rat plasma, tissue homogenates, and gastrointestinal fluids. Compounds 4a and 4c were stable in gastrointestinal tract at pH 6.0 but could be quickly converted into DAC in plasma and tissue homogenates after absorption. The oral absolute bioavailability of DAC was 46.7%, 50.9%, and 26.9% after compounds 4a, 4c, and DAC were orally administered to rats at a dose of 15 mg/kg, respectively. The bioavailability of compounds 4a and 4c in rats was both reduced to about 32% when orally coadministrated with typical hPepT1 substrate Gly-Sar (150 mg/kg). Overall, compounds 4a and 4c can significantly enhance the intestinal membrane permeability of DAC, followed by rapid and mostly bioactivation to parent drug in intestinal and hepatic tissues before entry into systemic circulation, and eventually improve oral bioavailability of DAC in rats. The hPepT1-targeted prodrug strategy is a promising strategy to improve the oral bioavailability of poorly absorbed decitabine.
23821478,0,2013,Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol,[Psychometric assessment of the German version of the Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF-4C+) - a new instrument for measuring dental anxiety].,JM Armfield introduced the questionnaire &quot;Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear&quot; with the intention of giving research into this complex area a broader theoretical base. A German translation of the IDAF-4C+ was given to 287 dental patients in Germany, of which 188 were recruited from a Dental Fears Clinic. Together with the IDAF-4C+ the patients also filled out the Dental Anxiety Scale, the Dental Fear Survey and Beck's Anxiety Inventory. The good reliability of the IDAF core dental anxiety and fear module, that was found in the original Australian research, was found to be even better in the translated version. The factorial validity of the fear- and phobia module could be confirmed, the stimulus module only partly. With the translation of the IDAF-4C+ there is for the first time a questionnaire available in the German language that not only measures the extent of the dental fears but also diagnoses the anxiety-causing stimuli and intends to differentiate between dental fear and phobia.

23808443,0,2013,Nutr Hosp,[Longitudinal assessment of body composition by different methods as product of a integral intervention for treating obesity in Chilean children school].,INTRODUCTION: In Chile, the main nutritional problem of children, is obesity. The alarming increase in childhood obesity, has generated an urgent need to develop prevention and treatment programs, unfortunately, the results have been disappointing because they have not achieved the expected impact on the nutritional status of the target population. For this it is necessary to use other strategies, such as incorporating exercise of muscle strength.OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of an integral intervention (exercise, nutritional education and psychological support) in the body composition of obese school children after the intervention and post-intervention.METHODS: The sample consisted of 61 obese children (BMI = p 95) of both sex, between 8 and 13 years old, who participated in an integral intervention for treating childhood obesity in the short term (3 months) and medium term (12 months). Body composition was assessed by isotope dilution, plethysmography, radiographic absorptiometry and four-compartment model of Fuller.RESULTS: There was a significant increase over time in FFM (kg) by 4C in both sex, GC (%) by isotope dilution in boys was reduced in the post-intervention, while in girls decreased significantly over time and FFM (kg) by isotope dilution significantly increased in both sex. According to the magnitude and direction of change in time, there was only significant difference by sex in FFM (%) by isotope dilution, the increase was significantly higher in boys a result of the intervention (p = 0,000).CONCLUSIONS: An intervention that includes programmed exercise improves body composition. However, its effect is reversed in the medium term if training ceases. This reaffirms the need for sustainability of interventions over time.Abstract available from the publisher.
23799551,0,2013,Cardiol J,Impaired global and segmental myocardial deformation assessed by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.,BACKGROUND: Contrary effects of vitamin B12 deficiency have been shown on the cardiovascular system. Aim of our study was to analyze left ventricular (LV) myocardial deformation, by using the two dimensional (2D) speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency and normal LV ejection fraction.METHODS: Twenty-five patients with vitamin B12 deficiency (B12 levels &lt; 200 pg/mL; meanage: 29.6 ± 8.2 years, 15 female), and 27 healthy controls (B12 levels &gt; 200 pg/mL; meanage: 30.1 ± 6.9 years, 13 female) were included in the study. 2D echocardiography images were transferred to a workstation for further offline analysis. Longitudinal peak systolic (LPSS) and global strain (LGS) was obtained from 4 chamber and apical long axis (APLAX) views.RESULTS: Standard echocardiographic parameters and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) velocities were compared between the groups. All LPSS values in the patient group except for apical 4C septal wall longitudinal strain were significantly decreased than those in the control group. There was a positive correlation between B12 levels and strain values except apical 4C septal wall strain values.CONCLUSIONS: We found that in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency, global and segmental myocardial deformation was impaired and this impairment was correlated with the levels of vitamin B12.
23792764,0,2013,Eur J Med Chem,Efficient construction of novel D-ring modified steroidal dienamides and their cytotoxic activities.,Two series of steroidal dienamides 4a-q and 5a-f were designed, synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxic activities against five human cancer cell lines (MGC-803, EC109, PC-3, SMMC-7721 and MCF-7). The protocol developed efficiently achieved the construction of carbon-carbon double bond and selective conversion of nitrile group into carboxamide in one-pot procedure. Besides, compounds 4a-q and 5a-f showed moderate to excellent cytotoxic activities with the IC₅₀ values ranging from 0.1 to 40 μM and most of them were more potent than 5-fluorouracil. Particularly, four compounds 4d, 4e, 4q and 5a showed excellent selectivity against MGC-803 with the IC₅₀ values less than 1 μM. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that compound 4c caused the cellular early apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase in a concentration-independent manner.

23721461,0,2013,Virol J,Genetic diversity of Newcastle disease virus in Pakistan: a countrywide perspective.,BACKGROUND: Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most deadly diseases of poultry around the globe. The disease is endemic in Pakistan and recurrent outbreaks are being reported regularly in wild captive, rural and commercial poultry flocks. Though, efforts have been made to characterize the causative agent in some of parts of the country, the genetic nature of strains circulating throughout Pakistan is currently lacking.MATERIAL AND METHODS: To ascertain the genetics of NDV, 452 blood samples were collected from 113 flocks, originating from all the provinces of Pakistan, showing high mortality (30-80%). The samples represented domesticated poultry (broiler, layer and rural) as well as wild captive birds (pigeons, turkeys, pheasants and peacock). Samples were screened with real-time PCR for both matrix and fusion genes (1792 bp), positive samples were subjected to amplification of full fusion gene and subsequent sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.RESULTS: The deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site indicated the presence of motif (112RK/RQRR↓F117) typical for velogenic strains of NDV. Phylogenetic analysis of hypervariable region of the fusion gene indicated that all the isolates belong to lineage 5 of NDV except isolates collected from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. A higher resolution of the phylogenetic analysis of lineage 5 showed the distribution of Pakistani NDV strains to 5b. However, the isolates from KPK belonged to lineage 4c; the first report of such lineage from this province.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, data indicated the prevalence of multiple lineages of NDV in different poultry population including wild captive birds. Such understanding is crucial to underpin the nature of circulating strains of NDV, their potential for interspecies transmission and disease diagnosis and control strategies.
23715189,0,2013,Biomedica,[Distribution of Listeria monocytogenes serotypes isolated from foods, Colombia, 2000-2009].,INTRODUCTION: Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular, opportunistic pathogen which can cause severe infections such as meningitis, encephalitis and bacteremia. It can also cause abortions in human beings. Foods are the vehicle for infection of the host. Serotypification has discriminated 13 serotypes: 1/2a,1/2b, 1/2c, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4a, 4ab, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 7. 4b is the cause of the majority of cases of listeriosis in the world.OBJECTIVE: The frequency of serotypes of L. monocytogenes was determined in bacteria isolated from foods in Colombia.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study is descriptive and retrospective. Over a 10-year period, 2000-2009, 1,599 isolates were examined. All were confirmed as Listeria monocytogenes and other strains of Listeria, using biochemical tests recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (USA) and API Listeria and serotyped using the Seeliger and Höhne method.RESULTS: Of the 1,599 isolates, 1,424 were confirmed as L. monocytogenes. Serotypes identified were: 1/2a, 135 (9.5%); 1/2b, 154 (10.8%); 1/2c, 68 (4.8%); 3a, 4 (0.3%); 3b, 29 (2.0%); 3c, 2 (0.1%); 4a, 44 (3.1%); 4b, 820 (57.6%); 4c, 6 (0.4%); 4d- 4e, 140 (9.8%); 4e, 17 (1.2%); 7, 2 (0.1%); not susceptible of serotypification, three cases, (0.2%). Isolates came mainly from the Capital District of Bogotá, 1,035 (73%); from Antioquia 199 (14%), from Nariño, 109 (8%); from Valle del Cauca 50 (3,5%) and from other provinces 33 (2.3%).CONCLUSION: Of the analyzed isolates, 1,424 (89%) belonged to L. monocytogenes, showing a good quality in isolation and identification. Most of these isolates belonged to serotype 4b, 820 (57.6%), a highly virulent serotype. Obligatory surveillance of this microorganism is recommended.
23712380,0,2013,Arch Pharm Res,Design, synthesis and molecular docking of some new 1,2,4-triazolobenzimidazol-3-yl acetohydrazide derivatives with anti-inflammatory-analgesic activities.,The present work describes the synthesis and evaluation of some new acetohydrazones, 1,3,4-oxadiazoles and 1,2,4-triazoles of 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]benzimidazole as anti-inflamm atory-analgesic agents. Structure elucidation of these compounds was confirmed by IR, (1)H NMR, and mass spectrometry along with elemental microanalyses. Most compounds exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity in comparison to indomethacin. Further, some compounds were tested for their analgesic effects where two compounds showed results comparable to indomethacin at 4 h interval. The most active anti-inflammatory and analgesic compounds (4c and 11a) were examined on gastric mucosa and didn't show any gastric ulcerogenic effect compared with the reference indomethacin. Moreover, LD50 of compounds (4c and 11a) were determined in mice; they were found non toxic up to 240 and 300 mg/kg (i.p.). Also, docking simulation of some compounds into COX active sites was studied.
23657508,0,2013,Sao Paulo Med J,Expression of claudin, paxillin and FRA-1 in non-nodular breast lesions in association with microcalcifications.,CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The possible role of adhesion molecules in early breast carcinogenesis has been shown in the literature. We aimed to analyze early adhesion imbalances in non-nodular breast lesions and their association with precursor lesions, in order to ascertain whether these alterations exist and contribute towards early carcinogenesis.DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cross-sectional study based on medical records at a private radiological clinic in São Paulo, Brazil.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all consecutive women attended between August 2006 and July 2007 who presented mammographic evidence of breast microcalcifications classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System Atlas (BI-RADS) type 4. These women underwent stereotaxic biopsy. Clinical, radiological and pathological data were collected, and immunohistochemical assays searched for claudin, paxillin, FRA-1 and HER-2.RESULTS: Over this period, 127 patients were evaluated. Previous BI-RADS diagnoses showed that 69 cases were in category 4A, 47 in 4B and 11 in 4C. Morphological assessment showed benign entities in 86.5%. Most of the benign lesions showed preserved claudin expression, associated with paxillin (P &lt; 0.001). Paxillin and HER-2 expressions were correlated. FRA-1 expression was also strongly associated with HER-2 expression (P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Although already present in smaller amounts, imbalance of adhesion molecules is not necessarily prevalent in non-nodular breast lesions. Since FRA-1 expression reached statistically significant correlations with radiological and morphological diagnoses and HER-2 status, it may have a predictive role in this setting.
23649545,0,2013,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,Photocatalytic degradation of N-heterocyclic aromatics-effects of number and position of nitrogen atoms in the ring.,This study demonstrates the influences of position, number of nitrogen (N) atoms and -C-N- or -N=N- linkage present in the six membered heterocyclic compounds such as pyridine, pyrazine, and pyridazine on their photocatalytic degradation by Au, Ag, and Fe(+2) deposited TiO(2) photocatalyst. The photodegradation rate of these heterocyclic compounds follow the order pyridine &gt; pyrazine &gt; pyridazine due to the different extent of hydroxylation and difference in position and number of N atoms in the aromatic moiety. The Au photodeposition significantly improved the TiO(2) photoactivity as compared to Ag and Fe(+2) loading. The presence of two N atoms in pyrazine and pyridazine as compared to one N atom in pyridine hamper the nucleophilc attack of OH radicals in comparison to easy hydroxylation of pyridine ring. There is 1 N atom, 4C-C, 1C-N and 1C=N bond in pyridine, 2 N atoms in the 1 and 4 positions, 2C-C, 2C-N bonds and 2C=N bonds in pyrazine, and pyridazine ring contains 2 N atoms in the 1 and 2 positions, 3C-C, 1N-N bond and 2C=N bonds. The bond strength/energy decreases gradually as: C=N- (615 KJ/mol) &gt; -N=N- (418 KJ/mol) &gt; -C-C- (347 KJ/mol) &gt; -C-N- (305 KJ/mol) &gt; -N-N- (163 KJ/mol). As pyridine has 1C-N, 1C=N, and no N-N bond, it photodegrades easily as compared to 1 N-N and 2C=N bonds of pyridazine of lowest photodecomposition rate. The improved photoactivity of Au-TiO(2) is explained on the basis of its favorable redox potential, work function, and electron-capturing capacity, etc.
23638895,0,2013,J Environ Sci Health B,Development of controlled release formulations of thiram employing amphiphilic polymers and their bioefficacy evaluation in seed quality enhancement studies.,Controlled release formulations of Thiram (Dimethylcarbamothioylsulfanyl-N,N-dimethylcarbamodithioate), a contact fungicide, have been prepared using laboratory synthesized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) based functionalized amphiphilic copolymers. The kinetics of thiram from developed controlled release (CR) formulations were studied in comparison with that of the commercially available 75 WS. Release from the commercial formulation was faster than with the developed CR formulations. Maximum amount of thiram was released on 35th day for PEG-2000 4d, 28th day for PEG-1500 4c, 21st day for PEG-1000 4b and 15th day for PEG-600 4a in comparison to commercial formulation (7th day). The diffusion exponent (n) of thiram in water ranged from 0.356 to 0.545 in the tested formulations. The half-release (t(1/2)) values ranged between 14.78 to 22.1 days, and the Period of Optimum Availability (POA) of thiram ranged from 7.79 to 25.15 days. An effort has also been made to identify the suitable polymers that could reduce the seed deterioration during storage and also act as an effective carrier of fungicide thiram. The results demonstrate that the seeds coated with the different formulations deteriorated at a slower pace as manifested in high germination percentage over control. Apart from the fungicidal effect of thiram, the polymers acted as barriers to moisture reducing the rate of seed deterioration and checked the degradation of thiram. The CR formulation 4d, with PEG 2000, was found to be most effective as seed coat.
23627061,0,2013,J Biomed Nanotechnol,Nanoscale film fabrication of various peptides on neural stem cell chip.,Modification of peptide on the electrode surface is very important issue for achieving valuable information from cell chip. In this study, various kinds of cysteine-containing peptide were fabricated on the electrode surface to enhance the electrochemical signals, cell spreading, and proliferation of rat neural stem cells. Different kinds of lysine-rich and RGD peptides were self-assembled on the gold nanoparticle modified ITO surfaces via strong Au-S chemical bond, followed by seeding neural stem cells (NE-4C) on its surface. As a result, K-MAP-C peptide consists of the quadruple branches of lysine chains and cysteine terminal showed outstanding characteristics respect to the improvement of redox signals, cell spreading and proliferation on electrode surface. Hence, our stem cell chip composed of lysine-rich peptide modified electrode can be usefully applied as efficient stem cell research tool.
23626395,0,2013,Indian J Pharm Sci,Analgesic, Antibacterial and Antiviral Activities of 2-(5-Alkyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-3H-benzo[f]chromen-3-ones.,A novel series of 2-(5-alkyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-3H-benzo[f]chromen-3-ones (4a-e) have been evaluated for analgesic, antibacterial and antiviral activities. Analgesic activity was carried out using acetic acid-induced writhing method in Swiss albino male mice. The antibacterial activity was performed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical strains by agar well diffusion method. The in vitro antiviral activity was carried out against camelpox and buffalopox viruses. The analgesic activity exhibited by the compounds 4a, 4c and 4d were found to be more significant compared to the standard. The bacterial activity was determined by the inhibition of growth of the organism by the drugs at different concentrations. All the compounds showed significant activity when compared with the drug ciprofloxacin. The in vitro antiviral activity of the compound 4b tested against camelpox and buffalopox viruses revealed no activity when tested at concentrations of 250 μg. The compound 4b did not alter the titres of both the viruses and the titres remain, respectively, 10(6.5) TCID50 and 10(6.74) TCID50 per ml for camelpox vaccine virus and buffalopox vaccine virus. However, the compounds 4a-e showed significant analgesic and antibacterial activities.
23623419,0,2013,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Facile synthesis of new imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines carrying 1,2,3-triazoles via click chemistry and their antiepileptic studies.,The present article reports the synthesis and anticonvulsant studies of new 2-arylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridines carrying suitably substituted 1,2,3-triazoles as well as their intermediates. The structures of newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques. The anticonvulsant study was carried out by MES and scPTZ screening methods, while their toxicity study was performed following Rotarod method. The active compounds showed enhanced seizure control in scPTZ method when compared with that of MES method. Compounds 3f, 4c, 4f, 5k, 5p and 5w carrying active pharmacophores exhibited complete protection against seizure and their results were comparable with standard drug diazepam. Majority of new compounds were found to be non-toxic, while few of them showed toxicity at 100 mg/kg. The clogP values of target compounds are in the range of 3.5-5.3, which confirm their lipophilic nature.
23611285,0,2013,Adv Immunol,Translocations in normal B cells and cancers: insights from new technical approaches.,Chromosomal translocations are recurrent genetic events that define many types of cancers. Since their first description several decades ago as defining elements in cancer cells, our understanding of the mechanisms that determine their formation as well as their implications for cancer progression and therapy has remarkably progressed. Chromosomal translocations originate from double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are brought into proximity in the nuclear space and joined inappropriately by DNA-repair pathways. The frequency and pattern of translocations are influenced by perturbations of any of these events. DSB formation is heavily determined by physiologic processes, such as the activity of RAG1/2 and AID enzymes during B-cell development or maturation, or by pathologic factors, such as ionizing radiations, ROS, or fragile sites. Cellular processes of mRNA transcription, DNA replication, and repair can influence the chromosomal territories and modify the relative position and proximity of genes inside the nucleus. DNA-repair factors contribute not only to the maintenance of genome integrity but also to translocations in normal and cancer cells. Next-generation sequencing techniques provide an unprecedented and powerful tool to approach the field of chromosomal translocations. Using specific examples, we will explain how genome-wide translocation mapping methods, such as high-throughput genomic translocation sequencing (HTGTS) and translocation-capture sequencing, combined with large-scale methods to determine nuclear proximity of genes or chromosome domains, such as 4C and Hi-C, have changed our view of the factors and the rules governing translocation formation in noncancer cells. Finally, we will review chromosomal rearrangements and newly described findings, such as chromothripsis, in cancer cells based on these novel rules on translocation formation.
23597790,0,2013,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Discovery of potent selective bioavailable phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) inhibitors active in an osteoarthritis pain model. Part II: optimization studies and demonstration of in vivo efficacy.,Selective phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) inhibitors are shown to have efficacy in a rat model of osteoarthritis (OA) pain. We identified potent, selective PDE2 inhibitors by optimizing residual PDE2 activity in a series of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors, while minimizing PDE4 inhibitory activity. These newly designed PDE2 inhibitors bind to the PDE2 enzyme in a cGMP-like binding mode orthogonal to the cAMP-like binding mode found in PDE4. Extensive structure activity relationship studies ultimately led to identification of pyrazolodiazepinone, 22, which was &gt;1000-fold selective for PDE2 over recombinant, full length PDEs 1B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 4C, 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B, 9, 10 and 11. Compound 22 also retained excellent PDE2 selectivity (241-fold to 419-fold) over the remaining recombinant, full length PDEs, 1A, 4D, 5, and 6. Compound 22 exhibited good pharmacokinetic properties and excellent oral bioavailability (F=78%, rat). In an in vivo rat model of OA pain, compound 22 had significant analgesic activity 1 and 3h after a single, 10 mg/kg, subcutaneous dose.
23587426,0,2013,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel amphiphilic aromatic amino alcohols.,We report in this work the preparation and in vitro antimicrobial evaluation of novel amphiphilic aromatic amino alcohols synthesized by reductive amination of 4-alkyloxybenzaldehyde with 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol. The antibacterial activity was determined against four standard strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and 21 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The antifungal activity was evaluated against four yeast (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis). The results obtained showed a strong positive correlation between the lipophilicity and the antibiotic activity of the tested compounds. The best activities were obtained against the Gram-positive bacteria (MIC=2-16μgml(-1)) for the five compounds bearing longer alkyl chains (4c-g; 8-14 carbons), which were also the most active against Candida (MIC=2-64μgml(-1)). Compound 4e exhibited the highest levels of inhibitory activity (MIC=2-16μgml(-1)) against clinical isolates of MRSA. A concentration of twice the MIC resulted in bactericidal activity of 4d against 19 of the 21 clinical isolates.
23577148,0,2013,PLoS One,Paralogous ribosomal protein l32-1 and l32-2 in fission yeast may function distinctively in cellular proliferation and quiescence by changing the ratio of rpl32 paralogs.,Fission yeast cells express Rpl32-2 highly while Rpl32-1 lowly in log phase; in contrast, expression of Rpl32-1 raises and reaches a peak level while Rpl32-2 is downregulated to a low basic level when cells enter into stationary phase. Overexpression of Rpl32-1 inhibits cell growth while overexpression of Rpl32-2 does not. Deleting rpl32-2 impairs cell growth more severely than deleting rpl32-1 does. Cell growth impaired by deleting either paralog can be rescued completely by reintroducing rpl32-2, but only partly by rpl32-1. Overexpression of Rpl32-1 inhibits cell division, yielding 4c DNA and multiple septa, while overexpressed Rpl32-2 promotes it. Transcriptomics analysis proved that Rpl32 paralogs regulate expression of a subset of genes related with cell division and stress response in a distinctive way. This functional difference of the two paralogs is due to their difference of 95(th) amino acid residue. The significance of a competitive inhibition between Rpl32 paralogs on their expression is discussed.
23525855,0,2013,Springerplus,Syntheses, characterizations and thermal analyses of four novel unsymmetrical β-diketiminates.,Four novel unsymmetrical β-diketiminates 2-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)amino-4-(phenyl)imino-2-pentene (4a), 2-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)amino-4-(4-methylphenyl)imino-2-pentene (4b), 2-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)amino-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)imino-2-pentene (4c) and 2-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)amino-4-(4-chlorophenyl)imino-2-pentene (4d) were synthesized with a 77-84% yield, and were characterized by spectroscopic methods ((1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR and mass spectrometry), elemental analysis, and X-ray single-crystal diffraction, respectively. Spectroscopic and X-ray single-crystal diffraction analyses determined the structures of the four β-diketiminates. While thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed two distinct endothermic peaks for each β-diketiminate at temperatures of 92.55°C and 221.50°C (4a), 93.51°C and 238.82°C (4b), 109.60°C and 329.22°C (4c), 115.43°C and 243.25°C (4d), respectively, corresponding to their melting and boiling points.
23513728,0,2013,Nat Prod Commun,Antifeedant activity of spin-labeled derivatives of deoxypodophyllotoxin against Brontispa longissima larvae.,To continue our search for natural product-based compounds for the control of Brontispa longissima larvae, eight spin-labeled podophyllotoxin derivatives (4a-h) and the intermediates 2 and 3 were tested for their insect antifeedant activity against third-instar larvae of B. longissima. Among all the tested compounds, 4a, 4c, 2 and 3 showed pronounced antifeedant activities with AFC50 values of 0.16, 0.31, 0.15 and 0.28 mg/mL, respectively. The different antifeedant activity ranges of these compounds indicated that variation of the structures of L-amino acids in these compounds markedly affected the activity profiles of this compound class, and some important SAR information has been revealed from it.
23478343,0,2013,Restor Neurol Neurosci,Rescue of injured motoneurones by grafted neuroectodermal stem cells: effect of the location of graft.,PURPOSE: Avulsion of one or more ventral roots from the spinal cord leads to the death of the majority of affected motoneurons. In this study we investigated whether immortalized clonal neuroectodermal stem cells applied to the injured cord in various ways impart neuroprotection on motoneurons otherwise destined to die.METHODS: The lumbar 4 (L4) ventral root of Sprague-Dawley rats was avulsed and reimplanted ventrolaterally into the injured cord. Clonal neuroectodermal murine stem cells (NE-GFP-4C) were placed in fibrin clot around the reimplanted root, were injected immediately following avulsion into the reimplanted ventral root or directly into the L4 segment. Three months after the primary surgery the L4 motoneuron pool was retrogradely labelled with Fast blue and the numbers of reinnervating motoneurons were determined. Functional recovery was tested biweekly through the use of the CatWalk automated gait analysis system.RESULTS: Transplantation of neuroectodermal stem cells into the reimplanted root or into the L4 spinal segment resulted in similarly extensive regeneration of the motoneurons (671 ± 26 and 711 ± 14 L4 motoneurons, respectively). In these groups significant functional recovery was achieved. The negative controls and animals with periradicular stem cell treatment showed poor motor recovery and reinnervation (42 ± 10 and 65 ± 2.5, respectively).CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that neuroectodermal stem cell transplantation into the reimplanted ventral root induces as successful regeneration of injured motoneurons as stem cells grafted into the spinal cord.
23474399,0,2013,Appl Radiat Isot,Development of collimator for in-situ measurement of 90Sr specific activity by β-ray survey meter and Monte Carlo calculation.,For the in-situ measurement of (90)Sr contamination, the collimators to be combined with the β-ray survey meter were designed with MCNP-4C calculations. The designed collimators were manufactured and its characteristics were measured in accordance with the calculations. The calculated energy deposition in the survey meter agreed within 27% to its counting rate measured in terms of their dependencies on the collimator dimension. This supports the usability of the manufactured collimators and numerical correction of the sensitivity of the survey meter depending on the geometry.
23447045,0,2013,Drug Res (Stuttg),Synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel series of pyrazolylcoumarins as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents.,A new series of pyrazolylcoumarins (4a-k) was synthesized by reaction of appropriate dibromochalcones (3a-k) with phenyl hydrazine in ethanol. Structures of all new synthesized compounds were characterized on the basis of elemental analysis and spectral data (UV, IR and 1H NMR). The title compounds were screened for in vivo anti-inflammatory activities at a dose of 200 mg/kg b.w. Among the 11 prepared compounds, Compounds 4c, d, h and i exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity in model of acute inflammation such as carrageenan-induced rat edema paw while compound 4d showed considerable activity in model of chronic inflammation such as adjuvant-induced arthritis along with minimum ulcerogenic index and were compared with diclofenac (13.5 mg/kg b.w.) as a standard drug. Additionally, the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant activity. Compound 4k was found to be the most active antioxidant in the series compared with standard vitamin C.
23446438,0,2013,J Mol Model,Electronic structures of bisnoradamantenyl and bisnoradamantanyl dications and related species.,The highly pyramidalized molecule bisnoradamantene is extremely reactive toward nucleophiles and dienes. In this work, we studied the electronic structure of bisnoaradamantene, as well as those of its cation and dication, which are previously unreported carbonium ions. According to QTAIM and MO analysis, there is a 3c-2e bonding system in the bisnoradamantenyl cation and a 4c-2e bonding system in the bisnoradamantenyl dication. A topological study indicated that, on going from bisnoradamantene to its dication, π-bond interaction with the bridgehead carbon atom increases. Additional study of the bisnoradamantanyl dication also indicated that it has two multicenter bonding systems. Comparison of the D3BIA and NICS aromaticity indices of these molecules and other derivatives indicates that these indices are well correlated, and analysis of these indices shows that the cationic and dicationic bisnoradamantenyl species are homoaromatic.

23430772,0,2013,Met Ions Life Sci,Imaging and sensing of cadmium in cells.,Cadmium is one of the highly toxic transition metals for human beings and is known as a human carcinogen. Once humans are exposed to Cd(2+) on a chronic basis, Cd(2+) primarily accumulates in the liver and kidney where it forms complexes with small peptides and proteins via sulfhydryl groups. Complexed Cd(2+) or the ionic Cd(2+) is then taken up by target cells and tissues and exerts the toxicity. However, the question of how non-essential Cd(2+) crosses the cell membranes remains unanswered. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of Cd(2+)-induced physiological signaling disruption in cells is still not fully elucidated. Investigations of Cd(2+) uptake kinetics, distributions, and concentrations in cells require chemical tools for its detection. Because of the easy use and high spatiotemporal resolution, optical imaging using fluorescence microscopy is a well-suited method for monitoring Cd(2+) in biological samples. This chapter summarizes design principles of small molecule fluorescent sensors for Cd(2+) detection in aqueous solution and their photophysical and metal-binding properties. Also the applications of probes for fluorescence imaging of Cd(2+) in a variety of cell types are demonstrated.
23424422,0,2013,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,Di-μ-chlorido-bis-[(2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-dicarb-oxy-lic acid-κ(2)N,N')chloridocopper(II)] dimethyl-formamide tetra-solvate.,In the title compound, [Cu(2)Cl(4)(C(12)H(8)N(2)O(4))(2)]·4C(3)H(7)NO, which contains a chloride-bridged centrosymmetric Cu(II) dimer, the Cu(II) atom is in a distorted square-pyramidal 4 + 1 coordination geometry defined by the N atoms of the chelating 2,2'-bipyridine ligand, a terminal chloride and two bridging chloride ligands. Of the two independent dimethyl-formamide mol-ecules, one is hydrogen bonded to a single -COOH group, while one links two adjacent -COOH groups via a strong accepted O-H⋯O and a weak donated C(O)-H⋯O hydrogen bond. Two of these last mol-ecules and the two -COOH groups form a centrosymmetric hydrogen-bonded ring in which the CH=O and the -COOH groups by disorder adopt two alternate orientations in a 0.44:0.56 ratio. These hydrogen bonds link the Cu(II) complex mol-ecules and the dimethyl-formamide solvent mol-ecules into infinite chains along [-111]. Slipped π-π stacking inter-actions between two centrosymmetric pyridine rings (centroid-centroid distance = 3.63 Å) contribute to the coherence of the structure along [0-11].
23419161,0,2013,J Agric Food Chem,Synthesis and antifungal activity of 2-chloromethyl-1H-benzimidazole derivatives against phytopathogenic fungi in vitro.,A series of 35 benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized from 2-chloromethyl-1H-benzimidazole in good yields. Their structures were characterized by (1)H and (13)C NMR and HRESIMS. Antifungal activities of all of the synthesized compounds were evaluated against five phytopathogens fungi (Cytospora sp., Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria solani, and Fusarium solani) using the mycelium growth rate method. Compound 4m displayed strong growth inhibition of C. gloeosporioides, A. solani, and F. solani with IC50 of 20.76, 27.58, and 18.60 μg/mL, respectively. Selective inhibition of B. cinerea instead of the other fungal pathogenes was observed with 7f (IC50 of 13.36 μg/mL), comparable to that of positive control, a commercial agricultural fungicide hymexazol (IC50 of 8.92 μg/mL). Compound 5b exhibited remarkable antifungal properties against Cytospora sp., C. gloeosporioides, B. cinerea, and F. solani with IC50 values of 30.97, 11.38, 57.71, and 40.15 μg/mL, respectively; among the target fungi, 5b was the most active compound and superior to the reference against C. gloeosporioides alone. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) data of these compounds are as follows: (1) introduction of the chlorine atom on para-position in the benzene ring help to increase activity (4f vs 4c; 7f vs 7n), (2) the sulfonyl group is critical for the inhibition of C. gloeosporioides (5b and 5c vs 5a), and (3) the unsubstituted benzene ring improve activity (4m vs 4n, 4e and 4a). Thus, compounds 5b, 4m, and 7f emerged as a new leading structure for the development of new fungicides.
23411616,0,2013,J Atheroscler Thromb,Rationale, design and baseline characteristics of a study to evaluate effects of candesartan on cardiovascular events after drug-eluting stent implantation in patients with ischemic heart disease.,AIM: Few multicenter studies have assessed the effects of angiotensin receptor blockers on cardiovascular events after drug-eluting stent implantation in patients with ischemic heart disease.METHODS: An open-label multicenter randomized prospective study is in progress to evaluate the effects of candesartan on cardiovascular events in patients with ischemic heart disease after implantation of sirolimus- and/or paclitaxel-eluting stents.RESULTS: A total of 1,145 patients were enrolled at 39 institutes in the Candesartan for prevention of Cardiovascular events after CYPHER or TAXUS Coronary stenting (4C trial). Patients were randomized into a group treated with candesartan (n=602) and a group treated with standard medical therapy without candesartan (n=543). The primary endpoint of the 4C trial is a composite of all-cause death, successful resuscitation after cardiopulmonary arrest and cardiovascular events including non-fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring emergent hospitalization, congestive heart failure requiring emergent hospitalization and cerebrovascular attacks. All patients will be followed-up for 36 months.CONCLUSIONS: The 4C trial will be the first multicenter study to elucidate the effects of candesartan after drug-eluting stent implantation and may provide new information to optimize medical therapy after percutaneous coronary interventions.
23400657,0,2013,Psychol Res,Subjective criteria and illusions in visual testing: some methodological limitations.,It is argued that illusions cannot generally be investigated with criterion-independent methods. This limits the value of the data obtained from them. This is particularly important when the results are compared between groups of subjects, for example, between dyslexic readers and controls, since it is possible that the differences between the groups reflect differences with regard to criteria rather than real perceptual differences.
23352268,0,2013,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,A facile three-component [3+2]-cycloaddition for the regioselective synthesis of highly functionalised dispiropyrrolidines acting as antimycobacterial agents.,A series of fourteen dispiropyrrolidines were synthesized using [3+2]-cycloaddition reactions and were screened for their antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv in HTS (High Throughput Screen). Most of the compounds showed moderate to good activity with MIC of less than 20 μM. Compound 4'-(4-bromophenyl)-1'-methyldispiro[acenaphthylene-1,2'-pyrrolidine-3',2″-indane]-2,1″(1H)-dione (4c) was found to be the most active with MIC of 12.50 μM.
23351402,0,2013,Daru,Three-component synthesis of pyrano[2,3-d]-pyrimidine dione derivatives facilitated by sulfonic acid nanoporous silica (SBA-Pr-SO3H) and their docking and urease inhibitory activity.,BACKGROUND: A straightforward and efficient method for the synthesis of pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine diones derivatives from the reaction of barbituric acid, malononitrile and various aromatic aldehydes using SBA-Pr-SO3H as a nanocatalyst is reported.RESULTS: Reactions proceed with high efficiency under solvent free conditions. Urease inhibitory activity of pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine diones derivatives were tested against Jack bean urease using phenol red method. Three compounds of 4a, 4d and 4l were not active in urease inhibition test, but compound 4a displayed slight urease activation properties. Compounds 4b, 4k, 4f, 4e, 4j, 4g and 4c with hydrophobic substitutes on phenyl ring, showed good inhibitory activity (19.45-279.14 μM).DISCUSSION: The compounds with electron donating group and higher hydrophobic interaction with active site of enzyme prevents hydrolysis of substrate. Electron withdrawing groups such as nitro at different position and meta-methoxy reduced urease inhibitory activity. Substitution of both hydrogen of barbituric acid with methyl group will convert inhibitor to activator.
23341387,0,2013,J Ultrasound Med,Comparison of sonographically guided core needle biopsy and excision in breast papillomas: clinical and sonographic features predictive of malignancy.,OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical factors and sonographic features of benign papillomas of the breast proven by sonographically guided 14-gauge core needle biopsy and their upgrade or malignancy rate after sonographically guided vacuum-assisted excision or surgical excision.METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent core needle biopsy from July 2005 to December 2011. We evaluated 39 benign papillomas without atypia in 34 patients. The papillomas were diagnosed by core needle biopsy and underwent surgical or vacuum-assisted excision. After core needle biopsy, imaging-histologic correlation was performed to determine concordance. The upgrade and malignancy rates were assessed after surgical or vacuum-assisted excision, and associated clinical and radiologic factors, including patient age, lesion size, distance from the nipple, sonographic features, and American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category were evaluated.RESULTS: Three lesions (7.7 %) among 39 papillomas were upgraded to papilloma with atypia after surgical excision. There was no malignancy after excision. The upgrade rates for BI-RADS categories 3, 4a, 4b, and 4c were 0%, 6.9%, 0%, and 20%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the upgrade to papilloma with atypia in terms of the presence of symptoms, lesion size, distance from the nipple, BI-RADS category, or imaging-histologic correlation.CONCLUSIONS: Prediction of papilloma with atypia, not malignancy, was challenging because there were no associated clinical or radiologic factors to predict papilloma with atypia before excision. However, there was no malignancy after excision. Therefore, intensive surveillance is preferable to immediate surgical excision for benign papillomas diagnosed on core needle biopsy.
23301523,0,2013,Med Chem,Synthesis, DNA binding ability and anticancer activity of 2-heteroaryl substituted benzimidazoles linked pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine conjugates.,As a continuation of our efforts to develop the benzimidazole-PBD conjugates as potential anticancer agents, a series of heteroaryl substituted benzimidazole linked PBD conjugates has been synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer potential in 60 human cancer cell lines. Most of the compounds exhibited promising anticancer activity and interestingly, compounds 4c and 4d displayed significant activity in most of the cell lines tested. Whereas, compound 4e showed selectivity in renal cancer cells with GI50 values of &lt;10 and 70 nM against RXF 393 and UO-31 cell lines, respectively. Further, these compounds also showed significant DNA-binding affinity by thermal denaturation study using duplex form of calf thymus (CT) DNA.
23282901,0,2013,Acta Crystallogr C,Synthesis, crystal structures and chemical bonding of RE(5-x)Li(x)Ge4 (RE = Nd, Sm and Gd; x ≃ 1) with the orthorhombic Gd5Si4 type.,The syntheses and single-crystal and electronic structures of three new ternary lithium rare earth germanides, RE(5-x)Li(x)Ge(4) (RE = Nd, Sm and Gd; x ≃ 1), namely tetrasamarium lithium tetragermanide (Sm(3.97)Li(1.03)Ge(4)), tetraneodymium lithium tetragermanide (Nd(3.97)Li(1.03)Ge(4)) and tetragadolinium lithium tetragermanide (Gd(3.96)Li(1.03)Ge(4)), are reported. All three compounds crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pnma and adopt the Gd(5)Si(4) structure type (Pearson code oP36). There are six atoms in the asymmetric unit: Li1 in Wyckoff site 4c, RE1 in 8d, RE2 in 8d, Ge1 in 8d, Ge2 in 4c and Ge3 in 4c. One of the RE sites, i.e. RE2, is statistically occupied by RE and Li atoms, accounting for the small deviation from ideal RE(4)LiGe(4) stoichiometry.
23281072,0,2013,Muscle Nerve,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C in Japan: report of a case.,INTRODUCTION: The distribution of documented cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C (CMT4C) is mainly limited to the Mediterranean region. We report the first documented case of CMT4C in East Asia. Furthermore, we estimate the proportion of CMT4C in Japan and compare the same with that in European countries.CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old Japanese woman presented with early-onset motor and sensory neuropathy associated with scoliosis, deformities of the hands and feet, and carpal tunnel syndrome. A genetic screen detected a homozygous p.R529Q mutation in SH3TC2, the causative gene of CMT4C. The SH3TC2 mutation identified here is unique among 426 unrelated Japanese CMT patients, excluding those with CMT1A.CONCLUSIONS: Although CMT4C also occurs in Japan, it is less common than in European countries.
25374693,0,2013,Int J Med Chem,Synthesis and In Vitro Antimicrobial Evaluation of New 1,3,4-Oxadiazoles Bearing 5-Chloro-2-methoxyphenyl Moiety.,A series of new 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives, 4(a-h), containing 5-chloro-2-methoxy benzohydrazide moiety were synthesized by the reaction of 5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoate with different aromatic carboxylic acids. These newly synthesized compounds were characterized by FT-IR, (1)H NMR, mass spectra, and also by elemental analysis. All the newly synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. Antimicrobial studies revealed that compounds 4c, 4f, and 4g showed significant activity against tested strains.
22215806,106,2012,Genes Dev,A decade of 3C technologies: insights into nuclear organization.,Over the past 10 years, the development of chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology and the subsequent genomic variants thereof have enabled the analysis of nuclear organization at an unprecedented resolution and throughput. The technology relies on the original and, in hindsight, remarkably simple idea that digestion and religation of fixed chromatin in cells, followed by the quantification of ligation junctions, allows for the determination of DNA contact frequencies and insight into chromosome topology. Here we evaluate and compare the current 3C-based methods (including 4C [chromosome conformation capture-on-chip], 5C [chromosome conformation capture carbon copy], HiC, and ChIA-PET), summarize their contribution to our current understanding of genome structure, and discuss how shape influences genome function.
22282182,37,2012,Radiology,Shear-wave elastography improves the specificity of breast US: the BE1 multinational study of 939 masses.,PURPOSE: To determine whether adding shear-wave (SW) elastographic features could improve accuracy of ultrasonographic (US) assessment of breast masses.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 2008 to September 2010, 958 women consented to repeat standard breast US supplemented by quantitative SW elastographic examination in this prospective multicenter institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant protocol. B-mode Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) features and assessments were recorded. SW elastographic evaluation (mean, maximum, and minimum elasticity of stiffest portion of mass and surrounding tissue; lesion-to-fat elasticity ratio; ratio of SW elastographic-to-B-mode lesion diameter or area; SW elastographic lesion shape and homogeneity) was performed. Qualitative color SW elastographic stiffness was assessed independently. Nine hundred thirty-nine masses were analyzable; 102 BI-RADS category 2 masses were assumed to be benign; reference standard was available for 837 category 3 or higher lesions. Considering BI-RADS category 4a or higher as test positive for malignancy, effect of SW elastographic features on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity after reclassifying category 3 and 4a masses was determined.RESULTS: Median participant age was 50 years; 289 of 939 (30.8%) masses were malignant (median mass size, 12 mm). B-mode BI-RADS AUC was 0.950; eight of 303 (2.6%) BI-RADS category 3 masses, 18 of 193 (9.3%) category 4a lesions, 41 of 97 (42%) category 4b lesions, 42 of 57 (74%) category 4c lesions, and 180 of 187 (96.3%) category 5 lesions were malignant. By using visual color stiffness to selectively upgrade category 3 and lack of stiffness to downgrade category 4a masses, specificity improved from 61.1% (397 of 650) to 78.5% (510 of 650) (P&lt;.001); AUC increased to 0.962 (P=.005). Oval shape on SW elastographic images and quantitative maximum elasticity of 80 kPa (5.2 m/sec) or less improved specificity (69.4% [451 of 650] and 77.4% [503 of 650], P&lt;.001 for both), without significant improvement in sensitivity or AUC.CONCLUSION: Adding SW elastographic features to BI-RADS feature analysis improved specificity of breast US mass assessment without loss of sensitivity.
22422861,35,2012,Science,ESCRT-III governs the Aurora B-mediated abscission checkpoint through CHMP4C.,The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery plays an evolutionarily conserved role in cytokinetic abscission, the final step of cell division where daughter cells are physically separated. Here, we show that charged multivesicular body (MVB) protein 4C (CHMP4C), a human ESCRT-III subunit, is involved in abscission timing. This function correlated with its differential spatiotemporal distribution during late stages of cytokinesis. Accordingly, CHMP4C functioned in the Aurora B-dependent abscission checkpoint to prevent both premature resolution of intercellular chromosome bridges and accumulation of DNA damage. CHMP4C engaged the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) via interaction with Borealin, which suggested a model whereby CHMP4C inhibits abscission upon phosphorylation by Aurora B. Thus, the ESCRT machinery may protect against genetic damage by coordinating midbody resolution with the abscission checkpoint.
22961246,28,2012,Nat Methods,Robust 4C-seq data analysis to screen for regulatory DNA interactions.,Regulatory DNA elements can control the expression of distant genes via physical interactions. Here we present a cost-effective methodology and computational analysis pipeline for robust characterization of the physical organization around selected promoters and other functional elements using chromosome conformation capture combined with high-throughput sequencing (4C-seq). Our approach can be multiplexed and routinely integrated with other functional genomics assays to facilitate physical characterization of gene regulation.
22609568,24,2012,Methods,Determining long-range chromatin interactions for selected genomic sites using 4C-seq technology: from fixation to computation.,Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) and 3C-based technologies are constantly evolving in order to probe nuclear organization with higher depth and resolution. One such method is 4C-technology that allows the investigation of the nuclear environment of a locus of choice. The use of Illumina next generation sequencing as a detection platform for the analysis of 4C data has further improved the sensitivity and resolution of this method. Here we provide a step-by-step protocol for 4C-seq, describing the procedure from the initial template preparation until the final data analysis, interchanged with background information and considerations.
22808280,19,2012,PLoS One,High-coverage ITS primers for the DNA-based identification of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes in environmental samples.,The kingdom Fungi is estimated to include 1.5 million or more species, playing key roles as decomposers, mutualists, and parasites in every biome on the earth. To comprehensively understand the diversity and ecology of this huge kingdom, DNA barcoding targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal repeat has been regarded as a prerequisite procedure. By extensively surveying ITS sequences in public databases, we designed new ITS primers with improved coverage across diverse taxonomic groups of fungi compared to existing primers. An in silico analysis based on public sequence databases indicated that the newly designed primers matched 99% of ascomycete and basidiomycete ITS taxa (species, subspecies or varieties), causing little taxonomic bias toward either fungal group. Two of the newly designed primers could inhibit the amplification of plant sequences and would enable the selective investigation of fungal communities in mycorrhizal associations, soil, and other types of environmental samples. Optimal PCR conditions for the primers were explored in an in vitro investigation. The new primers developed in this study will provide a basis for ecological studies on the diversity and community structures of fungi in the era of massive DNA sequencing.
23103767,17,2012,EMBO J,TNFα signals through specialized factories where responsive coding and miRNA genes are transcribed.,Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a potent cytokine that signals through nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) to activate a subset of human genes. It is usually assumed that this involves RNA polymerases transcribing responsive genes wherever they might be in the nucleus. Using primary human endothelial cells, variants of chromosome conformation capture (including 4C and chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing), and fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect single nascent transcripts, we show that TNFα induces responsive genes to congregate in discrete 'NFκB factories'. Some factories further specialize in transcribing responsive genes encoding micro-RNAs that target downregulated mRNAs. We expect all signalling pathways to contain this extra leg, where responding genes are transcribed in analogous specialized factories.
22807480,16,2012,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Chromatin-interaction compartment switch at developmentally regulated chromosomal domains reveals an unusual principle of chromatin folding.,Several 400- to 800-kb murine chromosome domains switch from early to late replication during loss of pluripotency, accompanied by a stable form of gene silencing that is resistant to reprogramming. We found that, whereas enhanced nuclease accessibility correlated with early replication genome-wide, domains that switch replication timing during differentiation were exceptionally inaccessible even when early-replicating. Nonetheless, two domains studied in detail exhibited substantial changes in transcriptional activity and higher-order chromatin unfolding confined to the region of replication timing change. Chromosome conformation capture (4C) data revealed that in the unfolded state in embryonic stem cells, these domains interacted preferentially with the early-replicating chromatin compartment, rarely interacting even with flanking late-replicating domains, whereas after differentiation, these same domains preferentially associated with late-replicating chromatin, including flanking domains. In both configurations they retained local boundaries of self-interaction, supporting the replication domain model of replication-timing regulation. Our results reveal a principle of developmentally regulated, large-scale chromosome folding involving a subnuclear compartment switch of inaccessible chromatin. This unusual level of regulation may underlie resistance to reprogramming in replication-timing switch regions.
22802932,12,2012,PLoS One,Pairing of homologous regions in the mouse genome is associated with transcription but not imprinting status.,Although somatic homologous pairing is common in Drosophila it is not generally observed in mammalian cells. However, a number of regions have recently been shown to come into close proximity with their homologous allele, and it has been proposed that pairing might be involved in the establishment or maintenance of monoallelic expression. Here, we investigate the pairing properties of various imprinted and non-imprinted regions in mouse tissues and ES cells. We find by allele-specific 4C-Seq and DNA FISH that the Kcnq1 imprinted region displays frequent pairing but that this is not dependent on monoallelic expression. We demonstrate that pairing involves larger chromosomal regions and that the two chromosome territories come close together. Frequent pairing is not associated with imprinted status or DNA repair, but is influenced by chromosomal location and transcription. We propose that homologous pairing is not exclusive to specialised regions or specific functional events, and speculate that it provides the cell with the opportunity of trans-allelic effects on gene regulation.
22786955,11,2012,J Neurophysiol,Cholinergic suppression of visual responses in primate V1 is mediated by GABAergic inhibition.,Acetylcholine (ACh) has been implicated in selective attention. To understand the local circuit action of ACh, we iontophoresed cholinergic agonists into the primate primary visual cortex (V1) while presenting optimal visual stimuli. Consistent with our previous anatomical studies showing that GABAergic neurons in V1 express ACh receptors to a greater extent than do excitatory neurons, we observed suppressed visual responses in 36% of recorded neurons outside V1's primary thalamorecipient layer (4c). This suppression is blocked by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine. Within layer 4c, ACh release produces a response gain enhancement (Disney AA, Aoki C, Hawken MJ. Neuron 56: 701-713, 2007); elsewhere, ACh suppresses response gain by strengthening inhibition. Our finding contrasts with the observation that the dominant mechanism of suppression in the neocortex of rats is reduced glutamate release. We propose that in primates, distinct cholinergic receptor subtypes are recruited on specific cell types and in specific lamina to yield opposing modulatory effects that together increase neurons' responsiveness to optimal stimuli without changing tuning width.
22258256,9,2012,J Virol,Retargeting of rat parvovirus H-1PV to cancer cells through genetic engineering of the viral capsid.,The rat parvovirus H-1PV is a promising anticancer agent given its oncosuppressive properties and the absence of known side effects in humans. H-1PV replicates preferentially in transformed cells, but the virus can enter both normal and cancer cells. Uptake by normal cells sequesters a significant portion of the administered viral dose away from the tumor target. Hence, targeting H-1PV entry specifically to tumor cells is important to increase the efficacy of parvovirus-based treatments. In this study, we first found that sialic acid plays a key role in H-1PV entry. We then genetically engineered the H-1PV capsid to improve its affinity for human tumor cells. By analogy with the resolved crystal structure of the closely related parvovirus minute virus of mice, we developed an in silico three-dimensional (3D) model of the H-1PV wild-type capsid. Based on this model, we identified putative amino acids involved in cell membrane recognition and virus entry at the level of the 2-fold axis of symmetry of the capsid, within the so-called dimple region. In situ mutagenesis of these residues significantly reduced the binding and entry of H-1PV into permissive cells. We then engineered an entry-deficient viral capsid and inserted a cyclic RGD-4C peptide at the level of its 3-fold axis spike. This peptide binds α(v)β(3) and α(v)β(5) integrins, which are overexpressed in cancer cells and growing blood vessels. The insertion of the peptide rescued viral infectivity toward cells overexpressing α(v)β(5) integrins, resulting in the efficient killing of these cells by the reengineered virus. This work demonstrates that H-1PV can be genetically retargeted through the modification of its capsid, showing great promise for a more efficient use of this virus in cancer therapy.
22929766,8,2012,Methods Enzymol,4C technology: protocols and data analysis.,Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology and its genome-wide derivatives have revolutionized our knowledge on chromatin folding and nuclear organization. 4C-seq Technology combines 3C principles with high-throughput sequencing (4C-seq) to enable for unbiased genome-wide screens for DNA contacts made by single genomic sites of interest. Here, we discuss in detail the design, application, and data analysis of 4C-seq experiments. Based on many hundreds of different 4C-seq experiments, we define criteria to assess data quality and show how different restriction enzymes and cross-linking conditions affect results. We describe in detail the mapping strategy of 4C-seq reads and show advanced strategies for data analysis.
23189967,7,2012,J Med Chem,Discovery of salermide-related sirtuin inhibitors: binding mode studies and antiproliferative effects in cancer cells including cancer stem cells.,Chemical changes performed on 1a (sirtinol) led to a series of SIRT1/2 inhibitors, in some cases more potent than 1a mainly against SIRT1. Tested in human leukemia U937 cells, the benzamide and anilide derivatives 1b, 1c, 2b, and 2c as well as the 4-(2-phenylpropyl)thioanalogue 4c showed huge apoptosis induction, while some sulfinyl and sulfonyl derivatives (5b, 5c, and 6a-c) were highly efficient in granulocytic differentiation. When assayed in human leukemia MOLT4 as well as in human breast MDA-MB-231 and colon RKO cancer cell lines, the anilide 2b (salermide) and the phenylpropylthio analogue 4b emerged as the most potent antiproliferative agents. Tested on colorectal carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme cancer stem cells (CSCs) from patients, 2b was particularly potent against colorectal carcinoma CSCs, while 4b, 6a, and the SIRT2-selective inhibitor AGK-2 showed the highest effect against glioblastoma multiforme CSCs. Such compounds will be further explored for their broad-spectrum anticancer properties.
22684983,7,2012,J Comp Neurol,Distribution of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2) in the primary visual cortex of the macaque and human.,The majority of thalamic terminals in V1 arise from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) afferents. Thalamic afferent terminals are preferentially labeled by an isoform of the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGluT2. The goal of our study was to determine the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in macaque and human visual cortex. First, we investigated the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in all layers of macaque monkey primary visual cortex (V1), and found a very close correspondence between the known distribution of LGN afferents from previous studies and the distribution of VGluT2-immunoreactive (-ir) puncta. There was also a close correspondence between cytochrome oxidase density and VGluT2-ir puncta distribution. After validating the correspondence in macaque, we made a comparative study in human V1. In many aspects, the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in human was qualitatively similar to that of the macaque: high densities in layer 4C, patches of VGluT2-ir puncta in the supragranular layer (2/3), lower but clear distribution in layers 1 and 6, and very few puncta in layers 5 and 4B. However, there were also important differences between macaques and humans. In layer 4A of human, there was a sparse distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta, whereas in macaque, there was a dense distribution with the characteristic honeycomb organization. The results suggest important changes in the pattern of cortical VGluT2 immunostaining that may be related to evolutionary differences in the cortical organization of LGN afferents between Old World monkeys and humans.
22617153,6,2012,J Hepatol,The Laennec staging system for histological sub-classification of cirrhosis is useful for stratification of prognosis in patients with liver cirrhosis.,BACKGROUNDS &amp; AIMS: The clinical severity of cirrhosis varies widely. We investigated whether histological sub-classification of cirrhosis using the Laennec system can discriminate different outcomes among patients with cirrhosis.METHODS: One hundred and seventy-five patients with chronic liver disease who underwent liver biopsy and showed stage 3 or 4 fibrosis between January 2001 and December 2008 were prospectively enrolled. Cirrhosis was sub-classified into three groups (4A, 4B, and 4C) according to the Laennec system. The end point was liver-related event (LRE) occurrence, including decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related death.RESULTS: The median age of the patients (110 men, 65 women) was 55 years. Stages 3, 4A, 4B, and 4C were identified in 46 (26.3%), 16 (9.1%), 82 (46.9%), and 31 (17.7%) patients, respectively. During the follow-up period, LREs occurred in 32 (18.3%) patients: 4 (8.7%) with stage 3, 2 (12.5%) with stage 4A, 17 (20.7%) with stage 4B, and 9 (29.0%) with stage 4C. In a multivariate analysis, histological sub-classification of cirrhosis independently predicted LRE occurrence. While patients with stage 4A tended to be at higher risk of LRE occurrence than those with stage 3, patients with stages 4B and 4C had significantly higher risks of LRE occurrence, with hazard ratios of 6.158 (p=0.016) and 8.945 (p=0.004), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Histological sub-classification of cirrhosis using the Laennec system can be used to assess the risk of LRE occurrence among patients with cirrhosis. Our study provides a solid basis for further studies of non-invasive methods for monitoring the risk of LRE occurrence and will help physicians to establish optimum treatment strategies.
22712544,5,2012,J Med Chem,Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of N-alkylated deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) derivatives for the treatment of dengue virus infection.,We recently described the discovery of oxygenated N-alkyl deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) derivative 7 (CM-10-18) with antiviral activity against dengue virus (DENV) infection both in vitro and in vivo. This imino sugar was promising but had an EC(50) against DENV in BHK cells of 6.5 μM, which limited its use in in vivo. Compound 7 presented structural opportunities for activity relationship analysis, which we exploited and report here. These structure-activity relationship studies led to analogues 2h, 2l, 3j, 3l, 3v, and 4b-4c with nanomolar antiviral activity (EC(50) = 0.3-0.5 μM) against DENV infection, while maintaining low cytotoxicity (CC(50) &gt; 500 μM, SI &gt; 1000). In male Sprague-Dawley rats, compound 3l was well tolerated at a dose up to 200 mg/kg and displayed desirable PK profiles, with significantly improved bioavailability (F = 92 ± 4%).
22563557,5,2012,Ann Lab Med,Prevalence of hepatitis C virus infections and distribution of hepatitis C virus genotypes among Korean blood donors.,BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a worldwide health-care burden. Prevalence rates vary and the distribution of genotypes depends on geographical location. Here, the recent prevalence of HCV infections and distribution of HCV genotypes among Korean blood donors were studied.METHODS: Between February 2005 and December 2009, a total of 11,064,532 donors were screened for anti-HCV and 11,412,690 donors were screened for HCV RNA. HCV genotyping was conducted for 748 blood donors with HCV RNA by using the line probe assay (VERSANT HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay, Bayer Healthcare, USA) after amplification of the 5'-untranslated and core regions of the genome.RESULTS: The anti-HCV prevalence was 0.16% (17,250/11,064,532). HCV RNA was detected in 959 out of the 11,412,690 donors (8.4/100,000). HCV RNA was more prevalent among women, donors who resided at harbor sites, and first-time donors. In addition, the prevalence of HCV RNA increased with age. The genotypes of 740 out of the 748 tested donors (98.9%) were identified. HCV genotype 1b (47.7%) and 2a/2c (35.0%) were dominant. Genotypes 2 (7.6%), 2b (2.3%), 3a (1.6%), 1a (1.3%), 1 (0.9%), 2v (0.5%), 1v (0.1%), and 3 (0.1%) were also identified. Genotype 4a/4c/4d (0.1%) was detected for the first time in one Korean blood donor.CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of HCV genotypes in Korea has not changed remarkably, with the exception of genotype 4a/4c/4d. A periodic study to monitor the prevalence of HCV infections and the distribution of HCV genotypes is required to identify emerging genotypes in Korea.
22476443,5,2012,Chromosoma,Interphase chromatin organisation in Arabidopsis nuclei: constraints versus randomness.,The spatial chromatin organisation and molecular interactions within and between chromatin domains and chromosome territories (CTs) are essential for fundamental processes such as replication, transcription and DNA repair via homologous recombination. To analyse the distribution and interaction of whole CTs, centromeres, (sub)telomeres and ~100-kb interstitial chromatin segments in endopolyploid nuclei, specific FISH probes from Arabidopsis thaliana were applied to 2-64C differentiated leaf nuclei. Whereas CTs occupy a distinct and defined volume of the nucleus and do not obviously intermingle with each other in 2-64C nuclei, ~100-kb sister chromatin segments within these CTs become more non-cohesive with increasing endopolyploidy. Centromeres, preferentially located at the nuclear periphery, may show ring- or half-moon like shapes in 2C and 4C nuclei. Sister centromeres tend to associate up to the 8C level. From 16C nuclei on, they become progressively separated. The higher the polyploidy level gets, the more separate chromatids are present. Due to sister chromatid separation in highly endopolyploid nuclei, the centromeric histone variant CENH3, the 180-bp centromeric repeats and pericentromeric heterochromatin form distinct subdomains at adjacent but not intermingling positions. The (sub)telomeres are frequently associated with each other and with the nucleolus and less often with centromeres. The extent of chromatid separation and of chromatin decondensation at subtelomeric chromatin segments varies between chromosome arms. A mainly random distribution and similar shapes of CTs even at higher ploidy levels indicate that in general no substantial CT reorganisation occurs during endopolyploidisation. Non-cohesive sister chromatid regions at chromosome arms and at the (peri)centromere are accompanied by a less dense chromatin conformation in highly endopolyploid nuclei. We discuss the possible function of this conformation in comparison to transcriptionally active regions at insect polytene chromosomes.
22347474,5,2012,PLoS One,CTCF mediates the cell-type specific spatial organization of the Kcnq5 locus and the local gene regulation.,Chromatin loops play important roles in the dynamic spatial organization of genes in the nucleus. Growing evidence has revealed that the multivalent functional zinc finger protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master regulator of genome spatial organization, and mediates the ubiquitous chromatin loops within the genome. Using circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) methodology, we discovered that CTCF may be a master organizer in mediating the spatial organization of the kcnq5 gene locus. We characterized the cell-type specific spatial organization of the kcnq5 gene locus mediated by CTCF in detail using chromosome conformation capture (3C) and 3C-derived techniques. Cohesion also participated in mediating the organization of this locus. RNAi-mediated knockdown of CTCF sharply diminished the interaction frequencies between the chromatin loops of the kcnq5 gene locus and down-regulated local gene expression. Functional analysis showed that the interacting chromatin loops of the kcnq5 gene locus can repress the gene expression in a luciferase reporter assay. These interacting chromatin fragments were a series of repressing elements whose contacts were mediated by CTCF. Therefore, these findings suggested that the dynamical spatial organization of the kcnq5 locus regulates local gene expression.
22304696,5,2012,Inorg Chem,Mixed-valence nickel-iron dithiolate models of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase active site.,A series of mixed-valence nickel-iron dithiolates is described. Oxidation of (diphosphine)Ni(dithiolate)Fe(CO)(3) complexes 1, 2, and 3 with ferrocenium salts affords the corresponding tricarbonyl cations [(dppe)Ni(pdt)Fe(CO)(3)](+) ([1](+)), [(dppe)Ni(edt)Fe(CO)(3)](+) ([2](+)) and [(dcpe)Ni(pdt)Fe(CO)(3)](+) ([3](+)), respectively, where dppe = Ph(2)PCH(2)CH(2)PPh(2), dcpe = Cy(2)PCH(2)CH(2)PCy(2), (Cy = cyclohexyl), pdtH(2) = HSCH(2)CH(2)CH(2)SH, and edtH(2) = HSCH(2)CH(2)SH. The cation [2](+) proved unstable, but the propanedithiolates are robust. IR and EPR spectroscopic measurements indicate that these species exist as C(s)-symmetric species. Crystallographic characterization of [3]BF(4) shows that Ni is square planar. Interaction of [1]BF(4) with P-donor ligands (L) afforded a series of substituted derivatives of type [(dppe)Ni(pdt)Fe(CO)(2)L]BF(4) for L = P(OPh)(3) ([4a]BF(4)), P(p-C(6)H(4)Cl)(3) ([4b]BF(4)), PPh(2)(2-py) ([4c]BF(4)), PPh(2)(OEt) ([4d]BF(4)), PPh(3) ([4e]BF(4)), PPh(2)(o-C(6)H(4)OMe) ([4f]BF(4)), PPh(2)(o-C(6)H(4)OCH(2)OMe) ([4g]BF(4)), P(p-tol)(3) ([4h]BF(4)), P(p-C(6)H(4)OMe)(3) ([4i]BF(4)), and PMePh(2) ([4j]BF(4)). EPR analysis indicates that ethanedithiolate [2](+) exists as a single species at 110 K, whereas the propanedithiolate cations exist as a mixture of two conformers, which are proposed to be related through a flip of the chelate ring. Mössbauer spectra of 1 and oxidized S = 1/2 [4e]BF(4) are both consistent with a low-spin Fe(I) state. The hyperfine coupling tensor of [4e]BF(4) has a small isotropic component and significant anisotropy. DFT calculations using the BP86, B3LYP, and PBE0 exchange-correlation functionals agree with the structural and spectroscopic data, suggesting that the SOMOs in complexes of the present type are localized in an Fe(I)-centered d(z(2)) orbital. The DFT calculations allow an assignment of oxidation states of the metals and rationalization of the conformers detected by EPR spectroscopy. Treatment of [1](+) with CN(-) and compact basic phosphines results in complex reactions. With dppe, [1](+) undergoes quasi-disproportionation to give 1 and the diamagnetic complex [(dppe)Ni(pdt)Fe(CO)(2)(dppe)](2+) ([5](2+)), which features square-planar Ni linked to an octahedral Fe center.
23019137,4,2012,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Reversal of dopamine D2 agonist-induced inhibition of ventral tegmental area neurons by Gq-linked neurotransmitters is dependent on protein kinase C, G protein-coupled receptor kinase, and dynamin.,Dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area are important components of brain pathways related to addiction. Prolonged exposure of these neurons to moderate concentrations of dopamine (DA) decreases their sensitivity to inhibition by DA, a process called DA-inhibition reversal (DIR). DIR is mediated by phospholipase C and conventional subtype of protein kinase C (cPKC) through concurrent stimulation of D2 and D1-like DA receptors, or by D2 stimulation concurrent with activation of 5-HT(2) or neurotensin receptors. In the present study, we further characterized this phenomenon by use of extracellular recordings in brain slices to examine whether DIR is linked to G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) or dynamin by assessing DIR in the presence of antagonists of these enzymes. DIR was blocked by β-ARK1 inhibitor, which inhibits GRK2, and by dynasore, which blocks dynamin. Reversal of inhibition by D2 agonist quinpirole was produced by serotonin (50 µM) and by neurotensin (5-10 nM). Serotonin-induced or neurotensin-induced reversal was blocked by β-ARK1 inhibitor, dynasore, or cPKC antagonist 5,6,7,13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-12H-indolo[2,3-a]pyrrolo[3,4c]carbazole-12-propanenitrile (Gö6976). This further characterization of DIR indicates that cPKC, GRK2, and dynamin play important roles in the desensitization of D2 receptors. As drugs of abuse produce persistent increases in DA concentration in the ventral tegmental area, reduction of D2 receptor sensitivity as a result of drug abuse may be a critical factor in the processes of addiction.
22889767,4,2012,Brain Behav Evol,Evidence for ape and human specializations in geniculostriate projections from VGLUT2 immunohistochemistry.,Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) reuptake glutamate into synaptic vesicles at excitatory synapses. VGLUT2 is localized in the cortical terminals of neuronal somas located in the main sensory nuclei of the thalamus. Thus, immunolabeling of cortex with antibodies to VGLUT2 can reveal geniculostriate terminal distributions in species in which connectivity cannot be studied with tract-tracing techniques, permitting broader comparative studies of cortical specializations. Here, we used VGLUT2 immunohistochemistry to compare the organization of geniculostriate afferents in primary visual cortex in hominid primates (humans, chimpanzees, and an orangutan), Old World monkeys (rhesus macaques and vervets), and New World monkeys (squirrel monkeys). The New and Old World monkeys had a broad, dense band of terminal-like labeling in cortical layer 4C, a narrow band of labeling in layer 4A, and additional labeling in layers 2/3 and 6, consistent with results from conventional tract-tracing studies in these species. By contrast, although the hominid primates had a prominent layer 4C band, labeling of layer 4A was sparse or absent. Labeling was also present in layers 2/3 and 6, although labeling of layer 6 was weaker in hominids and possibly more individually variable than in Old and New World monkeys. These findings are consistent with previous observations from cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and a very small number of connectivity studies, suggesting that the projections from the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus to layer 4A were strongly reduced or eliminated in humans and apes following their evolutionary divergence from the other anthropoid primates.</AbstractText>: Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) reuptake glutamate into synaptic vesicles at excitatory synapses.

22778789,4,2012,Therap Adv Gastroenterol,Chronic constipation: new diagnostic and treatment approaches.,Chronic constipation is a highly prevalent disorder that affects approximately 15% of the US population. Chronic constipation refers to patients who have had symptoms for more than 6 months. In clinical practice, chronic constipation is often used interchangeably with the term functional constipation. This is best defined using the Rome III criteria, which involves an evaluation of stool frequency in addition to symptoms of straining, feelings of incomplete evacuation, and the need to use manual maneuvers to assist with stool evacuation. Symptoms can be burdensome, leading to a reduction in patients' quality of life. As a national healthcare issue, chronic constipation is also important because it imposes a significant economic impact on the healthcare system. A number of treatment options are currently available, both over-the-counter and by prescription, although not all patients respond to these therapies. This review will focus on new medical treatment options for the management of chronic constipation, and the safety and efficacy of these agents will be reviewed. In addition, the efficacy of new diagnostic tests to evaluate colonic motility and anorectal function are described.
22776363,4,2012,Methods,A genome-wide 3C-method for characterizing the three-dimensional architectures of genomes.,Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromosomes within the eukaryotic nucleus reflects and influences genomic activities, including transcription, DNA replication, recombination and DNA repair. In order to uncover structure-function relationships, it is necessary first to understand the principles underlying the folding and the 3D arrangement of chromosomes. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) provides a powerful tool for detecting interactions within and between chromosomes. A high throughput derivative of 3C, chromosome conformation capture on chip (4C), executes a genome-wide interrogation of interaction partners for a given locus. We recently developed a new method, a derivative of 3C and 4C, which, similar to Hi-C, is capable of comprehensively identifying long-range chromosome interactions throughout a genome in an unbiased fashion. Hence, our method can be applied to decipher the 3D architectures of genomes. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for this method.
22722369,4,2012,Nat Protoc,Sensitive detection of chromatin coassociations using enhanced chromosome conformation capture on chip.,Chromosome conformation capture (3C) is a powerful technique for analyzing spatial chromatin organization in vivo. Technical variants of the assay ('4C') allow the systematic detection of genome-wide coassociations with bait sequences of interest, enabling the nuclear environments of specific genes to be probed. We describe enhanced 4C (e4C, enhanced chromosome conformation capture on chip), a technique incorporating additional enrichment steps for bait-specific sequences, and thus improving sensitivity in the detection of weaker, distal chromatin coassociations. In brief, e4C entails the fixation, restriction digestion and ligation steps of conventional 3C, with an optional chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) step to select for subsets of chromatin coassociations, followed by bait enrichment by biotinylated primer extension and pull-down, adapter ligation and PCR amplification. Chromatin coassociations with the bait sequence can then be assessed by hybridizing e4C products to microarrays or sequencing. The e4C procedure takes approximately 1 week to go from tissue to DNA ready for microarray hybridization.
22612619,4,2012,Xenobiotica,Stereoselective and regiospecific hydroxylation of ketamine and norketamine.,The objective was to determine the cytochrome P450s (CYPs) responsible for the stereoselective and regiospecific hydroxylation of ketamine [(R,S)-Ket] to diastereomeric hydroxyketamines, (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HK (5a) and (2S,6R;2R,6S)-HK (5b) and norketamine [(R,S)-norKet] to hydroxynorketamines, (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK (4a), (2S,6R;2R,6S)-HNK (4b), (2S,5S;2R,5R)-HNK (4c), (2S,4S;2R,4R)-HNK (4d), (2S,4R;2R,4S)-HNK (4e), (2S,5R;2R,5S)-HNK (4f). The enantiomers of Ket and norKet were incubated with characterized human liver microsomes (HLMs) and expressed CYPs. Metabolites were identified and quantified using LC/MS/MS and apparent kinetic constants estimated using single-site Michaelis-Menten, Hill or substrate inhibition equation. 5a was predominantly formed from (S)-Ket by CYP2A6 and N-demethylated to 4a by CYP2B6. 5b was formed from (R)- and (S)-Ket by CYP3A4/3A5 and N-demethylated to 4b by multiple enzymes. norKet incubation produced 4a, 4c and 4f and minor amounts of 4d and 4e. CYP2A6 and CYP2B6 were the major enzymes responsible for the formation of 4a, 4d and 4f, and CYP3A4/3A5 for the formation of 4e. The 4b metabolite was not detected in the norKet incubates. 5a and 4b were detected in plasma samples from patients receiving (R,S)-Ket, indicating that 5a and 5b are significant Ket metabolites. Large variations in HNK concentrations were observed suggesting that pharmacogenetics and/or metabolic drug interactions may play a role in therapeutic response.
22548123,4,2012,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Testing homeopathy in mouse emotional response models: pooled data analysis of two series of studies.,Two previous investigations were performed to assess the activity of Gelsemium sempervirens (Gelsemium s.) in mice, using emotional response models. These two series are pooled and analysed here. Gelsemium s. in various homeopathic centesimal dilutions/dynamizations (4C, 5C, 7C, 9C, and 30C), a placebo (solvent vehicle), and the reference drugs diazepam (1 mg/kg body weight) or buspirone (5 mg/kg body weight) were delivered intraperitoneally to groups of albino CD1 mice, and their effects on animal behaviour were assessed by the light-dark (LD) choice test and the open-field (OF) exploration test. Up to 14 separate replications were carried out in fully blind and randomised conditions. Pooled analysis demonstrated highly significant effects of Gelsemium s. 5C, 7C, and 30C on the OF parameter &quot;time spent in central area&quot; and of Gelsemium s. 5C, 9C, and 30C on the LD parameters &quot;time spent in lit area&quot; and &quot;number of light-dark transitions,&quot; without any sedative action or adverse effects on locomotion. This pooled data analysis confirms and reinforces the evidence that Gelsemium s. regulates emotional responses and behaviour of laboratory mice in a nonlinear fashion with dilution/dynamization.
22455451,4,2012,Bioconjug Chem,Dual function of RGD-modified VEGI-192 for breast cancer treatment.,Identification of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors has led to development of an increasingly attractive strategy for cancer therapy and other angiogenesis-driven diseases. Vascular endothelial growth inhibitor (VEGI), a potent and relatively nontoxic endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, has been intensively studied, and this work shed new light on developing promising anti-angiogenic strategies. It is well-documented that the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif exhibits high binding affinity to integrin α(v)β(3), which is abundantly expressed in cancer cells and specifically associated with angiogenesis on tumors. Here, we designed a fusion protein containing the special RGD-4C motif sequence and VEGI-192, aimed at offering more effective multiple targeting to tumor cells and tumor vasculature, and higher anti-angiogenic and antitumor efficacy. Functional tests demonstrated that the purified recombinant human RGD-VEGI-192 protein (rhRGD-VEGI-192) potently inhibited endothelial growth in vitro and suppressed neovascularization in chicken chorioallantoic membrane in vivo, to a higher degree as compared with rhVEGI-192 protein. More importantly, rhRGD-VEGI-192, but not rhVEGI-192 protein, could potentially target MDA-MB-435 breast tumor cells, significantly inhibiting growth of MDA-MB-435 cells in vitro, triggered apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 cells by activation of caspase-8 as well as caspase-3, which was mediated by activating the JNK signaling associated with upregulation of pro-apoptotic protein Puma, and consequently led to the observed significant antitumor effect in vivo against a human breast cancer xenograft. Our study indicated that the RGD-VEGI-192 fusion protein might represent a novel anti-angiogenic and antitumor strategy.
23185501,3,2012,PLoS One,Passage of a Sendai virus recombinant in embryonated chicken eggs leads to markedly rapid accumulation of U-to-C transitions in a limited region of the viral genome.,The P gene of paramyxoviruses is unique in producing not only P but also &quot;accessory&quot; C and/or V proteins. Successful generation of C- or V-deficient recombinant viruses using a reverse genetics technique has been revealing their importance in viral pathogenesis as well as replication. As for Sendai virus (SeV), the C proteins, a nested set of four polypeptides C', C, Y1, and Y2, have been shown to exert multiple functions in escaping from the host innate immunity, inhibiting virus-induced apoptosis, promoting virus assembly and budding, and regulating viral RNA synthesis. In this study, we subjected the 4C(-) recombinant lacking expression of all four C proteins to serial passages through eggs, and found the rapid emergence of a C-recovered revertant virus. Unlike the SeV strains or the recombinants reported previously or tested in this study, this was caused by an exceptionally quick accumulation of U-to-C transitions in a limited region of the 4C(-) genome causing recovery of the C protein expression. These results suggest that a lack of C proteins could lead unexpectedly to strong selective pressures, and that the C proteins might play more critical roles in SeV replication than ever reported.
23033056,3,2012,Phys Chem Chem Phys,Self-weaving sulfur-carbon composite cathodes for high rate lithium-sulfur batteries.,Realization of a ubiquitous clean energy future depends critically on the efficient storage and utilization of renewable energies. Lithium-ion batteries are appealing in this regard, but low-cost, abundant, safe, high energy-density electrode materials need to be developed to adopt them. Here we present a sulfur-multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite cathode with high-rate cyclability by a facile binder/current collector-free fabrication process. The composite cathode exhibits high capacities of 1352 mAh g(-1) at 1C rate and 1012 mAh g(-1) at 4C rate. Due to the self-weaving behavior of MWCNTs, extra cell components such as binders and current collectors are rendered unnecessary, thereby streamlining the electrode manufacturing process and decreasing the cell weight. While the highly conductive MWCNTs improve the active material utilization at high rates, the absorption ability of the cathode framework localizes the electrolyte and suppresses the migration of soluble polysulfides. The cathode design and facile synthesis enhance the feasibility of practical high rate Li-S batteries.
22879959,3,2012,PLoS One,Association of OPA1 polymorphisms with NTG and HTG: a meta-analysis.,BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms of the Optic atrophy 1 gene have been implicated in altering the risk of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), especially the susceptibility to normal tension glaucoma (NTG), but the results remain controversial.METHODS: Multiple electronic databases (up to January 20, 2012) were searched independently by two investigators. A meta-analysis was performed on the association between Optic atrophy 1 polymorphisms (rs 166850 and rs 10451941) and normal tension glaucoma (NTG)/high tension glaucoma (HTG). Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated.RESULTS: Seven studies of 713 cases and 964 controls for NTG and five studies of 1200 cases and 971 controls for HTG on IVS8+4C&gt;T (rs 166850) and IVS8+32T&gt;C (rs10451941) were identified. There were significant associations between the OPA1 rs10451941polymorphism and NTG susceptibility for all genetic models(C vs. T OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.09-1.47, p = 0.002; CC vs. TT: OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.04-2.20, p = 0.029; CC vs. CT+TT: OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.16-2.33, p = 0.005; CC+CT vs. TT: OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.44, p = 0.032). However, no evidence of associations was detected between the OPA1 IVS8+32C&gt;T polymorphism and POAG susceptibility to HTG. Similarly, clear associations between the rs 166850 variant and NTG were observed in allelic and dominant models (T vs. C OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.16-1.99, p = 0.002; TT+TC vs. CC OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.13-2.01, p = 0.006) but not to HTG. In subgroup analyses by ethnicity, we detected an association between both OPA1 polymorphisms and risk for NTG in Caucasians but not in Asians. By contrast, no significant findings were noted between OPA1 variants for HTG, either in Caucasians or in Asians.CONCLUSIONS: Both the IVS8+4C&gt;T and IVS8+32T&gt;C variants may affect individual susceptibility to NTG. Moreover, stratified analyses for NTG detecting the effects of both OPA1 polymorphisms seemed to vary with ethnicity. Further investigations are needed to validate the association.
22848474,3,2012,PLoS One,Correlation between multi-drug resistance-associated membrane transport in clonal cancer cells and the cell cycle phase.,Multidrug resistance driven by ABC membrane transporters is one of the major reasons for treatment failure in human malignancy. Some limited evidence has previously been reported on the cell cycle dependence of ABC transporter expression. However, it has never been demonstrated that the functional activity of these transporters correlates with the cell cycle position. Here, we studied the rate of intrinsic ABC transport in different phases of the cell cycle in cultured MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The rate was characterized in terms of the efflux kinetics from cells loaded with an ABC transporter substrate. As averaging the kinetics over a cell population could lead to errors, we studied kinetics of ABC transport at the single-cell level. We found that the rate of ABC transport in MCF-7 cells could be described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics with two classical parameters, V(max) and K(M). Each of these parameters showed similar unimodal distributions with different positions of maxima for cell subpopulations in the 2c and 4c states. Compared to the 2c cells, the 4c cells exhibited greater V(max) values, indicating a higher activity of transport. They also exhibited a greater V(max)/K(M) ratio, indicating a higher efficiency of transport. Our findings suggest that cell cycle-related modulation of MDR may need to be taken into account when designing chemotherapy regimens which include cytostatic agents.
22743239,3,2012,Mech Ageing Dev,UCP3 polymorphisms, hand grip performance and survival at old age: association analysis in two Danish middle aged and elderly cohorts.,An efficient uncoupling process is generally considered to have a protective effect on the aging muscle by slowing down its age-related decay. Genetic polymorphisms in the Uncoupling Protein 3 (UCP3) gene, whose product is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle, were suggested to be associated with hand grip (HG) performances in elderly populations. Considering the population specificity of the quality of aging, we aimed to add further support to this evidence by analyzing the association between four SNPs in the UCP3 gene and relative haplotypes in two large cohorts of middle aged (N=708) and oldest old Danes (N=908). We found that the variability at rs1685354 and rs11235972 was associated with HG levels both at single and haplotypic level in both cohorts. Furthermore, taking advantage of large cohort and period survival data of the oldest cohort, we tested the association of each SNP with survival at 10years from the baseline visit. Interestingly, we found that allele A at rs11235972, associated in this cohort with lowest HG scores, influences also the survival patterns, with people carrying this allele showing higher mortality rates. On the whole, our work supports the role of UCP3 gene in functional status and survival at old age.
22569296,3,2012,Life Sci,Regulation by physiological cations of acetylcholine transport mediated by human OCTN1 (SLC22A4). Implications in the non-neuronal cholinergic system.,AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the influence of physiological ions on the transport of acetylcholine which is catalyzed by the recombinant human Organic Cation Transporter Novel 1 (hOCTN1), thus being involved in the function of the non neuronal cholinergic system.MAIN METHODS: The experimental model of proteoliposomes reconstituted with the hOCTN1 transporter obtained by over-expression in E. coli has been used. Uptake and efflux of [(3)H]acetylcholine in the proteoliposome system have been followed in the presence of different cations, mimicking the cell environment.KEY FINDINGS: Internal K(+) stimulated, while external Na(+) strongly inhibited the uptake of [(3)H]acetylcholine in proteoliposomes. Strong inhibition was exerted also by external K(+) while Mg(2+) or sucrose had no effect. Differently, the efflux of [(3)H]acetylcholine from proteoliposomes was not influenced by external or internal Na(+) and was only marginally stimulated by internal K(+). By dose response analysis of the Na(+) inhibition, an IC(50) of 1.3 mM was derived. The kinetic analysis of the Na(+) effect revealed a competitive type of inhibition on acetylcholine uptake, i.e., Na(+) interacts with the same external binding site of acetylcholine with a Ki of 1.2 mM.SIGNIFICANCE: Acetylcholine transport catalyzed by hOCTN1 revealed an asymmetric regulation by Na(+). Since the orientation of the transporter in the liposomal membrane is the same as in native membranes, and on the basis of sidedness of inhibition, physiological acetylcholine is principally exported by the transporter. This implies a role in autocrine and paracrine effects in non neuronal tissues.
22561016,3,2012,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Over-expression in Escherichia coli, purification and reconstitution in liposomes of the third member of the OCTN sub-family: the mouse carnitine transporter OCTN3.,pET-21a(+)-mOCTN3-6His was constructed and used for over-expression in Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS. After IPTG induction a protein with apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa was collected in the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate and purified by Ni(2+)-chelating chromatography with a yield of 2mg/l of cell culture. The over-expressed protein was identified with mOCTN3 by anti-His antibody and reconstitution in liposomes. mOCTN3 required peculiar conditions for optimal expression and reconstitution in liposomes. The protein catalyzed a time dependent [(3)H]carnitine uptake which was stimulated by intraliposomal ATP and nearly independent of the pH. The K(m) for carnitine was 36 μM. [(3)H]carnitine transport was inhibited by carnitine analogues and some Cys and NH(2) reagents. This paper represents the first outcome in over-expressing, in active form, the third member of the OCTN sub-family, mOCTN3, in E. coli.
22374795,3,2012,Cell Biochem Funct,Human OCTN2 (SLC22A5) is down-regulated in virus- and nonvirus-mediated cancer.,The expression of carnitine plasma membrane transporter OCTN2 was evaluated in virus and nonvirus-mediated cancer. Both OCTN2 mRNA and protein levels were reduced in keratinocytes retrotransduced with HPV16 E6 and E7 compared with the control. The OCTN2 expression was reduced also in keratinocytes retrotransduced with the sole HPV16 E6. A similar down-regulation of OCTN2 mRNA level was observed in a naturally HPV16-infected cancer cell line, CaSki, harbouring several copies of HPV16 whole genome. The mechanism of down-regulation is not related to p53 transcriptional activity because in SAOS (p53-null) cell line, the restoration of p53 expression did not rescue OCTN2 expression. The treatment of keratinocytes retrotransduced with HPV16 E6 and E7 with 5-aza-cytidine rescued the OCTN2 expression, indicating that the mechanism of down-regulation is linked to DNA methylation. Low levels of mRNA expression of OCTN2 were found also in several nonvirus-related epithelial cancer cell lines. The treatment of those cell lines with 5-aza-cytidine again rescued the expression of OCTN2 as well. These data demonstrate for the first time that the OCTN2 transporter is generally down-regulated in virus and nonvirus-mediated epithelial cancers, probably via methylation of its promoter region.
22266381,3,2012,Clin Chem,Four-color alternating-laser excitation single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy for next-generation biodetection assays.,BACKGROUND: Single-molecule detection (SMD) technologies are well suited for clinical diagnostic applications by offering the prospect of minimizing precious patient sample requirements while maximizing clinical information content. Not yet available, however, is a universal SMD-based platform technology that permits multiplexed detection of both nucleic acid and protein targets and that is suitable for automation and integration into the clinical laboratory work flow.METHODS: We have used a sensitive, specific, quantitative, and cost-effective homogeneous SMD method that has high single-well multiplexing potential and uses alternating-laser excitation (ALEX) fluorescence-aided molecule sorting extended to 4 colors (4c-ALEX). Recognition molecules are tagged with different-color fluorescence dyes, and coincident confocal detection of ≥2 colors constitutes a positive target-detection event. The virtual exclusion of the majority of sources of background noise eliminates washing steps. Sorting molecules with multidimensional probe stoichiometries (S) and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiencies (E) allows differentiation of numerous targets simultaneously.RESULTS: We show detection, differentiation, and quantification-in a single well-of (a) 25 different fluorescently labeled DNAs; (b) 8 bacterial genetic markers, including 3 antibiotic drug-resistance determinants found in 11 septicemia-causing Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strains; and (c) 6 tumor markers present in blood.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate assay utility for clinical molecular diagnostic applications by means of multiplexed detection of nucleic acids and proteins and suggest potential uses for early diagnosis of cancer and infectious and other diseases, as well as for personalized medicine. Future integration of additional technology components to minimize preanalytical sample manipulation while maximizing throughput should allow development of a user-friendly (&quot;sample in, answer out&quot;) point-of-care platform for next-generation medical diagnostic tests that offer considerable savings in costs and patient sample.
24312796,3,2012,Adv Pharm Bull,Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of some new pyrimidine derivatives containing 1,2,4-triazole.,PURPOSE: An efficient method has been described for synthesis of 6-(substituted aryl)-4-(3,5-diphenyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-1, 6-dihydropyrimidine-2-thiol, as a beneficial antimicrobial, anticonvulsant and anticancer agents.METHODS: The clalcones of title compounds were synthesized in three steps and subsequently these chalcones were further reacted with thiourea in the presence of KOH in ethanol, which led to the formation of dihydropyrimidine derivatives (4a-j). Compounds 4a-j were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity by agar well method and their anticonvulsant activity by the MES model. Anticancer activity of two newly synthesized heterocycles were evaluated at National Cancer Institute (NCI) Maryland, USA against 60 cell lines of different human tumor at a single dose of 10(-5) M.RESULTS: Compound 4b, 4c, 4d, 4i and 4j were exhibited significant antimicrobial potential against tested strains at 50μg/ml and 100μg/ml concentrations. Out of the ten compounds studied 4a, 4b, 4c, 4h and 4j showed comparable MES activity to Phenytoin and Carbamazepine after 0.5h. Tested compounds did not showed to be more potent than standard drugs after 4h. Compound 4a and 4d were found active on Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (HOP-92).CONCLUSION: Ten noveldihydropyrimidine analogues has been synthesized, characterized and found to bepromising antibacterial, anticonvulsant and antitumor agents.
23102569,2,2012,Eur J Intern Med,Serological markers of erosive hand osteoarthritis.,This review focuses on biomarkers in erosive hand osteoarthritis (EHOA), a subset of hand osteoarthritis (HOA), that primarily affects interphalangeal joints and is characterized by abrupt onset, severe pain and functional impairment, as well as signs of inflammation, in particular stiffness, swelling, erythema, paraesthesiae, and worse outcome. Inflammatory features and radiographic erosions are the main diagnostic hallmarks of this particular disease subset. As in other fields of OA, EHOA biomarkers can be classified as dry and soluble. Soluble biomarkers which are found in serum, synovial fluid and urine can be specific indicators of joint inflammation and degradation. With regard to inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein and myeloperoxidase have been found to be increased in EHOA, with respect to non-erosive HOA. All these markers have, moreover, been found to be correlated with disease activity. Another interesting marker linked to inflammation is hyaluronic acid, considered to be a marker of synovitis, which is frequently found in EHOA. The most useful cartilage markers in both erosive and non-erosive HOA, seems to be collagen (Coll) 2-1, Coll 2-1NO(2) and Col2-3/4C(short). Immunogenetic markers were also determined and an association between EHOA and a single nucleotide polymorphism on the gene encoding interleukin-1β was found in HLA and there was an increased frequency of HLA-B44 and HLA-DRB1*07 in EHOA.
23084904,2,2012,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and antibiofilm activity of marine natural product-based 4-thiazolidinones derivatives.,4-Thiazolidinones derivatives of marine bromopyrrole alkaloids were synthesized as potential antibiofilm compounds. Among the synthesized compounds, some showed promising antibiofilm activity. Biological data revealed that 1,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives are more potent antibiofilm agents compared to 1,3-thiazinan-4-ones. Antibiofilm activity of compound 4b, 4c (MIC=0.78 μg/ml) was 3-fold superior than standard vancomycin (MIC=3.125 μg/ml) while activity of compound 4d, 4f, 4g and 4h was 2-fold (MIC=1.56 μg/ml) against Staphylococcus aureus biofilm. Compound 4b-4h showed equal antibiofilm activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis compared to standard Vancomycin (MIC=3.125 μg/ml).
23073144,2,2012,Dalton Trans,Self-assembled metalla-rectangles bearing azodipyridyl ligands: synthesis, characterization and antitumor activity.,Sixteen arene-Ru based molecular-rectangles were self-assembled in high yields by the equimolar mixing of arene-Ru acceptors (Aa-Ad) with various azopyridyl ligands (1,2-di(pyridyl-4yl)diazene (L1), 1,2-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethylene)hydrazine (L2), 1,2-bis(1-(pyridin-4-yl)ethylidene)hydrazine (L3), 1,2-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethylene)hydrazine (L4)) in nitromethane-methanol solutions. These new molecular-rectangles were fully characterized by a host of analytical techniques including elemental analysis, (1)H and (13)C NMR and HR-ESI-MS. The solid-state structures of two molecular-rectangles (1b and 4d) were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction data. UV-visible and fluorescence studies were also carried out for the entire suite of rectangles. As with recent studies of similar arene-Ru complexes, the anti-proliferative activities of these complexes were evaluated against SK-hep-1 (liver cancer) and A-549 (lung cancer) human cancer lines. Additionally, the cellular pharmacology and intracellular localizations in AGS (gastric cancer) human cancer cells were determined for selected complexes (1c, 1d and 4c) by apoptosis and fluorescence microscopy studies. These studies confirm that arene-Ru molecular-rectangles inhibit cell cycle progression to the G0 phase, in contrast to that of cisplatin which arrests cell growth in the G2 phase.
22984562,2,2012,PLoS One,Mining gene expression signature for the detection of pre-malignant melanocytes and early melanomas with risk for metastasis.,BACKGROUND: Metastatic melanoma is a highly aggressive skin cancer and currently resistant to systemic therapy. Melanomas may involve genetic, epigenetic and metabolic abnormalities. Evidence is emerging that epigenetic changes might play a significant role in tumor cell plasticity and metastatic phenotype of melanoma cells.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we developed a systematic approach to identify genes implicated in melanoma progression. To do this, we used the Affymetrix GeneChip Arrays to screen 34,000 mouse transcripts in melan-a melanocytes, 4C pre-malignant melanocytes, 4C11- non-metastatic and 4C11+ metastatic melanoma cell lines. The genome-wide association studies revealed pathways commonly over-represented in the transition from immortalized to pre-malignant stage, and under-represented in the transition from non-metastatic to metastatic stage. Additionally, the treatment of cells with 10 µM 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AzaCdR) for 48 hours allowed us to identify genes differentially re-expressed at specific stages of melan-a malignant transformation. Treatment of human primary melanocytes with the demethylating agent 5AzaCdR in combination to the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) revealed changes on melanocyte morphology and gene expression which could be an indicator of epigenetic flexibility in normal melanocytes. Moreover, changes on gene expression recognized by affecting the melanocyte biology (NDRG2 and VDR), phenotype of metastatic melanoma cells (HSPB1 and SERPINE1) and response to cancer therapy (CTCF, NSD1 and SRC) were found when Mel-2 and/or Mel-3-derived patient metastases were exposed to 5AzaCdR plus TSA treatment. Hierarchical clustering and network analyses in a panel of five patient-derived metastatic melanoma cells showed gene interactions that have never been described in melanomas.SIGNIFICANCE: Despite the heterogeneity observed in melanomas, this study demonstrates the utility of our murine melanoma progression model to identify molecular markers commonly perturbed in metastasis. Additionally, the novel gene expression signature identified here may be useful in the future into a model more closely related to translational research.
22927006,2,2012,Learn Behav,Performance factors in associative learning: assessment of the sometimes competing retrieval model.,Previous simulations revealed that the sometimes competing retrieval model (SOCR; Stout &amp; Miller, Psychological Review, 114, 759-783, 2007), which assumes local error reduction, can explain many cue interaction phenomena that elude traditional associative theories based on total error reduction. Here, we applied SOCR to a new set of Pavlovian phenomena. Simulations used a single set of fixed parameters to simulate each basic effect (e.g., blocking) and, for specific experiments using different procedures, used fitted parameters discovered through hill climbing. In simulation 1, SOCR was successfully applied to basic acquisition, including the overtraining effect, which is context dependent. In simulation 2, we applied SOCR to basic extinction and renewal. SOCR anticipated these effects with both fixed parameters and best-fitting parameters, although the renewal effects were weaker than those observed in some experiments. In simulation 3a, feature-negative training was simulated, including the often observed transition from second-order conditioning to conditioned inhibition. In simulation 3b, SOCR predicted the observation that conditioned inhibition after feature-negative and differential conditioning depends on intertrial interval. In simulation 3c, SOCR successfully predicted failure of conditioned inhibition to extinguish with presentations of the inhibitor alone under most circumstances. In simulation 4, cue competition, including blocking (4a), recovery from relative validity (4b), and unblocking (4c), was simulated. In simulation 5, SOCR correctly predicted that inhibitors gain more behavioral control than do excitors when they are trained in compound. Simulation 6 demonstrated that SOCR explains the slower acquisition observed following CS-weak shock pairings.
22915481,2,2012,Am J Sports Med,Arthroscopic collagen meniscus implantation for partial lateral meniscal defects: a 2-year minimum follow-up study.,BACKGROUND: Loss of knee meniscal tissue often leads to increased pain and decreased function.HYPOTHESIS: At a minimum 2-year follow-up, patients receiving a lateral collagen meniscus implant (CMI) would show improved knee function and decreased pain compared with their preoperative status.STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.METHODS: Twenty-four patients with irreparable lateral meniscal tears (n = 7) or previous partial lateral meniscectomy (n = 17) underwent arthroscopic lateral collagen meniscus implantation. Clinical evaluation was performed preoperatively, at 6 months, and at a minimum 2-year follow-up with Lysholm, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, Tegner, objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) scores. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation was performed preoperatively and at final follow-up using the modified Yulish score for cartilage and the Genovese score for implant size and signal intensity.RESULTS: All clinical scores significantly improved from preoperative evaluation to final follow-up. Average Lysholm scores improved from 64.0 ± 16.2 to 92.7 ± 13.8 (P &lt; .0001), VAS for pain from 55.2 ± 29.4 to 19.5 ± 25.6 (P &lt; .0001), Tegner from 3 (interquartile range, 2-4) to 5 (interquartile range, 4-7) (P = .0062), objective IKDC from 6A, 14B, 4C to 20A, 3B, 1D (P = .0002), and EQ-5D from 0.58 ± 0.28 to 0.89 ± 0.14 (P &lt; .0001). Good to excellent (A + B) objective IKDC scores improved from 83% preoperatively to 96% at 2-year follow-up. The Tegner index (the percentage of the lost activity level that was regained as a result of the treatment intervention) was 47% at 6-month follow-up and 79% at 2-year follow-up: this improvement was statistically significant (P = .0062). The MRI evaluations for tibial and femoral modified Yulish scores for cartilage remained similar over the course of the study; 87.5% of implants were reduced in size, and in 3 cases (12.5%), they were completely resorbed; 50% of the implants had a slightly hyperintense signal (relative to the normal meniscus), and signal intensity changes suggested that full maturation had occurred in 37.5% at final follow-up (based on the Genovese scores).CONCLUSION: The lateral CMI demonstrated that it was safe in this population study, with decreased pain and improved knee function in 96% of patients with excellent/good Lysholm results in 87% of patients at a minimum 2-year follow-up. The MRI scans demonstrated a decreased implant size relative to a normal meniscus.
22873702,2,2012,J Org Chem,NA,The Jocic-Reeve and Corey-Link type reaction of dichloromethyllithium with suitably protected 5-keto-hexofuranoses followed by treatment with sodium azide and sodium borohydride reduction gave 5-azido-5-hydroxylmethyl substituted hexofuranoses 7a-c with required geminal dihydroxymethyl group. Removal of protecting groups and converting the C-1 anomeric carbon into free hemiacetal followed by intramolecular reductive aminocyclization with in situ generated C5-amino functionality afforded corresponding 5C-dihydroxymethyl piperidine iminosugars 2a-c. Alternatively, removal of protecting groups in 7b and 7c and chopping of C1-anomeric carbon gave C2-aldehyde that on intramolecular reductive aminocyclization with C5-amino gave 4C-dihydroxymethyl pyrrolidine iminosugars 1b and 1c, respectively. On the basis of the (1)H NMR studies, the conformations of 2a/2b were assigned as (4)C(1) and that of 2c as (1)C(4). The glycosidase inhibitory activities of all five iminosugars were studied with various glycosidase enzymes and compared with natural d-gluco-1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ). All the five compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of rice α-glucosidase with K(i) and IC(50) values in the nanomolar concentration range. Iminosugars 2b and 1b were found to be more potent inhibitors than their parent iminosugar. These results were substantiated by in silico molecular docking studies.
22739043,2,2012,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,Epidemiological, parasitological and molecular aspects of Giardia duodenalis infection in children attending public daycare centers in southeastern Brazil.,The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, associated risk factors and genotype of Giardia duodenalis infection in children attending public daycare centers in the city of Araguari, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Fecal samples were collected from 245 children aged 0-5 years, and questionnaires were asked about sociodemographic and hygiene-related characteristics. At the daycare centers where children tested positive, fecal samples were collected from the staff handling food, and from family members and domestic animals. Positive samples were analyzed at the dehydrogenase glutamate (gdh) locus to determine the genotype. The prevalence of G. duodenalis was 51.8%, and drinking unfiltered and unboiled water (OR 2.12, CI 1.26-3.69, p&lt;0.001) and washing hands only with water (OR 2.14, CI 1.19-4.04, p&lt;0.001) were related risk factors. No association was found between test-positive children and their family members, domestic animals and food handlers. An analysis of the sequences of 30 samples revealed that they all belonged to genotype B.
22732060,2,2012,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial studies of some new quinoline incorporated benzimidazole derivatives.,Two new series of quinoline incorporated benzimidazole derivatives (4a-i and 8a-f) were synthesized from substituted aniline and isatin through multi-step reaction. 6-substituted-4-carboxyquinolines (3a,b and 7) were synthesized by multi component one pot reactions (via Doebner reaction and Pfitzinger reaction respectively) and the targeted benzimidazole derivatives were obtained by the reaction of 6-substituted-4-carboxyquinolines (3a,b and 7) with substituted aromatic diamines in acidic media. All the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, NMR mass spectral study and also by C, H, N analyses. The final compounds were screened for their in-vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity by well plate method (zone of inhibition). The results revealed that, compounds 4c, 4d, 8c and 8d showed significant antibacterial activity. The compound 8b was found to be potent antifungal agent. 4a, 8a and 8f showed moderate to good antimicrobial activity as compared to the standard drugs against all tested microbial strains.
22704656,2,2012,Bioorg Med Chem,Analogs of N'-hydroxy-N-(4H,5H-naphtho[1,2-d]thiazol-2-yl)methanimidamide inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis methionine aminopeptidases.,Our previous target validation studies established that inhibition of methionine aminopeptidases (MtMetAP, type 1a and 1c) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an effective approach to suppress Mtb growth in culture. A novel class of MtMetAP1c inhibitors comprising of N'-hydroxy-N-(4H,5H-naphtho[1,2-d]thiazol-2-yl)methanimidamide (4c) was uncovered through a high-throughput screen (HTS). A systematic structure-activity relationship study (SAR) yielded variants of the hit, 4b, 4h, and 4k, bearing modified A- and B-rings as potent inhibitors of both MtMetAPs. Except methanimidamide 4h that showed a moderate Mtb inhibition, a desirable minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was not obtained with the current set of MtMetAP inhibitors. However, the SAR data generated thus far may prove valuable for further tuning of this class of inhibitors as effective anti-tuberculosis agents.
22622699,2,2012,Pediatr Infect Dis J,Immunogenicity and safety of two tetravalent (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella) vaccines coadministered with hepatitis a and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines to children twelve to fourteen months of age.,BACKGROUND: This study compared single-dose tetravalent measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, Priorix-Tetra, stored refrigerated (GSK+4C) or frozen (GSK-20C), with ProQuad (Merck-20C), when coadministered with hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7).METHODS: Multicenter, observer-blind phase 2 study in 1783 healthy 12-14 month olds randomized to: GSK+4C (n = 705), GSK-20C (n = 689) or Merck-20C (n = 389), administered concomitantly with HAV (Havrix) and PCV7 (Prevnar). Seroresponse rates and antibody geometric mean concentrations/titers were determined from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assays. Reactogenicity and safety were assessed.RESULTS: Seroresponse rates (day 42) were &gt;97% for measles and rubella viruses and &gt;92% for mumps virus, in all groups. Noninferiority of both GSK+4C and GSK-20C vaccines versus Merck-20C was demonstrated for seroresponse rates to measles, mumps and rubella viruses (lower 97.5% confidence interval above -5%, -10% and -5%, respectively). For varicella-zoster virus, seroresponse rates were 57.1%, 69.8% and 86.7% in the GSK+4C, GSK-20C and Merck-20C groups, respectively. Noninferiority was not shown for either GSK vaccine (lower 97.5% confidence intervals &lt;-15%). Geometric mean concentration ratios for anti-varicella-zoster virus demonstrated noninferiority (lower 97.5% confidence interval ≥ 0.5) versus Merck-20C for GSK-20C only. Geometric mean concentration ratios for antibodies to HAV and to PCV7 pneumococcal serotypes also met criteria for noninferiority for both GSK groups compared with Merck-20C. GSK vaccine safety was observed comparable to Merck-20C. Localized but not generalized measles/rubella-like rash and grade 3 fever was reported slightly more frequently with GSK vaccines, but antipyretic use was similar. The incidence of subjects experiencing at least 1 serious adverse event was 2.0%, 2.9% and 1.8% in the GSK+4C, GSK-20C and Merck-20C groups, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Noninferiority of both GSK measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccines versus Merck-20C was demonstrated for responses to measles, mumps and rubella viruses but was not fully demonstrated for varicella-zoster virus. The vaccines showed acceptable reactogenicity/safety when coadministered with HAV and PCV7.
22583563,2,2012,Br J Nutr,Genetic and environmental predictors of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations among middle-aged and elderly Chinese in Singapore.,Vitamin D is known for maintaining Ca homeostasis and bone structure, and may also decrease susceptibility to chronic and infectious diseases. However, data on vitamin D status and its predictors among Southeast Asian populations are limited. We evaluated the distribution and determinants (genetic and environmental) of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations among 504 middle-aged and elderly participants (aged 45-74 years) in the Singapore Chinese Health Study. Data on dietary and other lifestyle factors were collected by trained interviewers. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations and genetic polymorphisms in vitamin D metabolism pathway enzymes (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2R1, 3A4, 27B1, 24A1; vitamin D binding protein (also known as group-specific component, GC); and vitamin D receptor) were measured using stored biospecimens. Mean 25(OH)D concentration was 68·8 nmol/l. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were positively associated with dietary vitamin D intake, and inversely associated with hours spent sitting at work. BMI was not associated with 25(OH)D concentrations. CYP2R1 rs10741657, rs12794714, rs1993116; CYP3A4 rs2242480; and GC rs4588, rs7041, rs16847015, rs2298849 were statistically significantly associated with 25(OH)D concentrations. Individuals with the Gc2-2 haplotype (rs4588AA/rs7041TT) had statistically significantly lower 25(OH)D concentrations compared to all other Gc haplotypes (P-trend &lt; 0·001). The majority of participants (86 %) had 25(OH)D concentrations ≥ 50 nmol/l, which is consistent with the 2011 Institute of Medicine (US) recommendation for bone health, and 32 % had concentrations of ≥ 75 nmol/l that are thought to be required for broader health effects. Dietary vitamin D intake, hours spent indoors at work and genetic variation in CYP2R1, CYP3A4 and GC are significant predictors of 25(OH)D concentrations among Singapore Chinese.
22451725,2,2012,J Exp Bot,Synchronously developing collet hairs in Arabidopsis thaliana provide an easily accessible system for studying nuclear movement and endoreduplication.,Early Arabidopsis thaliana seedling growth includes the highly synchronous development of hairs from every epidermal cell of the collet (the root-hypocotyl transition zone). The dynamics of collet hair growth, and accompanying nuclear movement and endoreduplication, were followed using a combination of different fluorescent probes for time-lapse imaging and flow cytometry. Using laser-scanning confocal microscopy on the double-transgenic Arabidopsis hybrid line NLS-GFP-GUS × YPM, there appeared to be a correlation between nuclear position and the cell tip during growth of the collet hair cells, as occurs in asynchronously developing root hairs. However, disruption of nuclear movement in the growing collet hairs using low concentrations of cytoskeletal inhibitors demonstrated that nuclear positioning close to the tip of the cell is not essential for tip-directed growth of the hair. Nuclear DNA content increases from 4C to 16C during development of the collet hairs. Following cessation of growth, nuclei moved to the base of the hairs and then their movement became asynchronous and limited. Co-visualization of RFP-highlighted prevacuolar vesicles and GFP-labelled nuclei showed that, whereas small vesicles allowed unimpeded nuclear movement within the hair, transient stops and directional reversals coincided with the presence of larger vesicles in close proximity to the nucleus. Arabidopsis collet hairs provide a robust, easily accessible, naturally synchronized population of single tip-growing cells that can be used as a model cell type for studying nuclear movement and endoreduplication.
22346792,2,2012,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,Terbium (lithium zinc) distannide, TbLi(1-x)Zn(x)Sn(2) (x = 0.2).,The new terbium (lithium zinc) distannide, TbLi(1-x)Zn(x)Sn(2) (x = 0.2) crystallizes in the ortho-rhom-bic CeNiSi(2) structure type with space group Cmcm and Pearson symbol oS16. Of the four independent 4c atom positions (m2m site symmetry), three are fully occupied by individual atoms (two by Sn and one by Tb atoms) and the fourth is occupied by Li and Zn atoms with a statistical distribution. The Tb coordination polyhedron is a 21-vertex pseudo-Frank-Kasper polyhedron. One Sn atom is enclosed in a tricapped trigonal prism, the second Sn atom is in a cubocta-hedron and the statistically distributed (Li,Zn) site is in a tetra-gonal anti-prism with one added atom. Electronic structure calculations were used for the elucidation of reasons for and the ability of mutual substitution of lithium and transition metals. Positive charge density was observed around the rare earth atom and the Li and Zn atoms, the negative charge density in the proximity of the Sn atoms.
23207554,1,2012,Dalton Trans,The interaction of molybdenum pentachloride with carbonyl compounds.,The reactions of MoCl(5), 1, with small amounts of a series of carbonyl compounds in a chlorinated solvent were investigated. The chloroiminium salts [ClCH=NEt(2)][Mo(O)Cl(4){O=C(H)NEt(2)}], 2a, and [ClC=NH(CH(2))(4)CH(2)][Mo(O)Cl(4){O=CNH(CH(2))(4)CH(2)}], 2b, were obtained by a selective 1 : 2 molar reaction of 1 with, respectively, N,N-diethylformamide or ε-caprolactam. Otherwise 1 reacted with tetra-N-alkyl ureas in a 1 : 2 ratio to give the Mo(IV) mononuclear complexes MoCl(4)(urea)(2) [urea = (Me(2)N)(2)CO, 3a; urea = (Et(2)N)(2)CO, 3b; urea = (EtPhN)(2)CO, 3c] in high yields. Addition of 2 equiv. of ketones to 1 resulted in clean formation of equimolar amounts of MoOCl(3)(O=CR(2)) (R = Me, 4a; R = Et, 4b; R = Ph, 4c) and R(2)CCl(2). Analogously 1,2-C(6)H(4)(Me)(CHCl(2)) was produced from MoCl(5) and ortho-tolyaldehyde. The reactions of 1 with 1H-indole-2,3-dione (isatin) took place with selective chlorination of the carbonyl function non-adjacent to the nitrogen: the complexes MoOCl(3)(3,3-dichloro-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-2-one)(2), 5a, and MoOCl(3)(isatin)(3,3-dichloro-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-2-one), 5b, were isolated depending on the stoichiometry employed. The X-ray molecular structures of 2b, 3b, 4b, 5a and 5b were ascertained.
23183309,1,2012,Infect Genet Evol,Comparison of hepatitis E virus genotypes from rabbits and pigs in the same geographic area: no evidence of natural cross-species transmission between the two animals.,Domesticated pigs have been shown to be a reservoir of genotypes 3 and 4 hepatitis E virus (HEV). Farmed rabbits were recently recognized as the host of a novel virus, rabbit HEV. In order to determine whether HEV is transmitted naturally between rabbits and pigs, a survey on HEV infections was conducted in rabbits and pigs aged 2-4 months from rabbit and pig farms located near to each other in nine villages in three counties of Hebei Province, China. The overall anti-HEV antibody positivity rates in serum samples of swine and rabbits were 61.7% (58/94) and 23.2% (67/289), and the positive rates for HEV RNA were 23.4% (22/94) and 10% (29/289), respectively. In addition, 37 of 125 swine fecal samples (29.6%) were HEV RNA positive. The nucleotide sequences of a 304 bp region within HEV ORF2 have identity ranging from 84.5% to 100% among the rabbit isolates and from 82.3% to 100% among the swine isolates. In contrast, the nucleotide identity between the two species groups was only 72-76.6%. Consequently, the two groups were clearly separated in the phylogenetic tree that showed all of the rabbit isolates are closely related to the rabbit HEV reported recently and the swine isolates belong to genotype 4, including subgenotypes 4a, 4c and 4d. The results showed that HEV is highly prevalent in farmed rabbits and pigs in these areas. However, genotype 4 HEV and rabbit HEV are circulating separately in pigs and rabbits in the same area. In conclusion, there was no evidence of cross-species transmission of HEV between pigs and rabbits. The frequency of HEV transmission events between these two animal species is likely low in commercial farms.
23180011,1,2012,Radiol Phys Technol,Diagrams for the Leksell Gamma Knife 4C automatic positioning system accessible shot coordinates.,We have developed a graphic representation (APS shot-range diagrams) of achievable shot coordinates with the automatic positioning system (APS) for Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery. We formulated a mathematical relationship between the APS coordinate system and the Leksell frame coordinate system (frame-system) by considering the relative translation and rotation. Using the transformation equations, we calculated the Y-Z coordinate domain in the frame-system (domain B), which corresponds to the known coordinate domain achievable in the APS coordinate system (domain A). APS shot-range diagrams were presented by overlaying of domain B over domain A so that one can easily visualize the achievable shot coordinates with APS for various gamma angles. Domains A and B are identical for a 90° gamma angle, but they are different for other gamma angles. Applications of the diagrams to clinical cases, in which Leksell GammaPlan treatment planning software automatically set some of the shots in a treatment plan as trunnion shots because of the APS coordinate limit, enabled us to avoid the trunnion shots, and consequently to achieve much faster treatment delivery. In conclusion, APS shot-range diagrams can be used for achieving more efficient treatment delivery by avoiding unnecessary trunnion shots with a Gamma Knife unit equipped with the APS.
23136068,1,2012,Cytometry A,Endoreduplication intensity as a marker of seed developmental stage in the Fabaceae.,Flow cytometry (FCM) can be used to study cell cycle activity in developing, mature and germinating seeds. It provides information about a seed's physiological state and therefore can be used by seed growers for assessing optimal harvest times and presowing treatments. Because an augmented proportion of 4C nuclei usually is indicative of high mitotic activity, the 4C/2C ratio is commonly used to follow the progress of seed development and germination. However, its usefulness for polysomatic (i.e., containing cells with different DNA content) seeds is questioned. Changes in cell cycle/endoreduplication activity in developing seeds of five members of the Fabaceae were studied to determine a more suitable marker of seed developmental stages for polysomatic species based on FCM measurements. Seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris, Medicago sativa, Pisum sativum, Vicia sativa, and Vicia faba var. minor were collected 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 days after flowering (DAF), embryos were isolated and the proportion of nuclei with different DNA contents in the embryo axis and cotyledon was established. The ratios 4C/2C and (Σ&gt;2C)/2C were calculated. Dried seeds were subjected to laboratory germination tests following international seed testing association (ISTA) rules. Additionally, the absolute nuclear DNA content was estimated in the leaves of the studied species. During seed development nuclei with DNA contents from 2C to 128C were detected; the endopolyploidy pattern depended on the species, seed organ and developmental stage. The cell cycle/endoreduplication parameters correlated negatively with genome size. The (Σ&gt;2C)/2C ratio in the cotyledons reflected the seed developmental stage and corresponded with seed germinability. Therefore, this ratio is recommended as a marker in polysomatic seed research and production instead of the 4C/2C ratio, which does not consider the occurrence of endopolyploid cells.
23091721,1,2012,Chemother Res Pract,Antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies: applications in colorectal cancer.,Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have a poor prognosis and present a challenge to clinicians. The role of the antiepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway in tumorogenesis and tumor progression has been well defined. This paper will review the use of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of operable, as well as metastatic colorectal cancer both in the setting of KRAS mutation unselected patients and later in KRAS wild-type patients. Active investigations designed to further identify predictive biomarkers that may be potentially druggable are reviewed as well.
23036953,1,2012,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Novel 3-substituted-1-aryl-5-phenyl-6-anilinopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ones: docking, synthesis and pharmacological evaluation as a potential anti-inflammatory agents.,Novel 3-substituted-1-aryl-5-phenyl-6-anilino-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ones of pharmacological significance were synthesized by the reaction of ethyl-(5-amino-3-methylthio-1-aryl-5-phenyl-2H-pyrazole)-4-carboxylates 3a-c with S-methyl diphenyl thiourea independently to produce 1-aryl-3-thiomethyl-5-phenyl-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines 4a-c in DMF with catalytic amount of K(2)CO(3), which on further treatment with different aromatic amines independently under same reaction conditions generated for compounds 5a-l. The compounds were screened for the anti-inflammatory activity and evaluated for ulcerogenic potential. The compounds 5i exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activity in comparison with diclofenac sodium and comparable activity with celecoxib at a dose of 25mg/kg. The other compounds 4c, 5c, 5f and 5l were found as active with inhibition of edema in the range of 35-39 after 3 h of administration of test compounds. The ulcerogenic potential of active compounds was observed to be quite lesser as compared to standard. COX-2 docking score of the active compound 5i was found to be better than standard celecoxib.
23010079,1,2012,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Is collagen fiber damage the cause of early softening in articular cartilage?,OBJECTIVE: Because collagen damage and cartilage softening have not yet been determined simultaneously in one study for the very early onset of osteoarthritis (OA), it remains questionable whether they are associated. The aim of the present study is therefore to evaluate whether indeed, initial collagen damage can be found when tissue softening occurs as a result of excessive mechanical loading.METHODS: To investigate this aim, a series of specific indentation loading protocols were designed to induce and monitor cartilage softening in osteochondral explants of bovine carpometacarpal joints. The experiment contained one control group (n = 6) in which no damage was induced and four experimental groups in which samples received either a constant load of 3 (n = 5), 6 (n = 5) or 15 N (n = 6), or an increasing load (n = 7) from 2 to 13 N in 11 steps. Moreover, to determine mechanically induced collagen damage, Col2-3/4M (cumulative collagen damage) and Col2-3/4C(short) (only enzymatic damage) staining were compared.RESULTS: The normalized peak and equilibrium reaction forces decreased in the groups that received increasing and 15 N peak loading. However, Col2-3/4M staining was negative in all samples, while enzymatic damage (Col2-3/4C(short)) appeared similar in experiments and in unloaded control groups.CONCLUSION: It was shown that a loading magnitude threshold exists above which softening occurs in cartilage. However, in samples that did show softening, we were unable to detect collagen damage. Thus, our results demonstrate that cartilage softening most likely precedes collagen damage.
23009169,1,2012,J Med Chem,Development of oseltamivir phosphonate congeners as anti-influenza agents.,Oseltamivir phosphonic acid (tamiphosphor, 3a), its monoethyl ester (3c), guanidino-tamiphosphor (4a), and its monoethyl ester (4c) are potent inhibitors of influenza neuraminidases. They inhibit the replication of influenza viruses, including the oseltamivir-resistant H275Y strain, at low nanomolar to picomolar levels, and significantly protect mice from infection with lethal doses of influenza viruses when orally administered with 1 mg/kg or higher doses. These compounds are stable in simulated gastric fluid, liver microsomes, and human blood and are largely free from binding to plasma proteins. Pharmacokinetic properties of these inhibitors are thoroughly studied in dogs, rats, and mice. The absolute oral bioavailability of these compounds was lower than 12%. No conversion of monoester 4c to phosphonic acid 4a was observed in rats after intravenous administration, but partial conversion of 4c was observed with oral administration. Advanced formulation may be investigated to develop these new anti-influenza agents for better therapeutic use.

Inter-cube distances of 9.873 (2) and 12.376 (3) Å are observed.
22960694,1,2012,Eur J Med Chem,2,6-Disubstituted imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazoles: search for anticancer agents.,In this study, some novel 2,6-disubstituted imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazoles 4 (a-i), 7 (a-p) and 11 (a-i) were synthesized from 5-substituted-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amine. The newly synthesized compounds 4a, 4b, 4c, 4e, 4g, 7j, 7l, 11b and 11c were evaluated in the National Cancer Institute for single dose in vitro primary cytotoxicity assay. Among the tested nine compounds, compound 4b (107166/760239) and 4c (107168/760240) were passed the criteria for activity in this assay and scheduled automatically for evaluation against the full panel of 60 human tumor cell lines at a minimum of five concentrations at 10-fold dilutions. 3-(2-(4-methoxyphenyl)imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-6-yl)aniline (4c) exhibited significant in vitro anticancer activity against Non Small Cell Lung Cancer HOP-92 cell line (GI(50): 0.114 μM) and Renal Cancer CAKI-1 cell line (GI(50): 0.743 μM).
22950825,1,2012,J Neurogenet,Clinical, in silico, and experimental evidence for pathogenicity of two novel splice site mutations in the SH3TC2 gene.,Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy is the most common inherited neuromuscular disorder. CMT is genetically very heterogeneous. Mutations in the SH3TC2 gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 4C (CMT4C), a demyelinating form with autosomal recessive inheritance. In this study, two novel splice site mutations in the SH3TC2 gene have been studied (c.279G → A, c.3676-8G → A). Mutation c.279G → A was detected on one allele in two unrelated families with CMT4C in combination with a known pathogenic mutation (c.2860 C →T in one family, c.505T → C in the other) on the second allele of SH3TC2 gene. Variant c.3676-8G → A was detected in two patients from unrelated families on one allele of the SH3TC2 gene in combination with c.2860C →T mutation on the other allele. Several in silico tests were performed and exon trap experiments were undertaken in order to prove the effect of both mutations on proper splicing of SH3TC2. Fragments of SH3TC2 were subcloned into pET01 exon trap vector (Mobitec) and transfected into COS-7 cells. Aberrant splicing was predicted in silico for both mutations, which was confirmed by exon trap analysis. For c.279G → A mutation, 19 bases from intron 3 are retained in cDNA. The mutation c.3676-8G→ A produces a novel splice acceptor site for exon 17 and complex changes in splicing were observed. We present evidence that mutations c.279G → A and c.3676-8G →A in the SH3TC2 gene cause aberrant splicing and are therefore pathogenic and causal for CMT4C.
22933047,1,2012,Arzneimittelforschung,Synthesis and pharmacological investigation of 5-substituted-3-methylsulfanyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid ethyl esters as new analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents.,PURPOSE: To synthesize a new series of 5-substituted-3-methylsulfanyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid ethyl esters for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity.METHODS: The title compound synthesized by reacting the amino group of 5-amino-3-methylsulfanyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid ethyl ester with acid anhydrides, acid chlorides and phenyl dithiocarbamates. The synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, 1H-NMR and mass spectral data; the purity of the compounds was determined by elemental analysis. The title compounds were investigated for analgesic, anti-inflammatory and ulcerogenic behaviour.RESULTS: The compound 5-benzoylamino-3-methylsulfanyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (4c) emerged as the most active compound and exhibiting imperative analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. Interestingly the test compounds showed only mild ulcerogenic potential when compared to indomethacin.CONCLUSION: The compound (4c) could serve as a lead molecule for further modification to obtain a clinically useful novel class of analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents.
22898255,1,2012,Bioorg Med Chem,Identification and synthesis of substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines as novel firefly luciferase inhibitors.,A novel firefly luciferase inhibitor (3a) with a pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine core was identified in a cell-based NF-κB luciferase reporter gene assay. It potently inhibited the firefly luciferase derived from Photinus pyralis with an IC(50) value of 0.36 ± 0.05 μM. Kinetic analysis of 3a inhibition showed that it is predominantly competitive with respect to D-luciferin and uncompetitive with respect to ATP. Therefore, several pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine analogues were prepared to further investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for luciferase inhibition. The most potent inhibitor of this series was 4c, which showed an IC(50) value of 0.06 ± 0.01 μM. In addition, molecular docking studies suggested that both 3a and 4c could be accommodated in the D-luciferin binding pocket, which is expected for a predominantly competitive inhibitor with respect to D-luciferin.
22897207,1,2012,Nucleic Acid Ther,Antiproliferative activity of novel thiopyran analogs on MCF-7 breast and HCT-15 colon cancer cells: synthesis, cytotoxicity, cell cycle analysis, and DNA-binding.,A series of 6H-thiopyran-2,3-dicarboxylate derivatives 4a-d were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against HCT-15 colon and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines using Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. The results showed that these compounds could exhibit a good cytotoxicity to both cell lines. In addition, these compounds were found to exhibit significant DNA-binding affinity. Ultraviolet-visible light (UV-Vis) spectroscopy was conducted to determine the ability of the ligand under analysis. The effect of ligand complexation on DNA structure led to overall affinity constants of K(4a)=3.5×10(4) M(-1), K(4b)=6.4×10(4) M(-1), K(4c)=3.2×10(4) M(-1), and K(4d)=2.4×10(4) M(-1). Our findings could provide new evidence showing the relationship between the chemical structure and biological activity and may be useful for the discovery of new anti-cancer drugs.
22890720,1,2012,Neurotox Res,Functional analysis of histone demethylase Jmjd2b on lipopolysaccharide-treated murine neural stem cells (NSCs).,Neural stem cell (NSC) neurogenesis is the formation of new neurons by which the brain maintains its lifelong plasticity in response to extrinsic and intrinsic changes. Here, we show the effect of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as an in vitro model of inflammation on NSCs to determine whether the inflammatory mediators can epigenetically affect NSCs and alter their proliferation and differentiation abilities. To study the effect of LPS on NSCs, we used an immortalized mouse neuroectodermal stem cell line, NE-4C. We found that Jmjd2b, histone-3 lysine-9 di-/tri-methyl (H3K9me2/3) demethylase, is functional following LPS treatment and is crucial in multiple signaling pathways and biological processes. The global gene expression levels were detected in Jmjd2b-knockdown (kd) NE-4C cells and in LPS-stimulated Jmjd2b-kd NE-4C cells using an Affymetrix GeneChip(®) Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. In addition, the datasets were analyzed using MetaCore Pathway Analysis (GeneGo). The attenuation of Jmjd2b in NE-4C cells significantly affected the p65, iNOS, Bcl2, and TGF-β expression levels and had downstream effects on related signaling pathways. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that Jmjd2b-kd could inhibit the Notch1, IL-1β, and IL-2 genes by recruiting repressive H3K9me3 to their promoters. Moreover, this study highlights Jmjd2b role in LPS-mediated inflammation, which suggests an epigenetic regulation in NE-4C cells. Finally, this study establishes novel Jmjd2b targets that potentiate a biological rationale involving Jmjd2b in NSC inflammation.
22785354,1,2012,J Reprod Dev,Autophagy influences maternal mRNA degradation and apoptosis in porcine parthenotes developing in vitro.,Autophagy, an essential process for cellular maintenance, cell viability, and development, is the bulk degradation of proteins and organelles. This study investigated the expression levels of autophagy-related genes and the effect of 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) or rapamycin (an autophagy inducer) on maternal gene degradation and apoptosis in porcine parthenotes developing in vitro. LC3, which is essential for the formation of autophagosomes, was widely expressed in porcine parthenotes. High levels of autophagy-related genes, Atg5, Beclin1 and Lc3 transcripts were expressed in the 1-cell (1C) stage and gradually decreased through the 2-cell (2C) to blastocyst stages. The mRNA expression of Gdf9, c-mos and cyclin B maintained high levels in 2C and 4-cell (4C) embryos treated with 3-MA compared with the control. The Bmp15 and cyclin B mRNA levels were significantly reduced in embryos treated with rapamycin compared with the control. These results suggest that autophagy influences the degradation of these maternal genes. Furthermore, 3-MA-treated embryos exhibited significantly reduced developmental rates, decreased total cell numbers and increased rates of apoptosis. Expression of Atg5, Beclin1 and Lc3 and synthesis of LC3 protein were significantly reduced at the blastocyst stage. Although rapamycin treatment did not affect the developmental rate, it decreased the cell number and increased the rate of apoptosis, and the expression of Atg5, Beclin1 and Lc3 and LC3 protein synthesis were increased. Finally, blastocysts derived following treatment with 3-MA or rapamycin exhibited significantly decreased expression of selected transcription factors, including Pou5f1, Sox2 and Nanog. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that autophagy influences maternal mRNA degradation and apoptosis at the blastocyst stage and suggest that autophagy plays an important role in early embryo development in the pig.
22677317,1,2012,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Symmetrical approach of spiro-pyrazolidinediones as acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors.,Spiro-pyrazolidinedione derivatives without quaternary chiral center were discovered by structure-based drug design and characterized as potent acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitors. The high metabolic stability of the spiro-pyrazolo[1,2-a]pyridazine scaffold and enhancement of the activity by incorporation of a 7-methoxy group on the benzothiophene core successfully led to the identification of compound 4c as an orally bioavailable and highly potent ACC inhibitor. Oral administration of 4c significantly decreased the values of the respiratory quotient in rats, indicating the stimulation of fatty acid oxidation.
22643354,1,2012,Molecules,Synthesis, spectroscopy, thermal analysis, magnetic properties and biological activity studies of Cu(II) and Co(II) complexes with Schiff base dye ligands.,Three azo group-containing Schiff base ligands, namely 1-{3-[(3-hydroxypropylimino) methyl]-4-hydroxyphenylazo}-4-nitrobenzene (2a), 1-{3-[(3-hydroxypropylimino) methyl]-4-hydroxyphenylazo}-2-chloro-4-nitrobenzene (2b) and 1-{3-[(3-hydroxypropylimino) methyl]-4-hydroxyphenylazo}-4-chloro-3-nitrobenzene (2c) were prepared. The ligands were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, ¹³C- and ¹H-NMR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Next the corresponding copper(II) and cobalt(II) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the physicochemical and spectroscopic methods of elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, magnetic moment measurements, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and (DSC). The room temperature effective magnetic moments of complexes are 1.45, 1.56, 1.62, 2.16, 2.26 and 2.80 B.M. for complexes 3a, 3b, 3c, 4a 4b, and 4c, respectively, indicating that the complexes are paramagnetic with considerable electronic communication between the two metal centers.
22633008,1,2012,Eur J Med Chem,Biochemical and pharmacological evaluation of 4-hydroxychromen-2-ones bearing polar C-3 substituents as anticoagulants.,The objective of this study was to investigate in vitro and in vivo anticoagulant activity of sixteen 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives bearing polar C-3 scaffolds. The activity was evaluated by measuring prothrombin time. Enhanced anticoagulant activity in vitro was observed for all tested compounds. Upon successive administration of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight to adult Wistar rats, over a period of five days, four derivatives (2b, 4c, 5c and 9c) presented anticoagulant activity in vivo. The most active compound was 2b, with PT = 30.0 s. Low or non-toxic effects in vivo were determined based on the catalytic activity of liver enzymes and the concentration of bilirubin, iron and proteins. Metabolic pathways of the most active compounds in vivo were determined after GC/MS analysis of collected rat urine samples. The excretion occurs by glucuronidation of 7-hydroxy forms of tested derivatives. In vivo results were described using PLS-based CoMFA and CoMSIA 3D-QSAR studies, which showed CoMFA-SE (q(2) = 0.738) and CoMSIA-SEA (q(2) = 0.763) to be the statistically most relevant models. Furthermore, molecular docking and DFT mechanistic studies performed on the rat VKORC1 homology model revealed interactions between the 4-OH coumarin group in the form of phenolic anion and the Cys135 catalytic site in the transition state.
22591761,1,2012,Eur J Radiol,Elastography ultrasound and questionable breast lesions: does it count?,OBJECTIVE: To check possible additional value of using elastography ultrasound in the specification of questionable breast lesions.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Questionable breast lesions on gray scale ultrasound examination had been further evaluated by elastography ultrasound in 97 cases with median age of 42 years. The studied lesions were pathologically proven (58 benign and 39 malignant) using true cut tissue/surgical excision biopsy that was considered the gold standard of reference.RESULTS: Conventional ultrasound categorization before biopsy included: category 3 (probably benign) in 42.3% (n=41), category 4a (low suspicion of malignancy) in 13.4% (n=13), category 4b (intermediate suspicion of malignancy) in 16.5% (n=16) and category 4c (moderate suspicion of malignancy) in 27.8% (n=27). We had evaluated elastography ultrasound regarding elastography strain scoring and quantitative strain ratio. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 89.7%, 86.2% and 87.6% for conventional ultrasound, 92.3%, 74.1% and 81.4% for elastogram 5-point scoring method and 87.1%, 89.6% and 88.6% for the calculated strain ratios respectively in the assessment of the examined breast lesions.CONCLUSION: Ultrasound elastography, using both qualitative and quantitative methods can improve the performance of conventional B-mode ultrasound and enhance its specificity and accuracy in the diagnosis of questionable (BI-RADS categories 3 and 4) breast lesions.

The other Mn(II) ion is six-coordinated by four O atoms from four monoanionic and dianionic ligands, one DMF mol-ecule and one water mol-ecule in a distorted octa-hedral geometry. The monoanionic and dianionic ligands bridge the Mn(II) ions, resulting in the formation of a layered structure parallel to (111) in which all of the carboxyl-ate groups of the anionic ligands coordinate the Mn(II) ions in a monodentate manner. Intra- and inter-molecular O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds are present in the structure.
22572974,1,2012,Ophthalmic Res,The effect of additional topical cyclosporine or vitamin A on the ocular surface during antiglaucoma medication administration.,PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of topical application of cyclosporine or vitamin A on the ocular surface during the concurrent administration of antiglaucoma drugs.METHODS: Thirty rabbits were randomized into 5 groups. Group 1 was administered timolol, group 2 received travoprost, group 3 received a travoprost/timolol fixed combination solution, group 4 received timolol and travoprost, and group 5 received timolol, travoprost, and dorzolamide. Each group was divided into a subgroup that received only the antiglaucoma medication (subgroup A), a subgroup that received topical cyclosporine in addition to the antiglaucoma medication (subgroup B), and a subgroup that received topical vitamin A in addition to the antiglaucoma medication (subgroup C). Conjunctival impression cytology specimens were collected at baseline and at weeks 1, 3, and 6. Conjunctival biopsy specimens were collected at week 6.RESULTS: The impression cytologic study results are as follows: statistically significant differences were found between groups 4A and 4B and between groups 4A and 4C at week 6 (p = 0.004, p = 0.006, respectively) and between groups 5A and 5B and between groups 5A and 5C at weeks 3 and 6 (p = 0.006, p = 0.008 at week 3, p = 0.003, p = 0.004 at week 6, respectively). No statistically significant differences were found between subgroup B and subgroup C in any of the groups at any of the times evaluated (p &gt; 0.05). The conjunctival biopsy specimens from groups 1, 2, and 3 showed no distortion, but groups 4A and 5A showed distortion of the conjunctival epithelial structures. Groups 4B, 4C, 5B, and 5C showed less distortion of the conjunctival epithelial structures.CONCLUSION: Administration of cyclosporine or vitamin A may reduce the adverse ocular surface changes caused by long-term administration of antiglaucoma drugs.
22549320,1,2012,Health Phys,CUSUM analyses of time-interval data for online radiation monitoring.,Three statistical control chart methods were investigated to determine the one with the highest detection probability and the best average run length (ARL). The three control charts include the Shewhart control chart of count data, cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis of count data (Poisson CUSUM), and CUSUM analysis of time-interval (time difference between two consecutive radiation pulses) data (time-interval CUSUM). The time-interval CUSUM (CUSUMti) control chart was compared with the Poisson CUSUM (CUSUMcnt) and the Shewhart control charts with experimental and simulated data. The experimental data were acquired with a DGF-4C (XIA, Inc.) system in list mode. Simulated data were obtained by using Monte Carlo techniques to obtain a random sampling of a Poisson process. All statistical algorithms were developed using R (R Development Core Team). Detection probabilities and ARLs for the three methods were compared. The time-interval CUSUM control chart resulted in a similar detection probability as that of the Poisson CUSUM control chart but had the shortest ARL at relatively higher radiation levels; e.g., about 40% shorter than the Poisson CUSUM at 10.0 counts per second (cps) (five times above the background count rate). Both CUSUM control charts resulted in a higher detection probability than that of the Shewhart control chart; e.g., 100% greater than the Shewhart control method at 4.0 cps (two times above the background count rate). In addition, when time-interval information was used, the CUSUM control chart coupled with a modified runs rule (mrCUSUMti) showed the ability to further reduce the time needed to respond to changes in radiation levels and keep the false positive rate at a required level.
22533499,1,2012,J Nurs Educ,Developing and piloting an online graduate nursing course focused on experiential learning of qualitative research methods.,Despite the turmoil of a worldwide economic crisis, the health sector remains largely understaffed, and the nursing shortage represents a major issue that jeopardizes graduate nursing education. Access to education remains a challenge, particularly in rural and remote areas. This article reports the process of developing an asynchronous online qualitative research course. This online course was piloted among 16 interdisciplinary students. Participants agreed that experiential learning was useful to understand the intricacies of qualitative research. Within this constructivist approach, students were immersed in real-life experiences, which focused on the development of skills applicable to qualitative research. Based on the findings, we suggest that constructivism and the Four-Component Instructional Design (4C/ID) model (a four-part approach for fostering the development of complex skills) represent valuable ontological and pedagogical approaches that can be used in online courses. Triangulating these two approaches is also congruent with the student-centered philosophy that underpins nursing graduate programs.
22512505,1,2012,J Med Chem,Butyl pocket formation in the vitamin D receptor strongly affects the agonistic or antagonistic behavior of ligands.,Previously, we reported that 22S-butyl-25,26,27-trinor-1α,24-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)2 represents a new class of antagonist for the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of VDR complexed with 2 showed the formation of a butyl pocket to accommodate the 22-butyl group and insufficient interactions between ligand 2 and the C-terminus of VDR. Here, we designed and synthesized new analogues 5a-c and evaluated their biological activities to probe whether agonistic activity is recovered when the analogue restores interactions with the C-terminus of VDR. Analogues 5a-c exhibited full agonistic activity in transactivation. Interestingly, 5c, which bears a 24-diethyl group, completely recovered agonistic activity, although 3c and 4c act as an antagonist and a weak agonist, respectively. The crystal structures of VDR-LBD complexed with 3a, 4a, 5a, and 5c were solved, and the results confirmed that butyl pocket formation in VDR strongly affects the agonistic or antagonistic behaviors of ligands.
22480351,1,2012,Inorg Chem,Spectroscopic characterization of active-site variants of the PduO-type ATP:corrinoid adenosyltransferase from Lactobacillus reuteri: insights into the mechanism of four-coordinate Co(II)corrinoid formation.,The PduO-type adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP):corrinoid adenosyltransferase from Lactobacillus reuteri (LrPduO) catalyzes the transfer of the adenosyl-group of ATP to Co(1+)cobalamin (Cbl) and Co(1+)cobinamide (Cbi) substrates to synthesize adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and adenosylcobinamide (AdoCbi(+)), respectively. Previous studies revealed that to overcome the thermodynamically challenging Co(2+) → Co(1+) reduction, the enzyme drastically weakens the axial ligand-Co(2+) bond so as to generate effectively four-coordinate (4c) Co(2+)corrinoid species. To explore how LrPduO generates these unusual 4c species, we have used magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic techniques. The effects of active-site amino acid substitutions on the relative yield of formation of 4c Co(2+)corrinoid species were examined by performing eight single-amino acid substitutions at seven residues that are involved in ATP-binding, an intersubunit salt bridge, and the hydrophobic region surrounding the bound corrin ring. A quantitative analysis of our MCD and EPR spectra indicates that the entire hydrophobic pocket below the corrin ring, and not just residue F112, is critical for the removal of the axial ligand from the cobalt center of the Co(2+)corrinoids. Our data also show that a higher level of coordination among several LrPduO amino acid residues is required to exclude the dimethylbenzimidazole moiety of Co(II)Cbl from the active site than to remove the water molecule from Co(II)Cbi(+). Thus, the hydrophilic interactions around and above the corrin ring are more critical to form 4c Co(II)Cbl than 4c Co(II)Cbi(+). Finally, when ATP analogues were used as cosubstrate, only &quot;unactivated&quot; five-coordinate (5c) Co(II)Cbl was observed, disclosing an unexpectedly large role of the ATP-induced active-site conformational changes with respect to the formation of 4c Co(II)Cbl. Collectively, our results indicate that the level of control exerted by LrPduO over the timing for the formation of the 4c Co(2+)corrinoid intermediates is even more exquisite than previously anticipated.
22462672,1,2012,J Peripher Nerv Syst,Characteristics of clinical and electrophysiological pattern of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4C.,To describe the clinical and electrophysiological features evoking CMT4C, an autosomal recessive (AR) form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) due to mutations in the SH3TC2 gene, we screened the coding sequence of SH3TC2 gene in 102 unrelated patients with a demyelinating or intermediate CMT and a family history compatible with an AR transmission. We identified among this cohort 16 patients carrying two mutations in the SH3TC2 gene, but medical records finally analyzed 14 patients. We report clinical, electrophysiological, and molecular data of 14 patients (9 men, 5 women) with CMT4C. Mean age at examination was 43.6 years (median = 42.5). Among the 14 studied cases 6 had scoliosis as the presenting sign. Cranial nerve involvement affecting either the VIIIth, VIIth, XIIth or a combination of the IXth and Xth nerves was noted in 10 patients. Remarkably, 50% of the patients had proximal limb involvement at the time of examination. The hallmark of the electrophysiological study was the presence of probable conduction block and temporal dispersion. Thus the clinical and paraclinical spectrum of CMT4C can guide the clinician to perform analysis of the SH3TC2 gene.
22397394,1,2012,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Synthesis and anticonvulsant activity of 3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno[1,2-c]pyrazole-2-carboxamide/carbothioamide analogues.,A series of fourteen 3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno[1,2-c]pyrazole-2-carboxamide/carbothioamide analogues were synthesized and evaluated for anticonvulsant activity according to the Antiepileptic Drug Development Programme (ADD) protocol. Some of the synthesized compounds showed significant activity in minimal clonic seizure model (6 Hz psychomotor seizure test). 3-(4-Fluorophenyl)-N-(4-bromophenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno[1,2-c]pyrazole-2-carboxamide (4c) was found to be the most active compound of the series showing 75% (3/4, 0.25-2.0 h) and 50% (2/4, 4.0 h) protection against minimal clonic seizure at 100 mg/kg without any toxicity. 3-(Pyridin-4-yl)-N-(4-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno[1,2-c]pyrazole-2-carboxamide (4f) showed protection in maximal electroshock (MES) seizure and subcutaneous metrazol (scMET) seizure at 300 mg/kg.
22380762,1,2012,Echocardiography,Assessment of echocardiographic left atrial size: accuracy of M-mode and two-dimensional methods and prediction of diastolic dysfunction.,BACKGROUND: Despite the American Society of Echocardiography recommendation to use left atrial volume indexed for body surface area (LAVI) for quantification of left atrial size, a variety of methods are used in clinical practice. Our objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of M-mode and two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic LA size estimates to LAVI and to determine their ability to predict left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.METHODS: In 150 consecutive patients, LA diameter (LAD), LA diameter indexed for body surface area (LADI), LA area in the apical two- and four-chamber views (LAA 2c and LAA 4c), biplane area-length LA volume (LAV), and LAVI were obtained. The accuracy of these methods to quantify LA enlargement by LAVI, correlation with clinical parameters, and ability to act as a surrogate for diastolic dysfunction were determined using Pearson correlation coefficients along with univariate and multiple logistic analysis.RESULTS: The true degree of LA size (with LAVI as standard) was identified by LAD in 45%, LADI in 42%, LAA 4c in 43%, and LAA 2c in 41%. All methods showed positive correlation with age, E/E', mitral regurgitation, and right atrial size and negative correlation with ejection fraction. LAVI was the strongest method to predict any (c = 0.655, P = 0.012) or moderate-severe (P = 0.856 and P &lt; 0.001) diastolic dysfunction. All methods have greater capacity to identify moderate or severe diastolic dysfunction than any degree of diastolic dysfunction alone.CONCLUSIONS: One-dimensional and 2D methods inaccurately quantify LA size and are inferior to LAVI to predict diastolic dysfunction.
22357849,1,2012,J Neurosci,Neuronal projections from V1 to V2 in amblyopia.,The mechanism of amblyopia in children with congenital cataract is not understood fully, but studies in macaques have shown that geniculate synapses are lost in striate cortex (V1). To search for other projection abnormalities in amblyopia, the pathway from V1 to V2 was examined using a triple-label technique in three animals raised with monocular suture. [(3)H]proline was injected into one eye to label the ocular dominance columns. Cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to gold (CTB-Au) was injected into V2 to label V1 projection neurons. Alternate sections were processed for cytochrome oxidase (CO) and CTB-Au, or dipped for autoradiography. Eight fields of CTB-Au-labeled cells in V1 opposite injection sites were plotted in layers 2/3 or 4B. After thin stripe injection, labeled cells were concentrated in CO patches. Despite column shrinkage, cells in deprived and normal columns were equal in size and density in both layers 2/3 and 4B. After pale or thick stripe injection, labeled cells were concentrated in interpatches. Only 23% of projection neurons originated from deprived columns. This reduction exceeded the degree of column shrinkage, a result explained by the fact that column shrinkage causes disproportionate loss of interpatch territory. These data indicate that early monocular form deprivation does not alter the segregation of patch and interpatch pathways to V2 stripes or cause selective loss or atrophy of V1 projection neurons. The effect of shrinkage of geniculocortical afferents in layer 4C following visual deprivation is not amplified further by attenuation of the amblyopic eye's projections from V1 to V2.
22357113,1,2012,Eur J Med Chem,Design, synthesis, computational and biological evaluation of some new hydrazino derivatives of DHA and pyranopyrazoles.,Two series of compounds namely, 4-aryl/heteroaryl hydrazino-3-acetyl-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-ones (4a-4j) and pyrano[4,3-c]pyrazoles (6a-6e and 6g) were synthesized starting from 3-acetyl-4-chloro-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (2). Estimation of pharmacotherapeutic potential, possible molecular mechanism of action, toxic/side effects and interaction with drug-metabolizing enzymes were made for the synthesized compounds on the basis of prediction of activity spectra for substances (PASS) prediction results and their analysis by PharmaExpert software. COX inhibition predicted by PASS was confirmed by experimental evaluation and validated via docking studies. Out of all the compounds, compounds 4h, 4j, 6e, 6g exhibited good anti-inflammatory activity, whereas compounds 4b, 4c, 4h, 4i, 4j, 6b, 6e, 6g showed excellent analgesic activity compared with standard drug Diclofenac sodium.
22322240,1,2012,Oncol Rep,Characteristic CYP2A6 genetic polymorphisms detected by TA cloning-based sequencing in Chinese digestive system cancer patients with S-1 based chemotherapy.,S-1 is an oral antitumor agent that contains tegafur, which is converted to fluorouracil (5-FU) in the human body. Cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) is the principal enzyme responsible for bioconversion of tegafur to 5-FU. A number of CYP2A6 polymorphisms have been associated with variations in enzyme activity in several ethnic populations. The CYP2A6*4C allele leads to deletion of the entire CYP2A6 gene, and is the main finding in patients with reduced CYP2A6 enzymatic activity. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate the allele frequencies of CYP2A6 polymorphisms in a population with cancer of the digestive system. We developed a simple screening method, which combined TA cloning and direct-sequencing, to detect CYP2A6 genetic polymorphisms in Chinese patients with cancers of the digestive system. A total of 77 patients with various types of digestive system cancers were screened for CYP2A6 genetic polymorphisms. The allele frequencies of CYP2A6*1A, CYP2A6*1B and CYP2A6*4C in the 77 patients screened were 62, 42 and 13%, respectively. Frequencies of the homozygous genotypes for CYP2A6*1A and CYP2A6*4C were 27 and 12%, respectively. As expected, patients that were determined to be homozygous for CYP2A6*4C exhibited the characteristic chemotherapy efficacy and toxicity profiles. The TA cloning-based direct sequencing method facilitated allele frequency and genotyping determination for CYP2A6*1A, 1B and 4C of cancer patients. The findings indicated that the population carries a high frequency of the CYP2A6*4C homozygous genotype. Thus, the reduced efficacy of standard chemotherapy dosage in Chinese cancer patients may be explained by the lack of CYP2A6-mediated S-1 bioconversion to 5-FU.
24377010,1,2012,Rep Pract Oncol Radiother,Monte Carlo simulation for Neptun 10 PC medical linear accelerator and calculations of output factor for electron beam.,AIM: Exact knowledge of dosimetric parameters is an essential pre-requisite of an effective treatment in radiotherapy. In order to fulfill this consideration, different techniques have been used, one of which is Monte Carlo simulation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used the MCNP-4C to simulate electron beams from Neptun 10 PC medical linear accelerator. Output factors for 6, 8 and 10 MeV electrons applied to eleven different conventional fields were both measured and calculated.RESULTS: The measurements were carried out by a Wellhofler-Scanditronix dose scanning system. Our findings revealed that output factors acquired by MCNP-4C simulation and the corresponding values obtained by direct measurements are in a very good agreement.CONCLUSION: In general, very good consistency of simulated and measured results is a good proof that the goal of this work has been accomplished.
23246477,0,2012,J Urol,Carbon monoxide releasing molecules inhibit cell death resulting from renal transplantation related stress.,PURPOSE: Organ cold storage and subsequent transplantation are associated with significant ischemia-reperfusion injury, leading to cell death, graft inflammation and decreased graft function.MATERIALS AND METHODS: CORM-3s reduce oxidative stress and prevent inflammation in kidneys stored at 4C and subsequently transplanted. Graft survival and function are markedly improved compared to kidneys preserved and stored in University of Wisconsin solution alone. We determined whether CORM-3 has direct antiapoptotic effects on in vitro preparations of human HUVECs exposed to anoxic conditions. We also determined whether direct administration of CORM-3 to renal grafts before and/or after cold storage would prevent renal damage during the transplantation process.RESULTS: CORM-3 supplementation led to a significantly increased frequency of live cells (mean ± SD 72.3% ± 1.9%, p &lt;0.01), reduced apoptosis (14.9% ± 6.1%, p &lt;0.01) and decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential (40.2% ± 7.2%, p &lt;0.05) in HUVECs exposed to 20 hours of cold storage compared to controls (11.6% ± 3.5%, 82.2% ± 2.3% and 78.2% ± 3.2%, respectively). In keeping with this antiapoptotic effect CORM-3 supplementation led to a mean 7.4 ± 2.1-fold up-regulation in Bcl-2 gene expression. CORM-3 supplementation in standard preservation solution was most beneficial at initial ischemic injury and before cold storage exposure. However, additional reflushing before vascular reperfusion showed an additive benefit to graft survival and function after transplantation. This was confirmed by decreased glomerular and tubular necrosis, and apoptosis in double flushed grafts.CONCLUSIONS: CORM-3 supplementation in standard University of Wisconsin solution has a significant impact on decreasing cellular and graft injury, and improving survival through its antiapoptotic effects, which are likely mediated through mitochondrial membrane stabilization.
23238708,0,2012,Dalton Trans,Dehydrogenation of secondary amines: synthesis, and characterization of rare-earth metal complexes incorporating imino- or amido-functionalized pyrrolyl ligands.,The dehydrogenation of pyrrolyl-functionalized secondary amines initiated by rare-earth metal amides was systematically studied. Reactions of the rare-earth metal amides [(Me(3)Si)(2)N](3)RE(μ-Cl)Li(THF)(3) with pyrrolyl-functionalized secondary amines 2-(t)BuNHCH(2)-5-R-C(4)H(2)NH (R = H (1), R = (t)Bu (2)) led to dehydrogenation of the secondary amines with isolation of imino-functionalized pyrrolyl rare-earth metal complexes [2-(t)BuN=CH-5-R-C(4)H(2)N](2)REN(SiMe(3))(2) (R = H, RE = Y (3a), Dy (3b), Yb (3c), Eu (3d); R = (t)Bu, RE = Y (4a), Dy (4b), Er (4c)). The mixed ligands erbium complex [2-(t)BuNCH(2)-5-(t)Bu-C(4)H(2)N]Er[2-(t)BuN=CH-5-(t)BuC(4)H(2)N](2)ClLi(2)(THF) (4c') was isolated in a short reaction time for the synthesis of complex 4c. Reaction of the deuterated pyrrolyl-functionalized secondary amine 2-((t)BuNHCHD)C(4)H(3)NH with yttrium amide [(Me(3)Si)(2)N](3)Y(μ-Cl)Li(THF)(3) further proved that pyrrolyl-amino ligands were transferred to pyrrolyl-imino ligands. Treatment of 2-((t)BuNHCH(2))C(4)H(3)NH (1) with excess (Me(3)Si)(2)NLi gave the only pyrrole deprotonated product {[η(5):η(2):η(1)-2-((t)BuNHCH(2))C(4)H(3)N]Li(2)N(SiMe(3))(2)}(2) (5), indicating that LiN(SiMe(3))(2) could not dehydrogenate the secondary amines to imines and rare-earth metal ions had a decisive effect on the dehydrogenation. The reaction of the rare-earth metal amides [(Me(3)Si)(2)N](3)RE(μ-Cl)Li(THF)(3) with 1 equiv. of more bulky pyrrolyl-functionalized secondary amine 2-[(2,6-(i)Pr(2)C(6)H(3))NHCH(2)](C(4)H(3)NH) (6) in toluene afforded the only amine and pyrrole deprotonated dinuclear rare-earth metal amido complexes {(μ-η(5):η(1)):η(1)-2-[(2,6-(i)Pr(2)C(6)H(3))NCH(2)]C(4)H(3)N]LnN(SiMe(3))(2)}(2) (RE = Nd (7a), Sm (7b), Er (7c)), no dehydrogenation of secondary amine to imine products were observed. On the basis of experimental results, a plausible mechanism for the dehydrogenation of secondary amines to imines was proposed.
23192083,0,2012,Health Phys,Bayesian analyses of time-interval data for environmental radiation monitoring.,Time-interval (time difference between two consecutive pulses) analysis based on the principles of Bayesian inference was investigated for online radiation monitoring. Using experimental and simulated data, Bayesian analysis of time-interval data [Bayesian (ti)] was compared with Bayesian and a conventional frequentist analysis of counts in a fixed count time [Bayesian (cnt) and single interval test (SIT), respectively]. The performances of the three methods were compared in terms of average run length (ARL) and detection probability for several simulated detection scenarios. Experimental data were acquired with a DGF-4C system in list mode. Simulated data were obtained using Monte Carlo techniques to obtain a random sampling of the Poisson distribution. All statistical algorithms were developed using the R Project for statistical computing. Bayesian analysis of time-interval information provided a similar detection probability as Bayesian analysis of count information, but the authors were able to make a decision with fewer pulses at relatively higher radiation levels. In addition, for the cases with very short presence of the source (&lt; count time), time-interval information is more sensitive to detect a change than count information since the source data is averaged by the background data over the entire count time. The relationships of the source time, change points, and modifications to the Bayesian approach for increasing detection probability are presented.
23186173,0,2012,Inorg Chem,Rosamine-based fluorescent sensor with femtomolar affinity for the reversible detection of a mercury ion.,A Hg(2+)-selective fluorescent sensor, RosHg, has been developed based on a rosamine platform. RosHg exhibited a ∼20-fold increase in fluorescence emission upon binding with Hg(2+), and the enhanced fluorescence was immediately decreased when glutathione was added to a solution of the Hg-RosHg complex. The dissociation constant for the Hg(2+) complex was determined to be 0.10 fM by using a set of Hg(2+)/Mg(2+)/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer solutions. Confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated that this sensor can monitor changes of the Hg(2+) level in the mitochondria of living cells.
23178255,0,2012,Steroids,Synthesis and anti-tumor evaluation of novel 25-hydroxyprotopanaxadiol analogs incorporating natural amino acids.,In the current study, derivatives of 25-hydroxyprotopanaxadiol (25-OH-PPD) were prepared and their in vitro anti-tumor activities were tested on six different human tumor cell lines by standard MTT assay. The results showed that combining an ester group combined with the presence of an amino acid moiety led to a 10-fold improved anti-tumor activity. Compound 1c exhibited the best anti-tumor activity in the in vitro assays. Compounds 2c, 3c, 4c, 5c, 6c and 8b showed better anti-tumor activities compared to the parent compound 25-OH-PPD. The current results may provide useful data for researching and developing new anti-cancer agents.
23167225,0,2012,J Heart Valve Dis,Abnormal left ventricular mechanics in isolated bicuspid aortic valve disease may be independent of aortic distensibility: 2D strain imaging study.,BACKGROUND AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we hypothesized that subclinical impairment of left ventricular (LV) mechanical function in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients is independent of valvular hemodynamics represented by valvuloarterial impedance and aortic elastic characteristics. Therefore, we aimed to test left ventricular mechanics in cases of isolated non-stenotic BAV with non-dilated aorta.METHODS: Thirty-three patients with isolated BAV exhibiting non-dilated aorta, and 25 age-and gender-matched healthy subjects were included in the study. Patients with aortic valve velocity &gt; 1.5 m/s and mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation or ascending aorta diameter &gt; 3.5 cm were excluded from the study. Aortic elasticity parameters and valvulo-arterial impedance were calculated. Strain measurements were reported as the peak longitudinal strain (LS) for four chamber (4C), long axis (LAX) and two chamber (2C) views. Strain rate (Sr) measurements were reported as the peak systolic strain rate (Sr-sm), early diastolic strain rate (Sr-em) and late diastolic strain rate (Sr-am) for 4C, LAX and 2C views.RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic diameters of the ascending aorta, aortic elastic properties (aortic strain, aortic distensibility, aortic stiffness and aortic elastic modulus), and valvulo-arterial impedances were found to be comparable between the BAV and control groups. BAV group was observed to have statistically significantly lower 4C (18.9 +/- 1.7 vs. 17.8 +/- 1.5, p = 0.02), LAX (19.7 +/- 1.7 vs. 17.7 +/- 1.3, p = 0.001) and 2C (20.1 +/- 1.8 vs. 17.7 +/- 1.2, p &lt; 0.001) peak longitudinal strain values compared with the control group. Moreover, LV-GS values were found to be significantly lower in the BAV group than in the control group (19.6 +/- 1.1 vs. 17.7 +/- 0.9, p &lt; 0.001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of Sr-sm, Sr-em ve Sr-am values in the 4C, LAX, and 2C views.CONCLUSION: BAV might affect LV systolic functions, assessed by 2D strain imaging, in a fashion independent from the valvular dynamics and aortic elasticity. This might show that BAV is not only a valvular disease, but possibly a ventricular disease as well.
23165545,0,2012,Nutr Hosp,[Methods of body composition and four compartiments model in obese school children].,INTRODUCTION: In Chile, the prevalence of obesity in schoolchildren is 21.3%. The study and individual intervention of this malnutrition, it is necessary to have not only global indicators of nutritional status, but also indicators that give information on body composition.OBJECTIVE: To compare estimates of body fat isotopic dilution, plethysmography and radiographic absorptiometry 4C model in overweight schoolchildren.METHODS: We worked with 61 obese (BMI ≥ p 95) of both sexes, between 8 and 13 years, enrolled in a school in a district of the city of Santiago. The multicompartmental body composition determination, considered isotopic dilution, plethysmography and radiographic absorptiometry. Using as a reference standard four compartment model of Fuller.RESULTS: In both sexes, the method showed better agreement with the reference of 4 compartments was isotope dilution (r = 0.98, p &lt; 0.01). In children, the isotopic dilution underestimates body fat in -0.40 kg. By contrast, DEXA and plethysmography overestimate body fat by 0.81 kg and 1.89 kg respectively. In women, all methods overestimate body fat, with less emphasis isotopic dilution value 0.46 kg, 0.52 kg after DEXA and plethysmography 1.31 kg.CONCLUSIONS: The deuterium isotopic dilution would be the most sensitive method for estimating body fat in research studies because it shows the best agreement with the gold standard multicompartmental model.
23161629,0,2012,Chem Biodivers,New tripeptide-based macrocyclic calpain inhibitors formed by N-alkylation of histidine.,Two new series of 15-membered macrocyclic peptidomimetics, in which the P1 and P3 residues of the peptide backbone are linked by a bridge containing a 1,4-disubstituted 1H-imidazole, are reported. The structure with an aldehyde at the C-terminus and the imidazole at P3, i.e., 4c, shows significant inhibitory activity against calpain 2, with an IC(50) value of 238 nM. The macrocyclic aldehyde with the imidazole at the alternative P1 position, i.e., 5c, is significantly less active. The relative activities are linked to the ability of the component macrocycles to mimic a β-strand geometry that is known to favor active-site binding. This ability is defined by conformational searches and docking studies with calpain.
23144104,0,2012,Indian Pediatr,Changes in biochemical contents of expressed breast milk on refrigerator storage.,To determine the biochemical integrity of refrigerated breast milk for 96 hours at 4C, a longitudinal observational study done with fresh milk samples. It is found that there were significant changes in pH, serum albumin and lactose concentrations in breast milk though within normal range.
23142758,0,2012,Virus Res,Engagement of new castle disease virus (NDV) matrix (M) protein with charged multivesicular body protein (CHMP) 4 facilitates viral replication.,Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes heavy economic losses to poultry industry across the globe every year. Although NDV matrix (M) protein is involved in virus budding and our previous data indicate that in ovo expression of M protein facilitates NDV replication, the underlying mechanism for the role of M protein in NDV replication is not clear. Using yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation approaches, we found that M protein interacted with host vacuolar sorting protein charged multivesicular body protein (CHMP) 4B and 4C. In addition, the colocalization of M protein and CHMP4B/C could be observed using a laser confocal scanning microscope. Knockdown of CHMP4B by siRNA or transient expression of CHMP4B/C dominant negative forms markedly inhibited NDV growth in DF-1 cells. Thus, cellular CHMP4s play a critical role in NDV replication.
23132042,0,2012,Dalton Trans,Palladium, iridium and ruthenium complexes with acyclic imino-N-heterocyclic carbenes and their application in aqua-phase Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction and transfer hydrogenation.,Palladium (4a–4c), iridium (5a–5c) and ruthenium (6a–6c) complexes have been prepared by in situ transmetalation from the corresponding silver complexes of acyclic imino-functionalized imidazolium chlorides [1-(Me)-imidazolium-3-{C(p-CH(3)-Ph)=N(Ar)}]Cl (3) (Ar = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl (3a), 2,6-diisopropylphenyl (3b) and phenyl (3c)) with [Pd(COD)Cl(2)], [Cp*IrCl(2)](2) or [Ru(p-cymene)Cl(2)](2), respectively. Iridium and ruthenium complexes, 5a[PF(6)]–5c[PF(6)], 6a[PF(6)]–6c[PF(6)], 6c[BF(4)], 6c[BPh(4)] and 6c[NTf(2)], were obtained directly from 5a–5c and 6a–6c through an anion-exchange process with KPF(6), NaBF(4), NaBPh(4) and LiNTf(2) (bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium), respectively. All complexes were characterized by FT-IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Crystal structures of 4a, 5a and 6c[NTf(2)], and show that five-membered chelate ring is formed in these complexes by the coordination of the carbene carbon and the imino nitrogen atom, and the latter two are cationic compounds with Cl(-) and NTf(2)(-) as counteranion respectively. The catalytic performance of Pd complexes for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions in pure water and Ir and Ru complexes for transfer hydrogenation of ketones and imines was tested in a wide scope of substrates. Pd complex 4b with the largest steric hinder exhibited the best performance to gain moderate to excellent yields on catalyzing Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of aryl chlorides and arylboronic acids in water. While in transfer hydrogenation of various ketones, all the Ir and Ru complexes were effective with good to excellent yields. Among all these complexes, 6c[PF(6)] was found most effective, and moderate yields could be obtained even in the transfer hydrogenation of imines. Moreover, different counteranions of Ru complexes are influential on catalyzing the transfer hydrogenation, with the sequence of PF(6)(-) ≈ BF(4)(-) &gt; BPh(4)(-) &gt; Cl(-) &gt; NTf(2)(-).
23098517,0,2012,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Clinical outcome of breast cancer BI-RADS 4 lesions during 2003-2008 in the National Cancer Institute Thailand.,To determine the clinical outcome of breast cancer BI-RADS 4 lesions and seek a more effective management guideline, we conducted a retrospective study of all BI-RADS4 patients diagnosed between 2003-2008 with follow up time not less than 2 years. A total of 392 cases of BI-RADS 4 were identified and 320 could be sub-categorised as 4a, 4b and 4c. Overall malignant positive results were 7.65, 38.7 and 58.percent, respectively. In all cases assigned to the close follow up group, no malignancy was detectable (P&lt;0.02). The results of the study suggested that BI-RADS sub-categories have benefit for cancer diagnosis and treatment decisions of clinicians and it might be possible to set up a safe follow-up guideline in selected groups of patients to minimize un-necessary tissue biopsy for breast cancer detection.
23094992,0,2012,J Med Chem,New adamantane phenylalkylamines with σ-receptor binding affinity and anticancer activity, associated with putative antagonism of neuropathic pain.,The synthesis of the adamantane phenylalkylamines 2a-d, 3a-c, and 4a-e is described. These compounds exhibited significant antiproliferative activity, in vitro, against eight cancer cell lines tested. The σ(1), σ(2), and sodium channel binding affinities of compounds 2a, 3a, 4a, and 4c-e were investigated. The most interesting analogue, 4a, exhibited significant in vivo anticancer profile on pancreas, prostate, leukemia, and ovarian cancer cell line xenografts together with apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. Inhibition of the cancer cells cycle at the sub-G1 level was also obtained with 4a. Finally, encouraging results were observed with 4a in vivo on mice, suggesting putative antimetastatic and analgesic activities of this compound.
23088157,0,2012,Inorg Chem,Ca10Pt7Tt3 (Tt = Si, Ge): new platinide phases featuring electron-rich 4c-6e bonded [Pt7Tt3]20- intermetalloid clusters.,Two new phases Ca(10)Pt(7)Tt(3) (with Tt = Si, Ge) were obtained by reacting stoichiometric mixtures of the elements at high temperature. Their structures were refined from single crystal X-ray diffraction data. They are isostructural and crystallize in the Ba(10)Al(3)Ge(7) type structure, space group P6(3)/mcm (No. 193) with a = b = 8.7735(3) Å, c = 13.8260(5) Å, V = 921.66(6) Å(3), Z = 2 for Tt = Si, and a = b = 8.7995(6) Å, c = 13.9217(14) Å, V = 933.56(16) Å(3) for Tt = Ge phase. The most interesting structural features in these phases are the propeller shape {Pt(7)Tt(3)} (Tt = Si, Ge) intermetalloid clusters in a D(3h) local symmetry. LMTO electronic structure calculations and COHP analyses reveal that both Ca(10)Pt(7)Tt(3) (Tt = Si, Ge) phases are charge optimized, which is not predicted by the classical Zintl concept and the octet or Wade-Mingo's rules, but rather by a more complex bonding model based on the unprecedented electron-rich 4c-6e multicenter bonding. The clusters are best described as three-condensed trigonal planar [TtPt(3)](8-) units, resulting in a central Pt atom also with a trigonal planar coordination of three symmetrical equivalent Si/Ge atoms that are further connected to two terminal Pt atoms each. The &quot;trefoil&quot; electron-rich multicenter bonding is proposed here for the first time, and may be viewed as a unique bonding feature with potential relevance for the catalytic properties of the noble metal platinum.
23086104,0,2012,J Phys Condens Matter,The effect of the Wyckoff position of the K atom on the crystal structure and electronic properties of the compound KFe₂Se₂.,By means of first-principles electronic structure calculations, we study the effect of the Wyckoff position of the K atom on the crystal and electronic structures of the compound KFe(2)Se(2). When the K atoms take up the Wyckoff positions 2a, 2b and 4c (the related structures of KFe(2)Se(2) are referred to as Struc-2a, Struc-2b and Struc-4c), the calculated lattice constants c lie in the ranges 13.5-14.5, 15.5-16.7 or 18.6-19.1 Å respectively. Three concentric cylinder-like Fermi surfaces emerge around Γ-Z in the Brillouin zone for Struc-2b in the nonmagnetic state, unlike the cases for Struc-2a and Struc-4c. The Fe-Se-Fe angles are 107.8°, 108.8° and 110.7° respectively in the collinear antiferromagnetic state, and the superexchange interactions J(2) between two next neighbor Fe moments are 13.08 meV S(-2), 20.75 meV S(-2) and 11.86 meV S(-2) for the Struc-2a, Struc-2b and Struc-4c structures respectively. Struc-2b and Struc-4c have good correspondence with the newly discovered superconducting phases with T(c) = 40 and 30 K in KFe(2)Se(2). Our findings suggest a reasonable approach for achieving an understanding of the existence of multiple superconducting phases in alkali metal intercalated FeSe superconductor.

23077455,0,2012,Radiol Oncol,Dosimetric characterizations of GZP6 (60)Co high dose rate brachytherapy sources: application of superimposition method.,BACKGROUND: Dosimetric characteristics of a high dose rate (HDR) GZP6 Co-60 brachytherapy source have been evaluated following American Association of Physicists in MedicineTask Group 43U1 (AAPM TG-43U1) recommendations for their clinical applications.MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCNP-4C and MCNPX Monte Carlo codes were utilized to calculate dose rate constant, two dimensional (2D) dose distribution, radial dose function and 2D anisotropy function of the source. These parameters of this source are compared with the available data for Ralstron (60)Co and microSelectron(192)Ir sources. Besides, a superimposition method was developed to extend the obtained results for the GZP6 source No. 3 to other GZP6 sources.RESULTS: The simulated value for dose rate constant for GZP6 source was 1.104±0.03 cGyh-1U-1. The graphical and tabulated radial dose function and 2D anisotropy function of this source are presented here. The results of these investigations show that the dosimetric parameters of GZP6 source are comparable to those for the Ralstron source. While dose rate constant for the two (60)Co sources are similar to that for the microSelectron(192)Ir source, there are differences between radial dose function and anisotropy functions. Radial dose function of the (192)Ir source is less steep than both (60)Co source models. In addition, the (60)Co sources are showing more isotropic dose distribution than the (192)Ir source.CONCLUSIONS: The superimposition method is applicable to produce dose distributions for other source arrangements from the dose distribution of a single source. The calculated dosimetric quantities of this new source can be introduced as input data to the GZP6 treatment planning system (TPS) and to validate the performance of the TPS.
23077160,0,2012,J Exp Biol,The vestibuloocular reflex of tadpoles (Xenopus laevis) after knock-down of the isthmus-related transcription factor XTcf-4.,Development of the amphibian vestibular organ is regulated by molecular and neuronal mechanisms and by environmental input. The molecular component includes inductive signals derived from neural tissue of the hindbrain and from the surrounding mesoderm. The integrity of hindbrain patterning, on the other hand, depends on instructive signals from the isthmus organizer of the midbrain, including the transcription factor XTcf-4. If the development of the vestibular system depends on the integrity of the isthmus as the organizing centre, suppression of isthmus maintenance should modify vestibular morphology and function. We tested this hypothesis by downregulation of the transcription factor XTcf-4. 10 pmol l(-1) XTcf-4-specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotide was injected in one blastomere of two-cell-stage embryos of Xenopus laevis. For reconstitution experiments, 500 pg mRNA of the repressing XTcf-4A isoform or the activating XTcf-4C isoform were co-injected. Overexpression experiments were included using the same isoforms. Otoconia formation and vestibular controlled behaviour such as the roll-induced vestibuloocular reflex (rVOR) and swimming were recorded two weeks later. In 50% of tadpoles, downregulation of XTcf-4 induced (1) a depression of otoconia formation accompanied by a reduction of the rVOR, (2) abnormal tail development and (3) loop swimming behaviour. (4) All effects were rescued by co-injection of XTcf-4C but not, or only partially, by XTcf-4A. (5) Overexpression of XTcf-4A caused similar morphological and rVOR modifications as XTcf-4 depletion, while overexpression of XTcf-4C had no effect. Because XTcf-4C has been described as an essential factor for isthmus development, we postulate that the isthmus is strongly involved in vestibular development.
23074123,0,2012,Yonsei Med J,Histological analysis of benign breast imaging reporting and data system categories 4c and 5 breast lesions in imaging study.,PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to analyze the histology of breast lesions categorized as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4c or 5 breast lesions during the imaging evaluation, but diagnosed as benign during the histological evaluation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 71 breast lesions categorized as BI-RADS 4c or 5 during imaging study, but diagnosed as benign upon histological evaluation.RESULTS: Breast lesions were classified into six groups upon histological analysis: intraductal papilloma (18 cases), inflammatory group (15 cases), fibroepithelial tumor (14 cases), clustered microcalcification (10 cases), minimal histological alteration (10 cases), and adenosis (4 cases). Sclerosis and architectural complexity were associated with most of the biopsies that were morphologically similar to malignancy.CONCLUSION: Among 71 cases categorized as 4c or 5 during the imaging study, but diagnosed as benign upon histological examination, intraductal papilloma was the most frequently identified histological lesion. These 71 cases exhibited histological characteristics of sclerosis and/or complex/complicated features that should be histologically differentiated from malignancy during evaluation.
23072316,0,2012,Thyroid Res,Association between genetic mutations and the development of autoimmune thyroiditis in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon alpha.,BACKGROUND: Considerable progress was made by the introduction of interferon to the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. This treatment, however, is associated with the risk of developing or exacerbating autoimmune diseases, with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis being one of them. The aim of our study was to evaluate the predisposition to autoimmune thyroiditis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus during IFN-alpha therapy, depending on the presence of polymorphisms in the promoter region of CTLA-4C (-318)T gene and in exon 1 of A49G gene as well as C1858T transition of PTPN22 gene.METHODS: The study was conducted in 149 patients aged between 18 and 70 years (mean of 43.9 years), including 82 men and 67 women. Control group for the assessment of the distribution of analyzed polymorphism of genotypes consisted of 200 neonates, from whom umbilical blood was drawn for the tests. The patients were divided into three groups: group 1 consisted of 114 patients without thyroid impairment before and during IFN-alpha therapy, group 2 contained 9 patients with AT with the onset prior to IFN-alpha treatment, and group 3 comprised 26 patients with AT starting after the beginning of IFN-alpha therapy.RESULTS: The frequency of C1858Tand C(-318)T genotypes observed in the study group did not differ significantly from control group. A significant difference, however, was found for A49G polymorphism.CONCLUSIONS: No association was demonstrated between the occurrence of autoimmune thyroiditis with the onset during IFN-alpha therapy and the presence of polymorphisms within CTLA-4 C(-318)T gene in the promoter region and A49G in exon 1, as well as C1858T transition of PTPN22 gene.
23069383,0,2012,J Urol,The relationship between α1-adrenergic receptors and TRPM8 channels in detrusor overactivity induced by cold stress in ovariectomized rats.,PURPOSE: We studied whether cold stress induced detrusor overactivity in ovariectomized rats is associated with increased thermosensitive TRPM8 channel expression in the skin and whether the response could be inhibited by α1-adrenergic receptor blockade.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 24 Sprague-Dawley® rats at postnatal week 30 were randomly selected for ovariectomy (16) or sham ovariectomy (8). Five weeks later cystometric measurements of conscious, freely moving rats were made at room temperature (mean ± SEM 28C ± 2C) for 20 minutes. Eight ovariectomized rats were intravenously administered 1.0 mg/kg naftopidil. The other 8 ovariectomized and 8 sham operated rats were given naftopidil-free vehicle. Five minutes later they were transferred to a low temperature environment (mean 4C ± 2C) and micturition patterns were again recorded. TRPM8 channel expression in lumbar skin was estimated by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: TRPM8 channel mRNA and protein in the skin of ovariectomized rats were significantly higher than in sham operated rats. At room temperature micturition parameters were similar in sham operated and ovariectomized rats. At low temperature sham operated and ovariectomized rats showed cold stress induced detrusor overactivity but increased micturition frequency and decreased bladder capacity were significantly greater in ovariectomized rats. Treatment of ovariectomized rats with naftopidil inhibited cold stress induced detrusor overactivity.CONCLUSIONS: Cold stress induced detrusor overactivity in rats with decreased estrogen is associated with TRPM8 channel up-regulation in the skin and mediated by nerve pathways using α1-adrenergic receptors.
23046360,0,2012,Inorg Chem,New layered tin(II) thiophosphates ASnPS4 (A = K, Rb, Cs): synthesis, structure, glass formation, and the modulated CsSnPS4.,The layered compounds KSnPS(4) (1), RbSnPS(4) (2), and CsSnPS(4) (3) were synthesized using the chalcophosphate flux technique at high temperature and are rare examples of divalent Sn(II) thiophosphates. Orange polyhedral crystals of compound 1 crystallize in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c with a = 6.6673(13) Å, b = 11.9697(24) Å, c = 8.7604(18), and β=127.347(8)° in a 2-dimensional layered structure. Compound 2 is isostructural to 1. Yellow block shaped crystals of compound 3 crystallize in the monoclinic superspace group P2(1)(αβ0)0 with a commensurate q-vector at 1/4a* + 1/4c* with a = 18.0477(14) Å, b = 6.2021(5) Å, and c = 6.8415(5) Å. The structure of all three compounds contains SnS(3) pyramids, which is an extremely rare solid state chalcogenide coordination environment. All three compounds are semiconductors having well-defined band-gaps between 2.0 and 2.2 eV. The compounds are congruently melting and can be obtained as glasses by rapid quenching of the melt, which subsequently crystallize upon heating.
23041781,0,2012,Appl Radiat Isot,Design and optimization of a beam shaping assembly for BNCT based on D-T neutron generator and dose evaluation using a simulated head phantom.,A feasibility study was conducted to design a beam shaping assembly for BNCT based on D-T neutron generator. The optimization of this configuration has been realized in different steps. This proposed system consists of metallic uranium as neutron multiplier, TiF(3) and Al(2)O(3) as moderators, Pb as reflector, Ni as shield and Li-Poly as collimator to guide neutrons toward the patient position. The in-air parameters recommended by IAEA were assessed for this proposed configuration without using any filters which enables us to have a high epithermal neutron flux at the beam port. Also a simulated Snyder head phantom was used to evaluate dose profiles due to the irradiation of designed beam. The dose evaluation results and depth-dose curves show that the neutron beam designed in this work is effective for deep-seated brain tumor treatments even with D-T neutron generator with a neutron yield of 2.4×10(12) n/s. The Monte Carlo Code MCNP-4C is used in order to perform these calculations.
23038661,0,2012,Pharmacology,Therapeutic potential of ASP3258, a selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, on chronic eosinophilic airway inflammation.,We investigated and compared the pharmacological effects of a PDE4 inhibitor ASP3258 (3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-ethyl-7-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridin-3-yl] propanoic acid), with those of roflumilast, the most clinically advanced PDE4 inhibitor known. ASP3258 inhibited human PDE4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D with respective IC(50) values of 0.036, 0.050, 0.45, and 0.035 nmol/l, all approximately 3-6 times more potent than roflumilast. ASP3258 inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production and PHA-induced IL-5 production in human whole blood cells with respective IC(50) values of 110 and 100 nmol/l, both approximately 10 times less potent than roflumilast. Repeatedly administered ASP3258 and roflumilast both suppressed chronic airway eosinophilia induced by repeated exposure to ovalbumin in Brown Norway rats with respective ED(50) values of 0.092 and 0.17 mg/kg. We also evaluated the toxicological profiles of ASP3258. Although PDE4 inhibitors induce emesis by mimicking the pharmacological action of an α(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, repeated administration of ASP3258 (3 mg/kg) had no such inhibitory effect on rats anesthetized with α(2) - adrenoceptor agonist. PDE4 inhibitors are also known to induce vascular injury in rats. Although repeatedly administered ASP3258 (3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly increased plasma fibrinogen, a biomarker for toxicity, 1 mg/kg of ASP3258 did not. These results suggest that ASP3258 is an attractive PDE4 inhibitor for treating chronic eosinophilic airway inflammation due to asthma.
23036111,0,2012,Chem Biol Drug Des,Natural products as sources of new fungicides (I): synthesis and antifungal activity of acetophenone derivatives against phytopathogenic fungi.,Several series of 45 acetophenone derivatives bearing various alkyl or benzyl substituents were conveniently synthesized and their structures characterized by (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy, HRMS and single-crystal X-ray analysis. Their in vitro antifungal activities against a panel of phytopathogenic fungi were evaluated by mycelial growth rate assay. Of them, 12 derivatives (e.g., 3a-c, 4c and 4e) exhibited more potent antifungal effects on some phytopathogens than a commercial fungicide hymexazol as positive control. In particular, compound 3b with IC50 values of 10-19 μg/mL was found to be the most active in this series and might be a potential lead structure for further optimization. The preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of a series of acetophenones are also discussed.
23026710,0,2012,Carbohydr Res,Stereocontrolled synthesis of four diastereomeric C-aryl manno- and talofuranosides.,In a chiral-pool synthesis starting from D-mannono-1,4-lactone 1a, the four diastereomeric C-aryl furanosides (1S,4R)-4a, (1S,4S)-4b, (1R,4R)-4c, and (1R,4S)-4d were obtained in a stereocontrolled manner. The key steps of the synthetic pathway comprise a stereoselective reduction of the diastereomeric hemiketals (4R)-2a and (4S)-2b as well as a stereospecific cycloetherification of the resulting diols (1R,4R)-5a, (1S,4R)-5c, and (1S,4S)-5d. This ring closure which led to the desired C-glycosides was achieved by a Mitsunobu reaction or by preparing the 1-O-benzoyl-4-O-methylsulfonyl derivative 7 which was then treated with sodium methoxide. Final hydrolysis of the 5,6-O-isopropylidene protecting group led to the diastereomeric diols (1S,4R)-4a, (1S,4S)-4b, (1R,4R)-4c, and (1R,4S)-4d, representing versatile building blocks for further synthetic transformations.
23025059,0,2012,Trop Gastroenterol,Superiority of non-capsulated 14C-urea breath test over capsule based method for detection of Helicobacter pylori infection - a preliminary report.,BACKGROUND: 14C-urea breath test (14C-UBT) is employed as a 'gold standard' technique for the detection of active gastric Helicobacter pylori infection and is recommended as the best option for &quot;test-and-treat&quot; strategy in primary health care centers.AIM: To compare the performance of capsulated and non-capsulated 14C-UBT protocols for the detection of H. pylori infection in patients.METHODS: Fifty eight H. pylori infected patients underwent routine upper GI endoscopy and biopsies were processed for rapid urease test (RUT) and histopathology examination. Capsulated 14C-UBT was done in a novel way by using 74 kBq of 14C-urea along with 6.0 MBq of 99mTc-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) to simultaneously monitor the movement and the fate of ingested capsule after delineating the stomach contour by using 20.0 MBq of 99mTechnetium pertechnetate (99mTcO4-) under dual head gamma camera. Non-capsulated 14C-UBT was performed within 2 days of the previous test and the results of these protocols were compared.RESULTS: In 3 out of 58 H. pylori positive cases (5.17%), 14C-UBT results were found to be negative by using the capsulated method. Interestingly, on monitoring the real time images of the capsule in these cases it was found that misdiagnosis of H. pylori infection occurred mainly due to either rapid transit of the 14C-urea containing capsule from the upper gastric tract or its incomplete resolution in the stomach during the phase of breath collection.CONCLUSION: Use of non-capsulated '4C-UBT protocol appears to be a superior option than the conventional capsule based technique for the detection of H. pylori infection.
23013658,0,2012,Int J Comput Biol Drug Des,Fourth generation detour matrix-based topological indices for QSAR/QSPR - part-1: development and evaluation.,In the present study, four detour matrix-based Topological Indices (TIs) termed as augmented path eccentric connectivity indices 1-4 (denoted by (AP)ξ(1)(C), (AP)ξ(2)(C), (AP)ξ(3)(C) and (AP)ξ(4)(C)) as well as their topochemical versions (denoted by (AP)ξ(1c)(C), (AP)ξ(2c)(C), (AP)ξ(3c)(C) and (AP)ξ(4c)(C)) have been conceptualised. A modified detour matrix termed as chemical detour matrix (Δ(c)) has also been proposed so as to facilitate computation of index values of topochemical versions of the said TIs. Values of the proposed TIs were computed for all the possible structures containing three, four and five vertices using an in-house computer program. The said TIs exhibited exceptionally high discriminating power and high sensitivity towards branching/relative position of substituent(s) in cyclic structures amalgamated with negligible degeneracy. Due care was taken during the development of TIs so as to ensure that reduction in index values of complex chemical structures to be within reasonable limits without compromising discriminating power. The mathematical properties of one of the proposed TIs have also been studied. With exceptionally high discriminating power, high sensitivity towards branching as well as relative position(s) of substituents in cyclic structures and negligible degeneracy, the proposed indices offer a vast potential for use in characterisation of structures, similarity/dissimilarity studies, lead identification and optimisation, combinatorial library design and quantitative structure-activity/property/toxicity/pharmacokinetic relationship studies.
23010272,0,2012,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Design, synthesis and in vitro activities on anti-platelet aggregation of 4-methoxybenzene-1,3-isophthalamides.,On the purpose of searching for the structure-activity relationship (SAR) and obtaining novel anti-platelet drugs, 41 4-methoxybenzene-1,3-isophthalamides have been described the synthesis process and in vitro activities on anti-platelet aggregation. The target compounds have been classified into four series: series 1 (ortho-substituted phenyl: 1a-1j), series 2 (meta-substituted phenyl: 2a-2k), series 3 (para-substituted phenyl: 3a-3l) and series 4 (aromatic of no substituted group and aromatic heterocyclic substituted groups: 4a-4h). The chemical structures of the target compounds were confirmed by MS, IR, (1)H NMR, and their in vitro activities on anti-platelet aggregation were tested and assessed by using Born test. The result showed that thirteen compounds 1c, 1d, 1i, 1j, 2g, 3a, 3c, 3d, 3f, 3h, 3l, 4b and 4c have superior anti-platelet aggregation activities than the reference drug Picotamide.
23007532,0,2012,Acta Crystallogr C,Poly[[bis{μ2-N2,N6-bis[(pyridin-3-yl)methyl]pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide}dichloridonickel(II)] N,N-dimethylformamide tetrasolvate].,In the title compound, {[NiCl(2)(C(19)H(17)N(5)O(2))(2)]·4C(3)H(7)NO}(n), the Ni(II) atom is located on an inversion centre and is in a six-coordinated octahedral geometry, formed by four pyridine N atoms from four N(2),N(6)-bis[(pyridin-3-yl)methyl]pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide (BPDA) ligands occupying the equatorial plane and two chloride anions at the axial sites. The bidentate bridging BPDA ligands link the Ni(II) atoms into a two-dimensional corrugated grid-like flexible layer with a (4,4)-connected topology, which consists of left- and right-handed helical chains sharing the common Ni(II) atoms. Investigation of the thermal stability shows that the network is stable up to 573 K.
23006990,0,2012,Drug Discov Ther,Synthesis and structure-activity relationship study of 2-(substituted benzylidene)-7-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(furan-2-yl)-2H-thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-3(7H)-one derivatives as anticancer agents.,The synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of a series of 2-(substituted benzylidene)-7-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(furan-2-yl)-2H-thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-3(7H)-one (4a-4j) derivatives as anticancer agents are described. This series of thiazolopyrimidines were synthesized by the reaction of 7-(4-fluoro phenyl)-5-(furan-2-yl)-2H-thiazolo[3,2-a] pyrimidin-3(7H)-one (3) with appropriate substituted aldehydes in the presence of anhydrous sodium acetate and glacial acetic acid. Their structures were confirmed by IR, (1)H-NMR, mass, and elemental analyses. These novel thiazolopyrimidine derivatives were screened for their anticancer activity on the U937 human histocytic lymphoma cell line by 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. The comparison of anticancer activity of thiazolopyrimidine was performed considering their structures. This study was done using 2-(substituted benzylidene)-7-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(furan-2-yl)-2H-thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-3(7H)-one (4a-4j) as a basic model, showing that i) presence of a hydrogen donor/acceptor domain [thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-3(7H)-one] on the thiazolopyrimidine ring; ii) presence of a hydrophobic [(4-fluorophenyl)] aryl ring system on the thiazolopyrimidine ring; iii) presence of an electron donor moiety [5-(furan-2-yl)] on the thiazolopyrimidine ring; iv) ortho and para substitution of the distal aryl ring [2-(substituted benzylidene)] function strongly influenced anticancer activity. Among these compounds (4a-4j) para substituted derivatives 4c, 4e, 4f, 4g, 4h, and 4j showed significant anticancer activity.
23001981,0,2012,J Clin Lab Anal,Measurement of urinary cystatin C with a particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay on Architect ci8200.,BACKGROUND: Cystatin C is a low-molecular-weight protein that is freely filtered by the glomerulus and catabolized after reabsorption by the proximal tubular cells in healthy subjects. Urinary cystatin C is a potential biomarker for tubular damage including acute kidney injury (AKI) in the acute phase when patients are submitted to the intensive care unit.METHODS: The aim of this study was to perform a method validation of urinary analysis of cystatin C by particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA) on a high-throughput chemical analyzer. Total assay time was 10 min. The antigen excess, linearity, lower limit of quantification (LoQ), recovery, assay precision, stability, and interference caused by hemoglobin were evaluated.RESULTS: The LoQ was calculated to 0.020 mg/l with a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤ 10%. No hook effect was observed and the assay was linear over the studied interval less than 0.020-0.950 mg/l with a regression of R² = 0.9994. The assay had a recovery between 93-100% and the assay precision had a total CV of less than 3.5%. Cystatin C was stable for 3 days in room temperature and 14 days in +4C. The assay did not show any major interference with hemoglobin at a hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/L. The reference interval for urine cystatin C was less than 0.166 mg/l.CONCLUSION: The urinary cystatin C PETIA showed good precision and performance characteristics including short test turnaround times that are necessary qualifications for a biomarker at a routine laboratory.
22998281,0,2012,J Chem Phys,Origin of enhanced water adsorption at &lt;110&gt; step edge on rutile TiO2(110) surface.,Water adsorption behavior at &lt;110&gt; and &lt;001&gt; step edges on rutile TiO(2) (110) surface has been investigated using density-functional theory calculations. We find that the &lt;110&gt; edge exhibits significantly enhanced water adsorption, especially dissociative adsorption, as compared to the pristine (110) surface and &lt;001&gt; step edge. The origin for the enhanced water adsorption is found to be due to the existence of fourfold coordinated Ti atoms (Ti(4c)) at the &lt;110&gt; step edge, which lead to charge transfer to adsorbates more easily than fivefold coordinated Ti atoms on the (110) surface and &lt;001&gt; step edge. Furthermore, due to the local configuration of the dissociative mode, the charge transfer occurs more easily from Ti(4c) to the hydroxyl group 1π orbital, which considerably increases the adsorbate-substrate interaction. As a result, the &lt;110&gt; step edge favors dissociative water adsorption, making it more reactive to water than the (110) surface and &lt;001&gt; edge.
22986831,0,2012,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo),Synthesis and antiproliferative activity of novel α-aminophosphonates.,A novel series of carbazole-based α-aminophosphonates were synthesized by three component coupling of 6-bromo-9-ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-carbaldehyde, amine and diethyl phosphite using polyethylene glycol (PEG-400) as a green reaction media. The antiproliferative activity of these molecules was evaluated against three cancer cell lines. Of these, compounds 4c, 4e and 4m were found to exhibit good antiproliferative activity against three cancer cells, A549, MCF-7, and NCI-N87.
22983098,0,2012,Photochem Photobiol Sci,Photochemistry of 1-allyl-4-aryltetrazolones in solution; structural effects on photoproduct selectivity.,The photochemistry of tetrazolones derived from the carbocyclic allylic alcohols cyclohex-2-enol and 3-methylcyclohex-2-enol and from the natural terpene alcohol nerol was investigated in solution with the aim of assessing the effect of solvent and of structural constraints imposed by bulky allylic moieties on photoproduct selectivity and stability. Photolysis of tetrazolones derived from nerol and cyclohex-2-enol afforded the corresponding pyrimidinones as major products through a pathway that appears to be similar to that proposed for other 1-allyl-4-phenyl-1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-ones derived from acyclic and unhindered allylic alcohols previously investigated but photolysis of the tetrazolone derived from the bulkier 3-methylcyclohex-2-enol 4c leads to formation of a benzimidazolone, indicating that, in this case, cyclization of the biradical formed upon extrusion of N(2) involves the phenyl substituent and not the allylic moiety. Theoretical calculations (DFT(B3LYP)/3-21G*) were conducted to support the interpretation of the experimental results and mechanistic proposals. Laser flash photolysis experiments were conducted with the aim of clarifying the nature of the intermediate involved in the primary photocleavage process.
22944164,0,2012,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,[Effect of endoplasmic reticulum stress in brain injury following chronic intermittent hypoxia in weanling rat].,OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in brain injury following chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) in weanling rats.METHODS: A total of 48 male healthy Sprague-Dawley rats (3-4-week-old, 80-100 g) were randomly divided into 4 groups: 2-week-CIH (2IH) group, 4-week-CIH (4IH) group, 2-week-control (2C) group and 4-week-control (4C) group. The morphologic changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and cell apoptosis detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay. Then hippocampus and prefrontal cortices were collected for transcription and expression analysis of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blotting respectively. And the expressions of Caspase-12 mRNA and Caspase-12 protein in prefrontal cortex were analyzed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: The neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus and prefrontal cortices in CIH exposed groups were more pronounced than those of the control groups (all P &lt; 0.01), especially in the 4IH group (hippocampus: 8.78% ± 0.71% vs 3.26% ± 0.45%, cortices: 6.02% ± 0.32% vs 2.91% ± 0.29%). The expression levels of GRP78 mRNA (hippocampus: 0.424 ± 0.033 vs 0.326 ± 0.013 and 0.444 ± 0.028 vs 0.310 ± 0.015, cortices: 0.514 ± 0.038 vs 0.430 ± 0.017 and 0.524 ± 0.038 vs 0.439 ± 0.033) and GRP78 protein in hippocampus and prefrontal cortices (hippocampus: 0.221 ± 0.032 vs 0.178 ± 0.014 and 0.241 ± 0.019 vs 0.170 ± 0.013, cortices: 0.307 ± 0.012 vs 0.226 ± 0.022 and 0.311 ± 0.023 vs 0.225 ± 0.025), and the expression levels of Caspase-12 mRNA (0.396 ± 0.004 vs 0.323 ± 0.014, 0.417 ± 0.011 vs 0.313 ± 0.011) and Caspase-12 protein (0.334 ± 0.035 vs 0.197 ± 0.023, 0.368 ± 0.079 vs 0.215 ± 0.024) in prefrontal cortex in the IH groups all were more than those in the 2C and 4C groups (all P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Chronic intermittent hypoxia can up-regulate the GRP78 transcription and expression in brain regions associated with learning and memory. This may induce the endoplasmic reticulum stress and activate the Caspase-12 mediated apoptosis signaling pathway. In the end, neuronal apoptosis occurs. All these factors may play an important role in the impairment of learning memory during the exposure of growing rats to chronic intermittent hypoxia.

22928971,0,2012,Cell Reprogram,The mechanism of oocyte activation influences the cell cycle-related genes expression during bovine preimplantation development.,The first cleavage divisions and preimplantation embryonic development are supported by mRNA and proteins synthesized and stored during oogenesis. Thus, mRNA molecules of maternal origin decrease and embryonic development becomes gradually dependent on expression of genetic information derived from the embryonic genome. However, it is still unclear what the role of the sperm cell is during this phase and whether the absence of the sperm cell during the artificial oocyte activation affects subsequent embryonic development. The objective of this study was to determine, in bovine embryos, changes in cell cycle-associated transcript levels (cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin E, CDC2, CDK2, and CDK4) after oocyte activation in the presence or absence of the sperm cell. To evaluate that, in vitro-produced (IVP) and parthenogenetically activated (PA) embryos (2-4 cells (2-4C), 8-16 cells (8-16C) and blastocysts) were evaluated by real-time PCR. There was no difference in cleavage and blastocyst rates between IVP and PA groups. Transcript level was higher in oocytes than in IVP and PA embryos. Cleaved PA embryos showed higher expression of cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin E, and CDK2 and lower expression of CDC2 when compared with that from the IVP group. At the time of activation, all transcripts were expressed less in PA than in IVP embryos, whereas at the blastocyst stage, almost all genes were expressed at a higher level in the PA group. These results suggest that in both groups there is an initial consumption of these transcripts in the early stages of embryonic development. Furthermore, 8-16C embryos seem to synthesize more cell cycle-related genes than 2-4C embryos. However, in PA embryos, activation of the cell cycle genes seems to occur after the 8- to 16-cell stage, suggesting a failure in the activation process.
22923876,0,2012,Indian J Pharm Sci,Synthesis and Antimicrobial Activity of Some New 2-(3-(4-Aryl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl) Chroman-4-ones.,Seven new 2-(3-(4-aryl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl) chroman-4-ones (4a-4g) have been synthesized by cyclization of 2-hydroxychalcone analogues of pyrazole 3a-3g using conc. HCl in acetic acid. The structures of the compounds 4a-4g were established by the combined use of (1)HNMR, IR and mass spectra. All the seven compounds were tested in vitro for their antibacterial activity against two Gram positive bacteria namely Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis and two Gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The compounds 4b, 4c, 4e, 4f, 4g have displayed good antibacterial activity when compared with commercially available antibiotic, ciprofloxacin. These compounds also were screened for their antifungal activity against two ear pathogenic fungi, namely Aspergillus Niger and A. flavus. The compounds 4a, 4c, 4d, 4g exhibited good antifungal activity when compared with commercially available antifungal, fluconazole.
22920151,0,2012,Med Chem,Synthesis, cytotoxicity, antibacterial and antileishmanial activities of imidazolidine and hexahydropyrimidine derivatives.,This paper describes the synthesis and in vitro biological activities of imidazolidine and hexahydropyrimidine derivatives against bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and Leishmania protozoa. Out of sixteen heterocyclic derivatives tested, none were cytotoxic against mammalian cells. The compounds showed significant bacterial effects and leishmanicidal activity. Compounds 4a and 4c were active against S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. Compounds 3a-3f, 4h and 4i presented promising results against M. tuberculosis, with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 25.0 μg/mL, comparable to the &quot;first and second line&quot; drugs used to treat tuberculosis. Compounds 4a, 4c and 4e were active against L major. Three of them were structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.
22908070,0,2012,Hormones (Athens),Sertoli cell tumor and gonadoblastoma in an untreated 29-year-old 46,XY phenotypic male with Frasier syndrome carrying a WT1 IVS9+4C&gt;T mutation.,OBJECTIVE: Frasier syndrome (FS) phenotype in 46,XY patients usually consists of female external genitalia, gonadal dysgenesis, high risk of gonadoblastoma and the development of end stage renal failure usually in the second decade of life. FS is caused by heterozygous de novo intronic splice site mutations of the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene 1 (WT1), although a few cases with typical exonic WT1 Denys-Drash mutations that resemble an FS phenotype have been described. The aim of this study was to present further data on the spectrum of FS phenotypes through the evaluation of a 29-year-old patient with a predominantly male phenotype and coexistence of Sertoli cell tumor and gonadoblastoma.RESULTS: Genetic analysis using standard methods for DNA sequencing confirmed FS due to a WT1 gene mutation, IVS9+4C&gt;T.CONCLUSIONS: This very rare case illustrates the natural course of FS over many years due to the neglect by the patient to address his need for follow-up, while adding further data on the spectrum of FS phenotypes associated with IVS9+4 C&gt;T mutations. The coexistence of the rare Sertoli cell tumor and gonadoblastoma emphasizes that early clinical recognition and molecular identification facilitates appropriate patient management, especially with respect to the high risk of gonadal malignancy.
22901012,0,2012,J Food Sci,Reduction of Listeria monocytogenes in raw catfish fillets by essential oils and phenolic constituent carvacrol.,The antimicrobial activity of various essential oils and carvacrol was determined on fresh raw catfish fillets against a 4-strain Listeria monocytogenes mixture representing serotypes 1/2b, 3b, 4b, and 4c that were predominantly isolated from catfish processing environments. Thyme oil, oregano oil and carvacrol exhibited concentration and time dependent responses in broth against L. monocytogenes; for example 0.5% concentrations resulted in 4 log CFU/mL reduction within 30 min whereas 0.1% concentrations required more than 24 h for the same level of reduction. Lemon, orange, and tangerine oils, at 0.5% showed listeriostatic effect in which 4 log CFU/mL of the initial L. monocytogenes load was unchanged at 4 °C in 10 d whereas 1% concentrations were listericidal in a time dependent manner. Apart from carvacrol, efficacy of tested essential oils in reducing L. monocytogenes and total microbial load from catfish fillet was very limited. Dipping treatment of catfish fillets in 2% carvacrol solution for 30 min at 4 °C reduced L. monocytogenes to an undetectable level from their initial load of 5 log CFU/g and reduced total microbial load from catfish fillets by approximately 5 log CFU/g. In sensory analysis trained panelist preferred control samples over 2% carvacrol treated samples implying potential limitation in applicability of carvacrol for fillet treatments.
22897767,0,2012,Prep Biochem Biotechnol,A rapid and convenient method to enhance transgenic expression in target cells.,Gene therapy provides a novel strategy and a new hope for patients with cancer. Unfortunately, the specifics of the delivery systems or the promoters have not achieved the specified efficacy so far, and the perfection of either system will be extremely difficult. In this study, we introduce a simple concept that a combination of a partially specific delivery system and a partially specific promoter activity may achieve a more specific effect on transgenic expression in target cells. The first section describes tumor-related transcription factors that were assayed in tumors or rapidly proliferating cells to determine their activities. The activities of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, CREB, and HIF-1 were higher, and three copies of each response element were used to construct a transcription factor-based synthetic promoter (TSP). The results showed that the expression of the TSP was active and partially specific to cell types. As described in the second section, the multifunctional peptide RGD-4C-HA was designed to absorb polyethyleneimine (PEI) molecules, and this complex was targeted to integrin αvβ3 on B16F10 cells. The results indicated that RGD-4C-HA could associate with PEI to mediate specific targeting in vitro. Finally, the combination of the PEI-peptide complex and TSP could enhance the specifically transgenic expression in B16F10 cells. This strategy has been proven to work in vitro and might potentially be used for specific gene therapy in vivo.

These complexes were well characterized by NMR and the structures of 1a, 2a, 2c, 3b and 4c were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The aluminum and zinc complexes were tested to initiate lactide polymerization in which the zinc complexes show moderate to high activities in the presence of benzyl alcohol.
22885391,0,2012,Appl Radiat Isot,Verification of MCNP simulation of neutron flux parameters at TRIGA MK II reactor of Malaysia.,A 3-D model for 1 MW TRIGA Mark II research reactor was simulated. Neutron flux parameters were calculated using MCNP-4C code and were compared with experimental results obtained by k(0)-INAA and absolute method. The average values of φ(th),φ(epi), and φ(fast) by MCNP code were (2.19±0.03)×10(12) cm(-2)s(-1), (1.26±0.02)×10(11) cm(-2)s(-1) and (3.33±0.02)×10(10) cm(-2)s(-1), respectively. These average values were consistent with the experimental results obtained by k(0)-INAA. The findings show a good agreement between MCNP code results and experimental results.
22877079,0,2012,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,Endoreduplication in cervical trophoblast cells from normal pregnancies.,OBJECTIVE: Fetal cells represented by extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) obtained from the cervix by a minimally invasive procedure are important for prenatal diagnosis in early pregnancies. Endoreduplication is a duplication of chromosomes without mitosis, leading to polyploidy that might represent increased cellular metabolic activity. In this study, we estimated the normal prevalence of polyploid trophoblasts exfoliated to the cervix between 5 and 13 weeks of gestation.METHODS: Cervical samples were obtained by cytobrush, between 5 and 13 weeks of gestation from 36 randomly selected, singleton pregnancies. FISH was done with X, Y and two 21 probes.RESULTS: We diagnosed 21 pregnancies with female and 15 pregnancies with male fetal karyotypes. A mean of 15.2 (0.02%) tetraploid cells were found in pregnancies with a female fetus and a mean of 2.0 (0.003%) tetraploid cells were found in pregnancies with a male fetus. The tetraploid cells (endoreduplicated trophoblasts) were two to three times larger than the normal cells usually seen in the cervix.CONCLUSIONS: Extravillus trophoblasts tend to form endoreduplication to the ploidy level of 4c-8c of DNA. Those cells may represent a typical phenomenon in the growing placenta. Extravillus trophoblasts from female fetuses tend to form higher rates of endoreduplication.
22850211,0,2012,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Hybrid molecules of carvacrol and benzoyl urea/thiourea with potential applications in agriculture and medicine.,Benzoyl phenyl urea, a class of insect growth regulator's acts by inhibiting chitin synthesis. Carvacrol, a naturally occurring monoterpenoid is an effective antifungal agent. We have structurally modified carvacrol (2-methyl-5-[1-methylethyl] phenol) by introducing benzoylphenyl urea linkage. Two series of benzoylcarvacryl thiourea (BCTU, 4a-f) and benzoylcarvacryl urea (BCU, 5a-f) derivatives were prepared and characterized by elemental analysis, IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR and Mass spectroscopy. Derivatives 4b, 4d, 4e, 4f and 5d, 5f showed comparable insecticidal activity with the standard BPU lufenuron against Dysdercus koenigii. BCTU derivatives 4c, 4e and BCU 5c showed good antifungal activity against phytopathogenic fungi viz. Magnaporthe grisae, Fusarium oxysporum, Dreschlera oryzae; food spoilage yeasts viz. Debaromyces hansenii, Pichia membranifaciens; and human pathogens viz. Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Compounds 5d, 5e and 5f showed potent activity against human pathogens. Moderate and selective activity was observed for other compounds. All the synthesized compounds were non-haemolytic. These compounds have potential application in agriculture and medicine.
22845464,0,2012,Inorg Chem,Reactivity of rhodium(I) complexes bearing nitrogen-containing ligands toward CH3I: synthesis and full characterization of neutral cis-[RhX(CO)2(L)] and acetyl [RhI(μ-I)(COMe)(CO)(L)]2 complexes.,The neutral rhodium(I) square-planar complexes [RhX(CO)(2)(L)] [X = Cl (3), I (4)] bearing a nitrogen-containing ligand L [diethylamine (a), triethylamine (b), imidazole (c), 1-methylimidazole (d), pyrazole (e), 1-methylpyrazole (f), 3,5-dimethylpyrazole (g)] are straightforwardly obtained from L and [Rh(μ-X)(CO)(2)](2) [X = Cl (1), I (2)] precursors. The synthesis is extended to the diethylsulfide ligand h for 3h and 4h. According to the CO stretching frequency of 3 and 4, the ranking of the electronic density on the rhodium center follows the order b &gt; a ≈ d &gt; c &gt; g &gt; f ≈ h &gt; e. The X-ray molecular structures of 3a, 3d-3f, 4a, and 4d-4f were determined. Results from variable-temperature (1)H and (13)C{(1)H} NMR experiments suggest a fluxional associative ligand exchange for 4c-4h and a supplementary hydrogen-exchange process in 4e and 4g. The oxidative addition reaction of CH(3)I to complexes 4c-4g affords the neutral dimeric iodo-bridged acetylrhodium(III) complexes [RhI(μ-I)(COCH(3))(CO)(L)](2) (6c-6g) in very good isolated yields, whereas 4a gives a mixture of neutral 6a and dianionic [RhI(2)(μ-I)(COCH(3))(CO)][NHMeEt(2)](2) and 4h exclusively provides the analogue dianionic complex with [SMeEt(2)](+) as the counterion. X-ray molecular structures for 6d(2) and 6e reveal that the two apical CO ligands are in mutual cis positions, as are the two apical d and e ligands, whereas isomer 6d(1) is centrosymmetric. Further reactions of 6d and 6e with CO or ligand e gave quantitatively the monomeric complexes [RhI(2)(COCH(3))(CO)(2)(d)] (7d) and [RhI(2)(COCH(3))(CO)(e)(2)] (8e), respectively, as confirmed by their X-ray structures. The initial rate of CH(3)I oxidative addition to 4 as determined by IR monitoring is dependent on the nature of the nitrogen-containing ligand. For 4a and 4h, reaction rates similar to those of the well-known rhodium anionic [RhI(2)(CO)(2)](-) species are observed and are consistent with the formation of this intermediate species through methylation of the a and h ligands. The reaction rates are reduced significantly when using imidazole and pyrazole ligands and involve the direct oxidative addition of CH(3)I to the neutral complexes 4c-4g. Complexes 4c and 4d react around 5-10 times faster than 4e-4g mainly because of electronic effects. The lowest reactivity of 4f toward CH(3)I is attributed to the steric effect of the coordinated ligand, as supported by the X-ray structure.
22823896,0,2012,Inorg Chem,Reversible solvatomagnetic effect in novel tetranuclear cubane-type Ni4 complexes and magnetostructural correlations for the [Ni4(μ3-O)4] core.,A new family of tetranuclear nickel cube complexes [Ni(4)L(4)(solv)(4)] (1, solv = MeOH; 2, solv = H(2)O; H(2)L = pyrazole-based tridentate {ONO} ligand) has been studied in detail, in particular by X-ray diffraction and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry. Different solvates 1·H(2)O, 2·4C(3)H(6)O, 2·CH(2)Cl(2), and 2·H(2)O were obtained in crystalline form. Only small structural variations were found for the Ni-O-Ni angles of the [Ni(4)O(4)] cores of those compounds, but these slight variations have dramatic consequences for the magnetic properties. [Ni(4)L(4)(MeOH)(4)]·H(2)O (1·H(2)O) and [Ni(4)L(4)(H(2)O)(4)]·H(2)O (2·H(2)O) can be reversibly interconverted in the solid state by exposure to the respective solvent, MeOH or H(2)O, and this goes along with a switching of the spin ground state from magnetic (S(T) = 4) to diamagnetic (S(T) = 0). Likewise the (irreversible) loss of lattice solvent in [Ni(4)L(4)(H(2)O)(4)]·4C(3)H(6)O (2·4C(3)H(6)O) to give 2·2C(3)H(6)O changes the ground state from S(T) = 4 to S(T) = 0. In view of these dramatic solvatomagnetic effects for the present [Ni(4)L(4)(solv)(4)] complexes, which occur upon extrusion of lattice solvent or facile exchange of coordinated solvent molecules while keeping the robust [Ni(4)O(4)] core intact, a note of care is issued: whenever magnetic data are obtained for powdered material or for crystals that easily loose lattice solvent molecules, the magnetic properties may not necessarily reflect the situation observed in the corresponding single crystal diffraction study. Finally, a thorough analysis of the present series of complexes as well as other {Ni(4)(μ(3)-OR)(4)} cubes reported in the literature confirms that a correlation between the (Ni-O-Ni)(av) bond angle and J in [Ni(4)O(4)] cubane complexes does indeed exist.
22812005,0,2012,Yao Xue Xue Bao,[Design, synthesis and in vitro antifungal activity of 3-substituted-methylenechroman-4-ones].,Substituted phenols as the starting materials were transformed into substituted chromanones by substitution reaction and cyclization reaction, and then 3-(hydroxymethylene)chroman-4-ones were synthesized from substituted chromanones by condensation reaction; at last, the target compounds were synthesized from 3-(hydroxymethylene)chroman-4-ones by chlorination reaction. Their structures were confirmed by 1H NMR and MS. The antifungal activity of the target compounds in vitro was measured by consecutive double dilution, and the result of antifungal experiment indicated that the target compounds had good antifungal action on most fungi tested in vitro. The MIC value of compounds 4c, 4e, 4g and 4h on M. gypseum is 1 microg x mL(-1), better than fluconazole and amphotericin B.
22807767,0,2012,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,Octa-kis(dimethyl sulfoxide-κO)cerium(III) μ(6)-oxido-dodeca-μ(2)-oxido-hexa-oxidohexa-molybdate(VI) dimethyl sulfoxide tetrasolvate.,The title complex, [Ce(C(2)H(6)OS)(8)](2)[Mo(6)O(19)](3)·4C(2)H(6)OS, was obtained as a byproduct of the reaction of [(C(4)H(9))(4)N](2)[Mo(6)O(19)] with Ce(NO(3))(3)·6H(2)O and phthalic acid in dimethyl-sulfoxide solution. The asymmetric unit consists of a complex [Ce(C(2)H(6)OS)(8)](3+) cation, one and a half of the Lindqvist-type [Mo(6)O(19)](2-) polyanions and two dimethyl-sulfoxide solvent mol-ecules; the half polyanion lies on an inversion center. The Ce(3+) ion is coordinated by eight dimethyl-sulfoxide ligands through the O atoms in the form of a distorted square antiprism. The Ce-O bond lengths range from 2.429 (6) to 2.550 (5) Å. The cohesion of the structure is ensured by S⋯O [3.115 (6), 3.242 (10) and 3.12 (3) Å], O⋯O [3.037 (10) Å] and C-H⋯O inter-actions between cations and anions. The S and C atoms of a dmso ligand are disordered over three sites in a 0.45:0.30:0.25 ratio. The dimethyl-sulfoxide solvent mol-ecules are highly disordered and could not be modelled successfully; their contribution was therefore removed from the refinement using the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON [Spek (2009 ▶). Acta Cryst. D65, 148-155]. Potential solvent-accessible voids of 500.0 Å(3) occur in the crystal structure.
22803675,0,2012,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,1-(3-aminomethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-pyridinyl-2-propen-1-ones: a novel group of tumour-selective cytotoxins.,Two series of 1-(3-aminomethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-pyridinyl-2-propen-1-ones, designed as novel cytotoxins, were synthesized. The compounds had low CC50 values in the micromolar range against HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cells and HSC-2, HSC-3 and HSC-4 oral squamous cell carcinomas. The CC50 values of these compounds were higher towards non-malignant HGF (gingival fibroblasts), HPC (pulp cells), and HPLF (periodontal ligament fibroblasts) cells, which reveals the tumour-selectivity of these enones. A representative compound 4c caused cleavage of PARP1 in HSC-2 cells but not in HGF cells, which may be a contributing factor to the tumour-selectivity.
22799346,0,2012,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Diagnostic potential of strain ratio measurement and a 5 point scoring method for detection of breast cancer: Chinese experience.,AIM: To evaluate the differential diagnostic potential of lesion stiffness assessed by the sonoelastographic strain index ratio (SR) and elastographic color scoring system (UE) for breast lesions.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty two breast masses (158 benign and 184 malignant) from 325 consecutive patients (mean age 44.2 years; range 16-81)who had been scheduled for a sonographically guided core biopsy were examined with grey scale sonography,doppler sonography and sonoelastography. Each lesion was classified with ACR's BI-RADS assessment category (2, 3 and 4A=Benign and; 4B, 4C, 5=Malignant) and the 5-point scoring system proposed by Itoh et al, with scoring 1-3=benign and 4-5=malignant. Strain and area ratios of each lesion were calculated within the same machine. Histological diagnosis was used as the reference standard. The area under the curve (AUC) and cut-off point were obtained by receiver operating curve and the cross table Fischer Test was carried out for assessing diagnostic value. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy and false-discovery rates were compared.RESULTS: The mean strain ratios for benign and malignant lesions were 1.87 and 7.9 respectively. (P&lt;0.0001). When a cutoff point of 3.54 was used, SR had a sensitivity of 94.6%, a specificity 94.3%, a PPV of 95.1%, an NPV of 93.7% and an accuracy of 94.4%. The AUC values were 0.90 for the 5 point scoring system (UE) and 0.96 for the strain index ratio. The overall diagnostic performance was SR method was better (P&lt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Strain ratio measurement could be another effective predictor in elastography imaging besides 5 the point scoring system for differential diagnosis of breast lesions.
22797013,0,2012,Stud Health Technol Inform,The Cradle Coast personally controlled electronic health record evaluation research.,In 2010 the Federal Government announced funding over two years to create a Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record (PCEHR) for Australians. One of the wave 2 implementation sites is the Cradle Coast in Tasmania. A PCEHR Program Benefits and Evaluation Partner (BEP) has been appointed to undertake evaluation activities with the e-health lead implementation sites. In addition to this implementation a comprehensive research plan has been developed and commenced through the Rural Clinical School at the University of Tasmania. The overarching aim of the research agenda is to evaluate the outcomes of various elements of the 4C project as it evolves and is implemented, from multiple perspectives. The research agenda is important as it expands upon the NEHTA mandated evaluation and provides an holistic overview of the PCEHR implementation process and outcomes for clinicians, patients and family members. This paper will detail the planned evaluation and its progress to date.
22788799,0,2012,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Screening of hepatitis C virus genotypes in urticaria patients in Saudi Arabia.,OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and to determine the HCV genotypes in urticaria patients of Saudi Arabia.METHODS: After thorough clinical examination by a consultant dermatologist, urticaria patients and individual healthy controls were enrolled. Venous blood collected from subjects was analyzed for LFT (aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], albumin, and bilirubin), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and HCV antibodies--HCV-RNA-PCR screening and genotyping.RESULTS: Upon enzyme immunoassay (EIA) screening for HCV infection, 5/70 (7.1%) urticaria patients and none among the controls tested positive for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies (p=0.005). Genotyping analysis revealed that HCV belongs to types 3 and 4 with subtypes 3a, 4a, and 4c. No significant variations were seen in the mean serum levels of ALT, AST, albumin, and bilirubin between the patients based on their HCV sero-positivity status.CONCLUSION: This prospective study indicated that HCV infection plays a significant role in urticaria. However, larger studies in different ethnicities could ascertain the association between different HCV genetic variants and the urticaria.

These compounds underwent NMannich reaction with various substituted piperazines to yield (title compounds 3a-f and 4a-f respectively. Structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral studies (IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and Mass) and elemental analysis. All the synthesized compounds were screened for in vitro leptospirocidal activty against Leptospira interrogans. The potent compounds 4a, 4b and 4c which showed maximum activity during in vitro studies were subjected to in vivo studies. The inhibitory activity of enzymes carboxypeptidase and transpeptidase, in leptospirosis by the synthesized compounds were determined. 3D-QSAR studies model developed showed the need for more hydrophobic and less steric groups as substituent groups to enhance the in vitro activity.
22777752,0,2012,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,In vivo antigenotoxic potential and possible mechanism of action of selected 4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one derivatives.,The in vivo sex-linked recessive lethal test was carried out in Drosophila melanogaster to investigate whether or not five substituted 4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-ones can modulate the genotoxicity of the well-established mutagenic agent ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). For this purpose, 3 days old Canton S males were treated with the potent mutagen EMS alone in concentration of 0.75 ppm, as well as in combination with one of the five 4-hydroxycoumarins, namely diethyl 2-(1-(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)ethylidene)malonate (2b), 3-(1-(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)ethylidene)pentane-2,4-dione (6b), 4-(4-(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)thiazol-2-ylamino) benzenesulfonic acid (4c), 4-hydroxy-3-(2-(2-nitropheny lamino)thiazol-4-yl)-2H-chromen-2-one (9c), and (E)-4-hydroxy-3-(1-(m-tolylimino)ethyl)-2H-chromen-2-one (5d), in concentration of 70 ppm. The frequency of germinative mutations increased significantly after the treatment with EMS and decreased after treatments with coumarins. The maximum reduction was observed after treatments with 2b, 6b, 4c, and 5d. By the formation of hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions with O(6) of DNA guanine, tested coumarins prevent EMS-induced alkylation. The results indicate a protective role of five 4-hydroxycoumarins under the action of a strong mutagen.
22774529,0,2012,Vopr Onkol,[Verification of histologic diagnosis in cervical carcinoma in situ with contradictory morphological data].,The medical technology of in situ cervical carcinoma cytological verification using computer-assisted morphometric and density analysis of atypical cells nuclei was developed. The technology is aimed at diagnosis verification in cases with contradictory morphological data. The malignant transformation of cervical epithelium undetectable by conventional morphology methods can be diagnosed using the Felgen-stained samples nuclear DNA distribution data. The right DNA distribution diagram shift with modal class 4C or higher, mean DNA contents higher than 4C, the ratio between aneuploidic and polyploidic cells higher than 0.2 are the signs of cervical epithelium malignant transformation.
22763684,0,2012,Acta Crystallogr C,Two [Cu2I2]-based coordination polymers of 1,3-bis(pyridin-4-yl)propane.,Solvothermal reactions of Cu(2)(OH)(2)CO(3) with 1,3-bis(pyridin-4-yl)propane (bpp) in the presence of aqueous ammonia in 4-iodotoluene/CH(3)CN or 1,4-diiodobenzene/CH(3)CN afforded two [Cu(2)I(2)]-based coordination polymers, namely catena-poly[[[di-μ-iodido-dicopper(I)]-bis[μ-1,3-bis(pyridin-4-yl)propane-κ(2)N:N']] p-toluidine tetrasolvate], {[Cu(2)I(2)(C(13)H(14)N(2))(2)]·4C(7)H(9)N}(n), (I), and the analogous 1,4-diiodobenzene monosolvate, {[Cu(2)I(2)(C(13)H(14)N(2))(2)]·C(6)H(4)I(2)}(n), (II). The [Cu(2)I(2)] unit of (I) lies on a centre of symmetry at the mid-point of the two I atoms, while that of (II) has a twofold axis running through the I···I line. In (I) and (II), each Cu centre is tetrahedrally coordinated by two μ-I and two N atoms from two different bpp ligands. Each rhomboid [Cu(2)I(2)] unit can be considered as a four-connecting node linked to the symmetry-related [Cu(2)I(2)] units via two pairs of bpp ligands to form a one-dimensional double chain along the c axis. The dimensions of the [Cu(2)I(2)(bpp)(2)](2) rings in (I) and (II) are different, which may be due to the presence of different guest solvent molecules in the structures. In (I), one p-toluidine molecule, derived from an Ullmann coupling reaction of 4-iodotoluene with ammonia, interacts with the [Cu(2)I(2)] cluster fragment through N-H···I hydrogen bonds, while the two p-toluidine molecules interact via N-H···N hydrogen bonds. In (II), two I atoms of each 1,4-diiodobenzene molecule are linked to the I atoms of the [Cu(2)I(2)] fragments from a neighbouring chain via I···I secondary interactions.
22701699,0,2012,PLoS One,Dynamics of endoreplication during Drosophila posterior scutellar macrochaete development.,Endoreplication is a variant type of DNA replication, consisting only of alternating G1 and S phases. Many types of Drosophila tissues undergo endoreplication. However, the timing and the extent to which a single endocycling macrochaete undergoes temporally programmed endoreplication during development are unclear. Here, we focused on the dynamics of endoreplication during posterior scutellar (pSC) macrochaete development. Quantitative analyses of C values in shaft cells and socket cells revealed a gradual rise from 8C and 4C at 8 hours after pupal formation (APF) to 72C and 24C at 29 hours APF, respectively. The validity of the values was further confirmed by the measurement of DNA content with a confocal laser microscope. BrdU incorporation assays demonstrated that shaft cells undergo four rounds of endoreplication from 18 to 29.5 hours APF. In contrast, socket cells undergo two rounds of endoreplication during the same period. Statistical analyses showed that the theoretical C values, based on BrdU assays, nearly coincide with the actually measured C values in socket cells, but not in shaft cells after 22 hours APF. These analyses suggest that socket cells undergo two rounds of endoreplication. However, the mechanism of endoreplication in the shaft cells may change from 22 hours APF, suggesting the possibility that shaft cells undergo two or four rounds of endoreplication during the periods. We also found that the timing of endoreplication differs, depending on the type of macrochaete. Moreover, endocycling in shaft cells of both the left and right sides of pSC bristle lineages occurs in the same pattern, indicating that the process is synchronized for specific types of macrochaete. Our findings suggest that endocycling in macrochaete cell lineages can be a model for understanding mechanisms of endoreplication at the single-cell level.
22694770,0,2012,J Sports Sci,Is bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy accurate in estimating changes in fat-free mass in judo athletes?,Bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) provides an affordable and practical assessment of fat-free mass (FFM). However, little information is available on the assessment of changes in fat-free mass in top-level athletes using BIS. The aim of this study was to examine the accuracy of BIS in tracking changes in fat-free mass of elite male judo athletes from a period of weight stability to just before competition, using the four-compartment model (4C model) as reference method. In total, 27 elite male judo athletes (age 22.2 ± 2.8 years) were evaluated. Measures of body volume assessed by air displacement plethysmography, bone mineral content by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and total-body water assessed with deuterium dilution were used in a 4C model. Fat-free mass was also assessed by BIS (FFM(BIS)). Changes in FFM(BIS) were not significantly different from measured by the reference method (P = 0.000). Furthermore, the r² was 0.62 and the standard error of the estimate was 1.03 kg. The limits of agreement ranged from -3.36 to 2.59 kg with no bias observed. These findings demonstrate the viability of BIS as a valid tool for tracking fat-free mass in elite male judo athletes. However, based on the wide limits of agreement observed, BIS is less valid at an individual level for tracking fat-free mass in these athletes.
22666175,0,2012,ScientificWorldJournal,Photoinduced synthesis of new diisochromenochromen-4-ones and their antimicrobial activities.,The diisochromenochromen-4-one 3a-3b, 4a-4c, 5a-6a  &amp; 7 have been prepared from the photocyclization reaction of bischromen-4-one 2a-2e. The later compounds are obtained from the O-alkylation of the suitable 3-hydroxy-2-aryl-4H-chromen-4-one 1a-1e with 4,4'-bischloromethyl-diphenyl in dry acetone, anhydrous K₂CO₃, and PTC (Bu₄N⁺I⁻) under refluxing conditions. The structures of compounds 2a-2e, 3a-3b, 4a-4c, 5a-6a  &amp; 7 have been characterized from the rigorous analysis of their IR, ¹H-NMR, ¹³C-NMR, ESI-Mass, and elemental analysis. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the synthesized products were also evaluated against the Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Aspergillus janus and Penicillium glabrum, respectively. Some of the tested compounds showed significant activity against the above-said microorganisms.
22648566,0,2012,Dalton Trans,Mechanistic insights on platinum- and palladium-pincer catalyzed coupling and cyclopropanation reactions between olefins.,The mechanism of M(II)-PNP-pincer catalyzed reaction between (i) ethene, (ii) trans-butene with 2-methylbut-2-ene, 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene and tert-butylbutene is examined by using density functional theory methods (where M = Pt or Pd). All key intermediates and transition states involved in the reaction are precisely located on the respective potential energy surfaces using the popular DFT functionals such as mPW1K, M06-2X, and B3LYP in conjunction with the 6-31+G** basis set. The reaction between these olefins can lead to a linear coupling product or a substituted cyclopropane. The energetic comparison between coupling as well as cyclopropanation pathways involving four pairs of olefins for both platinum (1-4) and palladium (5-8) catalyzed reactions is performed. The key events in the lower energy pathway in the mechanistic course involves (i) a C-C bond formation between the metal bound olefin (ethene or trans-butene) and a free olefin, and (ii) two successive [1,2] hydrogen migrations in the ensuing carbocationic intermediates (1c-4c, and 1d-4d), toward the formation of the coupling product. The computed barriers for these steps in the reaction of metal bound ethene to free tert-butylbutene (or other butenes) are found to be much lower than the corresponding steps when trans-butene is bound to the metal pincer. The Gibbs free energy differences between the transition states leading to the coupling product (TS(d-e)) and that responsible for cyclopropanated product (TS(d-g)) are found to be diminishingly closer in the case of the platinum pincer as compared to that in the palladium system. The computed energetics indicate that the coupled product prefers to remain as a metal olefin complex, consistent with the earlier experimental reports.
22639957,0,2012,Plant Biol (Stuttg),Cell division and endoreduplication play important roles in stem swelling of tuber mustard (Brassica juncea Coss. var. tumida Tsen et Lee).,We investigated spatio-temporal variations in cell division and the occurrence of endoreduplication in cells of tuber mustard stems during development. Cells in the stem had 8C nuclei (C represents DNA content of a two haploid genome), since it is an allotetraploid species derived from diploid Brassica rapa (AA) and B. nigra (BB), thus indicating the occurrence of endoreduplication. Additionally, we observed a dynamic change of cell ploidy in different regions of the swollen stems, with a decrease in 4C proportion in P4-1 and a sharp increase in 8C cells that became the dominant cell type (86.33% at most) in the inner pith cells. Furthermore, cDNAs of 14 cell cycle genes and four cell expansion genes were cloned and their spatial transcripts analysed in order to understand their roles in stem development. The expression of most cell cycle genes peaked in regions of the outer pith (P2 or P3), some genes regulating S/G2 and G2/M (BjCDKB1;2, BjCYCB1;1 and BjCYCB1;2) significantly decrease in P5 and P6, while G1/S regulators (BjE2Fa, BjE2Fb and BjE2Fc) showed a relative high expression level in the inner pith (P5) where cells were undergoing endoreduplication. Coincidentally, BjXTH1and BjXTH2 were exclusively expressed in the endoreduplicated cells. Our results suggest that cells of outer pith regions (P2 and P3) mainly divide for cell proliferation, while cells of the inner pith expand through endoreduplication. Endoreduplication could trigger expression of BjXTH1 and BjXTH2 and thus function in cell expansion of the pith tissue.
22622450,0,2012,Dalton Trans,Hydrothermal and solid-state transformation of ruthenium-supported Keggin-type heteropolytungstates [XW11O39{Ru(II)(benzene)(H2O)}]n- (X = P (n = 5), Si (n = 6), Ge (n = 6)) to ruthenium-substituted Keggin-type heteropolytungstates.,A new pathway for the preparation of mono-ruthenium (Ru)(iii)-substituted Keggin-type heteropolytungstates with an aqua ligand, [PW(11)O(39)Ru(iii)(H(2)O)](4-) (1a), [SiW(11)O(39)Ru(iii)(H(2)O)](5-) (1b) and [GeW(11)O(39)Ru(iii)(H(2)O)](5-) (1c), using [Ru(ii)(benzene)Cl(2)](2) as a Ru source was described. Compounds 1a-1c were prepared by reacting [XW(11)O(39)](n-) (X = P, Si and Ge) with [Ru(ii)(benzene)Cl(2)](2) under hydrothermal condition and were isolated as caesium salts. Ru(benzene)-supported heteropolytungstates, [PW(11)O(39){Ru(ii)(benzene)(H(2)O)}](5-) (2a), [SiW(11)O(39){Ru(ii)(benzene)(H(2)O)}](6-) (2b) and [GeW(11)O(39){Ru(ii)(benzene)(H(2)O)}](6-) (2c), were first produced in the reaction media, and then transformed to 1a, 1b and 1c, respectively, under hydrothermal conditions. Calcination of Ru(benzene)-supported heteropolytungstates, 2a, 2b and 2c, in the solid state produced mixtures of 1a, 1b and 1c with CO (carbon monoxide)-coordinated complexes, [PW(11)O(39)Ru(ii)(CO)](5-) (4a), [SiW(11)O(39)Ru(ii)(CO)](6-) (4b) and [GeW(11)O(39)Ru(ii)(CO)](6-) (4c), respectively. From comparison of their catalytic activities in water oxidation reaction, it was indicated that ruthenium should be incorporated in the heteropolytungstate in order to promote catalytic activity.
22621284,0,2012,Inorg Chem,Magnetooptical and structural investigations of five dimeric cobalt(II) complexes mimicking metalloenzyme active sites.,Four novel cobalt(II) complexes mimicking metalloenzyme active sites, novel C(14)H(22)Cl(12)Co(2)O(13)·2C(3)H(8)O (1), C(28)H(36)Cl(24)Co(4)O(28)·4C(4)H(8)O(2) (2), C(16)H(22)Cl(12)Co(2)O(13)·C(2)HCl(3)O(2) (3), C(16)H(22)Cl(12)Co(2)O(13) (4), and one known C(40)H(78)Cl(8)Co(2)O(17) (5) are composed of the same core of two high-spin cobalt(II) centers triply bridged by water and two trichloroacetato (1-4) or two pivalate (5) groups but differ in terminal ligands. The crystal structures of new compounds 1-4 belong to the space groups P ̅1, P2(1)/c, P ̅1, and Pbcn, respectively. All five investigated complexes contain Co atoms in distorted octahedral coordination. The complexes were characterized by magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements and by variable-temperature variable-field magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy. Experimental data were analyzed in the frame of the theoretical model, which includes an unquenched orbital moment of the Co(II) ions. All investigated compounds are antiferromagnetically coupled with exchange constants in the range -1.5 to -2.1 cm(-1). However, there is a significant difference between the crystal-field-splitting parameters.
22595891,0,2012,Dalton Trans,Theoretical study on the influence of ancillary and cyclometalated ligands on the electronic structures and optoelectronic properties of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes.,We report a theoretical analysis of a series of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes (dox)(2)Ir(acac) [dox = 2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazolato-N,C(2), acac = acetylacetonate] (1a), (fox)(2)Ir(acac) [fox = 2,5-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazolato-N,C(2)] (1b), (fox)(2)Ir(Et(2)dtc) [Et(2)dtc = N,N'-diethyldithiocarbamate] (2), (fox)(2)Ir(Et(2)dtp) [Et(2)dtp = O,O'-diethyldithiophosphate] (3), (pypz)(2)Ir(acac) [pypz = 3,5-di(2-pyridyl)pyrazole] (4a), (O-pypz)(2)Ir(acac) (4b), (S-pypz)(2)Ir(acac) (4c) and (bptz)(2)Ir(acac) [bptz = 3-tert-butyl-5-(2-pyridyl)triazole] (5) by using the density functional theory (DFT) method to investigate their electronic structures and photophysical properties and obtain further insights into the phosphorescent efficiency mechanism. Meanwhile, we also investigate the influence of ancillary and cyclometalated ligands on the properties of the above complexes. The results reveal that the nature of the ancillary ligands can influence the electron density distributions of frontier molecular orbitals and their energies, resulting in change in transition character and emission color, while the different cyclometalated ligands have a large impact on the charge transfer performances of the studied complexes. The calculated absorption and luminescence properties of the four complexes 1a, 1b, 2 and 3 are compared with the available experimental data and a good agreement is obtained. Further, the assumed complexes 4a and 4b possess better charge transfer abilities and more balanced charge transfer rates, and they are potential candidates as blue-emitting materials.
22594257,0,2012,Acta Pol Pharm,Synthesis and characterization of (Z)-N-(1-[2-{3-[(dimethylamino)methyl)]-2-methoxyphenyl}-5-(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-3(2H)-yl]ethylidene) benzenamine derivatives as potent antifungal agents.,In the present study, a series of (Z)-N-(1-[2-{3-[(dimethylamino)methyl)]-2-methoxyphenyl}-5-(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-3(2H)-yl]ethylidene)benzenamine derivatives have been synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antifungal activity and were compared with the standard drug, clotrimazole. The compounds demonstrated excellent to weak antifungal activity. Among the synthesized derivatives, 4f and 4h showed significant activity and 4c exhibited moderate activity against Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Aspergillus niger as compared with the standard antifungal agent - clotrimazole. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the compounds was in the range of 1.62-25 microg/mL against fungi. Furthermore, the substitution of chloro, nitro and methoxy groups at para position of benzene moiety play an important role in enhancing the antifungal activity of this class of compounds.
22573293,0,2012,Br J Radiol,Monte Carlo N-particle simulation of neutron-based sterilisation of anthrax contamination.,OBJECTIVE: To simulate the neutron-based sterilisation of anthrax contamination by Monte Carlo N-particle (MCNP) 4C code.METHODS: Neutrons are elementary particles that have no charge. They are 20 times more effective than electrons or γ-rays in killing anthrax spores on surfaces and inside closed containers. Neutrons emitted from a (252)Cf neutron source are in the 100 keV to 2 MeV energy range. A 2.5 MeV D-D neutron generator can create neutrons at up to 10(13) n s(-1) with current technology. All these enable an effective and low-cost method of killing anthrax spores.RESULTS: There is no effect on neutron energy deposition on the anthrax sample when using a reflector that is thicker than its saturation thickness. Among all three reflecting materials tested in the MCNP simulation, paraffin is the best because it has the thinnest saturation thickness and is easy to machine. The MCNP radiation dose and fluence simulation calculation also showed that the MCNP-simulated neutron fluence that is needed to kill the anthrax spores agrees with previous analytical estimations very well.CONCLUSION: The MCNP simulation indicates that a 10 min neutron irradiation from a 0.5 g (252)Cf neutron source or a 1 min neutron irradiation from a 2.5 MeV D-D neutron generator may kill all anthrax spores in a sample. This is a promising result because a 2.5 MeV D-D neutron generator output &gt;10(13) n s(-1) should be attainable in the near future. This indicates that we could use a D-D neutron generator to sterilise anthrax contamination within several seconds.

22525789,0,2012,Methods,Chromosome conformation capture on chip in single Drosophila melanogaster tissues.,Chromosomes are protein-DNA complexes that encode life. In a cell nucleus, chromosomes are folded in a highly specific manner, which connects strongly to some of their paramount functions, such as DNA replication and gene transcription. Chromosome conformation capture methodologies allow researchers to detect chromosome folding, by quantitatively measuring which genomic sequences are in close proximity in nuclear space. Here, we describe a modified chromosome conformation capture on chip (4C) protocol, which is specifically designed for detection of chromosome folding in a single Drosophila melanogaster tissue. Our protocol enables 4C analyses on a limited number of cells, which is crucial for fly tissues, because these contain relatively low numbers of cells. We used this protocol to demonstrate that target genes of Polycomb group proteins interact with each other in nuclear space of third instar larval brain cells. Major benefits of using D. melanogaster in 4C studies are: (1) powerful and tractable genetic approaches can be incorporated; (2) short generation time allows use of complex genotypes; and (3) compact and well annotated genome. We anticipate that our sensitized 4C method will be generally applicable to detect chromosome folding in other fly tissues.

22493630,0,2012,J Breast Cancer,Classification of Metastatic versus Non-Metastatic Axillary Nodes in Breast Cancer Patients: Value of Cortex-Hilum Area Ratio with Ultrasound.,PURPOSE: To investigate the significance of the cortex-hilum (CH) area ratio and longitudinal-transverse (LT) axis ratio and the blood flow pattern for diagnosis of metastatic axillary lymph nodes by ultrasound in breast cancer patients.METHODS: From October 2005 to July 2006, we prospectively evaluated axillary nodes with ultrasound in 205 consecutive patients who had category 4B, 4C or 5 breast lesions according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System-Ultrasound (BI-RADS-Ultrasound®). Among the 205, there were 24 patients who had pathologic verification of breast cancer and axillary lymph node status. For a total of 80 axillary nodes we measured the areas of the cortex and hilum of lymph nodes and calculated the area ratio. We also measured the length of the longitudinal and transverse axis of the lymph nodes and calculated the length ratio. We evaluated the blood flow pattern on power Doppler imaging and classified each lymph node into a central or peripheral pattern. Diagnostic performance was analyzed according to positive criteria for lymph node metastasis (CH area ratio &gt;2, LT axis ratio &lt;2, peripheral type on power Doppler imaging).RESULTS: The sensitivity of the CH area ratio was superior to that of the LT axis ratio (94.1% vs. 82.3%, p=0.031) and to that of the blood flow pattern (94.1% vs. 29.4%, p=0.009). For specificity, all three evaluating parameters had high values (89.1-95.6%) and no significant differences were found (p=0.121). The CH area ratio had a better positive predictive value than the LT axis ratio (94.1% vs. 80.0%, p=0.030) and power Doppler imaging (94.1% vs. 66.6%, p=0.028). For the negative predictive value, the CH area ratio was superior to the LT axis ratio (95.6% vs. 86.6%, p=0.035) and the blood flow pattern (95.6% vs. 63.0%, p=0.027).CONCLUSION: We recommend the CH area ratio of an axillary lymph node on ultrasound as a quantitative indicator for the classification of lymph nodes. The CH area ratio can improve diagnostic performance when compared with the LT axis ratio or blood flow pattern.
22482618,0,2012,Med Phys,Characteristics of miniature electronic brachytherapy x-ray sources based on TG-43U1 formalism using Monte Carlo simulation techniques.,PURPOSE: The goal of this study is to determine a method for Monte Carlo (MC) characterization of the miniature electronic brachytherapy x-ray sources (MEBXS) and to set dosimetric parameters according to TG-43U1 formalism. TG-43U1 parameters were used to get optimal designs of MEBXS. Parameters that affect the dose distribution such as anode shapes, target thickness, target angles, and electron beam source characteristics were evaluated. Optimized MEBXS designs were obtained and used to determine radial dose functions and 2D anisotropy functions in the electron energy range of 25-80 keV.METHODS: Tungsten anode material was considered in two different geometries, hemispherical and conical-hemisphere. These configurations were analyzed by the 4C MC code with several different optimization techniques. The first optimization compared target thickness layers versus electron energy. These optimized thicknesses were compared with published results by Ihsan et al. [Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. B 264, 371-377 (2007)]. The second optimization evaluated electron source characteristics by changing the cathode shapes and electron energies. Electron sources studied included; (1) point sources, (2) uniform cylinders, and (3) nonuniform cylindrical shell geometries. The third optimization was used to assess the apex angle of the conical-hemisphere target. The goal of these optimizations was to produce 2D-dose anisotropy functions closer to unity. An overall optimized MEBXS was developed from this analysis. The results obtained from this model were compared to known characteristics of HDR (125)I, LDR (103)Pd, and Xoft Axxent™ electronic brachytherapy source (XAEBS) [Med. Phys. 33, 4020-4032 (2006)].RESULTS: The optimized anode thicknesses as a function of electron energy is fitted by the linear equation Y (μm) = 0.0459X (keV)-0.7342. The optimized electron source geometry is obtained for a disk-shaped parallel beam (uniform cylinder) with 0.9 mm radius. The TG-43 distribution is less sensitive to the shape of the conical-hemisphere anode than the hemispherical anode. However, the optimized apex angle of conical-hemisphere anode was determined to be 60°. For the hemispherical targets, calculated radial dose function values at a distance of 5 cm were 0.137, 0.191, 0.247, and 0.331 for 40, 50, 60, and 80 keV electrons, respectively. These values for the conical-hemisphere targets are 0.165, 0.239, 0.305, and 0.412, respectively. Calculated 2D anisotropy functions values for the hemispherical target shape were F(1 cm, 0°) = 1.438 and F(1 cm, 0°) = 1.465 for 30 and 80 keV electrons, respectively. The corresponding values for conical-hemisphere targets are 1.091 and 1.241, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: A method for the characterizations of MEBXS using TG-43U1 dosimetric data using the MC MCNP4C has been presented. The effects of target geometry, thicknesses, and electron source geometry have been investigated. The final choices of MEBXS design are conical-hemisphere target shapes having an apex angle of 60°. Tungsten material having an optimized thickness versus electron energy and a 0.9 mm radius of uniform cylinder as a cathode produces optimal electron source characteristics.
22467491,0,2012,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),2'-chloro-4'-aminoflavone derivatives selectively targeting hepatocarcinoma cells: convenient synthetic process, G(2)/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis triggers.,A series of 2'-chloro-4'-nitroflavone and 2'-chloro-4'-aminoflavone derivatives were synthesized by a convenient synthetic process. The in vitro anti-proliferation ability of these compounds was evaluated against hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2), breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7), and human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (K562). Most of synthetic compounds possessed notable anti-proliferation activity against HepG2 cells and little activity against MCF-7 cells and K562 cells. In particular, compounds 4c and 4e exhibited high anti-proliferation activity against HepG2 cells with IC(50) at about 2.0 µM. Further toxicity screening toward normal human hepatocytes indicated that some compounds had low toxicity against normal liver cells, among which 4e displayed very weak effects on QSG7701 and HL7702 cells, with IC(50) values &gt;100 and 50 µM, respectively. Compound 4c, with the best anti-proliferation activity in amino-substituted flavones (IC(50) = 2.0 µM), was selected for further evaluation of its effects on apoptosis and the cell cycle. HepG2 cells were exposed to this compound at 10 µM, which induced nuclear disassembly and DNA fragmentation. Flow cytometry analysis suggested that the population of apoptotic cells greatly increased in the 4c-treated HepG2 cells, and the cell cycle was arrested at the G(2)/M phase.
22466757,0,2012,Dalton Trans,Synthesis, structural characterization, antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of aziridine, 2-aminoethylaziridine and azirine complexes of copper(II) and palladium(II).,The synthesis, spectroscopic and X-ray structural characterization of copper(II) and palladium(II) complexes with aziridine ligands as 2-dimethylaziridine HNCH(2)CMe(2) (a), the bidentate N-(2-aminoethyl)aziridines C(2)H(4)NC(2)H(4)NH(2) (b) or CH(2)CMe(2)NCH(2)CMe(2)NH(2) (c) as well as the unsaturated azirine NCH(2)CPh (d) are reported. Cleavage of the cyclometallated Pd(II) dimer [μ-Cl(C(6)H(4)CHMeNMe(2)-C,N)Pd](2) with ligand a yielded compound [Cl(NHCH(2)CMe(2))(C(6)H(4)CHMe(2)NMe(2)-C,N)Pd] (1a). The reaction of the aziridine complex trans-[Cl(2)Pd(HNC(2)H(4))(2)] with an excess of aziridine in the presence of AgOTf gave the ionic chelate complex trans-[(C(2)H(4)NC(2)H(4)NH(2)-N,N')(2)Pd](OTf)(2) (2b) which contains the new ligand b formed by an unexpected insertion and ring opening reaction of two aziridines (&quot;aziridine dimerization&quot;). CuCl(2) reacted in pure HNC(2)H(4) or HNCH(2)CMe(2) (b) again by &quot;dimerization&quot; to give the tris-chelated ionic complex [Cu(C(2)H(4)NC(2)H(4)NH(2)-N,N')(3)]Cl(2) (3b) or the bis-chelated complex [CuCl(C(2)H(2)Me(2)NC(2)H(2)Me(2)NH(2)-N,N')(2)]Cl (4c). By addition of 2H-3-phenylazirine (d) to PdCl(2), trans-[Cl(2)Pd(NCH(2)CPh)(2)] (5d) was formed. All new compounds were characterized by NMR, IR and mass spectra and also by X-ray structure analyses (except 3b). Additionally the cytotoxic effects of these complexes were examined on HL-60 and NALM-6 human leukemia cells and melanoma WM-115 cells. The antimicrobial activity was also determined. The growth of Gram-positive bacterial strains (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis) was inhibited by almost all tested complexes at the concentrations of 37.5-300.0 μg mL(-1). However, MIC values of complexes obtained for Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa, as well as for C. albicans yeast, mostly exceeded 300 μg mL(-1). The highest antibacterial activity was achieved by complexes 1a and 2b. Complex 2b also inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria.
22460028,0,2012,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Design, synthesis, molecular docking and biological evaluation of new dithiocarbamates substituted benzimidazole and chalcones as possible chemotherapeutic agents.,A series of novel dithiocarbamates with benzimidazole and chalcone scaffold have been designed synthesised and evaluated for their antimitotic activity. Compounds 4c and 9d display the most promising antimitotic activity with IC(50) of 1.66 μM and 1.52 μM respectively.
22443764,0,2012,J Chem Phys,Fully converged integral cross sections of collision induced dissociation, four-center, and single exchange reactions, and accuracy of the centrifugal sudden approximation in H2 + D2 reaction.,The initial state selected time-dependent wave packet method was employed to calculate the integral cross sections for the H(2) + D(2) reaction with and without the centrifugal sudden (CS) approximation by including all important K (the projection of the total angular momentum on the body-fixed axis) blocks. With a full-dimensional model, the first fully converged coupled-channel (CC) cross sections for different competitive processes from the ground rotational state were obtained: collision induced dissociation (CID), four-center (4C) reaction and single exchange (SE) reaction. The effect of the total angular momentum J on the reaction dynamics of H(2) + D(2) and the accuracy of the CS approximation have also been studied. It was found that the CID and SE processes occur in a wide range of J values while the 4C process can only take place in a narrow window of J values. For this reason, the CC cross section for the 4C channel is merely comparable to the SE channel. A comparison of the integral cross sections from CC and CS calculations showed that the CS approximation works well for the CID process but not for the 4C and SE processes, and the discrepancy between the CC and CS cross sections grows larger as the translational energy and/or the vibrational energy increase(s).
22356232,0,2012,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,Syntheses of 1-[2-(Phosphonomethoxy)Alkyl] thymine monophosphates and an evaluation of their inhibitory activity toward human thymidine phosphorylase.,A series of new monophosphates of 1-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)alkyl]thymines, such as PMPTp(,) 3-MeO-PMPTp, HPMPTp, and FPMPTp, were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit human thymidine phosphorylase. Kinetic measurements of enzyme activity were performed using thymidine and inorganic phosphate as the substrates. The data show that some monophosphates provide a considerable increase of the multisubstrate inhibitory effect. The highest inhibitory potency was found with (R)-FPMPTp 4c (K (i) (dT) = 4.09 ± 0.47 μM, K (i)(P(i)) = 2.13 ± 0.29 μM) and (R) 3-MeO-PMPTp 4d (K (i) (dT) = 5.78 ± 0.71 μM, K (i)(P(i)) = 2.71 ± 0.37 μM).
22318166,0,2012,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis, evaluation and docking studies on 3-alkoxy-4-methanesulfonamido acetophenone derivatives as non ulcerogenic anti-inflammatory agents.,A series of 3-alkoxy-4-methanesulfonamido acetophenone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model. The synthesized compounds were also investigated for their gastric ulcerogenic potential. The compounds 4a, 4c and 4d showed comparable anti-inflammatory activity to rofecoxib and indomethacin, the standard drugs taken in both studies and were also non ulcerogenic at the test doses. In silico (docking studies) were done to investigate the hypothetical binding mode of the target compounds to the cyclooxygenase isoenzyme (COX-2). A binding model has been proposed based on the docking studies. Selected physicochemical properties were calculated for theoretical ADME profiling of the compounds and excellent compliance was shown with Lipinski's rules.
22311585,0,2012,ChemMedChem,Discovery of novel 2-N-aryl-substituted benzenesulfonamidoacetamides: orally bioavailable tubulin polymerization inhibitors with marked antitumor activities.,The discovery and optimization of a series of 2-N-aryl-substituted benzenesulfonamidoacetamides as novel tubulin polymerization inhibitors are described. Pharmacophore exploration of hit compound AH-487 identified the optimal structure of N-heteroaryl-2-(4-methoxy-N-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)phenylsulfonamido)acetamide as a potent antimitotic agent. Subsequent lead compounds 4b and 4c, with N-4-aminophenyl and N-1H-indol-5-yl substitutions at the acetamide position, respectively, were shown to induce cell-cycle arrest at the G(2) /M phase and lead to an accumulation of HeLa cells in the sub-G(1) phase. More significantly, these lead compounds (3c, 4b, and 4c) exhibit impressive cytotoxicity against a panel of cancer cells including P-glycoprotein-overexpressing MDR-positive cells, with potency greater than or equal to clinically studied benzenesulfonamide E7010. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that derivatives of AH-487 disrupt mitotic spindles by inhibiting microtubule polymerization and induce apoptosis via induction of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in tumor cells. The optimized leads 4b and 4c strongly inhibited the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in a mouse xenograft model.
22302210,0,2012,Acta Radiol,Value of the US BI-RADS final assessment following mastectomy: BI-RADS 4 and 5 lesions.,BACKGROUND: Clinical examination is not entirely sufficient for evaluation of the postoperative site for follow-up of patients with mastectomy. A few studies have reported that postoperative follow-up US evaluation allows early detection and proper management of local tumor recurrence.PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the American College of Radiology (ACR) ultrasonographic (US) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories 4 and 5 breast lesions at the mastectomy site.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our institutional review board approved this study and waived the need for informed consent. We retrospectively reviewed the consecutive post-mastectomy US exams for palpable and non-palpable lesions in the post-mastectomy chest wall that were categorized as BI-RADS 4 (subcategorized 4a, 4b, and 4c) or 5 between January 2007 and April 2010. The positive predictive value (PPV) for final assessment was evaluated.RESULTS: From 2681 post-mastectomy US examinations, we obtained a study population of 50 patients with 50 lesions (20 palpable, 30 non-palpable). There were nine (45%) malignancies among the palpable lesions and six (20%) malignancies among the non-palpable lesions. The palpability showed no significant correlation with malignancy in overall subcategorization (P &gt;0.05). The PPVs of categories 4 and 5 were 14.3% for category 4a, 62.5% for category 4b, 100% for category 4c, and 100% for category 5.CONCLUSION: The ACR US BI-RADS categorization of 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 for breast lesions at the mastectomy site is a feasible method for predicting local recurrence. All lesions should be managed according to US characteristics during evaluation of local recurrence at the mastectomy site, regardless of palpability.
22299580,0,2012,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of some thiazole derivatives as new cholinesterase inhibitors.,In the present study, some thiazole derivatives were synthesized via the ring closure reaction of 1-[2-(2-oxobenzo[d]thiazol-3(2H)-yl)acetyl]thiosemicarbazide with various phenacyl bromides. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral data and elemental analyses. Each derivative was evaluated for its ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) using a modification of Ellman's spectrophotometric method. The compounds were also investigated for their cytotoxic properties using MTT assay. The most potent AChE inhibitor was found as compound 4e (IC(50) = 25.5 ± 2.12 µg/mL) followed by compounds 4i (IC(50) = 38.50 ± 2.12 µg/mL), 4c (IC(50) = 58.42 ± 3.14 µg/mL) and 4g (IC(50) = 68 ± 2.12 µg/mL) when compared with eserine (IC(50) = 0.025 ± 0.01 µg/mL). Effective compounds on AChE exhibited weak inhibition on BuChE (IC(50) &gt; 80 µg/mL). MTT assay indicated that the cytotoxic dose (IC(50) = 71.67 ± 7.63 µg/mL) of compound 4e was higher than its effective dose.

22282393,0,2012,Chemistry,Rare-earth-metal-hydrocarbyl complexes bearing linked cyclopentadienyl or fluorenyl ligands: synthesis, catalyzed styrene polymerization, and structure-reactivity relationship.,A series of rare-earth-metal-hydrocarbyl complexes bearing N-type functionalized cyclopentadienyl (Cp) and fluorenyl (Flu) ligands were facilely synthesized. Treatment of [Y(CH(2)SiMe(3))(3)(thf)(2)] with equimolar amount of the electron-donating aminophenyl-Cp ligand C(5)Me(4)H-C(6)H(4)-o-NMe(2) afforded the corresponding binuclear monoalkyl complex [({C(5)Me(4)-C(6)H(4)-o-NMe(μ-CH(2))}Y{CH(2)SiMe(3)})(2)] (1a) via alkyl abstraction and C-H activation of the NMe(2) group. The lutetium bis(allyl) complex [(C(5)Me(4)-C(6)H(4)-o-NMe(2))Lu(η(3)-C(3)H(5))(2)] (2b), which contained an electron-donating aminophenyl-Cp ligand, was isolated from the sequential metathesis reactions of LuCl(3) with (C(5)Me(4)-C(6)H(4)-o-NMe(2))Li (1 equiv) and C(3)H(5)MgCl (2 equiv). Following a similar procedure, the yttrium- and scandium-bis(allyl) complexes, [(C(5)Me(4)-C(5)H(4)N)Ln(η(3)-C(3)H(5))(2)] (Ln=Y (3a), Sc (3b)), which also contained electron-withdrawing pyridyl-Cp ligands, were also obtained selectively. Deprotonation of the bulky pyridyl-Flu ligand (C(13)H(9)-C(5)H(4)N) by [Ln(CH(2)SiMe(3))(3)(thf)(2)] generated the rare-earth-metal-dialkyl complexes, [(η(3)-C(13)H(8)-C(5)H(4)N)Ln(CH(2)SiMe(3))(2)(thf)] (Ln=Y (4a), Sc (4b), Lu (4c)), in which an unusual asymmetric η(3)-allyl bonding mode of Flu moiety was observed. Switching to the bidentate yttrium-trisalkyl complex [Y(CH(2)C(6)H(4)-o-NMe(2))(3)], the same reaction conditions afforded the corresponding yttrium bis(aminobenzyl) complex [(η(3)-C(13)H(8)-C(5)H(4)N)Y(CH(2)C(6)H(4)-o-NMe(2))(2)] (5). Complexes 1-5 were fully characterized by (1)H and (13)C NMR and X-ray spectroscopy, and by elemental analysis. In the presence of both [Ph(3)C][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] and AliBu(3), the electron-donating aminophenyl-Cp-based complexes 1 and 2 did not show any activity towards styrene polymerization. In striking contrast, upon activation with [Ph(3)C][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] only, the electron-withdrawing pyridyl-Cp-based complexes 3, in particular scandium complex 3b, exhibited outstanding activitiy to give perfectly syndiotactic (rrrr &gt;99%) polystyrene, whereas their bulky pyridyl-Flu analogues (4 and 5) in combination with [Ph(3)C][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] and AliBu(3) displayed much-lower activity to afford syndiotactic-enriched polystyrene.
22266816,0,2012,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),In vivo antihyperlipidemic activity of a new series of N-(benzoylphenyl) and N-(acetylphenyl)-1-benzofuran-2-carboxamides in rats.,A new series of N-(benzoylphenyl) and N-(acetylphenyl)-1-benzofuran-2-carboxamides (3a-3d and 4a'-4c') were synthesized. Compounds (3a, 3b, and 4a'-4c') were tested in vivo using Triton-WR-1339-induced hyperlipidemic rats as an experimental model for their hypolipidemic activity. The tested animals were divided into eight groups: control, hyperlipidemic, 3a, 3b, 4a', 4b', 4c', and bezafibrate. At a dose of 15 mg/kg, the elevated plasma triglyceride (TG) levels were significantly reduced in compounds 3b (p &lt;0.0001) and 4c' (p &lt;0.05) after 12 and 24 h compared to the normal control group. Furthermore, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were remarkably increased in compounds 3b (p &lt;0.001) and 4c' (p &lt;0.05). Meanwhile, compound 4b' slightly reduced the TG levels after 12 and 24 h. The present study demonstrated new properties of the novel series of benzofuran-2-carboxamides 3b and 4c' as potent lipid-lowering agents. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that compounds 3b and 4c' may have a promising potential in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and coronary heart diseases.
22263718,0,2012,J Org Chem,Calculations of the effects of methyl groups on the energy differences between cyclooctatetraene and bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene and between their iron tricarbonyl complexes.,In accord with experiment, DFT calculations find that cyclooctatetraene (COT, 1a) is lower in energy than its valence isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene (BCOT, 3a) and that the iron tricarbonyl complex of COT [COT-Fe(CO)(3), 2a] is lower in energy than the iron tricarbonyl complex of BCOT [BCOT-Fe(CO)(3), 4a]. Also in agreement with experiment are the DFT findings that 1,3,5,7-tetramethylCOT (TMCOT, 1b) is lower in energy than 1,3,5,7-tetramethylBCOT (TMBCOT, 3b), but that the iron tricarbonyl complex of TMCOT [TMCOT-Fe(CO)(3), 2b] is higher in energy than the iron tricarbonyl complex of TMBCOT [TMBCOT-Fe(CO)(3), 4b]. Calculations of the energies of isodesmic reactions allow the effect of each of the four methyl groups in 1b-4b to be analyzed in terms of its additive contribution to the relative energies of TMCOT (1b) and TMBCOT (3b) and to the Fe(CO)(3) binding energies in TMCOT-Fe(CO)(3) (2b) and TMBCOT-Fe(CO)(3) (4b). Our calculations also predict that the eight methyl groups in octamethylCOT-Fe(CO)(3) [OMCOT-Fe(CO)(3), 2c] should have much more than twice the effect of the four methyl groups in TMCOT-Fe(CO)(3) (2b) on raising the energy of OMCOT-Fe(CO)(3) (2c), relative to that of OMBCOT-Fe(CO)(3) (4c). The effects of the interactions between the methyl groups in OMCOT-Fe(CO)(3) (2c) and OMBCOT-Fe(CO)(3) (4c) are dissected and discussed.
22238538,0,2012,Beilstein J Org Chem,Dependency of the regio- and stereoselectivity of intramolecular, ring-closing glycosylations upon the ring size.,Phenyl 3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-2-O-(3-carboxypropionyl)-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (1) was condensed via its pentafluorophenyl ester 2 with 5-aminopentyl (4a), 4-aminobutyl (4b), 3-aminopropyl (4c) and 2-aminoethyl 4,6-O-benzylidene-β-D-glucopyranoside (4d), prepared from the corresponding N-Cbz protected glucosides 3a-d, to give the corresponding 2-[3-(alkylcarbamoyl)propionyl] tethered saccharides 5a-d. Intramolecular, ring closing glycosylation of the saccharides with NIS and TMSOTf afforded the tethered β(1→3) linked disaccharides 6a-c, the α(1→3) linked disaccharides 7a-d and the α(1→2) linked disaccharide 8d in ratios depending upon the ring size formed during glycosylation. No β(1→2) linked disaccharides were formed. Molecular modeling of saccharides 6-8 revealed that a strong aromatic stacking interaction between the aromatic parts of the benzyl and benzylidene protecting groups in the galactosyl and glucosyl moieties was mainly responsible for the observed regioselectivity and anomeric selectivity of the ring-closing glycosylation step.
22237836,0,2012,Chemistry,Large-scale honeycomb microstructures constructed by platinum-acetylide gelators through supramolecular self-assembly.,A series of new platinum-acetylide complexes 4a-4c and 6a-6c were synthesized and characterized. The gelation properties of these compounds were investigated by the &quot;stable-to-inversion-of-test-tube&quot; method. Unlike compounds 4a-4c, amides 6b and 6c can gelate a variety of nonpolar alkyl solvents; this result indicates that the hydrogen bonds between amide groups play an important role in the formation of metallic organogels. Interestingly, compared to the typical morphologies of known organogels or metallic organogels, compounds 6b and 6c exhibited highly ordered honeycomb patterns on a large-scale (determined by SEM analysis). To investigate the driving forces for the self-assembly process, concentration-dependent (1)H NMR spectroscopy and a competitive experiment between hydrogen bonds were used to confirm that intermolecular hydrogen bonding play an essential role during the formation of supramolecular aggregates.
22226316,0,2012,Homeopathy,Effects of Ignatia amara in mouse behavioural models.,BACKGROUND: Ignatia amara (Ignatia), a remedy made from the Strychnos ignatii seeds, is used for anxiety-related symptoms, but consistent evidence of its activity in reproducible experimental models is lacking. An investigation was performed in order to assess on mice, by means of emotional response models, the activity of homeopathic Ignatia dilutions/dynamizations.METHODS: Groups of 8 mice of the CD1 albino strain were treated intraperitoneally for 9 days with 0.3ml of five centesimal (C) dilutions/dynamizations of Ignatia (4C, 5C, 7C, 9C and 30C). Control mice were treated with the same hydroalcoholic (0.3%) solution used to dilute the medicines. Diazepam (1mg/kg) was the positive reference drug. Validated test models for locomotion and emotional response, the Open-Field (OF) and the Light-Dark (LD) tests, were employed. Five replications of the same protocol were carried out, in a randomised way using coded drugs/controls.RESULTS: In the OF the general locomotion of mice was slightly decreased by Ignatia 4C, but not by Ignatia 5C, 7C, 9C and 30C, indicating the absence of unspecific motor impairment or sedation by these dilutions/dynamizations. Ignatia and diazepam seemed to decrease the number of urine spots released in the OF during 10min, with borderline significance (P=0.083). In the LD the tested medicine showed anxiolytic-like activity (increase of time spent and distance travelled in the lit area), though to a lesser extent than diazepam. The highest and most significant difference with untreated controls (P&lt;0.01) was observed with the 9C dilution/dynamization. Among the 5 replication experiments, the best drug effects were obtained where the baseline anxiety of mice was higher.CONCLUSIONS: Homeopathic Ignatia dilutions/dynamizations (peak at 9C) modify some emotion-related symptoms in laboratory mice without affecting locomotion.
22213146,0,2012,Chemistry,Coordination polymers based on [Cp*Fe(η5-P5)]: solid-state structure and MAS NMR studies.,Slow diffusion reactions of the pentaphosphaferrocene [Cp*Fe(η(5)-P(5))] (Cp*=η(5)-C(5)Me(5) (1)) with CuX (X=Cl, Br, I) in different stoichiometric ratios and solvent mixtures result in the formation of one- and two-dimensional polymeric compounds 2-6 with molecular formula [{Cu(μ-X)}{Cp*Fe(μ(3),η(5):η(1):η(1)-P(5))}](n) (X=Cl (2a), I (2'c)), [{Cu(μ-I)}{Cp*Fe(μ(3),η(5):η(1):η(1)-P(5))}](n) (3), [{CuX}{Cp*Fe(μ(4),η(5):η(1):η(1):η(1)-P(5))}](n) (X=Cl (4a), Br (4b), I (4c), Br (4'b), I (4'c)), [{Cu(3)(μ-I)(2)(μ(3)-I)}{Cp*Fe(μ(5),η(5):η(1):η(1):η(1):η(1)-P(5))}](n) (5) and [{Cu(4)(μ-X)(4)(CH(3)CN)}{Cp*Fe(μ(7),η(5):η(2):η(1):η(1):η(1):η(1):η(1)-P(5))}](n) (X=Cl (6a), Br (6b)), respectively. The polymeric compounds have been characterised by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses and, for selected examples, by magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy. The solid-state structures demonstrate the versatile coordination modes of the cyclo-P(5) ligand of 1, extending from two to five coordinating phosphorus atoms in either σ or σ-and-π fashion. In compounds 2a, 2'c and 3, two phosphorus atoms of 1 coordinate to copper atoms in a 1,2 coordination mode (2a, 2'c) and an unprecedented 1,3 coordination mode (3) to form one-dimensional polymers. Compounds 4a-c, 4'b, 4'c and 5 represent two-dimensional coordination polymers. In compounds 4, three phosphorus atoms coordinate to copper atoms in a 1,2,4 coordination mode, whereas in 5 the cyclo-P(5) ligand binds in an unprecedented 1,2,3,4 coordination mode. The crystal structures of 6a,b display a tilted tube, in which all P atoms of the cyclo-P(5) ligand are coordinated to copper atoms in σ- and π-bonding modes.
23461030,0,2012,Tsitologiia,[Cellular mechanisms of regeneration of rats' liver after experimental myocardial infarction].,Morphological changes and regeneration activity of the rats' liver after an experimental myocardial infarction (MI), caused by a permanent left coronary artery occlusion, were investigated. It has been shown that in 6 months after MI there were considerable changes of the rats' liver circulatory system: the quantity of vessels per unit of area increased by 118%, thickness of their walls by 19%, and the average square of vessels lumens by 159%. The percentage of connective tissue in 6 months after MI increased more than in one and a half time in comparison with control. Inflammatory and necrotic changes in rats' liver remained for 6 months after MI. The liver injury caused by MI led to activation of regeneration processes in its parenchyma. In 6 months after MI, the number of 4c- hepatocytes decreased by 12% in comparison with control, and the number of 4c x 2- and 8c-hepatocytes increased by 45 and 71%, respectively. The mean level of hepatocytes ploidy increased in 6 months after MI by 11%. The dry mass of rats' hepatocytes increased in 6 months after MI by 19% in comparison with control. Thus, liver regeneration after MI is more due to hepatocytes hypertrophy than to their polyploidization.
21690198,61,2011,Genes Dev,The inactive X chromosome adopts a unique three-dimensional conformation that is dependent on Xist RNA.,Three-dimensional topology of DNA in the cell nucleus provides a level of transcription regulation beyond the sequence of the linear DNA. To study the relationship between the transcriptional activity and the spatial environment of a gene, we used allele-specific chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) technology to produce high-resolution topology maps of the active and inactive X chromosomes in female cells. We found that loci on the active X form multiple long-range interactions, with spatial segregation of active and inactive chromatin. On the inactive X, silenced loci lack preferred interactions, suggesting a unique random organization inside the inactive territory. However, escapees, among which is Xist, are engaged in long-range contacts with each other, enabling identification of novel escapees. Deletion of Xist results in partial refolding of the inactive X into a conformation resembling the active X without affecting gene silencing or DNA methylation. Our data point to a role for Xist RNA in shaping the conformation of the inactive X chromosome at least partially independent of transcription.
21451032,55,2011,J Neurosci,Neuronal mechanisms and attentional modulation of corticothalamic α oscillations.,Field potential oscillations in the ∼10 Hz range are known as the alpha rhythm. The genesis and function of alpha has been the subject of intense investigation for the past 80 years. Whereas early work focused on the thalamus as the pacemaker of alpha rhythm, subsequent slice studies revealed that pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of sensory cortices are capable of oscillating in the alpha frequency range independently. How thalamic and cortical generating mechanisms in the intact brain might interact to shape the organization and function of alpha oscillations remains unclear. We addressed this problem by analyzing laminar profiles of local field potential and multiunit activity (MUA) recorded with linear array multielectrodes from the striate cortex of two macaque monkeys performing an intermodal selective attention task. Current source density (CSD) analysis was combined with CSD-MUA coherence to identify intracortical alpha current generators and assess their potential for pacemaking. Coherence and Granger causality analysis was applied to delineate the patterns of interaction among different alpha current generators. We found that (1) separable alpha current generators are located in superficial, granular, and deep layers, with both layer 4C and deep layers containing primary local pacemaking generators, suggesting the involvement of the thalamocortical network, and (2) visual attention reduces the magnitude of alpha oscillations as well as the level of alpha interactions, consistent with numerous reports of occipital alpha reduction with visual attention in human EEG. There is also indication that alpha oscillations in the lateral geniculate cohere with those in V1.
21481790,42,2011,Cancer Cell,Integrated transcript and genome analyses reveal NKX2-1 and MEF2C as potential oncogenes in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,To identify oncogenic pathways in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we combined expression profiling of 117 pediatric patient samples and detailed molecular-cytogenetic analyses including the Chromosome Conformation Capture on Chip (4C) method. Two T-ALL subtypes were identified that lacked rearrangements of known oncogenes. One subtype associated with cortical arrest, expression of cell cycle genes, and ectopic NKX2-1 or NKX2-2 expression for which rearrangements were identified. The second subtype associated with immature T cell development and high expression of the MEF2C transcription factor as consequence of rearrangements of MEF2C, transcription factors that target MEF2C, or MEF2C-associated cofactors. We propose NKX2-1, NKX2-2, and MEF2C as T-ALL oncogenes that are activated by various rearrangements.
21471403,35,2011,Genome Res,Diverse gene reprogramming events occur in the same spatial clusters of distal regulatory elements.,The spatial organization of genes in the interphase nucleus plays an important role in establishment and regulation of gene expression. Contradicting results have been reported to date, with little consensus about the dynamics of nuclear organization and the features of the contact loci. In this study, we investigated the properties and dynamics of genomic loci that are in contact with glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-responsive loci. We took a systematic approach, combining genome-wide interaction profiling by the chromosome conformation capture on chip (4C) technology with expression, protein occupancy, and chromatin accessibility profiles. This approach allowed a comprehensive analysis of how distinct features of the linear genome are organized in the three-dimensional nuclear space in the context of rapid gene regulation. We found that the transcriptional response to GR occurs without dramatic nuclear reorganization. Moreover, contrary to the view of transcription-driven organization, even genes with opposite transcriptional responses colocalize. Regions contacting GR-regulated genes are not particularly enriched for GR-regulated loci or for any functional group of genes, suggesting that these subnuclear environments are not organized to respond to a specific factor. The contact regions are, however, highly enriched for DNase I-hypersensitive sites that comprehensively mark cell-type-specific regulatory sites. These findings indicate that the nucleus is pre-organized in a conformation allowing rapid transcriptional reprogramming, and this organization is significantly correlated with cell-type-specific chromatin sites accessible to regulatory factors. Numerous open chromatin loci may be arranged in nuclear domains that are poised to respond to diverse signals in general and to permit efficient gene regulation.
21455484,34,2011,PLoS Genet,Interactions among Polycomb domains are guided by chromosome architecture.,Polycomb group (PcG) proteins bind and regulate hundreds of genes. Previous evidence has suggested that long-range chromatin interactions may contribute to the regulation of PcG target genes. Here, we adapted the Chromosome Conformation Capture on Chip (4C) assay to systematically map chromosomal interactions in Drosophila melanogaster larval brain tissue. Our results demonstrate that PcG target genes interact extensively with each other in nuclear space. These interactions are highly specific for PcG target genes, because non-target genes with either low or high expression show distinct interactions. Notably, interactions are mostly limited to genes on the same chromosome arm, and we demonstrate that a topological rather than a sequence-based mechanism is responsible for this constraint. Our results demonstrate that many interactions among PcG target genes exist and that these interactions are guided by overall chromosome architecture.
22085927,30,2011,EMBO J,Human tRNA genes function as chromatin insulators.,Insulators help separate active chromatin domains from silenced ones. In yeast, gene promoters act as insulators to block the spread of Sir and HP1 mediated silencing while in metazoans most insulators are multipartite autonomous entities. tDNAs are repetitive sequences dispersed throughout the human genome and we now show that some of these tDNAs can function as insulators in human cells. Using computational methods, we identified putative human tDNA insulators. Using silencer blocking, transgene protection and repressor blocking assays we show that some of these tDNA-containing fragments can function as barrier insulators in human cells. We find that these elements also have the ability to block enhancers from activating RNA pol II transcribed promoters. Characterization of a putative tDNA insulator in human cells reveals that the site possesses chromatin signatures similar to those observed at other better-characterized eukaryotic insulators. Enhanced 4C analysis demonstrates that the tDNA insulator makes long-range chromatin contacts with other tDNAs and ETC sites but not with intervening or flanking RNA pol II transcribed genes.
21840925,22,2011,Hum Mol Genet,15q11.2-13.3 chromatin analysis reveals epigenetic regulation of CHRNA7 with deficiencies in Rett and autism brain.,Copy number variations (CNVs) within human 15q11.2-13.3 show reduced penetrance and variable expressivity in a range of neurologic disorders. Therefore, characterizing 15q11.2-13.3 chromatin structure is important for understanding the regulation of this locus during normal neuronal development. Deletion of the Prader-Willi imprinting center (PWS-IC) within 15q11.2-13.3 disrupts long-range imprinted gene expression resulting in Prader-Willi syndrome. Previous results establish that MeCP2 binds to the PWS-IC and is required for optimal expression of distal GABRB3 and UBE3A. To examine the hypothesis that MeCP2 facilitates 15q11.2-13.3 transcription by linking the PWS-IC with distant elements, chromosome capture conformation on chip (4C) analysis was performed in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. SH-SY5Y neurons had 2.84-fold fewer 15q11.2-13.3 PWS-IC chromatin interactions than undifferentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblasts, revealing developmental chromatin de-condensation of the locus. Out of 68 PWS-IC interactions with15q11.2-13.3 identified by 4C analysis and 62 15q11.2-13.3 MeCP2-binding sites identified by previous ChIP-chip studies, only five sites showed overlap. Remarkably, two of these overlapping PWS-IC- and MeCP2-bound sites mapped to sites flanking CHRNA7 (cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 7) encoding the cholinergic receptor, nicotinic, alpha 7. PWS-IC interaction with CHRNA7 in neurons was independently confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Subsequent quantitative transcriptional analyses of frontal cortex from Rett syndrome and autism patients revealed significantly reduced CHRNA7 expression compared with controls. Together, these results suggest that transcription of CHRNA7 is modulated by chromatin interactions with the PWS-IC. Thus, loss of long-range chromatin interactions within 15q11.2-13.3 may contribute to multiple human neurodevelopmental disorders.
21630267,21,2011,Int J Cancer,Integrin targeted oncolytic adenoviruses Ad5-D24-RGD and Ad5-RGD-D24-GMCSF for treatment of patients with advanced chemotherapy refractory solid tumors.,The safety of oncolytic viruses for treatment of cancer has been shown in clinical trials while antitumor efficacy has often remained modest. As expression of the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor may be variable in advanced tumors, we developed Ad5-D24-RGD, a p16/Rb pathway selective oncolytic adenovirus featuring RGD-4C modification of the fiber. This allows viral entry through alpha-v-beta integrins frequently highly expressed in advanced tumors. Advanced tumors are often immunosuppressive which results in lack of tumor eradication despite abnormal epitopes being present. Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) is a potent activator of immune system with established antitumor properties. To stimulate antitumor immunity and break tumor associated immunotolerance, we constructed Ad5-RGD-D24-GMCSF, featuring GMCSF controlled by the adenoviral E3 promoter. Preliminary safety of Ad5-D24-RGD and Ad5-RGD-D24-GMCSF for treatment of human cancer was established. Treatments with Ad5-D24-RGD (N = 9) and Ad5-RGD-D24-GMCSF (N = 7) were well tolerated. Typical side effects were grade 1-2 fatigue, fever and injection site pain. 77% (10/13) of evaluable patients showed virus in circulation for at least 2 weeks. In 3 out of 6 evaluable patients, disease previously progressing stabilized after a single treatment with Ad5-RGD-D24-GMCSF. In addition, 2/3 patients had stabilization or reduction in tumor marker levels. All patients treated with Ad5-D24-RGD showed disease progression in radiological analysis, although 3/6 had temporary reduction or stabilization of marker levels. Induction of tumor and adenovirus specific immunity was demonstrated with ELISPOT in Ad5-RGD-D24-GMCSF treated patients. RGD modified oncolytic adenoviruses with or without GMCSF seem safe for further clinical development.
21670265,20,2011,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Polycystin-2 and phosphodiesterase 4C are components of a ciliary A-kinase anchoring protein complex that is disrupted in cystic kidney diseases.,Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder that is characterized by cyst formation in kidney tubules. PKD arises from abnormalities of the primary cilium, a sensory organelle located on the cell surface. Here, we show that the primary cilium of renal epithelial cells contains a protein complex comprising adenylyl cyclase 5/6 (AC5/6), A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150), and protein kinase A. Loss of primary cilia caused by deletion of Kif3a results in activation of AC5 and increased cAMP levels. Polycystin-2 (PC2), a ciliary calcium channel that is mutated in human PKD, interacts with AC5/6 through its C terminus. Deletion of PC2 increases cAMP levels, which can be corrected by reexpression of wild-type PC2 but not by a mutant lacking calcium channel activity. Phosphodiesterase 4C (PDE4C), which catabolizes cAMP, is also located in renal primary cilia and interacts with the AKAP150 complex. Expression of PDE4C is regulated by the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β), mutations of which produce kidney cysts. PDE4C is down-regulated and cAMP levels are increased in HNF-1β mutant kidney cells and mice. Collectively, these findings identify PC2 and PDE4C as unique components of an AKAP complex in primary cilia and reveal a common mechanism for dysregulation of cAMP signaling in cystic kidney diseases arising from different gene mutations.
21565817,20,2011,Gerontologist,Recruitment and retention strategies for minority or poor clinical research participants: lessons from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study.,PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Investigating health disparities requires studies designed to recruit and retain racially and socioeconomically diverse cohorts. It is critical to address the barriers that disproportionately affect participation in clinical research by minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged. This study sought to identify and rectify these barriers to recruit and retain a biracial (African American and non-Hispanic White) and socioeconomically diverse cohort for a longitudinal study.DESIGN AND METHOD: The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study is a 20-year longitudinal examination of how race and socioeconomic status influence the development of age-related health disparities. One goal was to create a multifactorial recruitment and retention strategy. The recruitment paradigm targeted known barriers and identified those unique to the study's urban environment. The retention paradigm mirrored the recruitment plan but was based on specifically developed approaches.RESULTS: This cohort recruitment required attention to developing community partnerships, designing the research study to meet the study hypotheses and to provide benefit to participants, providing a safe community-based site for the research and creating didactics to develop staff cultural proficiency. These efforts facilitated study implementation and enhanced recruitment resulting in accrual of a biracial and socioeconomically diverse cohort of 3,722 participants.IMPLICATIONS: Recruiting and retaining minority or poor research participants is challenging but possible. The essential facets include clear communication of the research hypothesis, focus on providing a direct benefit for participants, and selection of a hypothesis that is directly relevant to the community studied.
21994270,18,2011,J Neurophysiol,Cholinergic modulation of response gain in the primary visual cortex of the macaque.,ACh modulates neuronal activity throughout the cerebral cortex, including the primary visual cortex (V1). However, a number of issues regarding this modulation remain unknown, such as the effect and its function and the receptor subtypes involved. To address these issues, we combined extracellular single-unit recordings and microiontophoretic administration of ACh and measured V1 neuronal responses to drifting sinusoidal grating stimuli in anesthetized macaque monkeys. ACh was found to have mostly facilitatory effects on the visual responses, although some cases of suppressive effects were also seen. To assess the functional role of ACh, we further examined how ACh modulates the stimulus contrast-response function, finding that the response gain increased with the facilitatory effect. The response facilitation was completely or strongly blocked by atropine (At), a muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) antagonist, in almost all neurons (96% of cells), whereas any residual effect after At administration was fully removed by mecamylamine, a nicotinic AChR (nAChR) antagonist, suggesting a predominant role for mAChRs in this mechanism. Furthermore, we found no laminar distribution bias for the facilitatory modulation, although the relative contribution of mAChRs was smaller in layer 4C than in other layers. The suppressive effect was blocked completely by At. These results demonstrate that ACh plays an important role in visual information processing in V1 by controlling the response gain via mAChRs across all cortical layers and via nAChRs, mainly in layer 4C.
21307208,18,2011,J Clin Microbiol,Standardization of hepatitis E virus (HEV) nucleic acid amplification technique-based assays: an initial study to evaluate a panel of HEV strains and investigate laboratory performance.,The performance of hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA nucleic acid amplification (NAT)-based assays has been investigated using a panel of HEV-containing plasma samples. The panel comprised 22 HEV-positive plasma samples representing 10-fold serial dilutions of HEV genotypes 3a, 3b, 3f, and 4c obtained from blood donors. Two negative-control plasma samples were included. All samples were blinded. The plasma samples were prepared as liquid/frozen materials and distributed to participants on dry ice. Laboratories were requested to test the panel using their routine HEV assays and to score samples as either positive or negative and could optionally return data in copies/ml for HEV RNA. Twenty laboratories from 10 different countries participated in the study. Data were returned by all participating laboratories; 10 laboratories returned quantitative data. All assays except one were developed in-house using conventional or real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) methodologies. There was a 100- to 1,000-fold difference in sensitivity between the majority of assays, independent of the virus strain. Although the quantitative data were limited, for the samples in the range of ∼6 to 4 log(10) copies/ml, the standard deviations of the geometric means of the samples ranged between 0.38 and 1.09. Except for one equivocal result, HEV RNA was not detected in the negative samples. The variability of assay sensitivity highlights the need for the standardization of HEV RNA NAT assays.
21705114,16,2011,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and antitumor activity of new sulfonamide derivatives of thiadiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidines.,New series of sulfonamide derivatives of [1,3,4]thiadiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine were synthesized and investigated as antitumor agents. Some of the newly prepared compounds were tested for their in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities. Preliminary biological studies revealed that compounds 4c, 4f, and 4j exhibited the highest affinity to DNA, while compounds 4h,i, 6a-c, 8 and 12-14 exhibited moderate activity. Also, compounds 4j, 4f and 4c showed the highest percentage increase in lifespan of mice inoculated with Ehrlich ascites cells over 5-flurouracil (positive control). The detailed synthesis, spectroscopic and biological data are reported.
21336277,15,2011,Nat Struct Mol Biol,Mapping of INS promoter interactions reveals its role in long-range regulation of SYT8 transcription.,Insulin (INS) synthesis and secretion from pancreatic β-cells are tightly regulated; their deregulation causes diabetes. Here we map INS-associated loci in human pancreatic islets by 4C and 3C techniques and show that the INS gene physically interacts with the SYT8 gene, located over 300 kb away. This interaction is elevated by glucose and accompanied by increases in SYT8 expression. Inactivation of the INS promoter by promoter-targeting siRNA reduces SYT8 gene expression. SYT8-INS interaction and SYT8 transcription are attenuated by CTCF depletion. Furthermore, SYT8 knockdown decreases insulin secretion in islets. These results reveal a nonredundant role for SYT8 in insulin secretion and indicate that the INS promoter acts from a distance to stimulate SYT8 transcription. This suggests a function for the INS promoter in coordinating insulin transcription and secretion through long-range regulation of SYT8 expression in human islets.
21307235,15,2011,J Neurosci,Infragranular sources of sustained local field potential responses in macaque primary visual cortex.,A local field potential (LFP) response can be measured throughout the visual cortex in response to the abrupt appearance of a visual stimulus. Averaging LFP responses to many stimulus presentations isolates transient, phase-locked components of the response that are consistent from trial to trial. However, stimulus responses are also composed of sustained components, which differ in their phase from trial to trial and therefore must be evaluated using other methods, such as computing the power of the response of each trial before averaging. Here, we investigate the basis of phase-locked and non-phase-locked LFP responses in the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey using a novel variant of current source density (CSD) analysis. We applied a linear array of electrode contacts spanning the thickness of the cortex to measure the LFP and compute band-limited CSD power to identify the laminar sites of persistent current exchange that may be the basis of sustained visual LFP responses. In agreement with previous studies, we found a short-latency phase-locked current sink, thought to correspond to thalamocortical input to layer 4C. In addition, we found a prominent non-phase-locked component of the CSD that persisted as long as the stimulus was physically present. The latter was relatively broadband, lasted throughout the stimulus presentation, and was centered ∼500 μm deeper than the initial current sink. These findings demonstrate a fundamental difference in the neural mechanisms underlying the initial and sustained processing of simple visual stimuli in the V1 microcircuit.
21226456,11,2011,J Am Chem Soc,Enantioselective [3 + 2] cycloaddition of allenes to acrylates catalyzed by dipeptide-derived phosphines: facile creation of functionalized cyclopentenes containing quaternary stereogenic centers.,A new family of dipeptide-based chiral phosphines was designed and prepared. D-Thr-L-tert-Leu-derived catalyst 4c promoted [3 + 2] cycloaddition of allenoates to α-substituted acrylates in a regiospecific and stereoselective manner, furnishing functionalized cyclopentenes with quaternary stereogenic centers in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.
21621454,10,2011,J Clin Virol,Hepatitis C virus core antigen: analytical performances, correlation with viremia and potential applications of a quantitative, automated immunoassay.,BACKGROUND: Testing for hepatitis C virus core antigen (HCV Ag) may represent a complementary tool to anti-HCV and HCV-RNA in the diagnosis and monitoring of HCV infection.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance characteristics of the automated Abbott ARCHITECT HCV Ag assay.STUDY DESIGN: Five sites analyzed over 3000 routine serum samples from populations at different risk, comparing HCV Ag results with anti-HCV screening and supplemental assay results and with HCV-RNA.RESULTS: The HCV Ag assay showed a specificity of 100%, a good precision (CV&lt;10%) and excellent dilution linearity (r&gt;0.999). The sensitivity (3 fmol/L) corresponds to 700-1100 IU/mL of HCV-RNA. A non-linear correlation with HCV-RNA was found: r=0.713 vs. Siemens bDNA (523 specimens), r=0.736 vs. Roche Cobas TaqMan (356 specimens) and r=0.870 vs. Abbott Real-Time PCR (273 specimens). HCV Ag quantitation was equally effective on different HCV genoypes (239 for genotype 1/1a/1b/1c, 108 for genotype 2/2a/2c, 86 for genotype 3/3a, 50 for genotype 4/4a/4c/4d). Testing of subjects at high risk for HCV and with potential or actual impairment of the immune system identified 2 cases negative for anti-HCV and positive for HCV Ag on 361 hemodialyzed (0.6%) and 7 cases on 97 (7.2%) among transplant recipients. HCV Ag positivity anticipated anti-HCV seroconversion in all three cases of acute hepatitis C.CONCLUSIONS: HCV Ag may be used as reflex testing on anti-HCV positive individuals to confirm or exclude an active infection, and on subjects with acute hepatitis or belonging to high risk groups.
21206754,10,2011,PLoS One,A systematic enhancer screen using lentivector transgenesis identifies conserved and non-conserved functional elements at the Olig1 and Olig2 locus.,Finding sequences that control expression of genes is central to understanding genome function. Previous studies have used evolutionary conservation as an indicator of regulatory potential. Here, we present a method for the unbiased in vivo screen of putative enhancers in large DNA regions, using the mouse as a model. We cloned a library of 142 overlapping fragments from a 200 kb-long murine BAC in a lentiviral vector expressing LacZ from a minimal promoter, and used the resulting vectors to infect fertilized murine oocytes. LacZ staining of E11 embryos obtained by first using the vectors in pools and then testing individual candidates led to the identification of 3 enhancers, only one of which shows significant evolutionary conservation. In situ hybridization and 3C/4C experiments suggest that this enhancer, which is active in the neural tube and posterior diencephalon, influences the expression of the Olig1 and/or Olig2 genes. This work provides a new approach for the large-scale in vivo screening of transcriptional regulatory sequences, and further demonstrates that evolutionary conservation alone seems too limiting a criterion for the identification of enhancers.
21642424,8,2011,J Biol Chem,Loss of cleavage at β'-site contributes to apparent increase in β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) secretion by β-secretase (BACE1)-glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) processing of amyloid precursor protein.,Several lines of evidence implicate lipid raft microdomains in Alzheimer disease-associated β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) production. Notably, targeting β-secretase (β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)) exclusively to lipid rafts by the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to its ectodomain has been reported to elevate Aβ secretion. Paradoxically, Aβ secretion is not reduced by the expression of non-raft resident S-palmitoylation-deficient BACE1 (BACE1-4C/A (C474A/C478A/C482A/C485A)). We addressed this apparent discrepancy in raft microdomain-associated BACE1 processing of APP in this study. As previously reported, we found that expression of BACE1-GPI elevated Aβ secretion as compared with wild-type BACE1 (WTBACE1) or BACE1-4C/A. However, this increase occurred without any difference in the levels of APP ectodomain released following BACE1 cleavage (soluble APPβ), arguing against an overall increase in BACE1 processing of APP per se. Further analysis revealed that WTBACE1 cleaves APP at β- and β'-sites, generating +1 and +11 β-C-terminal fragments and secreting intact as well as N-terminally truncated Aβ. In contrast, three different BACE1-GPI chimeras preferentially cleaved APP at the β-site, mainly generating +1 β-C-terminal fragment and secreting intact Aβ. As a consequence, cells expressing BACE1-GPI secreted relatively higher levels of intact Aβ without an increase in BACE1 processing of APP. Markedly reduced cleavage at β'-site exhibited by BACE1-GPI was cell type-independent and insensitive to subcellular localization of APP or the pathogenic KM/NL mutant. We conclude that the apparent elevation in Aβ secretion by BACE1-GPI is mainly attributed to preferential cleavage at the β-site and failure to detect +11 Aβ species secreted by cells expressing WTBACE1.
21621239,8,2011,Ultrasonics,Simultaneous grayscale and subharmonic ultrasound imaging on a modified commercial scanner.,OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneous dual fundamental grayscale and subharmonic imaging on a modified commercial scanner.MOTIVATION: The ability to generate signals at half the insonation frequency is exclusive to ultrasound contrast agents (UCA). Thus, subharmonic imaging (SHI; transmitting at f(0) and receiving at f(0)/2) provides improved visualization of UCA within the vasculature via suppression of the surrounding tissue echoes. While this capability has proven useful in a variety of clinical applications, the SHI suppression of surrounding tissue landmarks (which are needed for sonographic navigation) also limits it use as a primary imaging modality. In this paper we present results using a commercial ultrasound scanner modified to allow imaging in both grayscale (f(0)=4.0 MHz) and SHI (f(0)=2.5 MHz, f(0)/2=1.25 MHz) modes in real time.METHODS: A Logiq 9 ultrasound scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) with a 4C curvilinear probe was modified to provide this capability. Four commercially available UCA (Definity, Lantheus Medical Imaging, North Billerica, MA; Optison, GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ; SonoVue, Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy; and Sonazoid, GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) were all investigated in vitro over an acoustic output range of 3.34 MPa. In vivo the subharmonic response of Sonazoid was investigated in the portal veins of four canines (open abdominal cavity) and four patients with suspected portal hypertension.RESULTS: In vitro, the four UCA showed an average maximum subharmonic amplitude of 44.1±5.4 dB above the noise floor with a maximum subharmonic amplitude of 48.6±1.6 dB provided by Sonazoid. The average in vivo maximum signal above the noise floor from Sonazoid was 20.8±2.3 dB in canines and 33.9±5.2 dB in humans. Subharmonic amplitude as a function of acoustic output in both groups matched the S-curve behavior of the agent observed in vitro. The dual grayscale imaging provided easier sonographic navigation, while the degree of tissue suppression in SHI mode varied greatly on a case by case basis.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the feasibility of dual grayscale and SHI on a modified commercial scanner. The ability to simultaneously visualize both imaging modes in real time should improve the applicability of SHI as a future primary clinical imaging modality.
22065864,7,2011,Cereb Cortex,Differential expression patterns of striate cortex-enriched genes among Old World, New World, and prosimian primates.,A group of 5 genes, OCC1, testican-1, testican-2, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2A, are selectively expressed in layer 4 (4C of Brodmann) of striate cortex (visual area V1) of both Old World macaques and New World marmoset monkeys. The expression of these genes is activity dependent, as expression is reduced after blocking retinal activity. Surprisingly, the pronounced expression pattern has not been found in rodents or carnivores. Thus, these genes may be highly expressed in V1 of some but perhaps not all primates. Here, we compared the gene expression in members of 3 major branches of primate evolution: prosimians, New World monkeys, and Old World monkeys. Although the expression pattern of 5-HT1B was well conserved, those of the other genes varied from the least distinct in prosimian galagos to successively more in New World owl monkeys, marmosets, squirrel monkeys, and Old World macaque monkeys. In owl monkeys, the expression of 5-HT2A was significantly reduced by monocular tetrodotoxin injection, while those of OCC1 and 5-HT1B were not. Thus, we propose that early primates had low levels of expression and higher levels emerged with anthropoid primates and became further enhanced in the Old World catarrhine monkeys that are more closely related to humans.
21968373,7,2011,Eur J Med Chem,Hantzsch reaction: synthesis and characterization of some new 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives as potent antimicrobial and antioxidant agents.,In the present study two new series of Hantzsch 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives (1,4-DHPs) containing substituted pyrazole moiety (4a-f and 5a-f) were synthesized by the reaction of 3-aryl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehydes with 1,3-dicarbonylcompounds (ethylacetoacetate and methylacetoacetate) and ammonium acetate. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, NMR, mass spectral study and also by C, H, N analyses. New compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activity by well plate method (zone of inhibition). Antioxidant studies of the synthesized compounds were also performed by measuring the DPPH radical scavenging assay. Compounds 4c, 4e and 4f were found to be potent antibacterial and antioxidant agents. The acute oral toxicity study for the compounds 4c, 4e and 4f were carried out and the experimental studies revealed that compounds 4c and 4e is safe up to 3000 mg/kg and no death of animals were recorded. However in compound 4f, we found mortality above 2000 mg and also significant behavioral changes in experimental animals.
21427351,7,2011,AJR Am J Roentgenol,Interpretation of positron emission mammography and MRI by experienced breast imaging radiologists: performance and observer reproducibility.,OBJECTIVE: In preparation for a multicenter trial of positron emission mammography (PEM) and MRI in women with newly diagnosed cancer, the two purposes of this study were to validate training of breast imagers in standardized interpretation of PEM and to validate performance of the same specialists interpreting MRI.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2-hour didactic module was developed to train Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified radiologist observers to interpret PEM images, consisting of a sample feature analysis lexicon analogous to BI-RADS and 12 sample cases. Observers were then asked to review separate interpretive skills tasks for PEM (49 breasts, 20 [41%] of which were malignant) and MRI (32 breasts, 11 [34%] of which were malignant), describe findings, and give assessments analogous to BI-RADS (category 1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 4C, or 5). Demographic experience variables were collected for 36 observers from 15 sites. Performance against histopathologic truth was determined, and interobserver agreement for classifying features and final assessments was evaluated using kappa statistics.RESULTS: Across 36 observers, mean sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) for PEM were 96% (range, 75-100%), 84% (range, 66-97%), and 0.95 (range, 0.82-1.0), respectively. Mean sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for the MRI task were 82% (range, 45-100%), 67% (range, 38-91%), and 0.80 (range, 0.48-0.96), respectively. Interobserver agreement for PEM findings ranged from moderate to substantial, with kappa values of 0.57 for lesion type and 0.63 for final assessments.CONCLUSION: With minimal training, experienced breast imagers showed high performance in interpreting PEM images. Performance in MRI interpretation by the same observers validated expected clinical practice.
21343701,7,2011,Epigenetics,Epigenetic reprogramming as a key contributor to melanocyte malignant transformation.,Melanoma progression requires deregulation of gene expression by currently uncharacterized epigenetic mechanisms. A mouse model based on changes in cell microenvironment was developed by our group to study melanocyte malignant transformation. Melanoma cell lines (4C11- and 4C11+) were obtained as result of 5 sequential anchorage blockades of non-tumorigenic melan-a melanocytes. Melan-a cells submitted to 4 de-adhesion cycles were also established (4C), are non-tumorigenic and represent an intermediary phase of tumor progression. The aim of this work was to identify factors contributing to epigenetic modifications in early and later phases of malignant transformation induced by anchorage impediment. Epigenetic alterations occur early in tumorigenesis; 4C cell line shows changes in global and gene-specific DNA methylation and histone marks. Many histone modifications differ between melan-a, 4C, 4C11- (non-metastatic melanoma cell line) and 4C11+ (metastatic melanoma cell line) which could be associated with changes in gene and microRNA expression. These epigenetic alterations seem to play a key role in malignant transformation since melanocytes treated with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine before each anchorage blockade do not transform. Some epigenetic changes seem to be also responsible for the maintenance of malignant phenotype, since melanoma cell lines (4C11- and 4C11+) treated in vitro with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine or Trichostatin A showed reduction of tumor growth in vivo. Changes in gene expression reflecting cell adaptation to new environment were also observed. We propose a model in which sustained microenvironmental stress in melanocytes results in epigenetic reprogramming. Thus, after adaptation, cells may acquire epigenetic marks that could contribute to the establishment of a malignant phenotype.
21239159,7,2011,Biosens Bioelectron,A prototype of giant magnetoimpedance-based biosensing system for targeted detection of gastric cancer cells.,A targeted detection of gastric cancer cells is achieved by combining the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI)-based biosensing system and RGD-4C peptide coupled, chitosan covered superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (RGD-Fe(3)O(4)@chitosan). The micro-patterned GMI sensor for targeted detection is made of Co-based ribbon and fabricated by micro electromechanical system (MEMS) technology. Functionalized nanoparticles were designed by coating Fe(3)O(4) with chitosan and conjugating with RGD-4C peptides. The targeted cells were trickled down into the detection area of the system. The detection of each sample is carried out in ten-fold manner and average value is taken as the final result. This system can identify the differences between targeted cells and non-targeted cells. It is of considerable interest due to its potential application in the biomedical field of various specific detections.
22079412,6,2011,Comp Biochem Physiol Part D Genomics Proteomics,Transcriptome profiling of female alates and egg-laying queens of the Formosan subterranean termite.,Termites are known to have an extraordinary reproductive plasticity and capacity, but the underlying genetic patterns of termite reproductive biology are relatively understudied. The goal of this study was to identify genes for which expression levels differ between dealated precopulatory females (virgins) and egg-laying queens of the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki. We constructed a normalized polyphenic expressed sequence tag (EST) library that represents genomic material from most of the castes and life stages of the Formosan subterranean termite. Microarrays were designed using probes from this EST library and public genomic resources. Virgin females and queens were competitively hybridized to these microarrays and differentially expressed candidate genes were identified. Differential expression of eight genes was subsequently confirmed via reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR). When compared to virgins, queens had higher expression of genes coding for proteins related to immunity (gram negative binding protein), nutrition (e.g., termite-derived endo-beta-1,4-glucanase), protein storage, regulation of caste differentiation and reproduction (hexamerin, juvenile hormone binding protein). Queens also had higher transcript levels for genes involved in metabolism of xenobiotics, fat, and juvenile hormone (glutathione-S-transferase-like proteins, and cytochrome P450), among others. In particular, hexamerin, juvenile hormone binding protein, and a cytochrome P450 from the 4C subfamily are likely to be involved in initiating the inactive period during the reproductive cycle of the queen. Vice versa, virgins had higher expression than queens of genes related to respiration, probably due to recent flight activity, and several genes of unknown function.
21669243,6,2011,Hum Immunol,CTLA-4, CD28, and ICOS gene polymorphism associations with non-small-cell lung cancer.,Polymorphisms in genes encoding CD28, ICOS, and CTLA-4 were demonstrated to be associated with susceptibility to malignancies. To the best of our knowledge, no study on this association has been performed in a Caucasian population for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present work, we investigated the polymorphisms CTLA-4c.49A&gt;G (rs231775), CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T (rs5742909), CTLA-4g.*642AT(8_33), CTLA-4g.*6230G&gt;A (CT60) (rs3087243), CTLA-4g.*10223G&gt;T (Jo31) (rs11571302), CD28c.17+3T&gt;C (rs3116496), and ICOSc.1554+4GT(8_15) in 208 NSCLC patients and 326 controls. The distributions of the allele and genotype were similar in both groups for CTLA-4, CD28, and ICOS gene polymorphisms. However, we noted a tendency toward overrepresentation of individuals possessing the CTLA-4c.49A&gt;G[A] allele in NSCLC patients compared with controls (0.84 vs 0.79, p = 0.09). The association became significant compared with controls in women for the CTLA-4c.49A&gt;G[A] allele and CTLA-4c.49A&gt;G[AA] genotype (0.67 vs 0.54, p = 0.01, and 0.47 vs 0.30, p = 0.02; respectively). Moreover, the constellation of alleles CTLA-4c.49A&gt;G[A]/CT60[G]/CD28c.17+3T&gt;C[T]/ICOSc.1554+4GT(8_15)[&gt;10] increased the risk of NSCLC about 2-fold (p = 0.002). The same constellation of alleles combined with smoking, CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T[T], and ICOSc.1554+4GT(8_15)[&gt;10] was associated with a decreased overall survival rate. In conclusion, the constellation of specific alleles in CTLA-4, CD28, and ICOS genes contributes to the susceptibility and clinical course of NSCLC.
21602330,6,2011,J Bacteriol,Genome sequence of lineage III Listeria monocytogenes strain HCC23.,More than 98% of reported human listeriosis cases are caused by Listeria monocytogenes serotypes within lineages I and II. Serotypes within lineage III (4a and 4c) are commonly isolated from environmental and food specimens. We report the first complete genome sequence of a lineage III isolate, HCC23, which will be used for comparative analysis.
21460180,6,2011,Mol Cancer Res,MYC in chronic myeloid leukemia: induction of aberrant DNA synthesis and association with poor response to imatinib.,Untreated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progresses from chronic phase to blastic crisis (BC). Increased genomic instability, deregulated proliferation, and loss of differentiation appear associated to BC, but the molecular alterations underlying the progression of CML are poorly characterized. MYC oncogene is frequently deregulated in human cancer, often associated with tumor progression. Genomic instability and induction of aberrant DNA replication are described as effects of MYC. In this report, we studied MYC activities in CML cell lines with conditional MYC expression with and without exposure to imatinib, the front-line drug in CML therapy. In cells with conditional MYC expression, MYC did not rescue the proliferation arrest mediated by imatinib but provoked aberrant DNA synthesis and accumulation of cells with 4C content. We studied MYC mRNA expression in 66 CML patients at different phases of the disease, and we found that MYC expression was higher in CML patients at diagnosis than control bone marrows or in patients responding to imatinib. Further, high MYC levels at diagnosis correlated with a poor response to imatinib. MYC expression did not directly correlate with BCR-ABL levels in patients treated with imatinib. Overall our study suggests that, as in other tumor models, MYC-induced aberrant DNA synthesis in CML cells is consistent with MYC overexpression in untreated CML patients and nonresponding patients and supports a role for MYC in CML progression, possibly through promotion of genomic instability.
21408183,6,2011,PLoS One,Chromosome conformation capture uncovers potential genome-wide interactions between human conserved non-coding sequences.,Comparative analyses of various mammalian genomes have identified numerous conserved non-coding (CNC) DNA elements that display striking conservation among species, suggesting that they have maintained specific functions throughout evolution. CNC function remains poorly understood, although recent studies have identified a role in gene regulation. We hypothesized that the identification of genomic loci that interact physically with CNCs would provide information on their functions. We have used circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) to characterize interactions of 10 CNCs from human chromosome 21 in K562 cells. The data provide evidence that CNCs are capable of interacting with loci that are enriched for CNCs. The number of trans interactions varies among CNCs; some show interactions with many loci, while others interact with few. Some of the tested CNCs are capable of driving the expression of a reporter gene in the mouse embryo, and associate with the oligodendrocyte genes OLIG1 and OLIG2. Our results underscore the power of chromosome conformation capture for the identification of targets of functional DNA elements and raise the possibility that CNCs exert their functions by physical association with defined genomic regions enriched in CNCs. These CNC-CNC interactions may in part explain their stringent conservation as a group of regulatory sequences.
21261555,6,2011,Ann Med,In vivo and in vitro distribution of type 5 and fiber-modified oncolytic adenoviruses in human blood compartments.,BACKGROUND: Successful tumor targeting of systemically administered oncolytic adenoviruses may be hindered by interactions with blood components.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood distribution of oncolytic adenoviruses featuring type 5 adenovirus fiber, 5/3 capsid chimerism, or RGD-4C in the fiber knob was investigated in vitro and in patients with refractory solid tumors.RESULTS: Virus titers and prevalence in serum of patients increased over the first post-treatment week, suggesting replication. Detection of low virus loads was more sensitive in blood clots than in serum, although viral levels &gt; 500 viral particles/mL did not differ significantly between both sample types. While adenovirus bound to erythrocytes, platelets, granulocytes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro, the virus was mainly detectable in erythrocytes and granulocytes in cancer patients. Taken together with a temporary post-treatment decrease in thrombocyte counts, platelet activation by adenovirus and subsequent clearance seem likely to occur in humans. Fiber modifications had limited observed effect on virus distribution in blood cell compartments. Neutrophils, monocytes and cytotoxic T lymphocytes were the major leukocyte subpopulations interacting with adenoviruses.CONCLUSION: Serum and blood clots are relevant to estimate oncolytic adenovirus replication. Insight into viral interactions with blood cells may contribute to the development of new strategies for tumor delivery.
22134952,5,2011,Am J Clin Nutr,Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-based body volume measurement for 4-compartment body composition.,BACKGROUND: Total body volume (TBV), with the exclusion of internal air voids, is necessary to quantify body composition in Lohman's 4-compartment (4C) model.OBJECTIVE: This investigation sought to derive a novel, TBV measure with the use of only dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) attenuation values for use in Lohman's 4C body composition model.DESIGN: Pixel-specific masses and volumes were calculated from low- and high-energy attenuation values with the use of first principle conversions of mass attenuation coefficients. Pixel masses and volumes were summed to derive body mass and total body volume. As proof of concept, 11 participants were recruited to have 4C measures taken: DXA, air-displacement plethysmography (ADP), and total body water (TBW). TBV measures with the use of only DXA (DXA-volume) and ADP-volume measures were compared for each participant. To see how body composition estimates were affected by these 2 methods, we used Lohman's 4C model to quantify percentage fat measures for each participant and compared them with conventional DXA measures.RESULTS: DXA-volume and ADP-volume measures were highly correlated (R(2) = 0.99) and showed no statistically significant bias. Percentage fat by DXA volume was highly correlated with ADP-volume percentage fat measures and DXA software-reported percentage fat measures (R(2) = 0.96 and R(2) = 0.98, respectively) but were slightly biased.CONCLUSIONS: A novel method to calculate TBV with the use of a clinical DXA system was developed, compared against ADP as proof of principle, and used in Lohman's 4C body composition model. The DXA-volume approach eliminates many of the inherent inaccuracies associated with displacement measures for volume and, if validated in larger groups of participants, would simplify the acquisition of 4C body composition to a single DXA scan and TBW measure.
21919203,5,2011,Proteomics,Quantitative proteomic identification of host factors involved in the Salmonella typhimurium infection cycle.,To identify host factors involved in Salmonella replication, SILAC-based quantitative proteomics was used to investigate the interactions of Salmonella typhimurium with the secretory pathway in human epithelial cells. Protein profiles of Golgi-enriched fractions isolated from S. typhimurium-infected cells were compared with those of mock-infected cells, revealing significant depletion or enrichment of 105 proteins. Proteins annotated to play a role in membrane traffic were overrepresented among the depleted proteins whereas proteins annotated to the cytoskeleton showed a diverse behavior with some proteins being enriched, others being depleted from the Golgi fraction upon Salmonella infection. To study the functional relevance of identified proteins in the Salmonella infection cycle, small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments were performed. siRNA-mediated depletion of a selection of affected proteins identified five host factors involved in Salmonella infection. Depletion of peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6), isoform β-4c of integrin β-4 (ITGB4), isoform 1 of protein lap2 (erbin interacting protein; ERBB2IP), stomatin (STOM) or TBC domain containing protein 10b (TBC1D10B) resulted in increased Salmonella replication. Surprisingly, in addition to the effect on Salmonella replication, depletion of STOM or ITGB4 resulted in a dispersal of intracellular Salmonella microcolonies. It can be concluded that by using SILAC-based quantitative proteomics we were able to identify novel host cell proteins involved in the complex interplay between Salmonella and epithelial cells.
21876519,5,2011,J Vis Exp,Preparation of viral DNA from nucleocapsids.,Viruses are obligate cellular parasites, and thus the study of their DNA requires isolating viral material away from host cell contaminants and DNA. Several downstream applications require large quantities of pure viral DNA, which is provided by this protocol. These applications include viral genome sequencing, where the removal of host DNA is crucial to optimize data output for viral sequences, and the production of new viral recombinant strains, where co-transfection of purified plasmid and linear viral DNA facilitates recombination.(1,2,3) This procedure utilizes a combination of extractions and density-based centrifugation to isolate purified linear herpesvirus nucleocapsid DNA from infected cells.(4,5) The initial purification steps aim to isolate purified viral capsids, which contain and protect the viral DNA during the extractions and centrifugation steps that remove cellular proteins and DNA. Lysis of nucleocapsids then releases viral DNA, and two final phenol-chloroform steps remove remaining proteins. The final DNA captured from solution is highly concentrated and pure, with an average OD(260/280;) of 1.90. Depending on the quantity of infected cells used, yields of viral DNA range from 150-800 μg or more. The purity of this DNA makes it stable during long-term storage at 4C. This DNA is thus ideally suited for high-throughput sequencing, high fidelity PCR reactions, and transfections. Prior to beginning the protocol, it is important to know the average number of cells per dish (e.g. an average of 8 x 10(6) PK-15 cells in a confluent 15 cm dish), and the titer of the viral stock to be used (e.g. 1 x 10(8) plaque-forming units per ml). These are necessary to calculate the appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI) for the protocol.(6) For instance, to infect one 15 cm dish of PK-15 cells with the above viral stock, at an MOI of 5, you would use 400 μl of viral stock and dilute it with 3.6 ml of medium (total inoculation volume of 4 ml for one 15 cm plate). Multiple viral DNA preparations can be prepared at the same time. The number of simultaneous preparations is limited only by the number of tubes held by the ultracentrifuge rotor (one per virus; see step 3.9 below). Here we describe the procedure as though being done for one virus.
21437184,5,2011,Patholog Res Int,Impact of KRAS Mutations on Management of Colorectal Carcinoma.,The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is a therapeutic target in the management of colorectal cancer (CRC). EGFR antagonists are active in this disease; however, only a subset of patients respond to such therapy. A Kirsten ras sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) wild-type (WT) status of the tumor is necessary, but possibly not sufficient, for a response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy. Mechanisms of primary resistance to such therapy in patients harboring KRAS WT tumors are discussed. Strategies to overcome resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy, including novel agents and combinations of novel therapies, are explored. Also, the use of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting is reviewed.
21427350,5,2011,AJR Am J Roentgenol,Interpretation of positron emission mammography: feature analysis and rates of malignancy.,OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to define and illustrate standard terminology for describing findings on positron emission mammography (PEM) and provide associated rates of malignancy.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Three hundred eighty-eight women with newly-diagnosed breast cancer anticipating breast-conserving surgery completed a multicenter trial comparing PEM to MRI in assessment of disease extent. Morphologic terminology to describe PEM findings was patterned on BI-RADS for MRI, and investigators were trained in the PEM lexicon. PEM imaging features of known malignancies and additional PEM lesions were recorded and correlated with outcome. The reference standard was biopsy or at least a 6-month follow-up.RESULTS: Of 166 additional lesions on PEM, 54 (33%) proved malignant, with median invasive tumor size 8 mm (range, 2-60 mm). Among 43 round or oval masses, 16 (37%) were malignant, compared with 16 of 21 (76%) of lobulated or irregular masses (p = 0.003). Among 14 findings of focal or regional nonmass uptake, two (14%) were malignant compared with four of 12 (33%) findings of linear-ductal or segmental uptake (p = 0.350). Malignancy rates for BI-RADS-type final assessments were category 2, one of 31 (3.2%); 3, three of 32 (9.4%); 4a, four of 18 (22%); 4b, nine of 33 (27%); 4c, 15 of 24 (63%); and 5, 22 of 28 (79%). On the basis of modeling, irregular or lobulated morphology was the strongest predictor of malignancy, followed by lesion laterality (i.e., ipsilateral to known cancer) then increasing semiquantitative (18)F-FDG uptake.CONCLUSION: Use of standardized terminology to report PEM findings will facilitate effective communication of results and consistent management. A probably benign category 3 assessment carried a substantial rate of malignancy for lesions seen on PEM, and biopsy may be more appropriate than follow-up.
21204256,5,2011,Proteomics,Proteomic analysis of male 4C germ cell proteins involved in mouse meiosis.,Male meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that gives rise to sperm. Errors in this process can result in the generation of aneuploid gametes, which are associated with birth defects and infertility in humans. Until now, there has been a lack of a large-scale identification of proteins involved in male meiosis in mammals. In this study, we report the high-confidence identification of 3625 proteins in mouse male germ cells with 4C DNA content undergoing meiosis I. Of these, 397 were found to be testis specific. Bioinformatics analysis of the proteome led to the identification of 28 proteins known to be essential for male meiosis in mice. We also found 172 proteins that had yeast orthologs known to be essential for meiosis. Chromosome distribution analysis of the proteome showed underrepresentation of the identified proteins on the X chromosome, which may be due to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Characterization of the proteome of 4C germ cells from mouse testis provides an inventory of proteins, which is useful for understanding meiosis and the mechanisms of male infertility.
22170455,4,2011,Biotechnol Bioeng,Transgene delivery using poly(amino ether)-gold nanorod assemblies.,Gold nanorods (GNRs) have emerged as promising nanomaterials for biosensing, imaging, photothermal treatment, and therapeutic delivery for several diseases, including cancer. We have generated poly(amino ether)-functionalized gold nanorods (PAE-GNRs) using a layer-by-layer deposition approach; polymers from a poly(amino ether) library recently synthesized in our laboratory were employed to generate the PAE-GNR assemblies. PAE-GNR assemblies demonstrate long-term colloidal stability as well as the capacity to bind plasmid DNA by means of electrostatic interactions. Sub-toxic concentrations of PAE-GNRs were employed to deliver plasmid DNA to prostate cancer cells in vitro. PAE-GNRs generated using 1,4C-1,4Bis, a cationic polymer from our laboratory demonstrated significantly higher transgene expression and exhibited lower cytotoxicities when compared to similar assemblies generated using 25 kDa poly(ethylene imine) (PEI25k-GNRs), a current standard for polymer-mediated gene delivery. The roles of polyelectrolyte chemistry and zeta-potential in determining transgene expression efficacies of PAE-GNR assemblies were investigated. Our results indicate that stable and effective PAE-GNR assemblies are a promising engineered platform for transgene delivery. PAE-GNRs also have the potential to be used simultaneously for photothermal ablation, photothermally enhanced drug and gene delivery, and biological imaging, thus making them a powerful theranostic platform.
22011830,4,2011,Br J Radiol,Quantification of the UK 5-point breast imaging classification and mapping to BI-RADS to facilitate comparison with international literature.,OBJECTIVE: The UK 5-point breast imaging scoring system, recently formalised by the Royal College of Radiologists Breast Group, does not specify the likelihood of malignancy in each category. The breast imaging and reporting data system (BI-RADS) is widely used throughout North America and much of Europe. The main purpose of this study is to quantify the cancer likelihood of each of the UK 5-point categories and map them to comparable BI-RADS categories to facilitate comparison with North American and European literature and publication of UK research abroad.METHODS: During the 8 year study period, mammogram and ultrasound results were UK scored and the percentage of cancer outcomes within each group calculated. These were then compared with the percentage incidence of the BI-RADS categories.RESULTS: Of 23 741 separate assessment episodes, 15 288 mammograms and 10 642 ultrasound examinations were evaluated. There was a direct correlation between UK scoring and BI-RADS for categories 1 and 5. UK Score 2 lipomas and simple cysts correlated with BI-RADS 2, with the remaining UK Score 2 lesions (mostly fibroadenomas) assigned to BI-RADS 3. BI-RADS 4 incorporates a wide range of cancer risk (2-95%) with subdivisions a, b and c indicating increasing, but unspecified, likelihood of malignancy. UK Score 3 correlated with BI-RADS 4 a/b and UK Score 4 corresponded with BI-RADS 4c.CONCLUSION: This study quantifies the cancer likelihood of the UK scoring and maps them to parallel BI-RADS categories, with equivalent cancer risks. This facilitates the ability to share UK research data and clinical practice on an international scale.
21938629,4,2011,Methods Mol Biol,Detecting long-range chromatin interactions using the chromosome conformation capture sequencing (4C-seq) method.,Eukaryotic transcription is tightly regulated by transcriptional regulatory elements, even though these elements may be located far away from their target genes. It is now widely recognized that these regulatory elements can be brought in close proximity through the formation of chromatin loops, and that these loops are crucial for transcriptional regulation of their target genes. The chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique presents a snapshot of long-range interactions, by fixing physically interacting elements with formaldehyde, digestion of the DNA, and ligation to obtain a library of unique ligation products. Recently, several large-scale modifications to the 3C technique have been presented. Here, we describe chromosome conformation capture sequencing (4C-seq), a high-throughput version of the 3C technique that combines the 3C-on-chip (4C) protocol with next-generation Illumina sequencing. The method is presented for use in mammalian cell lines, but can be adapted to use in mammalian tissues and any other eukaryotic genome.
21866186,4,2011,Am J Hypertens,Validating a new oscillometric device for aortic pulse wave velocity measurements in children and adolescents.,BACKGROUND: Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is an indicator of aortic stiffness and a predictor of cardiovascular risk. Applanation tonometry (e.g., SphygmoCor) is a well-established method to measure aortic PWV (aPWV). The Vicorder, a new oscillometric device, has not been validated in children and adolescents.METHODS: We performed intra- and interobserver repeatability studies in 14 individuals using the Vicorder. Vicorder and SphygmoCor measurements were compared in 156 healthy children (6-18 years) using two different path length measurements.RESULTS: Intra- and interobserver repeatabilities of the Vicorder were excellent with coefficients of variation of 5.6% and 5.8% and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0.8 and 1.0. aPWV calculated using the distances (suprasternal notch-to-femoral recording point) - (suprasternal notch-to-carotid artery), the path length most commonly used in adults, revealed a mean of 4.8 ± 0.7 m/s for SphygmoCor and 4.9 ± 0.6 m/s for Vicorder. The percentage deviation between both devices was 13.0% and the limit of agreement (LoA) ranged from -1.0 to 1.7 m/s reflecting a good concordance. Using a path length that measured the distance from suprasternal notch to femoral recording point via the umbilicus (Umb), an even better agreement was found (percentage deviation: 11.8%, LoA: -1.0 to 1.6 m/s).CONCLUSIONS: Vicorder aPWV values are similar to those obtained by SphygmoCor applanation tonometry. The best agreement between devices was obtained with the path length that most accurately describes the aortic tree. Excellent intra- and interobserver repeatability and ease of measurements make Vicorder appropriate for large multicentre studies in children and adolescents.
21726197,4,2011,Biochem J,Reconstitution in liposomes of the functionally active human OCTN1 (SLC22A4) transporter overexpressed in Escherichia coli.,The hOCTN1 (human organic cation transporter 1) overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-chelating chromatography has been reconstituted in liposomes by detergent removal with a batch-wise procedure. The reconstitution was optimized with respect to the protein concentration, the detergent/phospholipid ratio and the time of incubation with Amberlite XAD-4 resin. Time-dependent [(14)C]tetraethylammonium, [(3)H]carnitine or [(3)H]ergothioneine uptake was measured in proteoliposomes with activities ratios of 8:1.3:1 respectively. Optimal activity was found at pH 8.0. The transport depended on intraliposomal ATP. [(14)C]tetraethylammonium transport was inhibited by several compounds. The most effective were acetyl-choline and γ-butyrobetaine, followed by acetylcarnitine and tetramethylammonium. Reagents such as pyridoxal 5-phosphate, MTSES [sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate] and mercurials strongly inhibited the transport. From kinetic analysis of tetraethylammonium transport a K(m) of 0.77 mM was calculated. Acetylcholine and γ-butyrobetaine behaved as competitive inhibitors of TEA (tetraethylammonium) transport with K(i) values of 0.44 and 0.63 mM respectively.
21667992,4,2011,Chem Res Toxicol,Cr(VI) induces DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and polyploidization: a flow cytometric and comet assay study in Pisum sativum.,Chromium(VI) is recognized as the most toxic valency of Cr, but its genotoxicity and cytostaticity in plants is still poorly studied. In order to analyze Cr(VI) cyto- and gentotoxicity, Pisum sativum L. plants were grown in soil and watered with solutions with different concentrations of Cr up to 2000 mg/L. After 28 days of exposure, leaves showed no significant variations in either cell cycle dynamics or ploidy level. As for DNA damage, flow cytometric (FCM) histograms showed significant differences in full peak coefficient of variation (FPCV) values, suggesting clastogenicity. This is paralleled by the Comet assay results, showing an increase in DNA damage for 1000 and 2000 mg/L. In roots, exposure to 2000 mg/L resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M checkpoint. It was also verified that under the same conditions 40% of the individuals analyzed suffered polyploidization having both 2C and 4C levels. DNA damage analysis by the Comet assay and FCM revealed dose-dependent increases in DNA damage and FPCV. Through this, we have unequivocally demonstrated for the first time in plants that Cr exposure can result in DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and polyploidization. Moreover, we critically compare the validity of the Comet assay and FCM in evaluating cytogenetic toxicity tests in plants and demonstrate that the data provided by both techniques complement each other and present high correlation levels. In conclusion, the data presented provides new insight on Cr effects in plants in general and supports the use of the parameters tested in this study as reliable endpoints for this metal toxicity in plants.
21571530,4,2011,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Discovery of a potent and selective small molecule hGPR91 antagonist.,GPR91, a 7TM G-Protein-Coupled Receptor, has been recently deorphanized with succinic acid as its endogenous ligand. Current literature indicates that GPR91 plays role in various pathophysiology including renal hypertension, autoimmune disease and retinal angiogenesis. Starting from a small molecule high-throughput screening hit 1 (hGPR91 IC(50): 0.8 μM)-originally synthesized in Merck for Bradykinin B(1) Receptor (BK(1)R) program, systematic structure-activity relationship study led us to discover potent and selective hGPR91 antagonists e.g. 2c, 4c, and 5 g (IC(50): 7-35 nM; &gt;1000 fold selective against hGPR99, a closest related GPCR; &gt;100 fold selective in Drug Matrix screening). This initial work also led to identification of two structurally distinct and orally bio-available lead compounds: 5g (%F: 26) and 7e (IC(50): 180 nM; &gt;100 fold selective against hGPR99; %F: 87). A rat pharmacodynamic assay was developed to characterize the antagonists in vivo using succinate induced increase in blood pressure. Using two representative antagonists, 2c and 4c, the GPR91 target engagement was subsequently demonstrated using the designed pharmacodynamic assay.
21458145,4,2011,Ultrasound Med Biol,Subcategorization of ultrasonographic BI-RADS category 4: positive predictive value and clinical factors affecting it.,The objective of this study was to evaluate the positive predictive value (PPV) in ultrasonographically (US)-detected breast lesions of BI-RADS category 4a, 4b and 4c and to find how various clinical factors influenced the PPV of category 4. A total of 2142 women with 2430 breast lesions diagnosed on US as BI-RADS category 4 and underwent biopsy were included. Among them, 452 (18.6%) were pathologically confirmed as malignancy. PPV of each US BI-RADS subcategory was 7.6% (149/1963) for category 4a, 37.8% (68/180) for category 4b and 81.9% (235/287) for category 4c. Several clinical factors were more significantly seen in malignancy of category 4a and 4b, whereas none of the factors showed significance in category 4c. Subcategorization of category 4 is a feasible method in predicting malignancy in which patients' age, lack of multiplicity and symptoms affected the PPV of category 4 lesions.
21419632,4,2011,Bioorg Med Chem,Radiosynthesis and in vivo evaluation of 1-[18F]fluoroelacridar as a positron emission tomography tracer for P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein.,Aim of this study was to label the potent dual P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor elacridar (1) with (18)F to provide a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer to visualize Pgp and BCRP. A series of new 1- and 2-halogen- and nitro-substituted derivatives of 1 (4a-e) was synthesized as precursor molecules and reference compounds for radiolabelling and shown to display comparable in vitro potency to 1 in increasing rhodamine 123 accumulation in a cell line overexpressing human Pgp (MDCKII-MDR1). 1-[(18)F]fluoroelacridar ([(18)F]4b) was synthesized in a decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 1.7±0.9% by a 1-step no-carrier added nucleophilic aromatic (18)F-substitution of 1-nitro precursor 4c. Small-animal PET imaging of [(18)F]4b was performed in naïve rats, before and after administration of unlabelled 1 (5 mg/kg, n=3), as well as in wild-type and Mdr1a/b((-/-))Bcrp1((-/-)) mice (n=3). In PET experiments in rats, administration of unlabelled 1 increased brain activity uptake by a factor of 9.5 (p=0.0002, 2-tailed Student's t-test), whereas blood activity levels remained unchanged. In Mdr1a/b((-/-))Bcrp1((-/-)) mice, the mean brain-to-blood ratio of activity at 60 min after tracer injection was 7.6 times higher as compared to wild-type animals (p=0.0002). HPLC analysis of rat brain tissue extracts collected at 40 min after injection of [(18)F]4b revealed that 93±7% of total radioactivity in brain was in the form of unchanged [(18)F]4b. In conclusion, the in vivo behavior of [(18)F]4b was found to be similar to previously described [(11)C]1 suggesting transport of [(18)F]4b by Pgp and/or BCRP at the rodent BBB. However, low radiochemical yields and a significant degree of in vivo defluorination will limit the utility of [(18)F]4b as a PET tracer.
21291453,4,2011,Clin Genet,High frequency of SH3TC2 mutations in Czech HMSN I patients.,Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy type 4C (CMT4C) is an autosomal recessive (AR), demyelinating neuropathy with early spine deformities caused by mutations in the SH3TC2 gene. To determine the spectrum of SH3TC2 mutations in the Czech population, the entire coding region of SH3TC2 was sequenced in 60 unrelated Czech patients. The prevalent mutation was shown to be the p.Arg954Stop. Therefore, 412 additional patients referred for CMT testing were tested for the presence of p.Arg954Stop only. Of 60 patients in whom the SH3TC2 gene was sequenced, at least one mutation was detected in 13 (21.7%) patients and biallelic pathogenic mutations were detected in 7 (11.6%) patients. Of the 412 patients tested for p.Arg954Stop, the mutation was found in 8 patients (1.94%), 6 were homozygous and 2 were heterozygous. The second causative mutation was detected by sequencing in one of the patients but not in the other. Nine novel sequence variants were detected. Their pathogenicity was further tested in silico and in control samples. Mutations in the SH3TC2 gene are a frequent cause of demyelinating hereditary neuropathy among Czech patients. In total, at least one mutation was found in 21 unrelated patients. CMT4C seems to be the most frequent type of AR CMT and one of the most frequent of all CMT types. Mutation p.Arg954Stop is highly prevalent in the Czech population. Patients with demyelinating neuropathy along with non-dominant mode of inheritance and negative for CMT1A/hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy should be tested for the presence of the p.Arg954Stop mutation or other mutations in the SH3TC2 gene.
22206006,3,2011,PLoS One,tRNA gene identity affects nuclear positioning.,The three-dimensional organization of genomes is dynamic and plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular development and phenotypes. Here we use proximity-based ligation methods (i.e. chromosome conformation capture [3C] and circularized chromosome confrmation capture [4C]) to explore the spatial organization of tRNA genes and their locus-specific interactions with the ribosomal DNA. Directed replacement of one lysine and two leucine tRNA loci shows that tRNA spatial organization depends on both tRNA coding sequence identity and the surrounding chromosomal loci. These observations support a model whereby the three-dimensional, spatial organization of tRNA loci within the nucleus utilizes tRNA gene-specific signals to affect local interactions, though broader organization of chromosomal regions are determined by factors outside the tRNA genes themselves.
22135913,3,2011,Chin J Physiol,Physiological demands of cyclists during an ultra-endurance relay race: a field study report.,This study was to describe and compare the physiological demands of ultra-endurance cyclists during a 24 h cycling relay race. Eleven male athletes (means +/- SD: 34.8 +/- 5.6 years; 71.6 +/- 4.9 kg; 174.6 +/- 7.3 cm; BMI 23.5 +/- 0.5 kg/m2; VO2 max: 66.0 +/- 6.4 ml/kg/min) participated in the study; eight in teams with a format of four riders (4C) and three in teams with six riders (6C). To investigate exercise intensity, heart rate (HR) was recorded while cycling using portable telemetric monitors. Three different exercise intensities were defined according to the reference HR values obtained during a pre race laboratory incremental VO2 max test: Zone I (&lt; anaerobic threshold [AT]), Zone II (between AT and the respiratory compensation point [RCP]), Zone III (&gt; RCP). Total volume and intensity were integrated as a single variable (training impulse: TRIMP). The score for TRIMP in each zone was computed by multiplying the accumulated duration in this zone by a multiplier for this particular zone of exercise intensity. The average intensity did not differ between cyclists in 4C (means +/- SD; 4C: 87 +/- 3 HRmax) and 6C (87 +/- 1% of HRmax), despite the higher volume performed by 4C (means +/- SD; 4C: 361 +/- 65; 6C: 242 +/- 25 per min; P = 0.012). These differences in total exercise volume significantly affected the values TRIMP accumulated (means +/- SD; 4C: 801 +/- 98, confidence interval [CI] 95%: 719 - 884; 6C: 513 +/- 25, CI 95%: 451 - 575; P = 0.012). The ultra-endurance threshold of 4C and 6C athletes lies at about 87% of HRmax for both. Although the intensity profile was similar, the TRIMP values differed significantly as a consequence of the higher volume performed by the 4C cyclists.
21515714,3,2011,Cereb Cortex,Differential architecture of multisynaptic geniculo-cortical pathways to V4 and MT.,Parallel visual pathways in the primate brain known as the dorsal and ventral streams receive retinal inputs mainly through the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Inputs from these layers terminate within distinct parts of layer 4C of V1 (visual area 1). Due to the complexity of M- and P-derived neural connectivity in V1 and higher visual areas, the contributions of M and P inputs to the dorsal and ventral streams remain unclear. Employing retrograde transsynaptic transport of rabies virus, we analyzed the architecture of bottom-up pathways toward ventral stream area V4 (visual area 4) and dorsal stream area MT (middle temporal area). We found that V4 receives both M and P inputs &quot;trisynaptically&quot; from layer 4C via layer 2/3 of V1, whereas MT receives M-dominant input &quot;disynaptically&quot; from layer 4C via layer 4B of V1. V4 also receives disynaptic input from the dorsal stream portion of V2 (visual area 2) (i.e., cytochrome oxidase-stained thick stripes). Moreover, both M and P inputs reach V4 trisynaptically and MT disynaptically through &quot;short-cut&quot; pathways that bypass layer 4C of V1. The differential patterns of multisynaptic geniculo-cortical pathways to V4 and MT imply distinct modes of information processing in the dorsal and ventral streams.
21439690,3,2011,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel 2-aralkyl-5-substituted-6-(4'-fluorophenyl)-imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazole derivatives as potent anticancer agents.,Levamisole, the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative has been reported as a potential antitumor agent. In the present study, we synthesized, characterized and evaluated biological activity of its novel analogues with substitution in the aralkyl group and on imidazothiadiazole molecules with same chemical backbone but different side chains namely 2-aralkyl-6-(4'-fluorophenyl)-imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazoles (SCR1), 2-aralkyl-5-bromo-6-(4'-fluorophenyl)-imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]-thiadiazoles (SCR2), 2-aralkyl-5-formyl-6-(4'-fluorophenyl)-imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]-thiadiazoles (SCR3) and 2-aralkyl-5-thiocyanato-6-(4'-fluorophenyl)-imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]-thiadiazoles (SCR4) on leukemia cells. The cytotoxic studies showed that 3a, 4a, and 4c exhibited strong cytotoxicity while others had moderate cytotoxicity. Among these we chose 4a (IC50, 8 μM) for understanding its mechanism of cytotoxicity. FACS analysis in conjunction with mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation studies indicated that 4a induced apoptosis without cell cycle arrest suggesting that it could be used as a potential chemotherapeutic agent.
21353551,3,2011,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazines: orally efficacious inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC2.,The discovery and optimization of a series of imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine inhibitors of mTOR is described.

21273580,3,2011,Anticancer Res,Feulgen staining remains the gold standard for precise DNA image cytometry.,AIM: The suitability of Papanicolaou staining and of hematoxylin staining for DNA single-cell cytometry was investigated in comparison to Feulgen staining.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten normal cervical smears and ten cervical smears containing cells of a squamous cell carcinoma in situ were analyzed. The integrated optical density (IOD) of 200 epithelial cells, chosen per random, was determined using a CM-1 TV-image analysis system (Hund, Wetzlar, Germany). Various DNA cytometric variables, accepted by the European Society for Analytical and Cellular Pathology (ESACP), and the mean nuclear area were calculated. Two measurements were performed after Papanicolaou staining (wavelengths: 530 nm and 590 nm), followed by measurements after hematoxylin re-staining (wavelength: 590 nm) and after Feulgen restaining (wavelength: 570 nm).RESULTS: All histograms of Feulgen-stained normal squamous epithelia revealed a regular DNA distribution. The corresponding histograms after Papanicolaou staining or hematoxylin staining showed a wide scatter of values instead of a clear-cut diploid peak and an increased number of values &gt;4c. Similar findings were observed in the carcinomatous smears. In particular, the mean values of the dispersion parameters (2cDI, entropy, ploidy imbalance and 2,5cEE) were significantly increased as compared to Feulgen staining.CONCLUSION: Diagnostic or prognostic conclusions cannot be drawn from DNA measurements on Papanicolaou-stained or hematoxylin-stained specimens; Feulgen staining remains the gold standard for such purposes.
21206059,3,2011,Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr,Exploring binding sites other than the catalytic core in the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of MKP-4.,Map kinase phosphatase 4 (MKP-4), which has been implicated in signalling pathways that negatively regulate glucose uptake, belongs to the dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family. An inherent property of MKPs is an ability to undergo structural rearrangement, transitioning from a partially active to a fully active conformation. Here, a 2.7 Å resolution crystal structure of the catalytic domain of MKP-4 (MKP-4C) is presented. It was determined that the MKP-4C structure seriously deviates from canonical conformations of DUSPs and this characteristic feature results in significant gaps between the catalytic core and several surrounding loops which are unique compared with other MKP counterparts that adopt an active conformation. Using virtual library screening, it was found that inhibitors bind to MKP-4C with high affinity near these gaps. Inhibitors that target other binding sites instead of the active site can be utilized to prevent transition to a fully active conformation. Compounds that are able to make contacts with these sites in MKP-4 would not only provide a beneficial increase in affinity but may also permit greater specificity relative to other protein tyrosine phosphatases.
23145236,3,2011,Iperception,Stream/bounce event perception reveals a temporal limit of motion correspondence based on surface feature over space and time.,We examined how stream/bounce event perception is affected by motion correspondence based on the surface features of moving objects passing behind an occlusion. In the stream/bounce display two identical objects moving across each other in a two-dimensional display can be perceived as either streaming through or bouncing off each other at coincidence. Here, surface features such as colour (Experiments 1 and 2) or luminance (Experiment 3) were switched between the two objects at coincidence. The moment of coincidence was invisible to observers due to an occluder. Additionally, the presentation of the moving objects was manipulated in duration after the feature switch at coincidence. The results revealed that a postcoincidence duration of approximately 200 ms was required for the visual system to stabilize judgments of stream/bounce events by determining motion correspondence between the objects across the occlusion on the basis of the surface feature. The critical duration was similar across motion speeds of objects and types of surface features. Moreover, controls (Experiments 4a-4c) showed that cognitive bias based on feature (colour/luminance) congruency across the occlusion could not fully account for the effects of surface features on the stream/bounce judgments. We discuss the roles of motion correspondence, visual feature processing, and attentive tracking in the stream/bounce judgments.
22194094,2,2011,Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,Echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular volumes: a comparison of different techniques in children after surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot.,AIMS: Different echocardiographic techniques are available for assessing right ventricular (RV) volumes but their clinical validity has not been well established. We compared the feasibility, reproducibility and accuracy of three different echocardiographic techniques for measuring RV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) in children after tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair.METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy patients (age 14.2 ± 7.3 years) were studied using three-dimensional (3D) volume acquisition analysis (Tomtec, Germany), 2D echo with knowledge-based 3D reconstruction (3DR) (Ventripoint, USA) and the four-chamber area (4C area) methods. Parameters analysed were RV end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume and EF. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were available in 41 patients. Intra- and inter-observer as well as inter-technique variability was assessed using Pearson's correlation analysis (R), coefficient of variance, and Bland-Altman analysis. Feasibility was good for all echo techniques (91% for the 3D, 98% for the 3DR, and 100% for the 4C area method). Intra- and inter-observer variability was low for both 3DR and the 3D echo, while more variability was observed for the 4C method. Compared with MRI volumes, 3DR and 3D underestimated EDV by 6.6 ± 10 and 18.2 ± 17.8 mL, respectively, (P &lt; 0.001), while the 4C area method overestimated the EDV by 9.6 ± 33 mL, not significant due to a wide range.CONCLUSION: Current echocardiographic techniques to assess RV volumes are highly feasible and reproducible in paediatric post-operative TOF patients. When compared with MRI measurements, 3DR was the most accurate technique but requires extra equipment that is not readily available.
22104300,2,2011,J Inorg Biochem,Platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes with (N,N') and (C,N,N')- ligands derived from pyrazole as anticancer and antimalarial agents: synthesis, characterization and in vitro activities.,The study of the reactivity of three 1-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-1H-pyrazole derivatives of general formula [1-(CH(2))(2)NMe(2)}-3,5-R(2)-pzol] {where pzol represents pyrazole and R=H (1a), Me (1b) or Ph (1c)} with [MCl(2)(DMSO)(2)] (M=Pt or Pd) under different experimental conditions allowed us to isolate and characterize cis-[M{κ(2)-N,N'-{[1-(CH(2))(2)NMe(2)}-3,5-R(2)-pzol])}Cl(2)] {MM=PtPt (2a-2c) or Pd (3a-3c)} and two cyclometallated complexes [M{κ(3)-C,N,N'-{[1-(CH(2))(2)NMe(2)}-3-(C(5)H(4))-5-Ph-pzol])}Cl] {M=Pt(II) (4c) or Pd(II) (5c)}. Compounds 4c and 5c arise from the orthometallation of the 3-phenyl ring of ligand 1c. Complex 2a has been further characterized by X-ray crystallography. Ligands and complexes were evaluated for their in vitro antimalarial against Plasmodium falciparum and cytotoxic activities against lung (A549) and breast (MDA MB231 and MCF7) cancer cellular lines. Complexes 2a-2c and 5c exhibited only moderate antimalarial activities against two P. falciparum strains (3D7 and W2). Interestingly, cytotoxicity assays revealed that the platinacycle 4c exhibits a higher toxicity than cisplatin in the three human cell lines and that the complex 2a presents a remarkable cytotoxicity and selectivity in lung (IC(50)=3 μM) versus breast cancer cell lines (IC(50)&gt;20 μM). Thus, complexes 2c and 4c appear to be promising leads, creating a novel family of anticancer agents. Electrophoretic DNA migration studies in presence of the synthesized compounds have been performed, in order to get further insights into their mechanism of action.
22100817,2,2011,Vision Res,Spatial characteristics of motion-sensitive mechanisms change with age and stimulus spatial frequency.,Contrast-dependent interactions between classical (CRF) and non-classical regions (nCRF) of visual neuron receptive fields are well documented in primate visual cortex. Physiological models that describe CRF and nCRF interactions in single neurons have recently been applied to psychophysical measures of spatial summation and suppression in motion perception of young adults (Tadin &amp; Lappin, 2005). We wished to determine whether such models could account for the reduction in spatial suppression that occurs in normal aging (Betts et al., 2005). We applied three models to duration thresholds obtained in a simple motion discrimination task using drifting Gabor stimuli that ranged in spatial frequency from 0.5 to 4c/deg. We found that a model in which the center CRF and surrounding nCRF are represented as spatially-overlapping excitatory and inhibitory 2D Gaussians with independent contrast response functions, which we call the Gain model, could account for the effects of aging simply by increasing the spatial extent of the CRF. Two additional models were evaluated. The Size model, which varied the size of the CRF as a function of contrast, produced CRF and nCRF size constants that departed significantly from physiological estimates of receptive field sizes. The Drive model, which yoked the activation of the suppressive nCRF to the CRF response, yielded reasonable fits to the data and suggested an age-related decline in the strength of suppression from the nCRF. However, the Drive model estimated the CRF size parameter to be equal to, or even slightly larger than, the nCRF size parameter, which is inconsistent with the physiological literature. Our findings therefore suggest that the Gain model provides the most plausible estimates of receptive field sizes. Based on this model, age-related increases in the size of central excitatory receptive fields relative to the inhibitory surrounds may contribute to behavioral measures of reduced spatial suppression found in older observers.
21948239,2,2011,Mol Cell Biochem,CTCF and cohesin cooperatively mediate the cell-type specific interchromatin interaction between Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci.,CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master organizer of genome spatial organization and plays an important role in mediating extensive chromatin interactions. Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) is a high-throughput approach that allows genome-wide screening for unknown potential interaction partners. Using a conserved CTCF binding site on the Bcl11b locus as bait, an interaction partner at the Arhgap6 locus on a different chromosome was identified by 4C. Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF and cohesin. Functional analysis showed that the interchromatin interaction partners were repressing regulatory elements. These results indicate that interaction chromatin loops regulate the expression of the relevant genes.
21921980,2,2011,Mol Vis,Major intrinsic protein (MIP) polymorphism is associated with age-related cataract in Chinese.,PURPOSE: Age-related cataract (ARC) is a complex multi-factorial disorder involving several genetic and environmental factors. The major intrinsic protein of lens fiber gene (MIP) encodes the most abundant junctional membrane protein in the mature lens and plays a critical role in maintainace of lens normal structure and internal circulation. To determine the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MIP and the susceptibility to ARC in a Chinese population, we conducted this case-control study.METHODS: A total of 164 unrelated ARC patients and 132 normal controls were involved in the study. All participants completed full physical and ophthalmic examinations and provided a blood sample for DNA extraction. Seven SNPs (rs2269348, rs61759527, c.-4T&gt;C, rs77163805, rs74641138, rs35033450, and rs36032520) in MIP were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then sequenced. Statistical analysis was performed using SNPstats.RESULTS: Polymorphisms rs61759527, rs77163805, rs35033450, and rs36032520 were not detected in all 296 subjects. There were no statistical differences in genotype or allele frequency of rs2269348 and rs74641138 between ARC cases and controls. But in c.-4C&gt;T, cataract patients had a higher TC genotype and C allele frequencies (p=0.0018 and p=0.017, respectively) compared to healthy controls. The haplotype CCG of rs2269348, c.-4T&gt;C and rs74641138 also exhibited a significantly higher distribution in cases than controls (OR=8.83, p=0.0024).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the genotype TC in polymorphism c.-4T&gt;C and haplotype CCG of rs2269348, c.-4T&gt;C, and rs74641138 in MIP may attach an additional genetic risk factor for ARC in Chinese. This is the first association study about SNPs in MIP and susceptibility to ARC in Chinese population.
21895982,2,2011,Chem Biol Drug Des,Synthesis and biological evaluation of some novel 1,4-dihydropyridines as potential antitubercular agents.,Recent studies showed that 1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarbamoyl derivatives with lipophilic groups have significant antitubercular activity. In this study, we have synthesized new derivatives of 1,4-dihydropyridines bearing carbmethoxy and carbethoxy group at C-3 and C-5 of the 1,4-dihydropyridine ring. In addition, 1H-pyrazole ring is substituted at C-4 position. These analogues were synthesized by multi-component Hantzsch reaction. The in vitro antitubercular activity of compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37) Rv was evaluated. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration value, 0.02 μg/mL and SI &gt; 500, was found for dimethyl 1,4-dihydro-4-(3-(4-nitrophenyl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2,6-dimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate 3f, diethyl 1,4-dihydro-4-(3-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2,6-dimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate 4c and diethyl 1,4-dihydro-4-(3-(4-bromophenyl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2,6-dimethyl pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate 4e, making them more potent than first-line antitubercular drug isoniazid. In addition, these compounds exhibited relatively low cytotoxicity.
21801146,2,2011,Med Chem,4-Aryl-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile derivatives: evaluation of Src kinase inhibitory and anticancer activities.,Src kinase mutations and/or overexpression have been implicated in the development of a number of human cancer including colon, breast, and lung cancers. Thus, designing potent and selective Src kinase inhibitors as anticancer agents is a subject of major interest. A series of 4-aryl substituted derivatives of 2-amino-7-dimethylamino-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile were synthesized using one-pot reaction of appropriate substituted aromatic aldehydes, malononitrile, and 3-(dimethylamino)phenol in the presence of piperidine. All 23 compounds were evaluated for inhibition of Src kinase and cell proliferation in human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) and leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cell lines. Among the tested compounds, 2-chlorophenyl- (4c), 3-nitrophenyl- (4h), 4-trifluoromethyphenyl- (4i), and 2,3-dichlorophenyl- (4k) substituted chromenes showed Src kinase inhibitory effect with IC(50) values of 11.1-18.3 µM. Compound 4c was relatively selective against Src (IC(50) = 11.1 µM), when compared with selected kinases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, IC(50) &gt; 300 µM), C-terminal Src kinase (Csk, IC(50) = 101.7 µM), and lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck, IC(50) = 46.8 µM). 3-Chlorophenyl substituted thiazole (4v) and 2-chlorophenylsubstituted thiazole (4u) chromene derivatives inhibited the cell proliferation of HT-29 and CCRF-CEM by 80% and 50% respectively, at a concentration of 50 µM. The data indicate that 4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile scaffold has the potential to be optimized further for designing more potent Src kinase inhibitors and/or anticancer lead compounds.
21797204,2,2011,Org Lett,Bicyclic 1,2,3-triazolium ionic liquids: synthesis, characterization, and application to rutaecarpine synthesis.,Starting with commercial reagents, bicyclic 1,2,3-triazolium ionic liquids [b-3C-tr][NTf(2)] (1) and [b-4C-tr][NTf(2)] (2) were synthesized in four steps with high overall isolated yields of 68% and 76%, respectively. Since the C-5 hydrogen is acidic, under basic condition ionic liquids 1 and 2 were readily methylated with methyl iodide to afford chemically stable ionic liquids 7 and 8 at room temperature (88% and 82%, respectively). Ionic liquid 1 was used as the ionic solvent to demonstrate its usefulness for the synthesis of rutaecarpine, a natural product.
21766854,2,2011,J Med Chem,Design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of novel hybrid compounds to treat sickle cell disease symptoms.,A novel series of thalidomide derivatives (4a-f) designed by molecular hybridization were synthesized and evaluated in vitro and in vivo for their potential use in the oral treatment of sickle cell disease symptoms. Compounds 4a-f demonstrated analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and NO-donor properties. Compounds 4c and 4d were considered promising candidate drugs and were further evaluated in transgenic sickle cell mice to determine their capacity to reduce the levels of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Unlike hydroxyurea, the compounds reduced the concentrations of TNFα to levels similar to those induced with the control dexamethasone (300 μmol/kg). These compounds are novel lead drug candidates with multiple beneficial actions in the treatment of sickle cell disease symptoms and offer an alternative to hydroxyurea treatment.
21744007,2,2011,Pathol Oncol Res,Variations in suppressor molecule ctla-4 gene are related to susceptibility to multiple myeloma in a polish population.,Various phenotype and functional T-cell abnormalities are observed in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between polymorphisms in the gene encoding cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), a negative regulator of the T-lymphocyte immune response and susceptibility to multiple myeloma in a Polish population. Two hundred MM patients and 380 healthy subjects were genotyped for the following polymorphisms: CTLA-4c.49A&gt;G, CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T, CTLA-4g.*642AT(8_33), CT60 (CTLA-4g.*6230G&gt;A), Jo31 (CTLA-4g.*10223G&gt;T). Our study is the largest and most comprehensive evaluation to date of the association between genetic polymorphisms in the CTLA-4 molecule and multiple myeloma. It was found that CTLA-4c.49A&gt;G[G], CT60[G], and Jo31[G] alleles were more frequently observed in MM patients than in controls (0.50 vs. 0.44, p = 0.03, 0.65 vs. 0.58, p = 0.04, and 0.63 vs. 0.57, p = 0.03, respectively). Moreover, the haplotype CTLA-4c.49A&gt;G[G], CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T[C], CTLA-4g.*642AT(8_33) [8], CT60[G], Jo31[G] including all susceptibility alleles increases the risk of MM about fourfold (OR: 3.79, 95%CI: 2.08-6.89, p = 0.00001). These findings indicate that genetic variations in the CTLA-4 gene play role in susceptibility to multiple myeloma and warrant further investigation through replication studies.
21664013,2,2011,Eur J Med Chem,Single step synthesis of new fused pyrimidine derivatives and their evaluation as potent Aurora-A kinase inhibitors.,A simple, facile, efficient and one pot three-component procedure for the synthesis of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines and pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles ring systems incorporating phenylsulfonyl moiety was developed via the reaction of 1-aryl-2-(phenylsulfonyl)ethanone derivatives 1a-d with the appropriate heterocyclic amine and triethyl orthoformate and evaluated as Aurora-A kinase inhibitors. The cytotoxic activity of the newly synthesized compounds against HST116 colon tumor cell line was investigated. 2,7-Diphenyl-6-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine (4b) and its p-methoxy analogue 4c were found to be equipotent to Doxorubicin as a reference drug. Molecular modeling study was carried out in order to rationalize the in vitro anti-tumor results.
22933947,2,2011,Radiol Oncol,Target and peripheral dose from radiation sector motions accompanying couch repositioning of patient coordinates with the Gamma Knife(®) Perfexion(™).,BACKGROUND: The GammaPlan(™) treatment planning system (TPS) does not fully account for shutter dose when multiple shots are required to deliver a patient's treatment. The unaccounted exposures to the target site and its periphery are measured in this study. The collected data are compared to a similar effect from the Gamma Knife(®) model 4C. MATERIALS AND METHODS.: A stereotactic head frame was attached to a Leksell(®) 16 cm diameter spherical phantom; using a fiducial-box, CT images of the phantom were acquired and registered in the TPS. Measurements give the relationship of measured dose to the number of repositions with the patient positioning system (PPS) and to the collimator size. An absorbed dose of 10 Gy to the 50% isodose line was prescribed to the target site and all measurements were acquired with an ionization chamber.RESULTS: Measured dose increases with frequency of repositioning and with collimator size. As the radiation sectors transition between the beam on and beam off states, the target receives more shutter dose than the periphery. Shutter doses of 3.53±0.04 and 1.59±0.04 cGy/reposition to the target site are observed for the 16 and 8 mm collimators, respectively. The target periphery receives additional dose that varies depending on its position relative to the target.CONCLUSIONS: The radiation sector motions for the Gamma Knife(®) Perfexion(™) result in an additional dose due to the shutter effect. The magnitude of this exposure is comparable to that measured for the model 4C.
21553901,2,2011,J Am Chem Soc,Quantification of the electrophilic reactivities of aldehydes, imines, and enones.,The rates of the epoxidation reactions of aldehydes, of the aziridination reactions of aldimines, and of the cyclopropanation reactions of α,β-unsaturated ketones with aryl-stabilized dimethylsulfonium ylides have been determined photometrically in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). All of these sulfur ylide-mediated cyclization reactions as well as the addition reactions of stabilized carbanions to N-tosyl-activated aldimines have been shown to follow a second-order rate law, where the rate constants reflect the (initial) CC bond formation between nucleophile and electrophile. The derived second-order rate constants (log k(2)) have been combined with the known nucleophilicity parameters (N, s(N)) of the aryl-stabilized sulfur ylides 4a,b and of the acceptor-substituted carbanions 4c-h to calculate the electrophilicity parameters E of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes (1a-i), N-acceptor-substituted aromatic aldimines (2a-e), and α,β-unsaturated ketones (3a-f) according to the linear free-energy relationship log k(2) = s(N)(N + E) as defined in J. Am. Chem. Soc.2001, 123, 9500-9512. The data reported in this work provide the first quantitative comparison of the electrophilic reactivities of aldehydes, imines, and simple Michael acceptors in DMSO with carbocations and cationic metal-π complexes within our comprehensive electrophilicity scale.
21520399,2,2011,Cytometry A,High-purity flow sorting of early meiocytes based on DNA analysis of guinea pig spermatogenic cells.,Mammalian spermatogenesis is still nowadays poorly understood at the molecular level. Testis cellular heterogeneity is a major drawback for spermatogenic gene expression studies, especially when research is focused on stages that are usually very short and poorly represented at the cellular level such as initial meiotic prophase I (i.e., leptotene [L] and zygotene [Z]). Presumably, genes whose products are involved in critical meiotic events such as alignment, pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes are expressed during the short stages of early meiotic prophase. Aiming to characterize mammalian early meiotic gene expression, we have found the guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) as an especially attractive model. A detailed analysis of its first spermatogenic wave by flow cytometry (FCM) and optical microscopy showed that guinea pig testes exhibit a higher representation of early meiotic stages compared to other studied rodents, partly because of their longer span, and also as a result of the increased number of cells entering meiosis. Moreover, we have found that adult guinea pig testes exhibit a peculiar 4C DNA content profile, with a bimodal peak for L/Z and P spermatocytes that is absent in other rodents. Besides, we show that this unusual 4C peak allows the separation by FCM of highly pure L/Z spermatocyte populations aside from pachytene ones, even from adult individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first report on an accurate and suitable method for highly pure early meiotic prophase cell isolation from adult mammals, and thus sets an interesting approach for gene expression studies aiming at a deeper understanding of the molecular groundwork underlying male gamete production.
21487769,2,2011,Mol Biotechnol,Over-expression in E. coli and purification of the human OCTN2 transport protein.,The OCTN2 cDNA amplified from human skin fibroblast was cloned in pET-41a(+) carrying the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene. The construct pET-41a(+)-hOCTN2 was used to express the GST-hOCTN2 fusion protein in Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS. The best over-expression was obtained after 6 h of induction with IPTG at 28°C. The GST-hOCTN2 polypeptide was collected in the inclusion bodies and showed an apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE of 85 kDa. After solubilization with a buffer containing 0.8% sarkosyl and 3 M urea, the fusion protein was applied onto a Ni(2+)-chelating chromatography column. The purified GST-hOCTN2 was treated with thrombin, and the hOCTN2 was separated from the GST by size exclusion chromatography. After the whole procedure, a yield of about 0.2 mg purified protein per liter of cell culture was obtained. To improve the protein yield, hOCTN2 cDNA was subjected to codon bias. The second codon CGG was substituted with AAA; the substitution led to the mutation R2K in the hOCTN2 protein. hOCTN2(R2K) cDNA was cloned in pET-21a(+) carrying a C-terminal 6His tag. The resulting protein was expressed in E. coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS and purified by Ni(2+)-chelating chromatography. A yield of about 3.5 mg purified protein per liter of cell culture was obtained with this procedure.
21459581,2,2011,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of estradiol linked pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) conjugates as potential anticancer agents.,A series of new estradiol linked pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (E(2)-PBD) conjugates (3a-f, 4a-f and 5a-f) with different linker architectures including a triazole moiety have been designed and synthesized. All the 18 compounds have been evaluated for their anticancer activity and it is observed that some of the compounds particularly 4c-e and 5c,d exhibited significant anticancer activity. The detailed biological aspects relating to the cell cycle effects and tubulin depolymerization activity have been examined with a view to understand the mechanism of action of these conjugates. Among all these conjugates, one of the compound 5c could be considered as the most effective compound particularly against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line.
21425480,2,2011,J Integr Neurosci,On the use of visual motion perception to assess magnocellular integrity.,It has been proposed, particularly in connection with dyslexia and schizophrenia, that motion perception can be used to assess magnocellular integrity. This suggestion is examined in this paper. The following observations are made: (1) motion information, i.e., information about direction and speed, is extracted at the cortical level, (2) the magnocellular system provides input to the motion selective cortical entities, and (3) so do the parvo- and koniocellular systems. Therefore, although the magnocellular system clearly has the ability to influence motion perception so do other parts of the visual system, e.g., cortical mechanisms. It is concluded that motion perception by itself is not a reliable test of magnocellular integrity.
21414146,2,2011,Chem Biol Drug Des,Antitubercular activity of new coumarins.,The present article describes a series of 21 N '-benzylidene-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carbohydrazides 4a-4v, which were synthesized and evaluated for their cell viabilities in non-infected and Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin-infected macrophages. Subsequently, the non-cytotoxic compounds 4c, 4g, 4h, 4j, 4l and 4t were assessed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATCC 27294 using the microplate Alamar Blue assay and the activity expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration in μg/mL. These compounds exhibited a significant activity (50-100 μg/mL) when compared to the first-line drugs, such as pyrazinamide (PZA &gt;100 μg/mL). These results could be considered a good starting point for further studies to develop new lead compounds to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
21332736,2,2011,Aust Dent J,Australian population norms for the Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF-4C).,BACKGROUND: The Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF-4C) is a theoretically derived test developed to allow clinicians and researchers to measure a person's level of dental fear. Population norms have not previously been made available for the IDAF-4C. The aim of this study was to provide Australian norms for the IDAF-4C using percentile ranks and to examine associations between scores and individual-level characteristics, dental avoidance and fear of pain.METHODS: A stratified random sample of 1511 Australian adults yielded complete questionnaire data for 1063 individuals (70.4%). Percentile ranks were calculated for IDAF-4C full scale scores stratified by age and gender.RESULTS: IDAF-4C mean scores varied significantly by age, gender, income, and speaking a language other than English at home. Tables to convert raw scores to percentiles showed that full scale scores varied by age and gender. Scores on the IDAF-4C had strong and significant associations with avoidance of the dentist due to fear, average dental visiting frequency and anxiety about pain when going to the dentist.CONCLUSIONS: Population norms allow clinicians or researchers to compare results for an individual or subgroup to the Australian population. It is recommended that a dental fear scale be used to screen all dental patients for dental fear to enable a more tailored and effective dental treatment experience.

21194809,2,2011,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of 3,5-diaryl isoxazoline/isoxazole linked 2,3-dihydroquinazolinone hybrids as anticancer agents.,A series of new 3,5-diaryl isoxazoline/isoxazole linked 2,3-dihydro quinazolinone hybrids with different linker architectures have been designed and synthesized. These compounds have been evaluated for their anticancer activity. One of the compounds 4c amongst this series has shown promising anticancer activity.

22147608,1,2011,J Histochem Cytochem,Effects of long-term storage on the detection of proteins, DNA, and mRNA in tissue microarray slides.,Storage of tissue slides has been claimed to induce dramatically reduced antigen detection particularly for immunohistochemistry (IHC). With tissue microarrays, the necessity to serially cut blocks in order to obtain as much material as possible is obvious. The presumed adverse effect of storage might hamper such an approach. The authors designed an experimental setting consisting of four different storage conditions with storage time of tissue slides of up to 1 year. Detection of proteins, DNA, and mRNA was performed using IHC and in situ hybridization techniques. Slight but significant changes in IHC occurred over time. The most important factor is the primary antibody used: four showed no significant changes, whereas limited decreases in 8 antibodies could be detected by image analysis. Whether the antigen was nuclear or cytoplasmic/membranous did not matter. No major differences between different storage conditions could be shown, but storage at 4C was overall the best procedure. Furthermore, gene copy number aberrations, chromosomal translocations, and the presence of mRNA could be detected on slides stored up to 1 year. In conclusion, in tissues optimally formalin fixed and using modern histological techniques, only minute changes in tissue antigenicity are induced by long-term storage.
22042969,1,2011,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Estimation of beta-ray skin dose from exposure to fission fallout from the Hiroshima atomic bomb.,Beta-ray skin dose due to the fission fallout from the Hiroshima atomic bomb is potentially related to the epilation in the black rain area. The absorbed dose to the skin from beta-rays emitted by fission fallout has been estimated for an initial ¹³⁷Cs deposition of 1 kBq m⁻² on the ground at 0.5 h after the explosion. The estimated skin dose takes into account both external exposure from fission fallout radionuclides uniformly distributed in 1 mm of soil on the surface of the ground and from a 26 μm thickness of contaminated soil on the skin, using the Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNP-4C. The cumulative skin dose for 1 month after the explosion is taken as the representative value. The estimated skin dose for an initial ¹³⁷Cs deposition of 1 kBq m⁻² was determined to be about 500 mSv.
22020462,1,2011,Cryo Letters,Cryopreservation of adult bovine testicular tissue for spermatogonia enrichment.,To develop a procedure for cryopreservation of adult bovine testis tissue, the effects of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), propylene glycol (PG), ethylene glycol (EG), and their concentrations (v/v), as well as different thawing temperatures, on the cell viability of bovine testis tissue after freezing/thawing were examined. The highest testicular cell viabilities came from the media containing DMSO (85.3 ± 1.2 percent), PG (82 ± 1.0 percent) and EG (83.4 ± 1.0 percent) at 10 percent concentration respectively. Using 10 percent DMSO gave significantly higher spermatogonia percentage (61.1 ± 1.2 percent, P &lt; 0.001) than processing with 10 percent PG (54.3 ± 0.6 percent) or 10 percent EG (55 ± 1.8 percent) after differential plating. Thawing in water bath of 37 or 97-100 degree C also provided significantly higher viabilities (85.1 ± 1.0, 85 ± 1.0 percent, P &lt; 0.01, respectively) and spermatogonia percentages (56.6 ± 2.0, 56.6 ± 2.6 percent, P &lt; 0.01, respectively) than that thawing at 4C (23.4 ± 0.8 percent for total viability, 8.97 ± 1.0 percent for spermatogonia percentage). Collectively, 10 percent DMSO and thawing in 37-100 degree C water baths were appropriate for the cryopreservation of bovine testicular tissue and subsequent spermatogonia enrichment.
22017497,1,2011,J Med Chem,Novel reversible monoamine oxidase A inhibitors: highly potent and selective 3-(1H-pyrrol-3-yl)-2-oxazolidinones.,Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) are involved in various psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders; hence, MAO inhibitors are useful agents in the therapy of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's dementia, and depression syndrome. Herein we report a novel series of 3-(1H-pyrrol-3-yl)-2-oxazolidinones 3-7 as reversible, highly potent and selective anti-MAO-A agents. In particular, 4b, 5b, and 4c showed a K(i-MAO-A) of 0.6, 0.8, and 1 nM, respectively, 4c being 200000-fold selective for MAO-A with respect to MAO-B.
21978838,1,2011,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and antimycobacterial evaluation of 3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno [1,2-c] pyrazole-2-carboxamide analogues.,In the present investigation, a series of 3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno [1,2-c] pyrazole-2-carboxamide analogues were synthesized and were evaluated for antitubercular activity by two fold serial dilution technique. All the newly synthesized compounds showed low to good inhibitory activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv and multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB). 3-(4-fluorophenyl)-N-(4-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno [1,2-c] pyrazole-2-carboxamide (4c) was found to be the most promising compound active against M. tuberculosis, H(37)Rv and MDR-TB with minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.83 μM and 3.32 μM respectively.
21967468,1,2011,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Determination of hepatitis C virus genotypes in pruritus patients in saudi arabia.,The main objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes in 56 pruritus patients and 50 healthy blood donors on the basis of clinical and laboratory investigations. Both demographic and clinical data were collected from each subject after obtaining informed consent and approval from an ethics committee. Ten milliliters of venous blood was collected from fasting patients (8-10 h) and serum was used for aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase tests, anti-HCV antibody testing, HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction screening, and genotyping analysis. HCV was found to be significantly predominant over HBV infection among the pruritus patients (p&lt;0.001). Twelve pruritus patients (21.42%) were positive for anti-HCV antibodies and nine of them were confirmed positive for HCV RNA presence. Of the two major genotypes revealed, genotype 4 was found to be significantly predominant over the mixed genotype, that is, 4a/c+3a (p&lt;0.001). Subtyping results showed that a significant majority of the type 4 were of the HCV subtype 4a (five patients), followed by 4c (two patients) and 4b genotypes (one patient) and mixed genotype 4a/c+3a (one patient). Results of this prospective study indicated the significant association between pruritus and HCV infection. HCV genotype 4 is the most predominant genotype among the pruritus patients and warrants larger studies in different ethnicities to find the molecular association between HCV genetic variants and pruritus.
21950651,1,2011,Nat Prod Res,Anti-inflammatory activities of selected synthetic homoisoflavanones.,Four homoisoflavanones of the 3-benzylidene-4-chromanone type, some of which were previously isolated from Caesalpinia pulcherrima, were synthesised to determine their anti-inflammatory activity and cytotoxicity. A range of four different homoisoflavanones (compounds 4a-4d) were synthesised from the corresponding substituted phenols. ¹H- and ¹³C-NMR data together with high-resolution mass spectroscopy data were employed to elucidate the structures. Anti-inflammatory activity was determined in mice with acute croton oil-induced auricular dermatitis. In vitro cytotoxicity was tested against a Chinese hamster ovarian cell line using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Compound 4a exhibited a tendency to inhibit oedema in a dose-dependent manner after 3 and 6 h of treatment. Compounds 4b-4d also inhibited oedema, although a clear dose-response relationship was not observed. Compounds 4a-4c were found to be less cytotoxic than compound 4d. Compound 4b was the least cytotoxic. Compounds 4a-4d exhibited anti-inflammatory activity and varying levels of cytotoxicity.
21897964,1,2011,Dalton Trans,Theoretical study on intramolecular allene-diene cycloadditions catalyzed by PtCl2 and Au(I) complexes.,The intramolecular [4C+3C] cycloaddition reaction of allenedienes catalysed by PtCl(2) and several Au(I) complexes has been studied by means of DFT calculations. Overall, the reaction mechanism comprises three main steps: (i) the formation of a metal allyl cation intermediate, (ii) a [4C(4π)+3C(2π)] cycloaddition that produces a seven-membered ring and (iii) a 1,2-hydrogen migration process on these intermediates. The reaction proceeds with complete diastereochemical control resulting from a favoured exo-like cycloaddition. Allene substituents have a critical influence in the reaction outcome and mechanism. The experimental observation of [4C+2C] cycloadducts in the reaction of substrates lacking substituents at the allene terminus can be explained through a mechanism involving Pt(IV)-metallacycles. With gold catalysts it is also possible to obtain [4C+2C] cycloaddition products, but only with substrates featuring terminally disubstituted allenes, and employing π-acceptor ligands at gold. However the mechanism for the formation of these adducts is completely different to that proposed with PtCl(2), and consists of the formation of a metal allyl cation, subsequent [4C+3C] cycloaddition and a 1,2-alkyl shift (ring contraction). Electronic analysis indicates that the divergent pathways are mainly controlled by the electronic properties of the gold heptacyclic species (L-Au-C(2)), in particular, the backdonation capacity of the metal center to the unoccupied C(2) (pπ-orbital) of the intermediate resulting from the [4C+3C] cycloaddition. The less backdonation, (i.e. using P(OR)(3)Au(+) complexes), the more favoured is the 1,2-alkyl shift.
21880487,1,2011,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Conformationally constrained analogs of BAY 59-3074 as novel cannabinoid receptor ligands.,To obtain information on the pharmacophoric requirements of the CB1/CB2 partial agonist BAY 59-3074 we have synthesized a series of new conformationally constrained dibenzofuran (4a-d) and dibenzopyran analogs (5). All constrained analogs exhibited reduced binding affinity at both cannabinoid receptor subtypes, suggesting that planar conformations of these ligands are less favored by both receptors. We also found that 4c, 4d, and 5 exhibited 3- to 12-fold selectivity for hCB2 over rCB1 receptors and may serve as new chemotypes for the development of CB2-selective cannabinergics.
21871512,1,2011,Neurochem Int,Dopamine release and molecular modeling study of some coumarin derivatives.,4-aryl-2-amino-6-(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)-pyridin-3-carbonitrile (1), 4-aryl-2-oxo-6-(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)-pyridin-3-carbonitriles (2a-2c), 3-(6-aryl-1,2,5,6- tetrahydro-2-thioxopyrimidin-4-yl)-4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one (3a, 3b) and pyrazol-3-yl-4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives (4a-4c, 5, 6a, 6b, 7a, 7b, and 8a-8c) were prepared in order to measure their % change dopamine release in comparison to amphetamine as reference, using PC-12 cells in different concentrations. In addition, the molecular modeling study of the compounds into 3BHH receptor was also demonstrated. The calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) implemented in the AutoDock program revealed identical correlation with the experimental results to that obtained binding free energy (ΔG(b)) as both parameters revealed reasonable correlation coefficients (R(2)) being 0.51 involving 10 compounds; (1, 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 6a, and 8c).
21864929,1,2011,Int J Food Microbiol,Subtyping of Listeria monocytogenes at the haplotype level by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis.,Listeria monocytogenes is a widespread foodborne pathogen that represents a major concern with respect to food safety. Rapid identification of this bacterium at a subspecies level is important to trace back an outbreak and improve risk-based inspection programs. A method for subtyping L. monocytogenes at the serotype and haplotype levels was developed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) reflectance microscopy. Thirty strains of L. monocytogenes belonging to four different PCR serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 4b, and 4c) that had previously been characterized by Multilocus genotyping (MLGT) and Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) assays were used in this study. The FT-IR based identification and classification was compared to the known MLGT and PFGE subtyping of the L. monocytogenes. Canonical variate analysis (CVA) of the spectra resulted in 96.6% correct identification of L. monocytogenes at the serotype level. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and CVA of the spectra showed 91.7% correct identification of strains at the haplotype level consistent with their MLGT groupings. FT-IR spectra of strains were also differentiated correctly in accordance with their PFGE haplotyping. Additionally, by using HCA of FT-IR spectra, each bacterium was differentiated at the strain level. Starting from a pure culture, this method enabled classification of L. monocytogenes at the serotype, haplotype, and/or strain level within 18 h, which is faster and potentially less expensive than the molecular methods and previous FT-IR methods. This is the first report of the identification of L. monocytogenes at the haplotype level using FT-IR.
21768739,1,2011,J Oleo Sci,Triacylglycerol and triterpene ester composition of shea nuts from seven African countries.,The compositions of the triacylglycerol (TAG) and triterpene ester (TE) fractions of the kernel fats (n-hexane extracts; shea butter) of the shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa; Sapotaceae) were determined for 36 samples from seven sub-Saharan countries, i.e., Cote d' Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroun, Chad, Sudan, and Uganda. The principal TAGs are stearic-oleic-stearic (SOS; mean 31.2%), SOO (27.7%), and OOO (10.8%). The TE fractions contents are in the range of 0.5-6.5%, and contain α-amyrin cinnamate (1c; mean 29.3%) as the predominant TE followed by butyrospermol cinnamate (4c; 14.8%), α-amyrin acetate (1a; 14.1%), lupeol cinnamate (3c; 9.0%), β-amyrin cinnamate (2c; 7.6%), lupeol acetate (3a; 7.2%), butyrospermol acetate (4a; 5.8%), and β-amyrin acetate (2a; 4.9%). Shea kernel fats from West African provenances contained, in general, higher levels of high-melting TAGs such as SOS, and higher amount of TEs than those from East African provenances. No striking regional difference in the composition of the TE fractions was observed.
21733688,1,2011,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Design, synthesis and antimycobacterial evaluation of novel 3-substituted-N-aryl-6,7-dimethoxy-3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno[1,2-c]pyrazole-2-carboxamide analogues.,In the present investigation, a series of 3-substituted-N-aryl-6,7-dimethoxy-3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno[1,2-c]pyrazole-2-carboxamide analogues were synthesized and were evaluated for antitubercular activity by two fold serial dilution technique. All the newly synthesized compounds showed moderate to high inhibitory activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv and INH resistant M. tuberculosis. The compound N,3-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno[1,2-c]pyrazole-2-carboxamide (4c) was found to be the most promising compound active against M. tuberculosis H(37)Rv and isoniazid resistant M. tuberculosis with minimum inhibitory concentration 0.78 μM.
21723111,1,2011,Med Dosim,The effects of variations in the density and composition of eye materials on ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry.,In ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry, it is common to consider the water phantom as human eye anatomy. However, for better clinical analysis, there is a need for the dose determination in different parts of the eye. In this work, a full human eye is simulated with MCNP-4C code by considering all parts of the eye, i.e., the lens, cornea, retina, choroid, sclera, anterior chamber, optic nerve, and bulk of the eye comprising vitreous body and tumor. The average dose in different parts of this full model of the human eye is determined and the results are compared with the dose calculated in water phantom. The central axes depth dose and the dose in whole of the tumor for these 2 simulated eye models are calculated as well, and the results are compared.
21692475,1,2011,J Org Chem,Rearrangements and interconversions of heteroatom-substituted isocyanates, isothiocyanates, nitrile oxides, and nitrile sulfides, RX-NCY and RY-CNX.,Isocyanates and isothiocyanates of the type RX-NCY (X and Y = O or S) and the isomeric nitrile oxides and nitrile sulfides RY-CNX are highly reactive compounds. A number of potential 1,4-shifts of substituent groups of the type R-Y-CNX → R-X-N═C═Y, 1,3-shifts R-C(═Y)-N═X → R-X-N═C═Y, and 1,2-shifts R-C(═Y)-N═X → R-Y-CNX have been evaluated computationally. The results obtained for the relatively new functional MPW1K and the well-established B3LYP, together with a triple-ζ quality basis set, are very similar. The 1,3- and 1,4-halogen shifts in the title compounds are usually highly exothermic and possess low activation barriers. 1,3-Aryl shifts are feasible for for 5e → 6e (Ar-CO-NSO(2) → Ar-SO(2)-NCO) with activation barriers of less than 40 kcal/mol. Additionally, several 1,3- and 1,4-hydrogen shifts and the 1,4-methyl-shift in methoxynitrile sulfide MeO-CNS to methylsulfenyl isocyanate MeS-NCO (4c → 6c) are potentially feasible. The 1,2-shift reactions 4b → 5b (HO-NCS → H-CS-NO) and 4c → 5c (Ar-O-CNS→ Ar-CO-NS) are good candidates for experimental observation with activation energies around 30 kcal/mol.
21686153,1,2011,Int J Mol Sci,In vitro antioxidant activity of selected 4-hydroxy-chromene-2-one derivatives-SAR, QSAR and DFT studies.,The series of fifteen synthesized 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives was subjected to antioxidant activity evaluation in vitro, through total antioxidant capacity, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl radical, lipid peroxide scavenging and chelating activity. The highest activity was detected during the radicals scavenging, with 2b, 6b, 2c, and 4c noticed as the most active. The antioxidant activity was further quantified by the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) studies. For this purpose, the structures were optimized using Paramethric Method 6 (PM6) semi-empirical and Density Functional Theory (DFT) B3LYP methods. Bond dissociation enthalpies of coumarin 4-OH, Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) gained hybridization of the oxygen, acidity of the hydrogen atom and various molecular descriptors obtained, were correlated with biological activity, after which we designed 20 new antioxidant structures, using the most favorable structural motifs, with much improved predicted activity in vitro.
21674259,1,2011,Chromosome Res,Similar rye A and B chromosome organization in meristematic and differentiated interphase nuclei.,Supernumerary (B) chromosomes of rye are not required for plant development and exhibit a reduced transcription activity. These special features inspired us to analyse whether there are differences between A and B chromatin organization in interphase nuclei. Applying fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that both rye A and B chromosomes added to hexaploid wheat showed in meristematic nuclei a string-like shape and a clear Rabl orientation. In 4C differentiated leaf nuclei, a more relaxed chromatin structure, round-shaped chromosome territories and a less pronounced Rabl configuration were found. Also, the observed random association of homologues in 2C and 4C nuclei indicated in general a similar behaviour of A and B chromosomes. Whereas in differentiated 4C nuclei A sister centromeres are separated, B sister centromeres align in nearly all nuclei. In short, despite the different transcription activity of A and B chromosomes, both types of chromosomes exhibit a similar organization in meristematic and differentiated interphase nuclei. But the deletion of a B chromosome segment responsible for non-disjunction during gametogenesis induces released sister centromeres also in some interphase nuclei of somatic tissue. Hence, the control of rye B chromosome non-disjunction is also active in sporophytic cells.
21647893,1,2011,Laryngoscope,Follow-up after gamma knife radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas: volumetric and axial control rates.,HYPOTHESIS: A prospective long-term follow-up study was conducted to evaluate the results of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients. Both axial and volumetric measurements are used to determine tumor size during follow-up.STUDY DESIGN: Individual prospective cohort study.METHODS: A total of 110 VS patients were referred for radiosurgery between 2002 and 2007. All patients were treated with a Leksell 4C gamma knife. There were 12.5 to 13 Gy prescribed to the isodose covering 90% of the tumor volume. The resulting marginal dose was on average 11.0 Gy (range, 9.3-12.5 Gy). Tumor size and tumor volume were determined before and after gamma knife treatment at regular intervals. The minimal follow-up period was 2 years.RESULTS: There were 100 patients included in the study. Eight patients needed additional treatment after a mean follow-up period of 38 months. One patient experienced a temporary facial nerve deficit. No growth pattern could be recognized for tumor growth after GKRS. Based on the measurements of the largest extrameatal diameter, the tumor size would have decreased or remained stable in 94%. Based on volumetric measurement, the tumor size was decreased or remained stable in 79%.CONCLUSIONS: High tumor control and low complication rates make GKRS a good therapy for VS. If tumor growth occurs after GKRS, a conservative management can be considered because continued tumor growth is uncertain. The extrameatal diameter on axial magnetic resonance imaging seems to be a reliable parameter of the size of a VS. Volumetry is the preferred method to assess the dimensions of a VS, although the consequences of strong volumetric increase, especially in small tumors, can be different depending on individual differences in tumor size.
21640445,1,2011,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and preliminary in vitro biological evaluation of new carbon-11-labeled celecoxib derivatives as candidate PET tracers for imaging of COX-2 expression in cancer.,The enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is overexpressed in a variety of malignant tumors. This study was designed to develop new radiotracers for imaging of COX-2 in cancer using biomedical imaging technique positron emission tomography (PET). Carbon-11-labeled celecoxib derivatives, [(11)C]4a-c and [(11)C]8a-d, were prepared by O-[(11)C] methylation of their corresponding precursors using [(11)C]CH(3)OTf under basic conditions and isolated by a simplified solid-phase extraction (SPE) method in 52 ± 2% (n = 5) and 57 ± 3% (n = 5) radiochemical yields based on [(11)C]CO(2) and decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB). The overall synthesis time from EOB was 23 min, the radiochemical purity was &gt;99%, and the specific activity at end of synthesis (EOS) was 277.5 ± 92.5 GBq/μmol (n = 5). The IC(50) values to block COX-2 for known compounds celecoxib (4d), 4a and 4c were 40, 290 and 8 nM, respectively, and preliminary findings from in vitro biological assay indicated that the synthesized new compounds 4b and 8a-d display similar strong inhibitory effectiveness in the MDA-MB-435 human cancer cell line in comparison with the parent compound 4d. These results encourage further in vivo evaluation of carbon-11-labeled celecoxib derivatives as new potential PET radiotracers for imaging of COX-2 expression in cancer.
21469732,1,2011,J Agric Food Chem,Synthesis, insecticidal activity, and molecular docking studies of nitenpyram analogues with a flexible ester arm anchored on tetrahydropyrimidine ring.,To make further researches on the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of our previous synthesized neonicotinoid compounds, a new series of nitenpyam analogues with flexible ester arm were synthesized. Preliminary bioassays indicated that all of our newly designed nitenpyam analogues exhibited good insecticidal activity at 100 mg/L, while analogues 4c and 4d afforded the best in vitro activity, and both of them had 100% mortality at 20 mg/L. The SAR studies suggested that their insecticidal potency was dual-controlled by the length of the ester arm and the size of the ester group. In addition, the molecular docking simulations revealed that the structural uniqueness of these analogues may lead to a unique molecular recognition and binding mode, which explained the SARs observed in vitro, and shed light on the novel insecticidal mechanism of these novel nitenpyam analogues.
21431217,1,2011,Dalton Trans,Bis-imine-cyclometalated macrocycles: synthesis, characterization and observation of solution behaviour.,A novel class of cyclometalated macrocycles [(Cp*Ir)(2)(R-N=C-C(6)H(2)-C=N-R)(2)](2)(pyrazine)(2)·(OTf)(4) [R = Ph (4a), p-MeOC(6)H(4) (4b), p-MeC(6)H(4) (4c), p-ClC(6)H(4) (4d), Me (4e)]; [(Cp*Rh)(2)(R-N=C-C(6)H(2)-C=N-R)(2)](2)(pyrazine)(2)·(OTf)(4) [R = Ph (4a'), p-MeOC(6)H(4) (4b'), p-MeC(6)H(4) (4c')] and [(Cp*Ir)(2)(R-C=N-C(6)H(4)-N=C-R)(2)](2)(pyrazine)(2)·(OTf)(4) [R = Ph (5a), p-MeOC(6)H(4) (5b)] was stepwise constructed through the double-site C-H activation of aromatic bis-imine substrates. The structures of binuclear complexes and tetranuclear macrocycles were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Isomers were found both in binuclear species and macrocyclic complexes. Flexible substrates led to the existence of isomers for binuclear species, yet gave no isomers after macrocyclic constructions; rigid ones, in contrast, led to isomers only for macrocyclic species. The isomers of tetranuclear macrocycles were thermodynamically stable to reversible transformation on a scale of days. Robust bonding and a certain degree of rigidity were invoked to explain the existence of isomers. This is the first example, to our knowledge, in which coordinated macrocycles containing half-sandwich Cp*M (M = Ir, Rh) fragments have been constructed, without a dynamic reversible process.
21414145,1,2011,Chem Biol Drug Des,2,3-Dihydro-1,2-Diphenyl-substituted 4H-Pyridinone derivatives as new anti Flaviviridae inhibitors.,With the aim of identifying novel lead compounds active against emergent human infectious diseases, a series of 2,3-dihydro-4H-pyridinone derivatives has been prepared and evaluated for antiviral activity. Compounds were evaluated in vitro in cell-based assays for cytotoxicity and against a wide spectrum of viruses. In the antiviral screening, several compounds showed to be fairly active against viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family. The Pestiviruses (bovine viral diarrhoea virus) were inhibited by 4a cis (CC(50) &gt; 100 μm; EC(50) = 14 μm), compounds 4c cis and 6a showed a significant activity against Flaviviruses (Yellow Fever Virus) (CC(50) &gt; 100 μm; EC(50) = 18μm, CC(50) &gt; 100 μm; EC(50) = 10 μm). Among these, compound 6a displayed great inhibitory activity against Hepaciviruses (hepatitis C virus) in replicon assay [CC(50) &gt; 100 μm; EC(50) (1b) = 4 μm]. In vitro inhibitory activity against the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) of title compounds is discussed. The antiviral screening of viral strains indicated that compound 6a can be selected as promising tool in novel anti-flaviviruses development.
21398120,1,2011,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Ionic liquid promoted synthesis, antibacterial and in vitro antiproliferative activity of novel α-aminophosphonate derivatives.,Ionic liquid ethyl ammonium nitrate is used as an excellent catalyst and solvent for three-component one-pot reaction of an aldehydes, amines and diethylphosphite to form novel α-aminophosphonates at room temperature. Among the various catalysts, the preparation of ethyl ammonium nitrate is an environmental friendly, cost effective and recyclable catalyst. Compounds 4b, 4c, 4d, 4f and 4j were found more potent antibacterials against pathogenic microorganisms. Whereas, compounds 4a, 4g, 4h and 4j inhibits growth of active Escherichia coli NCIM 2645 and Salmonella typhi NCIM 2501. Compound 4j was found a promising antiproliferative agent against A549 and SK-MEL2 human melanoma cell lines.
21344657,1,2011,Chem Asian J,Gold(I)-catalyzed enantioselective intermolecular hydroarylation of allenes with indoles and reaction mechanism by density functional theory calculations.,Chiral binuclear gold(I) phosphine complexes catalyze enantioselective intermolecular hydroarylation of allenes with indoles in high product yields (up to 90%) and with moderate enantioselectivities (up to 63% ee). Among the gold(I) complexes examined, better ee values were obtained with binuclear gold(I) complexes, which displayed intramolecular Au(I)-Au(I) interactions. The binuclear gold(I) complex 4c [(AuCl)(2)(L3)] with chiral biaryl phosphine ligand (S)-(-)-MeO-biphep (L3) is the most efficient catalyst and gives the best ee value of up to 63%. Substituents on the allene reactants have a slight effect on the enantioselectivity of the reaction. Electron-withdrawing groups on the indole substrates decrease the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The relative reaction rates of the hydroarylation of 4-X-substituted 1,3-diarylallenes with N-methylindole in the presence of catalyst 4c [(AuCl)(2)(L3)]/AgOTf [L3 = (S)-(-)-MeO-biphep], determined through competition experiments, correlate (r(2) = 0.996) with the substituent constants σ. The slope value is -2.30, revealing both the build-up of positive charge at the allene and electrophilic nature of the reactive Au(I) species. Two plausible reaction pathways were investigated by density functional theory calculations, one pathway involving intermolecular nucleophilic addition of free indole to aurated allene intermediate and another pathway involving intramolecular nucleophilic addition of aurated indole to allene via diaurated intermediate E2. Calculated results revealed that the reaction likely proceeds via the first pathway with a lower activation energy. The role of Au(I)-Au(I) interactions in affecting the enantioselectivity is discussed.
21331993,1,2011,Turk J Gastroenterol,Transmission routes of chronic hepatitis C and their relation to HCV genotypes.,AIMS: Hepatitis C virus transmission routes in chronic hepatitis C patients, the relationship between the viral genotype and the transmission routes were studied.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Genotyping was performed by using a commercial reverse hybridization method, Line Probe Assay.RESULTS: Genotyping of 108 HCV RNA positive patients revealed four different types (1, 2, 3, and 4) and some mixed types. Subtype 1b was the most common (n=82). Subtype 1a and 3a were detected in six patients, 2a/2c was detected in seven patients, and 4c/4d was detected in one patient respectively. Six subjects revealed mixed infections. Three of them were 1a+1b, two of them were 1b+4a, and one of them was 1b+2a/2c. Genotype 1b was most common in all groups. In 38.8% of the 108 patients with a history of blood or blood product transfusions, 16.6% of patients with a history of surgery, 15.7% of patients had an anamnesis of dental treatment and, 12.9% of patients receiving dialysis.CONCLUSION: Before the routine screening of blood donor practices became mandatory, the most common route of HCV infection was blood transfusions. The other risk factors of transmission such as tattoos, piercings, iatrogenic infections and intravenous drug usage have not been recorded for any of these patients in our study. The patient with a history of surgery had the genotype 1b as the most common genotype. The genotype 1b was determined in 75.9% of the whole patient population of the study.
21235344,1,2011,Cell Reprogram,Diploid oocyte formation and tetraploid embryo development induced by cytochalasin B in bovine.,Tetraploid embryos are a useful model for postimplantation development of polyploidy cells, and tetraploid cells are an advantage in studies for chimeras yielding offspring completely derived from embryo stem cells or induced pluripotent cells. This study was designed to investigate the effects of cytochalasin B (CB) on bovine oocyte meiosis, and to induce the formation of diploid oocytes and tetraploid embryos. The results showed that: (1) incubation of oocytes in CB at ≥2.0 μg/mL concentrations for 24 h significantly decreased oocyte maturation and the matured oocytes' haploid composition. Over 50% of the CB-treated oocytes did not expel PB1 (non-PB1), and most of the non-PB1 oocytes contained 2n (60) chromosomes. (2) Pretreatment of oocytes with CB at concentrations of 7.5 and 15 μg/mL for 10 h significantly decreased oocyte maturation. Posttreatment of oocytes with CB resulted in most of the oocytes containing 2n chromosomes. (3) The parthenogenetic blastocysts (25-28%) derived from the non-PB1 oocytes of posttreatment group was significantly higher than that from pretreatment, whole period treatment, and the control oocytes (12-16%). (4) Cytogenetic analysis of the embryos derived from CB-treated non-PB1 oocytes resulted in 74% of the one-cell stage embryos being 4n = 120 chromosomes, 82% of two-cell stage embryos contained 4n chromosomes in each blastomere, and 75% of the blastocysts were tetraploidy (4n = 120). (6) The stopped uncleaved one-cell embryos showed an amazing phenomenon of over 15% of them containing extra chromosomes, which suggested multiple DNA duplication occurred within 40 h after activation. In conclusion, CB inhibits PB1 extrusion, disfigures spindle structure, decreases oocyte maturation, and results in formation of diploid (2n or 4c) oocytes. The diploid oocytes resulted in a higher development of tetraploid embryos, which would be a unique approach for the production of tetraploid embryos in bovine.
21207574,1,2011,Chemistry,Competitive pathways in the reaction of lithium oxy-ortho-quinodimethanes and Fischer alkoxy alkynyl carbene complexes: synthesis of highly functionalised seven-membered benzocarbocycles.,Up to four different outcomes have been found for the reaction between 1-oxy-ortho-quinodimethanes (oQDMs) and alkoxy alkynyl Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs). The product formed depends on the structure of both reagents and on the reaction solvent. The pathways can be topologically classified as a [4C+2C], a [3(2C+O)+3C], and two different [4C+3C] processes and, in all these sequences, 1-oxy-oQDMs behave as enolates or as vinylogous enolates. The reaction of Choy and Yang's unsubstituted oQDM 1 with tungsten alkynyl FCCs is solvent controlled; thus, selective formation of benzocycloheptenones can be achieved in THF, whereas exclusive synthesis of benzocycloheptene ketals is reached in diethyl ether. On the other hand, THF is the solvent of choice to form benzocycloheptene ketals when an alkyl or aryl group is placed at position 1 of the oQDM in its reaction with tungsten carbene complexes; however, a pyranylidene carbene complex is formed when a chromium carbene complex is used. Alternatively, the presence of bulky alkoxy groups in the FCC component favours a Diels-Alder aromatisation sequence, which leads to 1-naphthyl FCCs. Furthermore, the isolation and the characterisation of several deuterated compounds by labelling experiments have provided some insight into the reaction pathways, and mechanisms consistent with those findings have been established and several reaction intermediates have been identified.
21194811,1,2011,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis, antidepressant and antifungal evaluation of novel 2-chloro-8-methylquinoline amine derivatives.,A new series of N-[(2-chloro-8-methylquinolin-3-yl)methyl]-(substituted)-aniline/butylamine/cyclohexylamine/benzylamine derivatives (4a-p) was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution reaction of 2-chloro-3-(chloromethyl)-8-methylquinoline 3 with various aliphatic and aromatic amines in absolute ethanol in the presence of triethylamine (TEA). The newly synthesized secondary amines were characterized by the combined use of IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass spectral data and microanalyses. The antidepressant activity of the synthesized compounds (4a-p) was evaluated by Forced swim test in rats and their neurotoxicity was evaluated by the rotarod test. Test compounds and clomipramine were administered intraperitoneally at dose of 100 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg respectively. Preliminary antidepressant screening of compounds (4a-p) revealed that compounds 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4i and 4o significantly (P&lt;0.01) reduces the duration of immobility time. These compounds were also tested in-vitro for MAO inhibitory effect. All the compounds were also screened for antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger MTCC 281, Aspergillus flavus MTCC 277, Monascus purpureus MTCC 369 and Penicillium citrinum NCIM 768 strains.

The centrosymmetric mol-ecular structure of the complex is based on a tetra-nuclear {Mn(2)Cr(2)(μ-O)(6)} core. The tetra-nuclear complex mol-ecule and the two uncoordinated dimethyl-formamide mol-ecules are linked by O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, while the two other mol-ecules of dimethyl-formamide do not participate in hydrogen bonding.
22199467,0,2011,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,A sodium calcium arsenate, NaCa(AsO(4)).,The title compound, NaCa(AsO(4)), was synthesized using a hydro-thermal method at 633-643 K. It has a dense structure composed of alternating layers of distorted [CaO(6)] octa-hedra and layers of [AsO(4)] tetra-hedra and distorted [NaO(6)] octa-hedra, stacked along the a axis. The As, Ca and two O atoms lie on the mirror plane at y = 1/4 (i.e. 4c), while the Na atom lies on an inversion centre (1/2, 1/2, 0) (i.e. 4b). Each distorted [CaO(6)] octa-hedron shares four equatorial common O vertices with four neighboring octa-hedra, forming a layer parallel to (100), whereas each distorted [NaO(6)] octa-hedron shares two opposite edges with two neighboring ones, forming a chain running along [010]. Each isolated [AsO(4)] tetra-hedron shares two edges with two different [NaO(6)] octa-hedra in one [NaO(6)] chain and a vertex with another chain. Simultaneously the above [AsO(4)] tetra-hedron located in a four-membered [CaO(6)] ring shares one edge of its base facet with one [CaO(6)] octa-hedron and three corners with three other [CaO(6)] octa-hedra of one [CaO(6)] layer, and the remaining apex is shared with another [CaO(6)] layer. [NaO(6)] octa-hedra and [CaO(6)] octa-hedra are linked to each other by sharing edges and vertices.
22183686,0,2011,Dalton Trans,Crystal structure of novel compounds in the systems Zr-Cu-Al, Mo-Pd-Al and partial phase equilibria in the Mo-Pd-Al system.,The crystal structures of three Al-rich compounds have been solved from X-ray single crystal diffractometry: τ(1)-MoPd(2-x)Al(8+x) (x = 0.067); τ(7)-Zr(Cu(1-x)Al(x))(12) (x = 0.514) and τ(9)-ZrCu(1-x)Al(4) (x = 0.144). τ(1)-MoPd(2-x)Al(8+x) adopts a unique structure type (space group Pbcm; lattice parameters a = 0.78153(2), b = 1.02643(3) and c = 0.86098(2) nm), which can be conceived as a superstructure of the Mo(Cu(x)Al(1-x))(6)Al(4) type. Whereas Mo-atoms occupy the 4d site, Pd(2) occupies the 4c site, Al and Pd(1) atoms randomly share the 4d position and the rest of the positions are fully occupied by Al. A Bärnighausen tree documents the crystallographic group-subgroup relation between the structure types of Mo(Cu(x)Al(1-x))(6)Al(4) and τ(1). τ(7)-Zr(Cu(1-x)Al(x))(12) (x = 0.514) has been confirmed to crystallize with the ThMn(12) type (space group I4/mmm; lattice parameters a = 0.85243(2) and c = 0.50862(3) nm). In total, 4 crystallographic sites were defined, out of which, Zr occupies site 2a, the 8f site is fully occupied by Cu, the 8i site is entirely occupied by Al, but the 8j site turned out to comprise a random mixture of Cu and Al atoms. The compound τ(9)-ZrCu(1-x)Al(4) (x = 0.144) crystallizes in a unique structure type (space group P4/nmm; lattice parameters a = 0.40275(3) and c = 1.17688(4) nm) which exhibits full atom order but a vacancy (14.4%) on the 2c site, shared with Cu atoms. τ(9)-ZrCu(1-x)Al(4) is a superstructure of Cu with an arrangement of three unit cells of Cu in the direction of the c-axis. A Bärnighausen tree documents this relationship. The ZrCu(1-x)Al(4) type (n = 3) is part of a series of structures which follow this building principle: Cu (n = 1), TiAl(3) (n = 2), τ(5)-TiNi(2-x)Al(5) (n = 4), HfGa(2) (n = 6) and Cu(3)Pd (n = 7). A partial isothermal section for the Al-rich part of the Mo-Pd-Al system at 860 °C has been established with two ternary compounds τ(1)-MoPd(2-x)Al(8+x) and τ(2) (unknown structure). The Vickers hardness (H(v)) for τ(1) was found to be 842 ± 40 MPa.
22182629,0,2011,Appl Radiat Isot,Characterization of an extrapolation chamber for low-energy X-rays: experimental and Monte Carlo preliminary results.,The extrapolation chamber is a parallel-plate ionization chamber that allows variation of its air-cavity volume. In this work, an experimental study and MCNP-4C Monte Carlo code simulations of an ionization chamber designed and constructed at the Calibration Laboratory at IPEN to be used as a secondary dosimetry standard for low-energy X-rays are reported. The results obtained were within the international recommendations, and the simulations showed that the components of the extrapolation chamber may influence its response up to 11.0%.
22173328,0,2011,Ann Surg Oncol,Scoring system based on BI-RADS lexicon to predict probability of malignancy in suspicious microcalcifications.,PURPOSE: To develop a scoring system allowing quantification of the probability of malignancy of suspicious microcalcifications based on Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).METHODS: A total of 163 microcalcification lesions surgically excised in 147 women (aged 28-65 years) were included. Two radiologists independently reviewed each lesion with BI-RADS (4th edition). The interobserver agreement and positive predictive value (PPV) for each descriptor were determined and multivariate analysis was used to develop a scoring system. The scores were compared between benign and malignant lesions and among BI-RADS categories by using the two-sample t-test or the analysis of variance. To assess the discriminative power of the scoring system, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and cutoff values for categorization were determined. For the test of the scoring system, the validation data set from a different facility was applied.RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was fair to moderate for distribution, morphology, and category (κ = 0.45, 0.40, and 0.37). PPVs were significantly different among BI-RADS descriptors and categories (P &lt; 0.0001). Of the scoring system developed, the AUC was 0.75. The scores between benign and malignant lesions were significantly different. By means of cutoff values, PPV in category 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 was 7.0%, 15.0%, 44.8%, and 83.3%, respectively. For the validation data set, the AUC was 0.79 and the PPV in category 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 was 9.4%, 24.1%, 62.5%, and 80.0%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: In suspicious microcalcifications, our scoring system based on BI-RADS (4th edition) could help to derive a specific final category with good stratification of the probability of malignancy.
22172700,0,2011,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,The design, synthesis and in vitro immunosuppressive evaluation of novel isobenzofuran derivatives.,The synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of novel isobenzofuran-based compounds are described. The compounds were evaluated for their immunosuppressive effects of T-cell proliferation and IMPDH type II inhibitor activity in vitro, as well as their structure-activity relationships were assessed. Several compounds demonstrated highly efficacious immunosuppressive properties, especially compounds 2d, 2e, 2h and 2j, which were superior to MPA, while compounds 2k, 2m, 2n, 4c and 5d exhibited an equipotent inhibitory activity compared to MPA. Generally, it was obviously demonstrated that α,β-unsaturated amides proved more potent than the diamide and urea series. The present study provides a guide for further research on development of safe and effective immunosuppressive agents.
22168209,0,2011,Inorg Chem,Multinuclear copper(I) guanidinate complexes.,A series of multinuclear Copper(I) guanidinate complexes have been synthesized in a succession of reactions between CuCl and the lithium guanidinate systems Li{L} (L = Me(2)NC((i)PrN)(2) (1a), Me(2)NC(CyN)(2) (1b), Me(2)NC((t)BuN)(2)(1c), and Me(2)NC(DipN)(2) (2d) ((i)Pr = iso-propyl, Cy = cyclohexyl, (t)Bu = tert-butyl, and Dip = 2,6-disopropylphenyl) made in situ, and structurally characterized. The di-copper guanidinates systems with the general formula [Cu(2){L}(2)] (L = {Me(2)NC((i)PrN)(2)} (2a), {Me(2)NC(CyN)(2)} (2b), and {Me(2)NC(DipN)(2)} (2d) differed significantly from related amidinate complexes because of a large torsion of the dimer ring, which in turn is a result of transannular repulsion between adjacent guanidinate substituents. Attempts to synthesis the tert-butyl derivative [Cu(2){Me(2)NC((t)BuN)(2)}(2)] result in the separate formation and isolation of the tri-copper complexes [Cu(3){Me(2)NC((t)BuN)(2)}(2)(μ-NMe(2))] (3c) and [Cu(3){Me(2)NC((t)BuN)(2)}(2)(μ-Cl)] (4c), both of which have been unambiguously characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Closer inspection of the solution state behavior of the lithium salt 1c reveals a previously unobserved equilibrium between 1c and its starting materials, LiNMe(2) and N,N'-di-tert-butyl-carbodiimide, for which activation enthalpy and entropy values of ΔH(‡) = 48.2 ± 18 kJ mol(-1) and ΔS(‡) = 70.6 ± 6 J/K mol have been calculated using 1D-EXSY NMR spectroscopy to establish temperature dependent rates of exchange between the species in solution. The molecular structures of the lithium complexes 1c and 1d have also been determined and shown to form tetrameric and dimeric complexes respectively held together by Li-N and agostic Li···H-C interactions. The thermal chemistry of the copper complexes have also been assessed by thermogravimetric analysis.
22161618,0,2011,Ultraschall Med,Atypical ductal hyperplasia of the breast diagnosed by ultrasonographically guided core needle biopsy.,PURPOSE: We analysed the ultrasonographic (US) features of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) of the breast diagnosed by US-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) with the aim of identifying factors that affect the underestimation of ADH.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 134 ADH lesions sampled by US-guided CNB were reviewed retrospectively. All lesions were evaluated for pattern, size, lesion characteristics and margins, and the corresponding surgical outcome or imaging follow-up was obtained. Each patient's clinical and radiological features were analysed to identify factors involved in ADH underestimation.RESULTS: The prevalence of malignancy in each pattern of lesions following surgical excision was 32/81 (40%) for solid masses, 14/31 (45%) for ductal patterns, 5/17 (29%) for complex cystic lesions and 2/5 (40%) for architectural distortions. Based on the results of surgical and US follow-up, none of the category 3 lesions was proven to be a malignancy. Malignancy was found in 17 (21%) of the 80 BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) category 4a lesions, 20 (74%) of the 27 category 4b lesions, 12 (92%) of the 13 category 4c lesions, and four (100%) of the four category 5 lesions. Lesions with a higher US assessment category, lacking circumscribed margins, or a mammographic finding of suspected malignancy were all significantly associated with underestimation (p &lt; 0.05 for each).CONCLUSION: US is useful in evaluating ADH lesions and in clarifying the indication for biopsy of these lesions. Familiarity with the frequency associated with malignancy for each feature will improve the utility of US in the work-up of these breast abnormalities.

The dihedral angle between the bipyridine rings on general positions is 21.2 (2)°. These mol-ecular units are linked by O-H⋯N hydrogen bonds forming an extended two-dimensional framework in the crystal.
22090848,0,2011,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,catena-Poly[[diaqua-bis-(3-methyl-pyridine-κN)cobalt(II)]-μ-sulfato-κO:O'].,The environment of the Co(II) ion in the title compound, [Co(SO(4))(C(6)H(7)N)(2)(H(2)O)(2)](n), exhibits an octa-hedral configuration with the two 3-methyl-pyridine ligands lying in cis positions with respect to each other and trans to the two coordinated water mol-ecules. The axial positions are occupied by O atoms of the sulfate ions. Co and S atoms occupy special positions (twofold axis, Wyckoff position 4c). Neighboring Co(II) ions are covalently connected with each other through the sulfate ions, thus creating infinite polymeric chains that run along the c axis. The water mol-ecules are connected with neighboring sulfate ions through strong O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds. Intra-molecular hydrogen bonds parallel to the propagation direction of the chains stabilize the polymeric chains, and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds between chains connect neighboring chains with each other, thus leading to polymeric double chains.
22076762,0,2011,Arch Pharm Res,DNA binding, antiviral activities and cytotoxicity of new furochromone and benzofuran derivatives.,Bromination of visnagin (1) afforded 9-bromovisnagin (2) which on its alkaline hydrolysis afforded the 3-acetyl benzofuran derivative (3). The condensation of (3) with hydrazine hydrate, phenylhydrazine and/or hydroxylamine hydrochloride afforded the corresponding pyrazole derivatives (4a, b) and isoxazole derivative (4c). On the other hand, when compound 3 was condensed with some aromatic aldehydes, this yielded corresponding α, β-unsaturated keto derivatives (5a-e). Furthermore, when 1 was subjected to chlorosulfonation, the visnaginsulfonylchloride derivative 6 was afforded, which on amidation using morpholine, a sulonamido derivative (7) was obtained. Alkaline hydrolysis of the latter compound yielded 7-N-morpholinosulsamidobenzofuran (8) which was condensed with some aromatic aldehydes to yield the corresponding chalcone compounds (9a-e). Demethylation of visnagin afforded norvisnagin (10). The reaction of 10 with ethylbromoacetate in dry acetone yielded the ester benzopyran derivative (11) which reacted with hydrazine hydrate to afford the corresponding hydrazide derivative (12) and this was condensed with 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde to give the corresponding hydrazone (13). A thaizolidinone derivative (14) was obtained by condensation of (13) with thioglycolic acid. Chloromethylation of norvisnagin afforded a 4-chloromethyl derivative (15) which reacted with different primary and secondary amines to yield the corresponding ethylamino derivative (16a, b). Moreover, mannich bases (16a, b) and (17a-c) were obtained by reacting norvisnagin with different primary and secondary amines in the presence of formalin but benzoylation of (16a, b) and (17a-c) afforded 4-oxybenzoyl derivative (18a-e). The prepared compounds were tested for their interaction with DNA; bromovisnagin 2 showed the highest affinity and compounds 6, 15, 8a, &gt; 14, &gt; 16b, 17a, and 16a showed moderate activity in decreasing potency. Moreover, compound 2 also was the most active as antiviral agent toward HS-I virus and compounds 6, 7, 15, 14, 16a, and 18a were found to be moderately active. CD(50) of the active compounds were also measured.

The former generates an S(6) loop via an intra-molecular O-H⋯N hydrogen bond and the latter generates an S(6) loop via an N-H⋯O hydro-gren bond. The aromatic rings are oriented at a dihedral angle of 42.52 (10)°. In the crystal, C-H⋯π inter-actions occur and aromatic π-π stacking inter-actions [centroid-centroid separations = 3.7106 (12) and 3.9177 (13) Å] consolidate the packing.
22051064,0,2011,Eur J Med Chem,Copper(II) chloride mediated synthesis and DNA photocleavage activity of 1-aryl/heteroaryl-4-substituted-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalines.,A new class of photonucleases, 1-aryl/heteroaryl-4-substituted-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalines (4) was synthesized in a facile and efficient manner via copper(II) chloride mediated oxidative intramolecular cyclization of 2-(arylidenehydrazino)-3-substituted-quinoxalines (3). DNA cleavage potency of compounds 4a-d (40 μg each) was quantitatively evaluated on supercoiled plasmid ΦX174 under UV irradiation (312 nm, 15 W) without any additive. Compound 4c was found to be the most efficient DNA photocleaver which had converted supercoiled DNA (form I) into the relaxed DNA (form II) at 30 μg and the DNA photocleavage activity increases with increase in concentration of 4c.
22034859,0,2011,J Phys Chem B,On the nature of lithium biphenyl in ethereal solvents. A critical analysis unifying DFT calculations, physicochemical data in solution, and a X-ray structure.,The lithium ion is an important type of electrolyte that has technological applications in the manufacture of lithium ion cells; therefore, a better understanding of the nature of its solutions is desirable. When associated to the radical anion of biphenyl in an organic solvent, it forms conducting solutions comparable to strong electrolytes such as lithium perchlorate. We have studied the lithium biphenyl solution in dimethoxyethane using DFT calculations. The nature of these ionic solutions is described in terms of a dynamic equilibrium between different types of ionic associations, the composition of which depends on the solvent and the temperature. The X-ray structure of [Li(+)·4C(5)H(10)O][C(12)H(10)(•-)], a solvent-separated ion pair of lithium biphenyl complexed with tetrahydropyran, is reported. Its main structural characteristics coincide with the calculated one, which we think is the dominant species at room temperature, in agreement with the available physicochemical data.
22020459,0,2011,Cryo Letters,Cryopreservation of winter-dormant apple buds: II - tissue water status after desiccation at -4C and before further cooling.,The established protocol for the cryopreservation of winter-dormant Malus buds requires that stem explants, containing a single, dormant bud are desiccated at -4 degree C, for up to 14 days, to reduce their water content to 25-30 percent of fresh weight. Using three apple cultivars, with known differences in response to cryopreservation, the pattern of evaporative water loss has been characterised, including early freezing events in the bud and cortical tissues that allow further desiccation by water migration to extracellular ice. There were no significant differences between cultivars in this respect or in the proportions of tissue water lost during the desiccation process. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (to -90 degree C) of intact buds indicated that bud tissues of the cultivar with the poorest response to cryopreservation had the highest residual water content at the end of the desiccation process and froze at the highest temperature.
22014558,0,2011,Eur J Med Chem,New spirocyclic Δ²-isoxazoline derivatives related to selective agonists of α7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.,A set of structural analogues of spirocyclic quinuclidinyl-Δ(2)-isoxazolines, characterized as potent and selective α7 nicotinic agonists, was prepared and assayed for binding affinity at α7 and α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The investigated derivatives (3a-3c, 4a-4c, 5a-5c, 6a-6c, and 7a-7c), synthesized via the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nitrile oxides to suitable dipolarophiles, showed an overall reduced affinity at the α7 subtype when compared with their model compounds. Solely Δ(2)-isoxazolines 3a, 3b, and 6c maintained a binding affinity in the nanomolar range at the α7 nAChRs (K(i) = 230, 420 and 700 nM, respectively). The quaternary ammonium salt 6c retained also a noteworthy α7 vs. α4β2 subtype selectivity, whereas 3a and 3b showed a sharp reduction in selectivity compared with 1a and 1b, their quinuclidinyl higher homologues.
22000924,0,2011,Eur J Med Chem,Design, synthesis and biological study of novel pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine as anti-proliferative CDK2 inhibitors.,The design and synthesis of a small library of 4-aminopyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives is reported. The potential activity of these compounds as CDK2/Cyclin A, CDK4/Cyclin D, EGFR and anti-tumor was evaluated by cytotoxicity studies in A431a, SNU638b, HCT116 and inhibition of CDK2-Cyclin A, CDK4/Cyclin D and EGFR enzyme activity in vitro. The anti-proliferative and CDK2-Cyclin A inhibitory activity of compounds 4c and 11a was significantly more active than roscovotine with IC(50) 0.3 and 0.09 μM respectively. Molecular modeling study, including fitting to a 3D-pharmacophore model, docking into cyclin dependant kinase2 (CDK2) active site and binding energy calculations were carried out and these studies suggested the same binding orientation inside the CDK2 binding pocket for these analogs compared to ATP.
21950849,0,2011,J Chem Phys,Zero field splitting of the chalcogen diatomics using relativistic correlated wave-function methods.,The spectrum arising from the (π*)(2) configuration of the chalcogen dimers, namely, the X(2)1, a2, and b0(+) states, is calculated using wave-function theory based methods. Two-component (2c) and four-component (4c) multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) and Fock-space coupled cluster (FSCC) methods are used as well as two-step methods spin-orbit complete active space perturbation theory at 2nd order (SO-CASPT2) and spin-orbit difference dedicated configuration interaction (SO-DDCI). The energy of the X(2)1 state corresponds to the zero-field splitting of the ground state spin triplet. It is described with high accuracy by the 2- and 4-component methods in comparison with experiment, whereas the two-step methods give about 80% of the experimental values. The b0(+) state is well described by 4c-MRCI, SO-CASPT2, and SO-DDCI, but FSCC fails to describe this state and an intermediate Hamiltonian FSCC ansatz is required. The results are readily rationalized by a two-parameter model; Δε, the π* spinor splitting by spin-orbit coupling and K, the exchange integral between the π(1)* and the π(-1)* spinors with, respectively, angular momenta 1 and -1. This model holds for all systems under study with the exception of Po(2).
21944856,0,2011,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Tetrahydroquinolines as a novel series of nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators: structural requirements for better physicochemical and biological properties.,A rationally designed tetrahydroquinoline (1) for nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators was modified for the exploration of promising compounds by Grieco three-component condensation using various dienophiles. Based on the in vitro effects and physicochemical properties of the synthesized compounds, compound 4c was selected for further study. Compound 4c increased the femoral bone mineral density as much as DHT, but it reduced the uterus effect compared with DHT in ovariectomized rats. Thus, compound 4c has desirable osteoanabolic effects with weak undesirable effects on the uterus in a female osteoporosis model.
21928710,0,2011,Acta Pol Pharm,Synthesis, anticonvulsant and neurotoxicity screening of some novel 1,2,4-trisubstituted-1H-imidazole derivatives.,A series of 1,2,4-trisubstituted-1H- imidazole derivatives (4a-o) was synthesized by reacting 2,4-disubstituted-1H-imidazoles (3a-o) with chlorobenzene in the presence of triethylamine. Phenylglyoxal (2) was reacted with different aromatic aldehydes in the presence of ammonium acetate and glacial acetic acid to afford the disubstituted imidazoles (3a-o). The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed on the basis of their elemental analysis and spectral data results. Anticonvulsant activity was shown by majority of the synthesized compounds in the maximal electroshock (MES) and subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ) screens when given i.p. to mice. In anticonvulsant screening, only one compound 4k showed potent activity comparable to that of standard drugs phenytoin and carbamazepine. Compounds 4a, 4c, 4e, 41 and 4n passed the rotorod test successfully without any sign of neurological deficit.
21924441,0,2011,Radiologia,[Analysis of the positive predictive value of the subcategories of BI-RADS(®) 4 lesions: preliminary results in 880 lesions].,OBJECTIVES: The positive predictive values (PPV) of the subcategories of BI-RADS(®) 4 lesions (A/B/C) vary widely, and their correlation with specific descriptors has yet to be defined. We aimed to analyze the PPV of the subcategories and of the mammographic and ultrasonographic descriptors assigned to each.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 880 histologically confirmed lesions prospectively classified as BI-RADS(®) 4 A/B/C between 2003 and 2010. The statistical analysis included significance tests, contingency tables, and relative risk (RR) ratios, calculated for 545 mammographic lesions and 627 ultrasonographic lesions.RESULTS: The PPV was 8.8% for subcategory 4A, 18.9% for subcategory 4B, and 58.3% for subcategory 4C. The correlation between PPV and lesions was what we expected, with three exceptions: a) the PPV of 4A was greater than that of 4B in nodules that were irregular or had uncircumscribed margins on ultrasonography and in microcalcifications with segmental distribution on mammography, b) BI-RADS(®) 3 lesions classified as BI-RADS(®) 4, and c) identical lesions classified in distinct subcategories. In the contingency table analysis, the mammographic lesions were 4B/C and the ultrasonographic lesions were 4B. On mammography, the RR was significant for nodules with irregular shape (RR=3.205) and for those with spiculated margins (RR=2.469), as well as for microcalcifications that were pleomorphic (RR=2.531) or amorphous (RR=0.334), and for those with segmental (RR=1.895). On ultrasonography, the RR were significant for all the descriptors, with values greater than 1 for irregular shape (RR=1.977) and uncircumscribed margins (RR=2.277).CONCLUSIONS: Our results corroborate previous reports. The exceptions can be explained by aspects related to variability and nonradiological factors that might influence the classification and PPV. Mathematical models should be developed to enable the objective classification and these should include factors not related to imaging.
21923198,0,2011,J Med Chem,Synthesis of three novel fluorine-18 labeled analogues of L-deprenyl for positron emission tomography (PET) studies of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B).,The aim in this project was to synthesize and to study fluorine-18 labeled analogues of l-deprenyl which bind selectively to the enzyme monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Three fluorinated l-deprenyl analogues have been generated in multistep organic syntheses. The most promising fluorine-18 compound N-[(2S)-1-[(18)F]fluoro-3-phenylpropan-2-yl]-N-methylprop-2-yn-1-amine (4c) was synthesized by a one-step fluorine-18 nucleophilic substitution reaction. Autoradiography on human brain tissue sections demonstrated specific binding for compound 4c to brain regions known to have a high content of MAO-B. In addition, the corresponding nonradioactive fluorine-19 compound (13) inhibited recombinant human MAO-B with an IC(50) of 170.5 ± 29 nM but did not inhibit recombinant human MAO-A (IC(50) &gt; 2000 nM), demonstrating its specificity. Biodistribution of 4c in mice showed high initial brain uptake leveling at 5.2 ± 0.04%ID/g after 2 min post injection. In conclusion, compound 4c is a specific inhibitor of MAO-B with high initial brain uptake in mice and is, therefore, a candidate for further investigation in PET.
21912124,0,2011,Cardiology,Severity of mitral stenosis and left ventricular mechanics: a speckle tracking study.,BACKGROUND: It has been shown that mitral stenosis (MS) impairs left ventricular (LV) systolic function; however, this issue has not been studied comprehensively. We aimed to evaluate the role of 2D strain in the assessment of subclinical LV systolic dysfunction in patients with MS.METHODS: Seventy-two patients with isolated MS (mild, moderate and severe) and 31 healthy control subjects constituted the study population. 2D echocardiography images were obtained from LV apical 4-chamber (4C), long axis (LAX), and 2-chamber (2C) views. Peak longitudinal strain and strain rate (Sr) were obtained from 4C, LAX, and 2C views. Global strain and Sr were calculated by averaging the three apical views.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in LV ejection fraction and LV systolic or diastolic dimensions between the groups. Patients with MS had significantly lower LV longitudinal strain and Sr measurements than the control group. In addition, there were no significant differences in MS subgroups with respect to LV strain and Sr measurements.CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that patients with MS had lower LV functions using 2D strain imaging, and this is independent of the hemodynamic severity of MS. In the detection of subclinical LV dysfunction in patients with MS, 2D strain imaging appears to be useful.
21898611,0,2011,Chemistry,Bond stretching and redox behavior in coinage metal complexes of the dichalcogenide dianions [(SPh2P)2CEEC(PPh2S)2]2- (E=S, Se): diradical character of the dinuclear copper(I) complex (E=S).,The metathetical reactions of a) [Li(tmeda)](2)[(S)C(PPh(2)S)(2)] (Li(2)·3c) with CuCl(2) and b) [Li(tmeda)](2)[(SPh(2)P)(2)CSSC(PPh(2)S)(2)] (Li(2)·4c) with two equivalents of CuCl both afford the binuclear Cu(I) complex {Cu(2)[(SPh(2)P)(2)CSSC(PPh(2)S)(2)]} (5c). The elongated (C)S-S(C) bond (ca. 2.54 and 2.72 Å) of the dianionic ligand observed in the solid-state structure of 5c indicate the presence of diradical character as supported by theoretical analyses. The treatment of [Li(tmeda)](2)[(SPh(2)P)(2)CSeSeC(PPh(2)S)(2)] (Li(2)·4b) and Li(2)·4c with AgOSO(2)CF(3) produce the analogous Ag(I) derivatives, {Ag(2)[(SPh(2)P)(2)CEEC(PPh(2)S)(2)]} (6b, E=Se; 6c, E=S), respectively. The diselenide complex 6b exhibits notably weaker Ag-Se(C) bonds than the corresponding contacts in the Cu(I) congeners, and the (31)P NMR data suggest a possible isomerization in solution. In contrast to the metathesis observed for Cu(I) and Ag(I) reagents, the reactions of Li(2)·4b and Li(2)·4c with Au(CO)Cl involve a redox process in which the dimeric dichalcogenide ligands are reduced to the corresponding monomeric dianions, [(E)C(PPh(2)S)(2)](2-) (3b, E=Se; 3c, E=S), and one of the gold centers is oxidized to generate the mixed-valent Au(I)/Au(III) complexes, {Au[(E)C(PPh(2)S)(2)]}(2) (7b, E=Se; 7c, E=S), with relatively strong aurophilic Au(I)···Au(III) interactions. The new compounds 5c, 6b,c and 7b,c are characterized in solution by NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by X-ray crystallography (5c, 6b, 7b and 7c) and by Raman spectroscopy (5c and 6c). The UV-visible spectra of coinage metal complexes of the type 5, 6 and 7 are discussed in the light of results from theoretical analyses using time-dependent density functional theory.
21891827,0,2011,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,Phosphodiesterases inhibition by Bacilli Calmette-Guérin contributes to decrease asthma in allergic rats.,Phosphodiesterases (PDE) hydrolyse intracellular cAMP and cGMP to inactive 5' monophosphates. Decreased level of cAMP is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. We and others have shown that phosphodiesterases were upregulated in the lung of allergic rats, and Bacilli Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induced the production of cAMP in vitro. However, it is unclear how BCG's effect asthma and whether it is related to PDEs.In this study, BCG was intraperitoneally injected into male Sprague-Dawley rats sensitized and later the rats were challenged with ovabumin/pertusis. The inflammation in lungs was measured. Airway hyperresponsiveness was determined using MedLab software after intravenous methacholine challenge. Furthermore, cAMP level and adenylate cyclase activity in lungs were analyzed by ELISA, phosphodiesterases activities were analyzed by HPLC, while PDEs mRNA levels in lungs was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Administration of BCG significantly attenuated allergen-induced lung inflammatory response and hyper responsiveness as compared with vehicle treatment. Furthermore, the levels of cAMP in lungs were significantly increased in BCG-treated allergic rats. Interestingly, administration of BCG decreased the activity of cAMP-PDE, but not adenylyl cyclase (AC), activity in lungs of animals. Furthermore, pretreatment with BCG significantly decreased the mRNA levels of PDE4A, 4C, 5 and 8, which were induced in lungs of allergic rats. BCG administration attenuated airway inflammatory response and bronchial hyper responsiveness in rats, which are the most important symptoms in asthma. The decreased PDEs mRNA and inhibited cAMP-PDE activities by BCG contribute, at least in part, prevention of allergen-induced airway inflammation and asthma in rats.
21879079,0,2011,Dalton Trans,Crystalline metal (Li, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sn, Pb) complexes of the new chelating N,N'-dianionic [1,2-N(R)C6H4(CH2NR)](2-) ligand (R = SiMe3, CH2Bu(t)).,2-Aminomethylaniline was converted into the N,N'-bis(pivaloyl) (1) or -bis(trimethylsilyl) (2) derivative, using 2 Bu(t)C(O)Cl or 2 Me(3)SiCl (≡ RCl), respectively, with 2 NEt(3), or for 2 from successively using 2 LiBu(n) and 2 RCl. N,N'-Bis(neopentyl)-2-(aminomethyl)aniline (3) was prepared by LiAlH(4) reduction of 1. From 2 or 3 and 2 LiBu(n), the appropriate dilitiodiamide {2-[{N(Li)R}C(6)H(4){CH(2)N(Li)R}(L)](2) (L absent, 4a; or L = THF, 4b) or the N,N'-bis(neopentyl) analogue (5) of 4a was prepared. Treatment of 4a with 2 Bu(t)NC, 2 (2,6-Me(2)C(6)H(3)NC) or 2 Bu(t)CN (≡ L') furnished the corresponding adduct [2-N{Li(L')R}C(6)H(4){CH(2)N(Li)R}] (4c, 4d or 4e, respectively), whereas 4b with 2 PhCN afforded [2-{N(Li)R}C(6)H(4){CH(2)C(Ph) = NLi(NCPh)}] (6). The dimeric bis(amido)stannylene [Sn{N(R)C(6)H(4)(CH(2)NR)-1,2}](2) (7) was obtained from 4a and [Sn(μ-Cl)NR(2)](2), while the N,N'-bis(neopentyl) analogue 8 of 7 was similarly derived from [Sn(μ-Cl)NR(2)](2) and 5. Reaction of two equivalents of the diamine 2 with Pb(NR(2))(2) yielded 9, the lead homologue of 7. Oxidative addition of sulfur to 7 led to the dimeric bis(diamido)tin sulfide 10. Treatment of 2 successively with 'MgBu(2)' in C(5)H(12) and THF gave [Mg{N(R)C(6)H(4)(CH(2)NR)}(THF)](2) (11a), which by displacement of its THF by an equivalent portion of Bu(t)CN or PhCN produced [Mg{N(R)C(6)H(4)(CH(2)NR)}(CNR')(n)] [R' = Bu(t), n = 1 (11b); R' = Ph, n = 2 (11c)]. The Ca (12), Sr (13) or Ba (14) analogues of the Mg compound 11a were isolated from 2 and either the appropriate compound M(NR(2))(2) (M = Ca, Sr, Ba), or successively 2 LiBu(n) and 2 M(OTos)(2). The new compounds 1-14 were characterized by microanalysis (C, H, N; not for 1, 2, 3, 5), solution NMR spectra, ν(max) (C≡N) (IR for 4c, 4d, 4e, 6, 11b, 11c), selected EI-MS peaks (for 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10), and single crystal X-ray diffraction (for 4a, 4b, 11a).
21866243,0,2011,GMS Z Med Ausbild,Clerkship maturity: does the idea of training clinical skills work?,BACKGROUND: With the reformed curriculum &quot;4C&quot;, the Medical Faculty of the University of Cologne has started to systematically plan practical skills training, for which Clerkship Maturity is the first step. The key guidelines along which the curriculum was development were developed by experts. This approach has now been validated.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Both students and teachers were asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding preclinical practical skills training to confirm the concept of Clerkship Maturity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The Cologne training program Clerkship Maturity can be validated empirically overall through the activities of the students awaiting the clerkship framework and through the evaluation by the medical staff providing the training. The subjective ratings of the advantages of the training by the students leave room for improvement. Apart from minor improvements to the program, the most likely solution providing sustainable results will involve an over-regional strategy for establishing skills training planned as part of the curriculum.
21864951,0,2011,Eur J Med Chem,Derivatives of pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazinone, a new class of analgesic agents.,A series of N2-{2-[4-aryl(benzyl)-1-piperazinyl(piperidinyl)]ethyl}pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazinones 4 and related derivatives 5 were synthesized as potential analgesic agents. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by micro, spectral and X-ray analysis. Analgesic activity of the compounds was investigated in the phenylbenzoquinone induced 'writhing' and 'hot plate' test in mice and at radioligand binding assay. At 'writhing' test all compounds, without exception, were more active than acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) with ED(50) values ranging from 0.04 to 11 mg/kg (i.p.) (ED(50) for ASA--39.15 mg/kg). Analgesic effect at the 'hot plate' test was observed for three compounds 4c,e,f at the dose 3-5 times higher then that of morphine (ED(50)-3.39 mg/kg). At radioligand binding assay of 4c,e,f only compound 4f exhibited affinity for the μ-opioid receptors similar to that of Tramadol. The acute toxicity of the pyrrolopyridazinones 4, 5 were also studied and non toxic effect was observed at the 2000 mg/kg (5a 1420 mg/kg) i.p. dose level. On the basis of the available pharmacological data S-A relationship is discussed. The preferred conformational characteristic of 4, taken 4c as an example, was also described.

The Co(III) ions are six-coordinate with acetyl-ide and chloride ligands bound to the axial sites and the N atoms from the cyclam rings coordinated at the equatorial positions. N-H⋯O and N-H⋯Cl hydrogen-bonding interactions help to consolidate the crystal packing.
21809716,0,2011,West Indian Med J,Traumatic mechanisms and therapeutic results of the perilunate injuries.,OBJECTIVE: In this study, eighteen patients who have had perilunate injury with dislocation or fracture, were evaluated and the patho-mechanics and surgical treatment were studied.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: According to the Green and O'Brien's classification, type 1 injury occurred in one patient, type 2 in nine, type 4A in five, type 4C in one and type 4D in one. The other one case could not be classified using the Green and O'Brien's criteria.RESULTS: According to the Evans scoring system, good results were achieved in thirteen patients, fair results, in four, poor results in one and very poor results in none. When the patho-mechanics was estimated based on the Mayfield's criteria, seventeen patients were classified as stage 3. However only one case was extremely unusual and should be classified as a subtype of stage 2.CONCLUSION: The results were good in the majority of patients who had repair of perilunate injury.
21806050,0,2011,J Am Chem Soc,Electrochemistry, electrogenerated chemiluminescence, and excimer formation dynamics of intramolecular π-stacked 9-naphthylanthracene derivatives and organic nanoparticles.,We report the electrochemical characterization and the observation of excimer emission from a series of 9-naphthylanthracene-based dimer- and trimer-bridged high steric hindrance aromatic groups during photoluminescence (PL) measurements in the solid state and in solution electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) measurements. Cyclic voltammetry of 4,4'-bis(9-(1-naphthyl)anthracen-10-yl)biphenyl (4A) and 1,3,5-tris(9-(1-naphthyl)anthracen-10-yl)benzene (4C) showed two or three reversible, closely spaced one-electron transfers on oxidation in dichloromethane. The ECL emission spectra of 4A and 4C resulting from the annihilation reaction in benzonitrile showed two bands: one at the same wavelength as the PL peak in the solution state, and a broad band at longer wavelength. With a coreactant, such as peroxydisulfate, ECL spectra showed a single peak that was less broad in shape. PL measurement in the solid state and measurement of representative time traces of PL intensity, lifetimes, and picosecond time-correlated single-photon counting confirmed excimer emission at long wavelength. A reprecipitation method was used to prepare well-dispersed organic nanoparticles (NPs) of 4A in both aqueous and acetonitrile solutions. The smallest stable size of NPs produced was ~15 ± 6 nm, as analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. These organic NPs produced stable and weak ECL emission from the annihilation reaction in both aqueous and MeCN solutions. With a coreactant, such as peroxydisulfate, the ECL signal on reduction was sufficiently strong to obtain an ECL spectrum.
21800890,0,2011,J Am Chem Soc,Coupled commensurate cation and charge modulation in the tunneled structure, Na(0.40(2))MnO(2).,Na(0.40(2))MnO(2) belongs to a family of mixed Mn(3+) and Mn(4+) porous oxides that contains both octahedral and square pyramidal Mn-O units. Neutron and synchrotron radiation studies identify the presence of both sodium ordering (T(Na) ≈ 310 K) and Mn charge and orbital ordering. Below T(Na), the centrosymmetric Pbam structure adopts an (ab 4c) supercell of Pnnm symmetry that accommodates a coupled commensurate modulation down the c-axis channels of both Na position and occupancy with Mn valence.
21793061,0,2011,Chemistry,Unusually long, multicenter, cation(δ+)···anion(δ-) bonding observed for several polymorphs of [TTF][TCNE].,The α, β, and δ polymorphs of [TTF][TCNE] (TTF=tetrathiafulvalene; TCNE=tetracyanoethylene) exhibit a new type of long, multicenter bonding between the [TTF](δ+) and [TCNE](δ-) moieties, demonstrating the existence of long, hetero-multicenter bonding with a cationic(δ+)···anionic(δ-) zwitterionic-like structure. These diamagnetic π-[TTF](δ+) [TCNE](δ-) heterodimers exhibit a transfer of about 0.5 e(-) from the TTF to the TCNE fragments, as observed from experimental studies, in accord with theoretical predictions, that is, [TTF(δ+)···TCNE(δ-)] (δ≅0.5). They have several interfragment distances &lt;3.4 Å, and a computed interaction energy of -21.2 kcal mol(-1), which is typical of long, multicenter bonds. The lower stability of [TTF](δ+) [TCNE](δ-) with respect to typical ionic bonds is due, in part, to the partial electron transfer that reduces the electrostatic bonding component. This reduced electrostatic interaction, and the large interfragment dispersion stabilize the long, heterocationic/anionic multicenter interaction, which in [TTF(δ+)···TCNE(δ-)] always involves two electrons, but have ten, eight, and eight bond critical points (bcps) involving C-C, N-S, and sometimes C-S and C-N components for the α, β, and δ polymorphs, respectively. In contrast, γ-[TTF][TCNE] possesses [TTF](2)(2+) and [TCNE](2)(2-) dimers, each with long, homo-multicenter 2e(-)/12c (c=center, 2 C+4 S) [TTF](2)(2+) cationic(+)···cationic(+) bonds, as well as long, homo-multicenter 2e(-)/4c [TCNE](2)(2-) anionic(-)···anionic(-) bonding. The MO diagrams for the α, β, and δ polymorphs have all of the features found for conventional covalent C-C bonds, and for all of the previously studied multicenter long bonds, for example, π-[TTF](2)(2+) and π-[TCNE](2)(2-). The HOMOs for α-, β-, and δ-[TTF][TCNE] have 2c C-S and 3c C-C-C orbital-overlap contributions between the [TTF](δ+-) and [TCNE](δ-) moieties; these are the shortest intra [TTF···TCNE] separations. Thus, from an orbital-overlap perspective, the bonding has 2c and 3c components residing over one S and four C atoms.
21779990,0,2011,Methods Mol Biol,The ForeSee (4C) approach for integrative analysis in gene discovery.,The development of high-throughput experimental techniques has made measurements for virtually all kinds of cellular components possible. Effective integration and analysis of this diverged information to produce insightful knowledge is central to biological study today. In this chapter, we present a methodology for building integrative analytical workbenches using the workflow technology. We focus on the field of gene discovery through the combined study of transcriptomics, genomics and epigenomics, although the methodology is generally applicable to any omics-data analysis for biomarker discovery. We illustrate the application of the methodology by presenting our study on the identification of aberrant genomic regions, genes and/or their regulatory elements with their implications for breast cancer research. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities brought by the latest development of the next generation sequencing technology.

Each pyrazole ring is essentially planar (mean deviations of 0.009 and 0.002 Å), with the two nitro groups rotated out of the plane [dihedral angles = 11.7 (2)/31.1 (1) and 21.8 (2)/25.0 (1)° for the two mol-ecules].
21749090,0,2011,J Org Chem,Enantioselective organocatalytic Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction of indoles with 5-hydroxyfuran-2(5H)-one: access to chiral γ-lactones and γ-lactams via a Ugi 4-center 3-component reaction.,5-Hydroxyfuran-2(5H)-one 1, a readily available renewable resource, was used as an electrophile in the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of indoles catalyzed by a diphenylprolinol silyl ether. Moderate catalyst loading was achieved because of the high reactivity of 5-hydroxyfuran-2(5H)-one 1 in this process. Reduction of the Friedel-Crafts adduct (FC adduct) afforded indoyl lactones in high yield and enantioselectivity. Moreover, the FC adduct was used as a chiral synthon in a diversity-oriented synthesis, as illustrated by its successful engagement in a 4-center 3-component Ugi reaction (U-4C-3CR) to afford chiral five-membered lactams in high yield and enantioselectivity.
21744900,0,2011,J Chem Phys,Full-dimensional time-dependent wave packet dynamics of H2 + D2 reaction.,Collision induced dissociation (CID), four center reaction (4C), and single exchange reaction (SE) in H(2) (v(1) = high) + D(2) (v(2) = low) were studied by means of time-dependent wave packet approach within a full-dimensional model. Initial state-selected total reaction probabilities for the three competitive processes have been computed on two realistic global potential energy surfaces of Aguado-Suárez-Paniagua and Boothroyd-Martin-Keogh-Peterson (BMKP) with the total angular momentum J = 0. The role of both vibrationally excited and rotationally excited reagents was examined by varying the initial vibrational and rotational states. The vibrational excitation of the hot diatom gives an enhancement effect on the CID process, while the vibrational excitation of the cold diatom gives an inhibition effect. The rotational excitation of both reagents has a significant effect on the reaction process. The 4C and SE probabilities are at least one order of magnitude smaller than the CID probabilities over the energy range considered. Isotope substitution effects were also studied by substituting the collider D(2) by H(2) and HD on the BMKP potential energy surfaces. The CID process is most efficient for the H(2) + D(2) combination and least efficient for the H(2) + H(2) combination and is different for the 4C and SE processes.
21722108,0,2011,J Fish Biol,Morphological and histological study of larval development of the Senegal sole Solea senegalensis: an integrative study.,This study provides a comprehensive description of the main morphological and histological events that take place during larval and post-larval development of Senegal sole Solea senegalensis in order to establish a reference for its normal developmental organogenesis. Five stages have been described. Before gill development at the onset of metamorphosis (eye migration process, stage 4c), the skin was the main site of gas and ion exchange, whereas during stages 3 and 4, the skin begins differentiating into the definitive juvenile structure. The timing of development of the endocrine system depends on each organ, the endocrine pancreas and thyroid gland being the first to differentiate (stages 2 and 3, respectively), followed by the interrenal tissue and stannius corpuscles that develop at metamorphosis (stages 4 and 4c, respectively). The differentiation and maturation of the lymphohaematopoietic organs was coupled with the increase in complexity of the cardiovascular system and the presence of mature erythrocytes (stage 4b), which might be attributed to the change in respiration and the development of fully functional gills. In the differentiation of sensory structures, the development of eyes, inner ear, neuromasts and olfactory organs was rapid, with most of these organs becoming fully developed soon after hatching (stage 1). Vision, chemo- and mechano-reception developed very early in ontogeny, in parallel with the development of the central nervous system and changes in feeding habits. Although the general pattern of development in S. senegalensis appeared similar to most marine fish larvae already described, there were species-specific ontogenetic characteristics probably derived from the species' particular environment (subtropical waters) and behaviour (nocturnal, benthic, omnivorous feeding habits). These results on the organogenesis of larvae are a useful tool for establishing the functional systemic capabilities and physiological requirements of larvae to ensure optimal welfare and growth under aquaculture conditions.
21699144,0,2011,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,Lithiation and delithiation of silicon oxycarbide single particles with a unique microstructure.,Single particles (11 and 13 μm diameter) of a silicon oxycarbide (Si-O-C) glass were electrochemically analyzed using a microelectrode technique. A micromanipulator-guided nickel-plated rhodium-platinum microfilament (25 μm diameter, 13 wt % rhodium) was used to maintain electrical contact to a single Si-O-C glass particle in an organic solution containing 1 mol dm(-3) LiClO(4). The cyclic voltammograms of a single Si-O-C glass particle (11 μm diameter) featured a characteristic sharp peak at ca. 0.1 V vs Li/Li(+), along with a broad peak and a shoulder, in the anodic reaction. This result indicates that there are several electrochemically active sites for lithium storage in the single Si-O-C glass particle. The first lithiation and delithiation capacities of a single Si-O-C glass particle (13 μm diameter) were 1.67 nA h and 1.12 nA h, respectively, at 5 nA (4C rate) in the potential range 0.01-2.5 V vs Li/Li(+), leading to a Coulombic efficiency of 67%. These results are in good agreement with those observed in typical porous composite electrodes. The 13 μm diameter particle gives 75% of the full-delithiation capacity even at 100 nA (80C rate), demonstrating that its intrinsic delithiation rate capability is suitable for practical purposes. Assuming that the Tafel equation is applicable to the delithiation of the single Si-O-C glass particle, the charge-transfer resistance tended to increase as lithium was released.
21683483,0,2011,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis, characterization and biological evaluation of novel 2,4,6-trisubstituted bis-pyrimidine derivatives.,A new series of 2,4,6-trisubstituted bis-pyrimidines were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antiamoebic activity against HM1:IMSS strain of Entamoeba histolytica. Out of 16 compounds 8 compounds have shown IC(50) values in the range of 0.10-1.86 μM. Bis-pyrimidine having methyl-, methoxy-, thiomethyl- and dimehyl-phenyl substituents, exhibited higher antiamoebic activity than the reference drug metronidazole (IC(50) = 1.9 μM). The toxicological studies of active compounds on PC12-rat pheochoromocytoma cell line showed that all compounds were non-toxic at a concentration of 100 μM. 4-4'-Benzene-1,3-diylbis[6-(4-methylphenyl-2-(piperidin-1-yl)pyrimidine] (4c) was found most active (IC(50) = 0.10 μM) and least toxic among all the compounds.

21657936,0,2011,Foodborne Pathog Dis,Listeria monocytogenes serotypes 1/2c and 3c possess inlH.,To examine the serotype specificity of inlH, which encodes the virulence-associated surface protein InlH related to the intracellular survival of Listeria monocytogenes in mice, the presence of inlH in 337 L. monocytogenes strains, representing 11 different serotypes, was studied. A total of 106 strains representing 3 serotypes and 14 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types were positive for inlH by polymerase chain reaction. inlH was present in all 99 serotype 1/2c and 3 serotype 3c strains. Moreover, 4 out of 129 (3%) serotype 1/2a strains carried inlH. All 106 strains representing serotypes 1/2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, and 7 and 125 out of 129 (97%) serotype 1/2a strains were inlH-negative. The coding sequences of the inlH genes of eight L. monocytogenes strains representing three serotypes and five PFGE types were identical. These results suggest that inlH is specifically present in serotype 1/2c, 3c, and a small fraction of 1/2a L. monocytogenes strains and exists as a single allele.
21644541,0,2011,J Med Chem,Antimalarial pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles.,A novel class of antimalarial pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles were synthesized and evaluated for antiplasmodial activity and cytotoxicity following hits identified from screening commercially available compound collections. The most active of these, TDR86919 (4c), showed improved in vitro activity vs the drug-resistant K1 strain of Plasmodium falciparum relative to chloroquine (IC(50) = 0.047 μM v 0.17 μM); potency was retained against a range of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, with negligible cytotoxicity against the mammalian (L-6) cell line (selectivity index of &gt;600). 4c and several close analogues (as HCl or mesylate salts) showed significant efficacy in P. berghei infected mice following both intraperitoneal (ip) and oral (po) administration, with &gt;90% inhibition of parasitemia, accompanied by an increase in the mean survival time (MSD). The pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles appeared to be relatively slow acting in vivo compared to chloroquine, and metabolic stability of the alkylamino side chain was identified as a key issue in influencing in vivo activity.

The formation of 1 is remarkably diastereoselective, with the major isomer (97% of the product) assigned to rac-1. Restricted rotation about the P-P bond of the bulky meso-1 is detected by variable temperature (31)P NMR spectroscopy. Diphosphane 3 reacts with BH(3) to give a mixture of CgP(BH(3))-PPhob and CgP-PPhob(BH(3)) which was unexpected in view of the predicted much greater electron-richness of the PhobP site. Each of the diphosphanes was treated with dimethylacetylene dicarboxylate (DMAD) in order to determine their propensity for diphosphination. The homodiphosphanes 1 and 2 did not react with DMAD. The CgP-containing heterodiphosphanes 4a-d all added to DMAD to generate the corresponding cis alkenes CgPCH(CO(2)Me)=CH(CO(2)Me)PR(2) (6a-d) which have been used in situ to form chelate complexes of the type [MCl(2)(diphos)] (7a-d) where M = Pd or Pt. The PhobP-containing heterodiphosphanes 3 and 5a-d react anomalously with DMAD and do not give the products of diphosphination. The X-ray crystal structures of the diphosphanes 2, 3, 4a, and 5a, the monoxide and dioxide of diphosphane 1, and the platinum chelate complex 7c have been determined and their structures are discussed.

Benzoylation of 4c led to the formation of the dibenzoate derivative 9. Compounds 4a-c could be prepared stepwise through the formation of S-alkylated derivatives 10a-c. Compounds 2, 4a-c, 9 and 10a-c were prepared using microwave as a source of heat, and gave better yields in shorter times than those achieved by traditional methods. Coupling of 4a-c with arenediazonium chlorides proceeded unusually to give the 6-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(arylazo)thieno[2,3-b]pyridin-3(2H)-one ring contraction products 14.

21614820,0,2011,Arch Latinoam Nutr,[Estimation of body fat by DXA and the four compartment model in Mexican youth].,The objective of this study was to validate the estimation of body fat (%BF) by DXA (Dual-Energy X-Ray AbsorciomDPX-MD) against the four compartment model (4C) of body composition in 32 Mexican pubertal girls and boys (aged 9-14 y; F=16). The mean of the difference between DXA and 4C model was -3.5 %BF (p=0.171). The limits of agreement (95% = 2 SD) were +5% to -12%BF. The precision of estimated limits of y the confidence intervals were -1.9% to -5.1%BF (P = 0.050). The concordance correlation coefficient was p = 0.85. The test of accuracy for coincidence of slop intercepts between DXA and the 4C model showed no coincidence (p &lt; 0.05). The precision by R2 explained 83% of the variance (SEE, 4.1%). The individual accuracy assess by the total error was 5.6%. The group mean accuracy by two way analysis of variance of body fat did not show interaction between method (DXA-4C model) and separate analysis of gender and overweight. However, there was an effect of method (p = 0.043) in the presence of overweight (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the estimation of percent of body fat by DXA was not precise and accurate in a group of Mexican children. However, results do not limit the utility of DXA for the measurements of body composition and its relation with health outcomes, especially in follow up studies.

For all these compounds, (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra have been recorded. For two compounds, 2D spectra have been recorded. The spectral data suggest that these compounds adopt sofa conformation in solution with H-5, H-6 and H-4t occupying axial-like positions and H-4c occupying equatorial-like positions. In 3-phenyl-5r-(o-chlorophenyl)-6t-carbethoxycylohex-2-enone (2b), the o-chlorophenyl group is oriented such that the chlorine atom is in between H-4c and H-5. Allylic coupling of H-2 is observed only with H-4t. Evidence has been obtained for four-bond coupling between 1,3-diaxial and 1,3-axial-equatorial protons.
21482532,0,2011,Yi Chuan,[The quality control of 4C-clone screening assay].,Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) can be used to analyze the high-resolution interaction map of cis-regulatory elements in genome-wide studies. In this study, we optimized the condition of PCR with the mimical 4C sample in order to establish a specific and efficient assay, which was validated practically. This 4C-clone screening assay can be used as the quality control in the application of 4C assay.
21454090,0,2011,Biologicals,Improving heat stability of haemagglutinating antigens for avian influenza.,The increasing demand for avian influenza diagnostic reagents worldwide, has included requests for significant supplies of product to developing countries. Difficulties in dispatching to remote areas and tropical countries are a major concern to suppliers, international organisations and donors as delays in forwarding parcels often result in storage at non-optimal or inadequate temperatures results in loss in titre and thus wastage of resources. In this study we demonstrate that the heat stability of avian influenza haemagglutination inhibition antigens of the H5, H7 and H9 subtype following 14 days of exposure to 37°C and 45°C is significantly increased by adding D-(+)-Trehalose to the freshly prepared antigen. Increased stability was detected both for freeze-dried antigens over an extended period of 6 months and also in heat exposed antigens that were then stored at +4C for up to 35 days post reconstitution.
21441492,0,2011,Adv Dent Res,Social aspects of HIV and their relationship to craniofacial problems: workshop 4C.,The oral research community needs an understanding of the social causes, consequences, and costs of disease in relation to oral health. This workshop concluded that HIV infection constitutes a special dental need requiring specific arrangements to facilitate oral care for infected persons. Oral manifestations of HIV infection affect everyday life, but more evidence is needed on the effects of interventions to alleviate these impacts. Other oral health habits add to the burden of HIV/AIDS-associated oral diseases and compete with them for resources. These problems are most acute where the prevalence of HIV is high and resources are scarce. Effective health promotion is therefore important in these areas. Without data on the utility of oral health care in developing countries, practical approaches are guided by societal and multidisciplinary principles. There are also important ethical considerations.
21439837,0,2011,Appl Radiat Isot,Development of monitoring method of spatial neutron distribution in neutrons-gamma rays mixed field using imaging plate for NCT--depression of the field.,The degree of depression in the neutron field caused by neutron absorption in the materials of an imaging plate (IP) was investigated using MCNP-4C. Consequently, the IP doped with Gd, which reproduced the distribution of (157)Gd(n,γ)(158)Gd reaction rate in the previous study, depresses the relative distribution by about 50%. The depression for the IP in which Gd is replaced with similar amount of B atoms was estimated to be about 10%. The signal intensity for this IP is estimated to be at a similar level with that for Gd-doped IP.
21431922,0,2011,Ecotoxicology,Reproductive toxicity in male mice exposed to Nanjing City tap water.,End points of reproductive toxicity were investigated in male mice (Mus musculus, ICR) fed Nanjing City tap water for 90 days. There was no significant alteration in body weights between treatment and control mice. In treated mice, flow cytometry analysis of testicular tissue indicated that the relative percentage of the elongated spermatid (HC) decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05). Also slight increases in the relative percentage of round spermatids (1C) and primary spermatocytes (4C) were noted. The ratios of 4C:2C (diploid germ cells) and 1C:2C increased, and testicular histopathology indicated an expansion of interstitial space and a decreased number and size of Leydig cells in treated mice. The current study suggests that Nanjing City tap water is toxic to the reproductive system of mice and additional study to evaluate its effects on other species, including human beings, would be warranted.
21425481,0,2011,J Integr Neurosci,The time course of visual backward masking deficits in schizophrenia.,Schizophrenia, it has been hypothesized, is linked to a deficiency in the magnocellular portion of the visual system. Abnormal backward masking has been invoked as support for this hypothesis. The rationale for linking backward masking to the magnocellular system is the hypothesis that fast responses in the magnocellular systems catches up with, and then inhibits slower responses in the parvocellular system. However, the latency difference between the magno- and parvocellular systems is at most 20 ms. Magnocellular abnormalities as a result would be expected to manifest themselves only at relatively short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) or interstimulus intervals (ISIs). The present study examines this implication. It is found that a substantial number of investigations have uncovered abnormal masking at SOAs or ISIs of 300 ms or larger, and some even at ISIs as large as 700 ms. It is difficult to reconcile abnormalities at these SOAs and ISIs with magno-parvocellular latency differences of 20 ms or less. It is concluded that the abnormal masking does not support the existence of a magnocellular deficiency in schizophrenia.
21420863,0,2011,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and SAR investigations of novel 2-arylbenzimidazole derivatives as melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCH-R1) antagonists.,Compounds containing 2-arybenzimidazole ring systems linked to arylpiperidines were synthesized and evaluated as MCH-R1 antagonists. The results of structure-activity relationship studies led to the identification of compound 4c as a potent MCH-R1 antagonist (IC(50)=1 nM). This compound also has good metabolic stability, and favorable pharmacokinetic and brain penetration properties. However 4c was found to be potent inhibitor of the hERG potassium channel.
21399804,0,2011,Dalton Trans,Syntheses, reactions, and ethylene polymerization of titanium complexes with [N,N,S] ligands.,Tridentate dianionic arylsulfide free ligands [ArNHCH(2)C(6)H(4)NHC(6)H(4)-2-SPh] (Ar = Ph (3a); Ar = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl (3b); Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl (3c)) have been prepared by reduction of the corresponding imine compounds [ArN[double bond, length as m-dash]CHC(6)H(4)NHC(6)H(4)-2-SPh] (Ar = Ph (2a); Ar = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl (2b); Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl (2c)) with LiAlH(4) in high yields. Reactions of TiCl(4) with the tridentate dianionic arylsulfide free ligands (3a-3c) afford five-coordinate and four-coordinate titanium complexes [κS, κ(2)N-(ArNHCH(2)C(6)H(4)NHC(6)H(4)-2-SPh)TiCl(2)] (Ar = Ph (4a); Ar = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl (4b)] and [κ(2)N-(ArNHCH(2)C(6)H(4)NHC(6)H(4)-2-SPh)TiCl(2)] (Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl (4c)], respectively. The molecular structures of compounds 2b, 2c, 3b and 3c·HCl have been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Complexes 2a-4c are characterized by IR,(1)H-NMR spectra, and elemental analysis. EXAFS spectroscopy performed on complexes 4b and 4c reveals the expected different coordination geometry due to steric hindrance effect. When activated by excess methylaluminoxane (MAO), 4a-4c can be used as catalysts for ethylene polymerization and exhibit moderate to good activities.
21388816,0,2011,Appl Radiat Isot,Designing of an online system for radiocaesium measurements in the marine environment.,An online radiocaesium measuring system (ORMS) is designed to determine the environmental radiocaesium contamination of sea water near the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP). The System consists of a 400-liter, spherical stainless steel water tank, including three aluminum (0.5mm) enclosure NaI (TI) detectors, which each are located in 120° phase angle with size (6×3in.) to confirm each other. Responses of detectors to gamma radiations were calculated, using Monte Carlo code MCNP.4C. Moreover, delay time of each response and the dead time of the whole system to be considered due to designing decisions were calculated.
21380472,0,2011,Phys Chem Chem Phys,Structure of clean and hydrated α-Al2O3 (1102) surfaces: implication on surface charge.,Periodic DFT calculations coupled to a first-principle thermodynamic approach have allowed us to establish a surface phase diagram for the different terminations of the α-Al(2)O(3) (1102) surface in various temperature and water pressure conditions. Theoretical results are compared with previous experimental data from the literature. Under a wide range of temperature and water pressure (including ambient conditions) the most stable surface (denoted C2_1H(2)O in this work) is terminated with singly coordinated hydroxyls on four-fold coordinated aluminium (Al(4C)-μ(1)-OH) while most existing surface models are only considering six-fold coordinated surface Al atoms as in the bulk structure of alumina. The presence of more acidic Al(4C)-μ(1)-OH sites helps explain the low Point of Zero Charge (PZC) (between 5 and 6) determined from the onset of Mo oxoanions adsorption on (1102) single crystal wafers. It is also postulated that another termination (corresponding to the hydration of the non-polar, stoichiometric surface, stable in dehydrated conditions) may be observed in aqueous solution depending on the surface preparation conditions.
21366315,0,2011,J Am Chem Soc,P-C bond activation chemistry: evidence for 1,1-carboboration reactions proceeding with phosphorus-carbon bond cleavage.,A series of diarylphosphinyl-substituted acetylenes of the type (aryl)(2)P-C≡C-R (aryl = phenyl or mesityl, R = Ph or n-propyl) react with the strongly Lewis acid reagent B(C(6)F(5))(3) in toluene at elevated temperatures (70-105 °C) to give the 1,1-carboboration products 4. Treatment of bis(diphenylphosphinyl)acetylene with B(C(6)F(5))(3) under analogous conditions proceeded with phosphinyl migration to yield the 1,1-carboboration product 4d, bearing a geminal pair of Ph(2)P substituents at one former acetylene carbon atom and a C(6)F(5) substituent and the remaining -B(C(6)F(5))(2) group at the other. Prolonged thermolysis of 4d resulted in an intramolecular aromatic substitution reaction by means of Ph(2)P attack on the adjacent C(6)F(5) ring to yield the zwitterionic phospha-indene derivative 7. The compounds 4a, 4c, 4d, and 7 were characterized by X-ray diffraction.
21360410,0,2011,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,Microwave-assisted synthesis of 2(1H)-pyridones and their glucosides as cell proliferation inhibitors.,A new series of substituted 2(1H)-pyridones (4a-i) and their glucosides (5, 6a-e) were prepared as potential agents against leukemia (HL-60) cells. Glucosides (5,6a-e) were synthesized using three independent methods. Microwave protocol as an ecologically new method was used to synthesize the target compounds. Structures of the new products were confirmed using one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. In vitro exposure of pyridones substituted at position 4 with a 2-thienyl or 2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl were found to exhibit high antiproliferation activities; in particular, 3-cyano-4-(thien-2'-yl)-6-(4''-chlorophenyl)-2(1H)-pyridone (4c) and its glucoside analogue (6c) had the highest activity.
21358573,0,2011,Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Broader curve criteria for selective thoracic fusion.,STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective radiographic review.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of selective thoracic fusion (STF) by using cantilever bending technique (CBT) and the direct vertebral rotation (DVR) technique for major thoracic-compensatory lumbar (MTCL) curves selected by new curve criteria, which are broader than Lenke curve criteria for STF.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical treatment of MTCL curves aims to maximize the number of MTCL curves that can be treated with STF and optimize instrumented thoracic and spontaneous lumbar correction. Comparing current guidelines for STF shows that the surgical technique utilized for STF may affect the curve criteria for MTCL curves for successful STF and thoracic and lumbar correction.METHODS: Seventy-eight consecutive idiopathic scoliosis patients with major thoracic-compensatory &quot;C&quot; modifier lumbar curves who met the following three criteria: (1) main thoracic curve (MT) to compensatory lumbar curve (CL) ratios of Cobb magnitude and apical vertebral translation (AVT) greater than one; (2) MT/CL ratio of flexibility less than one; (3) Cobb magnitude of lumbar curve less than 35° on side bending, were treated with STF by using CBT and DVR. Radiographs were analyzed before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the most recent follow-up (range, 2-5 years).RESULTS: All 78 MTCL curves were successfully treated with STF by using CBT and DVR. A mean 61% thoracic correction was matched by 55% lumbar correction at the most recent follow-up. Spontaneous correction of lumbar AVT occurred in all patients. Global coronal imbalance was common before surgery (mean, 14 mm) and remained so after surgery (mean, 12 mm). There were 49 MTCL curves that did not meet Lenke curve criteria for STF. All were successfully treated with STF by using CBT and DVR. Among these 49 MTCL curves, there were 14 Lenke 1C and 18 Lenke 2C curves with one or two, or all of MT/CL ratios of Cobb magnitude, AVT, and apical vertebral rotation of 1.2 or less, and 6 Lenke 3C and 11 Lenke 4C curves with the Cobb magnitude of residual lumbar curve on side bending between 25° and 35°.CONCLUSION: CBT and DVR can broaden the current curve criteria of MTCL curves for STF to have more MTCL curves treatable with STF and optimize instrumented thoracic and spontaneous lumbar correction. A more effective surgical technique can not only improve instrumented thoracic and spontaneous lumbar correction but also can broaden the MTCL curve criteria for STF to have more MTCL curves treatable with STF.
21285491,0,2011,Acta Crystallogr C,Gadolinium ytterbium trifluoride, Gd0.81Yb0.19F3.,A new gadolinium ytterbium trifluoride has been grown for the first time by the Czochralski technique. Although GdF(3) and YbF(3) both present a high-temperature phase transition, the mixed compound Gd(0.81)Yb(0.19)F(3) maintains its crystallographic structure upon cooling to room temperature. Taking into account that both Gd(3+) and Yb(3+) ions are distributed randomly on a single site (Wyckoff position 4c), this is attributed to a mean cationic radius coincident with that of the Tb(3+) ion, so that the stability of the crystal structure resembles that of TbF(3). The grown crystal melts noncongruently at ∼1413 K, it is transparent and colourless, and it has a high density.
21254751,0,2011,Inorg Chem,Gold(III) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes mediated synthesis of β-enaminones from 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds and aliphatic amines.,A series of gold(III) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes [1-(R(1))-3-(R(2))imidazol-2-ylidene]AuBr(3) [R(1) = i-Pr, R(2) = CH(2)Ph (1c); R(1) = mesityl, R(2) = CH(2)Ph (2c); R(1) = i-Pr, R(2) = CH(2)COt-Bu (3c), and R(1) = t-Bu, R(2) = CH(2)COt-Bu (4c)] act as effective precatalysts in the synthesis of β-enaminones from 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds and primary amines under ambient conditions. Specifically the 1c-4c complexes efficiently catalyzed the condensation of a variety of cyclic as well as acyclic 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, namely, acetyl acetone, benzoylacetone, 2-acetylcyclopentanone, and ethyl-2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylate with primary aliphatic amines, viz., methylamine, ethylamine, n-propylamine, i-propylamine, and n-butylamine, yielding β-enamines at room temperature. Interestingly enough, the more electrophilic gold(III) 1c-4c complexes exhibited superior activity in comparison to the gold(I) counterparts 1b-4b. A comparison along a representative 4a-c series further underscored the importance of gold in the reaction as both the gold(I) 4b and gold(III) 4c complexes were more effective than the silver analogue 4a. The density functional theory (DFT) study revealed that the strong σ-donating nature of the N-heterocyclic carbene ligand results in a strong C(carbene)-Au(III) interaction in the 1c-4c complexes.
21246135,0,2011,Dalton Trans,Synthesis and characterisation of trigonal C2-chiral di- and tetra-substituted bis(oxazoline) alkyl zinc complexes and their reactivity towards protic reagents.,A series of zinc(ii) alkyl complexes stabilised by the C(2)-chiral bis(oxazoline) ligand ((R(1),R(2))BOX, with R(1) = (4S)-tBu, R(2) = H (a); R(1) = (4S)-Ph, R(2) = H (b); R(1) = (4R)-Ph, R(2) = (5S)-Ph (c)), has been synthesised and structurally characterised. ((R(1),R(2))BOX)H ligands react with ZnEt(2) in toluene to give the heteroleptic three-coordinate compounds of ((R(1),R(2))BOX)ZnEt, 1a, 1b and 1c in high yield. However, when the addition of (BOX)H ligands (a-b) over ZnEt(2) is &quot;uncontrolled&quot;, the formation of homoleptic four-coordinate compounds are favoured (2a-b), but not for the more sterically crowded ligand (c). The zinc-ethyl derivatives (1a-c) react readily with protic reagents such as acetic acid (HOAc) and methanol (MeOH). For compounds 1a-c a redistribution of ligands is observed leading preferentially to homoleptic compounds, except for the bulkier ligand c providing a three-coordinate complex identified as ((Ph,Ph)BOX)Zn(OMe), 4c. The reaction of acetylacetone (acacH) with compounds 1a-c leads straightforwardly to the more stable four-coordinate compounds corresponding to ((R(1),R(2))BOX)Zn(η(2)-acac), 5a-c. The potential of these compounds as initiators for the copolymerisation of epoxides with CO(2) was investigated.
21242167,0,2011,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Monte Carlo determination of the conversion coefficients Hp(3)/Ka in a right cylinder phantom with 'PENELOPE' code. Comparison with 'MCNP' simulations.,This work has been performed within the frame of the European Union ORAMED project (Optimisation of RAdiation protection for MEDical staff). The main goal of the project is to improve standards of protection for medical staff for procedures resulting in potentially high exposures and to develop methodologies for better assessing and for reducing, exposures to medical staff. The Work Package WP2 is involved in the development of practical eye-lens dosimetry in interventional radiology. This study is complementary of the part of the ENEA report concerning the calculations with the MCNP-4C code of the conversion factors related to the operational quantity H(p)(3). In this study, a set of energy- and angular-dependent conversion coefficients (H(p)(3)/K(a)), in the newly proposed square cylindrical phantom made of ICRU tissue, have been calculated with the Monte-Carlo code PENELOPE and MCNP5. The H(p)(3) values have been determined in terms of absorbed dose, according to the definition of this quantity, and also with the kerma approximation as formerly reported in ICRU reports. At a low-photon energy (up to 1 MeV), the two results obtained with the two methods are consistent. Nevertheless, large differences are showed at a higher energy. This is mainly due to the lack of electronic equilibrium, especially for small angle incidences. The values of the conversion coefficients obtained with the MCNP-4C code published by ENEA quite agree with the kerma approximation calculations obtained with PENELOPE. We also performed the same calculations with the code MCNP5 with two types of tallies: F6 for kerma approximation and *F8 for estimating the absorbed dose that is, as known, due to secondary electrons. PENELOPE and MCNP5 results agree for the kerma approximation and for the absorbed dose calculation of H(p)(3) and prove that, for photon energies larger than 1 MeV, the transport of the secondary electrons has to be taken into account.
21237220,0,2011,J Biotechnol,Identification of RNF2-responding loci in long-range chromatin interactions using the novel 4C-ChIP-Cloning technology.,RNF2 is a core component of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which binds to various chromatic regions to regulate their transcriptional activity. It was recently reported that EZH2, a Polycomb group complex member, helps mediate long-range chromosomal interactions in mammalian cells. The present study investigates whether RNF2-responding loci interact in long-range chromatin. The new 4C-ChIP-Cloning technology was developed based on circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) and ChIP. Use of the 4C-ChIP-Cloning technology successfully identified four loci in long-range cis- or trans-interactions that were mediated by the RNF2 protein. RNAi experiments showed that RNF2 regulated the transcription levels of genes adjacent to the loci. These results suggest that RNF2 protein, as part of PRC1, mediates long-range interactions between RNF2-interation loci and regulates adjacent genes. This 4C-ChIP-Cloning technology may contribute to the study of protein-mediated long-range chromatin interactions with specific regulatory elements.
21233096,0,2011,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Dosimetric characteristic of a new 125I brachytherapy source.,A new brachytherapy (125)I source has been investigated at Iranian Agricultural, Medical and Industrial Research School. Dosimetric characteristics [dose-rate constant Λ, radial dose function g(l)(r) and anisotropy function F(r,)] of IRA-(125)I were theoretically determined in terms of the updated AAPM task group 43 (TG-43U1) recommendations. Versions 5 and 4C of the Monte Carlo radiation transport code were used to calculate the dosimetry parameters around the source. The Monte Carlo calculated dose-rate constant of the (125)I source in water was found to be 92×10(-4) Gy h(-1) U(-1) with an approximate uncertainty of ±3 %. Brachytherapy seed model, 6711-(125)I, carrying (125)I radionuclides, was modelled and benchmarked against previously published values. Finally, the calculated results were compared with the published results of those of other source manufacturers.

Compounds exhibits significant antibacterial activity and antifungal activity. Compounds 4a and g exhibited equal while 4c, d, i and j slightly less antibacterial activity than standard streptomycin. Compounds 4a and g exhibited equal while 4b, c, d, f and i displayed slightly less antifungal activity than standard griseofulvins.
21206067,0,2011,Acta Crystallogr C,Strontium magnesium phosphate, Sr(2+x)Mg(3-x)P4O15 (x ~ 0.36), from laboratory X-ray powder data.,The previously unknown crystal structure of strontium magnesium phosphate, Sr(2+x)Mg(3-x)P(4)O(15) (x ~ 0.36), determined and refined from laboratory powder X-ray diffraction data, represents a new structure type. The title compound was synthesized by high-temperature solid-state reaction and it crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmcm. It was earlier thought to be stoichiometric Sr(2)Mg(3)P(4)O(15), but our structural study indicates the nonstoichiometric composition. The asymmetric unit contains one Sr (site symmetry ..m on special position 8g), one M (= Mg 64%/Sr 36%; site symmetry 2/m.. on special position 4b), one Mg (site symmetry 2.. on special position 8e), two P (site symmetry m.. on special position 8f and site symmetry ..m on special position 8g), and six O sites [two on general positions 16h, two on 8g, one on 8f and one on special position 4c (site symmetry m2m)]. The nonstoichiometry is due to the mixing of magnesium and strontium ions on the M site. The structure consists of three-dimensional networks of MgO(4) and PO(4) tetrahedra, and MO(6) octahedra with the other strontium ions occupying the larger cavities surrounded by ten O atoms. All the polyhedra are connected by corner-sharing except the edge-sharing MO(6) octahedra forming one-dimensional arrangements along [001].
22750370,0,2011,Bull Group Int Rech Sci Stomatol Odontol,O45-regulation of osteoblast differentiation and ECM remodeling by Bmp2/4 in vitro.,Both of bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4 (Bmp2 and Bmp4) are two closely related members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily and play diverse roles in normal and pathological processes. However, detail understandings of mechanisms through which Bmp2 and Bmp4 exert their effects remain elusive due to their functional compensations each other. To study roles of Bmp2/Bmp4 in osteoblast differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, calvarial osteoblasts from Bmp2/4 conditional mice with Cre recombinase recognition site (loxP) were isolated and transfected with simian virus 40 large T antigen to generate immortalized BMP2C/C4C/C (iBMP2 C/C/4C/C) osteoblast lines. The BMP2/4 genes in the iBMP2 C/C/4C/C cells were double knocked out by Ad-Cre recombinase infection. Differentiation and mineralization of iBMP2C/C/4C/C knock-out (iBmp2C/C/4C/C KO) cells were detected by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin (ALZ) red S staining analyses. ECM remodeling was also observed in fluorescent microscope. Cell differentiation was dramatically decreased in the iBMP2C/C/4C/C KO cells compared to that of the iBMP2C/C/4C/C osteoblasts. Mineralization was also reduced in these KO cells by ALZ staining. Furthermore, Bmp2/4 double knock-out cells have major defects in remodeling the ECM as reflected by changes in collagen type I processing. Here we for the first time demonstrate the establishment of iBmp2C/C/4C/C KO osteoblasts. Cell differentiation and mineralization in the iBmp2C/C/4C/C KO cells were decreased. Furthermore, ECM processing in these KO cells was impaired. This indicates that BMP2/4 play important roles in osteoblast differentiation and ECM remodeling.
20150996,35,2010,J Cheminform,Application of the PM6 semi-empirical method to modeling proteins enhances docking accuracy of AutoDock.,BACKGROUND: Molecular docking methods are commonly used for predicting binding modes and energies of ligands to proteins. For accurate complex geometry and binding energy estimation, an appropriate method for calculating partial charges is essential. AutoDockTools software, the interface for preparing input files for one of the most widely used docking programs AutoDock 4, utilizes the Gasteiger partial charge calculation method for both protein and ligand charge calculation. However, it has already been shown that more accurate partial charge calculation - and as a consequence, more accurate docking- can be achieved by using quantum chemical methods. For docking calculations quantum chemical partial charge calculation as a routine was only used for ligands so far. The newly developed Mozyme function of MOPAC2009 allows fast partial charge calculation of proteins by quantum mechanical semi-empirical methods. Thus, in the current study, the effect of semi-empirical quantum-mechanical partial charge calculation on docking accuracy could be investigated.RESULTS: The docking accuracy of AutoDock 4 using the original AutoDock scoring function was investigated on a set of 53 protein ligand complexes using Gasteiger and PM6 partial charge calculation methods. This has enabled us to compare the effect of the partial charge calculation method on docking accuracy utilizing AutoDock 4 software. Our results showed that the docking accuracy in regard to complex geometry (docking result defined as accurate when the RMSD of the first rank docking result complex is within 2 A of the experimentally determined X-ray structure) significantly increased when partial charges of the ligands and proteins were calculated with the semi-empirical PM6 method. Out of the 53 complexes analyzed in the course of our study, the geometry of 42 complexes were accurately calculated using PM6 partial charges, while the use of Gasteiger charges resulted in only 28 accurate geometries. The binding affinity estimation was not influenced by the partial charge calculation method - for more accurate binding affinity prediction development of a new scoring function for AutoDock is needed.CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the accuracy of determination of complex geometry using AutoDock 4 for docking calculation greatly increases with the use of quantum chemical partial charge calculation on both the ligands and proteins.
20727575,28,2010,Cell,Structural basis of semaphorin-plexin recognition and viral mimicry from Sema7A and A39R complexes with PlexinC1.,Repulsive signaling by Semaphorins and Plexins is crucial for the development and homeostasis of the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Sema7A acts as both an immune and a neural Semaphorin through PlexinC1, and A39R is a Sema7A mimic secreted by smallpox virus. We report the structures of Sema7A and A39R complexed with the Semaphorin-binding module of PlexinC1. Both structures show two PlexinC1 molecules symmetrically bridged by Semaphorin dimers, in which the Semaphorin and PlexinC1 beta propellers interact in an edge-on, orthogonal orientation. Both binding interfaces are dominated by the insertion of the Semaphorin's 4c-4d loop into a deep groove in blade 3 of the PlexinC1 propeller. A39R appears to achieve Sema7A mimicry by preserving key Plexin-binding determinants seen in the mammalian Sema7A complex that have evolved to achieve higher affinity binding to the host-derived PlexinC1. The complex structures support a conserved Semaphorin-Plexin recognition mode and suggest that Plexins are activated by dimerization.
20181685,24,2010,J Virol,Novel inhibitors of influenza virus fusion: structure-activity relationship and interaction with the viral hemagglutinin.,A new class of N-(1-thia-4-azaspiro[4.5]decan-4-yl)carboxamide inhibitors of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated membrane fusion that has a narrow and defined structure-activity relationship was identified. In Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells infected with different strains of human influenza virus A/H3N2, the lead compound, 4c, displayed a 50% effective concentration of 3 to 23 muM and an antiviral selectivity index of 10. No activity was observed for A/H1N1, A/H5N1, A/H7N2, and B viruses. The activity of 4c was reduced considerably when added 30 min or later postinfection, indicating that 4c inhibits an early step in virus replication. 4c and its congeners inhibited influenza A/H3N2 virus-induced erythrocyte hemolysis at low pH. 4c-resistant virus mutants, selected in MDCK cells, contained either a single D112N change in the HA2 subunit of the viral HA or a combination of three substitutions, i.e., R220S (in HA1) and E57K (in HA2) and an A-T substitution at position 43 or 96 of HA2. The mutants showed efficiency for receptor binding and replication similar to that of wild-type virus yet displayed an increased pH of erythrocyte hemolysis. In polykaryon assays with cells expressing single-mutant HA proteins, the E57K, A96T, and D112N mutations resulted in 4c resistance, and the HA proteins containing R220S, A96T, and D112N mutations displayed an increased fusion pH. Molecular modeling identified a binding cavity for 4c involving arginine-54 and glutamic acid-57 in the HA2 subunit. Our studies with the new fusion inhibitor 4c confirm the importance of this HA region in the development of influenza virus fusion inhibitors.
20181416,24,2010,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of cholic acid hydrazone analogues.,Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of cholic acid analogues 4a-t are reported. The synthesis of 4a-t was accomplished from ethylcholate 2. The hydrazone moiety was introduced via coupling of the cholic acid hydrazide (3) with appropriately functionalized aldehyde utilizing acetic acid as a catalyst. Quiet of interest in relation to the synthesized hydrazones is the formation of two rotamers s-cis.E and s-trans.E. Most compounds showed stronger antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria than Cefaclor and Cefixime. Compounds 4d, 4i and 4j indicated 15-fold stronger antimicrobial activities against Enterobacter faecalis compared to Cefaclor and Cefixime. Some of the synthesized compounds (e.g. 4a, 4c, 4d, 4i, and 4l) reflected two-folds less activity against Escherichia coli relative to Cefixime.
20501623,18,2010,Clin Cancer Res,Oncolytic adenovirus ICOVIR-7 in patients with advanced and refractory solid tumors.,PURPOSE: Twenty-one patients with cancer were treated with a single round of oncolytic adenovirus ICOVIR-7.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ICOVIR-7 features an RGD-4C modification of the fiber HI-loop of serotype 5 adenovirus for enhanced entry into tumor cells. Tumor selectivity is mediated by an insulator, a modified E2F promoter, and a Rb-binding site deletion of E1A, whereas replication is optimized with E2F binding hairpins and a Kozak sequence. ICOVIR-7 doses ranged from 2 x 10(10) to 1 x 10(12) viral particles. All patients had advanced and metastatic solid tumors refractory to standard therapies.RESULTS: ICOVIR-7 treatment was well tolerated with mild to moderate fever, fatigue, elevated liver transaminases, chills, and hyponatremia. One patient had grade 3 anemia but no other serious side effects were seen. At baseline, 9 of 21 of patients had neutralizing antibody titers against the ICOVIR-7 capsid. Treatment resulted in neutralizing antibody titer induction within 4 weeks in 16 of 18 patients. No elevations of serum proinflammatory cytokine levels were detected. Viral genomes were detected in the circulation in 18 of 21 of patients after injection and 7 of 15 of the samples were positive 2 to 4 weeks later suggesting viral replication.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, objective evidence of antitumor activity was seen in 9 of 17 evaluable patients. In radiological analyses, 5 of 12 evaluable patients had stabilization or reduction in tumor size. These consisted of one partial response, two minor responses and two cases of stable disease, all occurring in patients who had progressive disease before treatment. In summary, ICOVIR-7 treatment is apparently safe, resulting in anticancer activity, and is therefore promising for further clinical testing.
20716111,17,2010,Traffic,Trafficking and recycling of the connexin43 gap junction protein during mitosis.,During the cell cycle, gap junction communication, morphology and distribution of connexin43 (Cx43)-containing structures change dramatically. As cells round up in mitosis, Cx43 labeling is mostly intracellular and intercellular coupling is reduced. We investigated Cx43 distributions during mitosis both in endogenous and exogenous expressing cells using optical pulse-chase labeling, correlated light and electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and biochemical analysis. Time-lapse imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)/tetracysteine tagged Cx43 (Cx43-GFP-4C) expressing cells revealed an early disappearance of gap junctions, progressive accumulation of Cx43 in cytoplasmic structures, and an unexpected subset pool of protein concentrated in the plasma membrane surrounding the midbody region in telophase followed by rapid reappearance of punctate plaques upon mitotic exit. These distributions were also observed in immuno-labeled endogenous Cx43-expressing cells. Photo-oxidation of ReAsH-labeled Cx43-GFP-4C cells in telophase confirmed that Cx43 is distributed in the plasma membrane surrounding the midbody as apparent connexons and in cytoplasmic vesicles. We performed optical pulse-chase labeling and single label time-lapse imaging of synchronized cells stably expressing Cx43 with internal tetracysteine domains through mitosis. In late telophase, older Cx43 is segregated mainly to the plasma membrane while newer Cx43 is intracellular. This older population nucleates new gap junctions permitting rapid resumption of communication upon mitotic exit.
21183689,14,2010,Blood,Endothelial reticulon-4B (Nogo-B) regulates ICAM-1-mediated leukocyte transmigration and acute inflammation.,The reticulon (Rtn) family of proteins are localized primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of most cells. The Rtn-4 family, (aka Nogo) consists of 3 splice variants of a common gene called Rtn-4A, Rtn-4B, and Rtn-4C. Recently, we identified the Rtn-4B (Nogo-B) protein in endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall, and showed that Nogo-B is a regulator of cell migration in vitro and vascular remodeling and angiogenesis in vivo. However, the role of Nogo-B in inflammation is still largely unknown. In the present study, we use 2 models of inflammation to show that endothelial Nogo-B regulates leukocyte transmigration and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)-dependent signaling. Mice lacking Nogo-A/B have a marked reduction in neutrophil and monocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation, while Nogo-A/B(-/-) mice engrafted with wild-type (WT) bone marrow still exhibit impaired inflammation compared with WT mice engrafted with Nogo-A/B(-/-) bone marrow, arguing for a critical role of host Nogo in this response. Using human leukocytes and endothelial cells, we show mechanistically that the silencing of Nogo-B with small interfering RNA (siRNA) impairs the transmigration of neutrophils and reduces ICAM-1-stimulated phosphorylation of vascular endothelial-cell cadherin (VE-cadherin). Our results reveal a novel role of endothelial Nogo-B in basic immune functions and provide a key link in the molecular network governing endothelial-cell regulation of diapedesis.
20926676,13,2010,J Neurosci,Generation of black-dominant responses in V1 cortex.,Consistent with human perceptual data, we found many more black-dominant than white-dominant responses in layer 2/3 neurons of the macaque primary visual cortex (V1). Seeking the mechanism of this black dominance of layer 2/3 neurons, we measured the laminar pattern of population responses (multiunit activity and local field potential) and found that a small preference for black is observable in early responses in layer 4Cβ, the parvocellular-input layer, but not in the magnocellular-input layer 4Cα. Surprisingly, further analysis of the dynamics of black-white responses in layers 4Cβ and 2/3 suggested that black-dominant responses in layer 2/3 were not generated simply because of the weak black-dominant inputs from 4Cβ. Instead, our results indicated the neural circuitry in V1 is wired with a preference to strengthen black responses. We hypothesize that this selective wiring could be due to (1) feedforward connectivity from black-dominant neurons in layer 4C to cells in layer 2/3 or (2) recurrent interactions between black-dominant neurons in layer 2/3, or a combination of both.
21073743,9,2010,Virol J,Epidemiological manifestations of hepatitis C virus genotypes and its association with potential risk factors among Libyan patients.,BACKGROUND: The information on hepatitis C virus genotypes and subtypes among Libyan population and its association with various risk factors is not known. The objectives of this study were to determine the epidemiological manifestations of HCV genotypes among Libyan patients and their association with certain potential risk factors.METHODS: A total of 1240 of HCV infected patients registered at Tripoli Medical Centre were studied in five years period from January 2005 to October 2009. The information were reviewed and the data were collected. A sample from each patient (785 male; 455 female) was analysed for genotyping and sub-typing using specific genotyping assay. The information was correlated with the risk factors studied and the statistical data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.5.RESULTS: Off the total patients studied, four different genotypes were reported, including genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Genotype4 was the commonest (35.7%), followed by genotype1 (32.6%). According to subtypes 28% were unclassified genotype 4, 14.6% were genotype 1b and some patients infected with more than one subtype (2.3% genotype 4c/d, 1% genotype 2a/c). Genotypes 1 was the commonest among males, while genotype 4 among females. According to the risk factors studied, Genotype1 and genotype 4 were found with most of the risk factors. Though they were particularly evident surgical intervention, dental procedures and blood transfusion while genotype 1 was only followed by genotype 3 mainly which mainly associated with certain risk groups such as intravenous drug abusers.CONCLUSION: Here in we report on a detailed description of HCV genotype among Libyans. The most common genotype was type 4 followed by genotype 1, other genotypes were also reported at a low rate. The distribution of such genotypes were also variable according to gender and age. The commonly prevalent genotypes found to be attributable to the medical -related transmission of HCV, such as blood, surgery and dental procedures when compared with other risk factors. This however, raises an alarming signal on the major steps to be taken to reduce such infection in Libya.
20509659,9,2010,J Med Chem,Synthesis and characterization of in vitro and in vivo profiles of hydroxybupropion analogues: aids to smoking cessation.,To create potentially superior aids to smoking cessation and/or antidepressants and to elucidate bupropion's possible mechanisms of action(s), 23 analogues based on its active hydroxymetabolite (2S,3S)-4a were synthesized and tested for their abilities to inhibit monoamine uptake and nAChR subtype activities in vitro and acute effects of nicotine in vivo. The 3',4'-dichlorophenyl [(+/-)-4n], naphthyl (4r), and 3-chlorophenyl or 3-propyl analogues 4s and 4t, respectively, had higher inhibitory potency and/or absolute selectivity than (2S,3S)-4a for inhibition of DA, NE, or 5HT uptake. The 3'-fluorophenyl, 3'-bromophenyl, and 4-biphenyl analogues 4c, 4d, and 4l, respectively, had higher potency for antagonism of alpha4beta2-nAChR than (2S,3S)-4a. Several analogues also had higher potency than (2S,3S)-4a as antagonists of nicotine-mediated antinociception in the tail-flick assay. The results suggest that compounds acting via some combination of DA, NE, or 5HT inhibition and/or antagonism of alpha4beta2-nAChR can potentially be new pharmacotherapeutics for treatment of nicotine dependence.
20401745,9,2010,Psychopharmacology (Berl),Dose-effect study of Gelsemium sempervirens in high dilutions on anxiety-related responses in mice.,INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to investigate the putative anxiolytic-like activity of ultra-low doses of Gelsemium sempervirens (G. sempervirens), produced according to the homeopathic pharmacopeia.METHODS: Five different centesimal (C) dilutions of G. sempervirens (4C, 5C, 7C, 9C and 30C), the drug buspirone (5 mg/kg) and solvent vehicle were delivered intraperitoneally to groups of ICR-CD1 mice over a period of 9 days. The behavioral effects were assessed in the open-field (OF) and light-dark (LD) tests in blind and randomized fashion.RESULTS: Most G. sempervirens dilutions did not affect the total distance traveled in the OF (only the 5C had an almost significant stimulatory effect on this parameter), indicating that the medicine caused no sedation effects or unspecific changes in locomotor activity. In the same test, buspirone induced a slight but statistically significant decrease in locomotion. G. sempervirens showed little stimulatory activity on the time spent and distance traveled in the central zone of the OF, but this effect was not statistically significant. In the LD test, G. sempervirens increased the % time spent in the light compartment, an indicator of anxiolytic-like activity, with a statistically significant effect using the 5C, 9C and 30C dilutions. These effects were comparable to those of buspirone. The number of transitions between the compartments of the LD test markedly increased with G. sempervirens 5C, 9C and 30C dilutions.CONCLUSION: The overall pattern of results provides evidence that G. sempervirens acts on the emotional reactivity of mice, and that its anxiolytic-like effects are apparent, with a non-linear relationship, even at high dilutions.
21122816,8,2010,Mol Cell Neurosci,Semaphorin 4C and 4G are ligands of Plexin-B2 required in cerebellar development.,Semaphorins and Plexins are cognate ligand-receptor families that regulate important steps during nervous system development. The Plexin-B2 receptor is critically involved in neural tube closure and cerebellar granule cell development, however, its specific ligands have only been suggested by in vitro studies. Here, we show by in vivo and in vitro analyses that the two Semaphorin-4 family members Sema4C and Sema4G are likely to be in vivo ligands of Plexin-B2. The Sema4C and Sema4G genes are expressed in the developing cerebellar cortex, and Sema4C and Sema4G proteins specifically bind to Plexin-B2 expressing cerebellar granule cells. To further elucidate their in vivo function, we have generated and analyzed Sema4C and Sema4G knockout mouse mutants. Like Plexin-B2-/- mutants, Sema4C-/- mutants reveal exencephaly and subsequent neonatal lethality with partial penetrance. Sema4C-/- mutants that bypass exencephaly are viable and fertile, but display distinctive defects of the cerebellar granule cell layer, including gaps in rostral lobules, fusions of caudal lobules, and ectopic granule cells in the molecular layer. In addition to neuronal defects, we observed in Sema4C-/- mutants also ventral skin pigmentation defects that are similar to those found in Plexin-B2-/- mutants. The Sema4G gene deletion causes no overt phenotype by itself, but combined deletion of Sema4C and Sema4G revealed an enhanced cerebellar phenotype. However, Sema4C/Sema4G double mutants showed overall less severe cerebellar phenotypes than Plexin-B2-/- mutants, indicating that further ligands of Plexin-B2 exist. In explant cultures of the developing cerebellar cortex, Sema4C promoted migration of cerebellar granule cell precursors in a Plexin-B2-dependent manner, supporting the model that a reduced migration rate of granule cell precursors is the basis for the cerebellar defects of Sema4C-/- and Sema4C/Sema4G mutants.
20410428,8,2010,AJR Am J Roentgenol,The positive predictive value of BI-RADS microcalcification descriptors and final assessment categories.,OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to retrospectively assess the likelihood of malignancy of microcalcifications according to the BI-RADS descriptors in a digital mammography environment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 146 women with calcifications who underwent imaging-guided biopsy between April 2005 and July 2006. Digital mammograms procured before biopsy were analyzed independently by two breast imaging subspecialists blinded to biopsy results. Lesions described discordantly were settled by consensus. One of the radiologists provided a BI-RADS final assessment score.RESULTS: The overall positive predictive value of biopsies was 28.8%. The individual morphologic descriptors predicted the risk of malignancy as follows: fine linear/branching, 16 (70%) of 23 cases; fine pleomorphic, 14 (28%) of 50 cases; coarse heterogeneous, two (20%) of 10 cases; amorphous, 10 (20%) of 51 cases; and typically benign, zero (0%) of 12 cases. Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact testing showed statistical significance among morphology descriptors (p &lt; 0.001) and distribution descriptors (p &lt; 0.001). The positive predictive value for malignancy according to BI-RADS assessment categories were as follows: category 2, 0%; category 3, 0%; category 4A, 13%; category 4B, 36%; category 4C, 79%; and category 5, 100%.CONCLUSION: BI-RADS morphology and distribution descriptors can aid in assessing the risk of malignancy of microcalcifications detected on full-field digital mammography. The positive predictive value increased in successive BI-RADS categories (4A, 4B, and 4C), verifying that subdivision provides an improved assessment of suspicious microcalcifications in terms of likelihood of malignancy.
21187383,7,2010,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Pre- and postexposure protection against virulent anthrax infection in mice by humanized monoclonal antibodies to Bacillus anthracis capsule.,One of the two essential virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis is the poly-γ-D-glutamic acid (γDPGA) capsule. Five γDPGA-specific antibody antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) were generated from immunized chimpanzees. The two selected for further study, Fabs 11D and 4C, were both converted into full-length IgG1 and IgG3 mAbs having human IgG1 or IgG3 constant regions. These two mAbs had similar binding affinities, in vitro opsonophagocytic activities, and in vivo efficacies, with the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses reacting similarly. The mAbs bound to γDPGA specifically with estimated binding affinities (K(d)) of 35-70 nM and effective affinities (effective K(d)) of 0.1-0.3 nM. The LD(50) in an opsonophagocytic bactericidal assay was ≈10 ng/mL of 11D or 4C. A single 30-μg dose of either mAb given to BALB/c mice 18 h before challenge conferred about 50% protection against a lethal intratracheal spore challenge by the virulent B. anthracis Ames strain. More importantly, either mAb given 8 h or 20 h after challenge provided significant protection against lethal infection. Thus, these anti-γDPGA mAbs should be useful, alone or in combination with antitoxin mAbs, for achieving a safe and efficacious postexposure therapy for anthrax.
21035938,7,2010,Differentiation,Sema4C-Plexin B2 signalling modulates ureteric branching in developing kidney.,Semaphorins, originally identified as axon guidance molecules, have also been implicated in angiogenesis, function of the immune system and cancerous growth. Here we show that deletion of Plexin B2 (Plxnb2), a semaphorin receptor that is expressed both in the pretubular aggregates and the ureteric epithelium in the developing kidney, results in renal hypoplasia and occasional double ureters. The rate of cell proliferation in the ureteric epithelium and consequently the number of ureteric tips are reduced in the kidneys lacking Plexin B2 (Plxnb2-/-). Semaphorin 4C, a ligand for Plexin B2, stimulates branching of the ureteric epithelium in wild type and Plxnb2+/- kidney explants, but not in Plxnb2-/- explants. As shown by co-immunoprecipitation Plexin B2 interacts with the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, the receptor of Glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf), in embryonic kidneys. Isolated Plxnb2-/- ureteric buds fail to respond to Gdnf by branching, but this response is rescued by Fibroblast growth factor 7 and Follistatin as well as by the metanephric mesenchyme. The differentiation of the nephrogenic mesenchyme, its morphology and the rate of apoptosis in the Plxnb2-/- kidneys are normal. Plexin B2 is co-expressed with Plexin B1 (Plxnb1) in the kidney. The double homozygous Plxnb1-Plxnb2-deficient mice show high embryonic lethality prior to onset of nephrogenesis. The only double homozygous embryo surviving to E12 showed hypoplastic kidneys with ureteric branches and differentiating mesenchyme. Taken together, our results show that Sema4C-Plexin B2 signalling regulates ureteric branching, possibly through modulation of Gdnf signalling by interaction with Ret, and suggest non-redundant roles for Plexin B1 and Plexin B2 in kidney development.
20502666,7,2010,PLoS One,Conserved charged amino acids within Sendai virus C protein play multiple roles in the evasion of innate immune responses.,One of the accessory proteins of Sendai virus (SeV), C, translated from an alternate reading frame of P/V mRNA has been shown to function at multiple stages of infection in cell cultures as well as in mice. C protein has been reported to counteract signal transduction by interferon (IFN), inhibit apoptosis induced by the infection, enhance the efficiency of budding of viral particles, and regulate the polarity of viral genome-length RNA synthesis to maximize production of infectious particles. In this study, we have generated a series of SeV recombinants containing substitutions of highly conserved, charged residues within the C protein, and characterized them together with previously-reported C'/C(-), 4C(-), and F170S recombinant viruses in infected cell cultures in terms of viral replication, cytopathogenicity, and antagonizing effects on host innate immunity. Unexpectedly, the amino acid substitutions had no or minimal effect on viral growth and viral RNA synthesis. However, all the substitutions of charged amino acids resulted in the loss of a counteracting effect against the establishment of an IFN-alpha-mediated anti-viral state. Infection by the virus (Cm2') containing mutations at K77 and D80 induced significant IFN-beta production, severe cytopathic effects, and detectable amounts of viral dsRNA production. In addition to the Cm2' virus, the virus containing mutations at E114 and E115 did not inhibit the poly(I:C)-triggered translocation of cellular IRF-3 to the nucleus. These results suggest that the C protein play important roles in viral escape from induction of IFN-beta and cell death triggered by infection by means of counteracting the pathway leading to activation of IRF-3 as well as of minimizing viral dsRNA production.
24376948,7,2010,Rep Pract Oncol Radiother,Air kerma strength characterization of a GZP6 Cobalt-60 brachytherapy source.,BACKGROUND: Task group number 40 (TG-40) of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) has recommended calibration of any brachytherapy source before its clinical use. GZP6 afterloading brachytherapy unit is a (60)Co high dose rate (HDR) system recently being used in some of the Iranian radiotherapy centers.AIM: In this study air kerma strength (AKS) of (60)Co source number three of this unit was estimated by Monte Carlo simulation and in air measurements.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simulation was performed by employing the MCNP-4C Monte Carlo code. Self-absorption of the source core and its capsule were taken into account when calculating air kerma strength. In-air measurements were performed according to the multiple distance method; where a specially designed jig and a 0.6 cm(3) Farmer type ionization chamber were used for the measurements. Monte Carlo simulation, in air measurement and GZP6 treatment planning results were compared for primary air kerma strength (as for November 8th 2005).RESULTS: Monte Carlo calculated and in air measured air kerma strength were respectively equal to 17240.01 μGym(2) h(-1) and 16991.83 μGym(2) h(-1). The value provided by the GZP6 treatment planning system (TPS) was &quot;15355 μGym(2) h(-1)&quot;.CONCLUSION: The calculated and measured AKS values are in good agreement. Calculated-TPS and measured-TPS AKS values are also in agreement within the uncertainties related to our calculation, measurements and those certified by the GZP6 manufacturer. Considering the uncertainties, the TPS value for AKS is validated by our calculations and measurements, however, it is incorporated with a large uncertainty.
20929967,6,2010,Schizophr Bull,On identifying magnocellular and parvocellular responses on the basis of contrast-response functions.,It has been proposed that magnocellular and parvocellular sensitivity in schizophrenic individuals can be assessed using steady-state visually evoked potentials (VEPs) to either low-contrast stimuli or stimuli whose contrast is modulated around a high contrast &quot;pedestal&quot; (Green MF, Butler PD, Chen Y, et al. Schizophr Bull. 2009;35:163-181). This suggestion faces 2 difficulties: (1) To use low-contrast stimuli to activate the magnocellular system is inconsistent with lesion studies that have shown that under many conditions, the parvocellular system responds to the lowest contrasts and (2) To rely on contrast-response relationships to identify magnocellular and parvocellular responses is difficult because other neurons exist in the visual system that have contrast-response relationships similar to those of magnocellular and parvocellular cells.
20807602,6,2010,Adv Genet,Targeted systemic gene therapy and molecular imaging of cancer contribution of the vascular-targeted AAVP vector.,Gene therapy and molecular-genetic imaging have faced a major problem: the lack of an efficient systemic gene delivery vector. Unquestionably, eukaryotic viruses have been the vectors of choice for gene delivery to mammalian cells; however, they have had limited success in systemic gene therapy. This is mainly due to undesired uptake by the liver and reticuloendothelial system, broad tropism for mammalian cells causing toxicity, and their immunogenicity. On the other hand, prokaryotic viruses such as bacteriophage (phage) have no tropism for mammalian cells, but can be engineered to deliver genes to these cells. However, phage-based vectors have inherently been considered poor vectors for mammalian cells. We have reported a new generation of vascular-targeted systemic hybrid prokaryotic-eukaryotic vectors as chimeras between an adeno-associated virus (AAV) and targeted bacteriophage (termed AAV/phage; AAVP). In this hybrid vector, the targeted bacteriophage serves as a shuttle to deliver the AAV transgene cassette inserted in an intergenomic region of the phage DNA genome. As a proof of concept, we assessed the in vivo efficacy of vector in animal models of cancer by displaying on the phage capsid the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD-4C) ligand that binds to alphav integrin receptors specifically expressed on the angiogenic blood vessels of tumors. The ligand-directed vector was able to specifically deliver imaging and therapeutic transgenes to tumors in mice, rats, and dogs while sparing the normal organs. This chapter reviews some gene transfer strategies and the potential of the vascular-targeted AAVP vector for enhancing the effectiveness of existing systemic gene delivery and genetic-imaging technologies.
20707328,6,2010,ACS Nano,Virus-enabled silicon anode for lithium-ion batteries.,A novel three-dimensional Tobacco mosaic virus assembled silicon anode is reported. This electrode combines genetically modified virus templates for the production of high aspect ratio nanofeatured surfaces with electroless deposition to produce an integrated nickel current collector followed by physical vapor deposition of a silicon layer to form a high capacity silicon anode. This composite silicon anode produced high capacities (3300 mAh/g), excellent charge-discharge cycling stability (0.20% loss per cycle at 1C), and consistent rate capabilities (46.4% at 4C) between 0 and 1.5 V. The biological templated nanocomposite electrode architecture displays a nearly 10-fold increase in capacity over currently available graphite anodes with remarkable cycling stability.
20472437,6,2010,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and antitumor activity of 2,5-bis(3'-indolyl)-furans and 3,5-bis(3'-indolyl)-isoxazoles, nortopsentin analogues.,A series of novel 2,5-bis(3'-indolyl)furans and 3,5-bis(3'-indolyl)isoxazoles were synthesized as antitumor agents. The antiproliferative activity was evaluated in vitro toward diverse human tumor cell lines. Initially 5 isoxazoles and 3 furan derivatives were tested against a panel of 10 human tumor cell lines and the most active derivatives 3c and 4a were selected to be evaluated in an extended panel of 29 cell lines. By exhibiting mean IC(50) values of 17.4 microg/mL (3a) and 20.5 microg/mL (4c), in particular 4c showed a high level of tumor selectivity toward the 29 cell lines.
20056603,6,2010,J Biol Chem,Elevated expression of Paneth cell CRS4C in ileitis-prone SAMP1/YitFc mice: regional distribution, subcellular localization, and mechanism of action.,Paneth cells at the base of small intestinal crypts of Lieberkühn secrete host defense peptides and proteins, including alpha-defensins, as mediators of innate immunity. Mouse Paneth cells also express alpha-defensin-related Defcr-rs genes that code for cysteine-rich sequence 4C (CRS4C) peptides that have a unique CPX triplet repeat motif. In ileitis-prone SAMP1/YitFc mice, Paneth cell levels of CRS4C mRNAs and peptides are induced more than a 1000-fold relative to non-prone strains as early as 4 weeks of age, with the mRNA and peptide levels highest in distal ileum and below detection in duodenum. CRS4C-1 peptides are found exclusively in Paneth cells where they occur only in dense core granules and thus are secreted to function in the intestinal lumen. CRS4C bactericidal peptide activity is membrane-disruptive in that it permeabilizes Escherichia coli and induces rapid microbial cell K(+) efflux, but in a manner different from mouse alpha-defensin cryptdin-4. In in vitro studies, inactive pro-CRS4C-1 is converted to bactericidal CRS4C-1 peptide by matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) proteolysis of the precursor proregion at the same residue positions that MMP-7 activates mouse pro-alpha-defensins. The absence of processed CRS4C in protein extracts of MMP-7-null mouse ileum demonstrates the in vivo requirement for intracellular MMP-7 in pro-CRS4C processing.
20844214,5,2010,J Clin Microbiol,Hepatitis C virus genotyping using an oligonucleotide microarray based on the NS5B sequence.,The genotype of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is essential for determining treatment duration in clinical practice and for epidemiological and clinical studies. Currently, few genotyping assays that determine the HCV subtype are available. This report describes a microarray-based molecular technique for identifying the HCV genotype and subtype. It uses low-density hydrogel-based biochips containing genotype- and subtype-specific oligonucleotides based on the sequences of the NS5B region of the HCV genome. The biochip contains 120 oligonucleotides that identify genotypes 1 to 6 and 36 (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2i, 2j, 2k, 2l, 2m, 3a, 3b, 3k, 4a, 4c, 4d, 4f, 4h, 4i, 4k, 4n, 4o, 4p, 4r, 4t, 5a, 6a, 6b, 6d, 6g, 6h, and 6k) subtypes. The procedure included amplification of a 380-nucleotide (nt) fragment of NS5B and its hybridization on the biochip. Tests on 345 HCV-positive samples showed that the assay agreed with NS5B sequencing 100% for the genotype and 99.7% for the subtype. The hybridization on the microarray and the NS5B sequence were in 100% agreement for identifying the most common subtypes, 1a, 1b, 4a, 4d, and 3a. This approach is a promising tool for HCV genotyping, especially for implementing the new anti-HCV drugs that require accurate identification of clinically relevant subtypes.
20831655,5,2010,Lett Appl Microbiol,The characterization of Listeria spp. isolated from food products and the food-processing environment.,AIM: To enhance the information pertaining to the epidemiology of a collection of 378 Listeria spp. isolates obtained from several food-processing plants in Ireland over a 3-year period (2004-2007).METHODS AND RESULTS: The collection was characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The most prevalent pulse-type was PFGE profile I (n=14·5%) that consisted mainly of environmental Listeria spp. samples. Serotyping of 145 Listeria monocytogenes isolates was performed. The most common serovar was 1/2a and comprised 57·4% (n=77) of the L. monocytogenes collection. The other serovars were as follows: 4b (14·1%, n=19), 1/2b (9·7%, n=13), 4c (4·4%, n=6) and 1/2c (6·7%, n=9), respectively. Eleven isolates were identified as non-Listeria spp., the remaining ten L. monocytogenes isolates were nontypeable. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed the antibiotic that isolates displayed the most resistance to was gentamicin (5%) followed by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (2%), tetracycline and ciprofloxacin (1·5%).CONCLUSIONS: The subtyping has indicated the diversity of the Listeria spp. The presence of serotype 1/2a, 1/2b and 4b in both raw and cooked ready-to-eat food products is a public health concern, as these serotypes are frequently associated with foodborne outbreaks and sporadic cases of human listeriosis. In addition, the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant L. monocytogenes isolates could have serious therapeutic consequences.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The molecular subtyping and the further characterization of these isolates may be valuable particularly in the context of a suspected common source outbreak in the future.
20576824,5,2010,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,The Cardiovascular Comorbidity in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (4C) study: objectives, design, and methodology.,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A systemic arteriopathy and cardiomyopathy has been characterized in pediatric dialysis patients by the presence of morphologic and functional abnormalities.DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &amp; MEASUREMENTS: The Cardiovascular Comorbidity in Children with CKD (4C) Study is a multicenter, prospective, observational study aiming to recruit more than 600 children, aged 6 to 17 years, with initial GFR of 10 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). The prevalence, degree, and progression of cardiovascular comorbidity as well as its association with CKD progression will be explored through longitudinal follow-up. The morphology and function of the heart and large arteries will be monitored by sensitive noninvasive methods and compared with aged-matched healthy controls. Multiple clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, and pharmacologic risk factors will be monitored prospectively and related to the cardiovascular status. A whole-genome association study will be performed to identify common genetic variants associated with progression of cardiovascular alterations and/or renal failure. Monitoring will be continued as patients reach end-stage renal disease and undergo different renal replacement therapies.RESULTS: While cardiovascular morbidity in adults is related to older age and additional risk factor load (e.g., diabetes), the role of CKD-specific factors in the initiation and progression of cardiac and vascular disease are likely to be characterized with greater sensitivity in the pediatric age group.CONCLUSIONS: The 4C study is expected to provide innovative insight into cardiovascular and renal disease progression in CKD.
20506370,5,2010,Arthritis Rheum,Efficacy of traditional and biologic agents in different clinical phenotypes of adult-onset Still's disease.,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of antiinflammatory agents, steroids, immunosuppressants, and biologic agents in patients with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) who have either chronic articular disease or nonchronic disease.METHODS: Forty-five patients with AOSD were seen and followed up for at least 2 years at our institution, from 1991 to 2008. The majority of patients were treated with several therapeutic regimens; a total of 152 efficacy trials were administered. Data regarding the type of medication, the dosage used, and the outcome of these trials were collected and analyzed.RESULTS: Our data showed that the efficacy of monotherapy with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug was very low (16%) and confirmed good efficacy of steroid therapy (63%), particularly in patients without chronic articular disease (78%). Patients whose disease did not respond to steroid therapy at the time of disease onset were at risk of the subsequent development of chronic arthritis. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) monotherapy was successful in controlling steroid-resistant or steroid-dependent disease in 60% of patients. Methotrexate and cyclosporine showed the best response rates. The combination of high-dose steroids and cyclosporine was administered to successfully control some acute life-threatening complications. Only 6 patients had disease that was both steroid resistant and DMARD resistant. Treatment with biologic agents eventually led to satisfactory control of disease manifestations in 5 (83%) of these 6 patients.CONCLUSION: Steroids were less effective in patients with chronic articular disease than in those with nonchronic disease. The administration of DMARDs early after disease onset could be beneficial in patients with steroid-resistant disease who are at risk of the development of chronic articular disease. Biologic agents proved to be highly effective in both steroid-resistant and DMARD-resistant AOSD.
20484321,5,2010,J Exp Bot,Increase in fruit size of a spontaneous mutant of 'Gala' apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) is facilitated by altered cell production and enhanced cell size.,Fruit size regulation was studied in the apple cultivar 'Gala' and a large fruit size spontaneous mutant of 'Gala', 'Grand Gala' (GG). GG fruits were 15% larger in diameter and 38% heavier than 'Gala' fruits, largely due to an increase in size of the fruit cortex. The mutation in GG altered growth prior to fruit set and during fruit development. Prior to fruit set, the carpel/floral-tube size was enhanced in GG and was associated with higher cell number, larger cell size, and increased ploidy through endoreduplication, an altered form of the cell cycle normally absent in apple. The data suggest that the mutation in GG promotes either cell production or endoreduplication in the carpel/floral-tube cells depending on their competence for division. Ploidy was not altered in GG leaves. During fruit growth, GG fruit cells exited cell production earlier, and with a DNA content of 4C suggesting G2 arrest. Cell size was higher in GG fruits during exit from cell production and at later stages of fruit growth. Final cell diameter in GG fruit cortex cells was 15% higher than that in 'Gala' indicating that enhanced fruit size in GG was facilitated by increased cell size. The normal progression of cell expansion in cells arrested in G2 may account for the increase in cell size. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated higher MdCDKA1 expression and reduced MdCYCA2 expression during early fruit development in GG fruits. Together, the data indicate an important role for cell expansion in regulating apple fruit size.
21111515,4,2010,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis, biological assessment and molecular modeling of new dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamides and dihydroquinoline-3-carbohydrazide derivatives as cholinesterase inhibitors, and Ca channel antagonists.,The synthesis, biological evaluation, and molecular modeling of new 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamides(4), 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-3-carbohydrazide (6), and some hexahydropyrimido[5,4-c]quinoline-2,5-diones (9) produced earlier by our laboratory, as AChE/BuChE inhibitors, is described. From these analyses compound 4c resulted equipotent regarding the inhibition of cholinesterases'; inhibitors 6k, 9a, 9b were selective for AChE, whereas product 4d proved selective for BuChE. Docking analysis has been carry out in order to identify the binding mode in the active site, and to explain the observed selectivities. Only compound 9a has been shown to decrease K(+)-induced calcium signals in bovine chromaffin cells.
20947350,4,2010,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis, antioxidant and toxicological study of novel pyrimido quinoline derivatives from 4-hydroxy-3-acyl quinolin-2-one.,A series of novel pyrimido and other fused quinoline derivatives like 4-methyl pyrimido [5,4-c]quinoline-2,5(1H,6H)-dione (4a), 4-methyl-2-thioxo-1,2-dihydropyrimido [5,4-c]quinoline-5(6H)-one (4b), 2-amino-4-methyl-1,2-dihydropyrimido [5,4-c]quinolin-5(6H)-one (4c), 3-methylisoxazolo [4,5-c]quinolin-4(5H)-one (4d), 3-methyl-1H-pyrazolo [4,3-c]quinoline-4(5H)-one (5e), 5-methyl-1H-[1,2,4] triazepino [6,5-c]quinoline-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (5f), 5-methyl-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-[1,2,4]triazepino [6,5-c]quinolin-6(7H)-one (5 g) were synthesized regioselectively from 4-hydroxy-3-acyl quinolin-2-one 3. They were screened for their in vitro antioxidant activities against radical scavenging capacity using DPPH(), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), total antioxidant activity by FRAP, superoxide radical (O(2)(°-)) scavenging activity, metal chelating activity and nitric oxide scavenging activity. Among the compounds screened, 4c and 5 g exhibited significant antioxidant activities.
20871647,4,2010,Acta Neurobiol Exp (Wars),Chronic intermittent hypoxia exposure induces memory impairment in growing rats.,The study was aimed to examine the effect of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) on spatial memory of growing rats and to explore the possible underlying mechanisms. Sixty two rats were trained to perform the 8-arm radial maze task and were divided into four groups: 2-week-CIH (2IH) 2-week-control (2C) 4-week-CIH (4IH) and 4-week-control (4C). There were more reference memory errors, working memory errors and total memory errors in 2IH and 4IH groups compared to the controls. The levels of 8-iso-Prostaglandin F(2-alpha) [8-ISO-PGF(2-alpha)] an in vivo marker for oxidative stress, in serum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were higher in CIH groups than the control groups. There were significant correlations between the levels of 8-ISO-PGF(2-alpha) and numbers of memory errors. The ultrastructural changes were evident in the hippocampal and prefrontal cortical tissues from the CIH groups. These results indicate that CIH can induce oxidative stress in brain tissues involved in spatial memory function.
20685659,4,2010,J Biol Chem,Serine- and arginine-rich proteins 55 and 75 (SRp55 and SRp75) induce production of HIV-1 vpr mRNA by inhibiting the 5'-splice site of exon 3.,HIV-1 non-coding exon 3 can either be spliced to exons 4, 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 to generate tat, rev, and nef mRNAs or remain unspliced to produce the 13a7 vpr mRNA. Here we show that serine- and arginine-rich proteins 55 and 75 (SRp55 and SRp75) inhibit splicing from the 5'-splice site of exon 3 thereby causing an accumulation of the partially unspliced 13a7 vpr mRNA. In contrast, serine- and arginine-rich protein 40 (SRp40) induces splicing from exon 3 to exon 4, thereby promoting the production of the 1347 tat mRNA. We demonstrate that SRp55 stimulates vpr mRNA production by interacting with the previously identified HIV-1 splicing enhancer named GAR and inhibiting its function. This inhibition requires both serine arginine-rich and RNA-binding domains of SRp55, indicating that production of HIV-1 vpr mRNA depends on the interaction of SRp55 with an unknown factor.
20572859,4,2010,Eur J Oral Sci,Towards a better understanding of dental anxiety and fear: cognitions vs. experiences.,Traumatic dental experiences are associated with dental anxiety and fear. However, many people with no dental fear have had negative dental experiences, and some people with considerable fear fail to recall any traumatic incidents. This study aimed to determine whether dental fear was better explained by experiences or by cognitive perceptions of going to the dentist as being uncontrollable, unpredictable, dangerous, and disgusting. A random sample of 1,084 Australian adults (response rate = 71.7%) completed a mailed questionnaire with measures of dental fear, perceptions of going to the dentist, and dental experiences. Perceptions of uncontrollability, unpredictability, dangerousness, and disgustingness had strong bivariate associations with scores on the Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF-4C). Vulnerability-related perceptions accounted for 46.3% of the variance in IDAF-4C scores beyond that accounted for by demographic variables and five possible dental experiences comprising intense pain, considerable discomfort, gagging, fainting, and having a personal problem with the dentist. In contrast, dental experiences accounted for &lt; 1% of the variance in IDAF-4C scores beyond that accounted for by the four cognitive perceptions. Perceptions of uncontrollability, unpredictability, dangerousness, and disgustingness were superior predictors of dental fear compared with negative dental experiences.
20510783,4,2010,Food Microbiol,Prevalence and contamination patterns of Listeria monocytogenes in catfish processing environment and fresh fillets.,Catfish skins, intestines, fresh fillets, processing surfaces at different production stages, chiller water and non-food contact surfaces were sampled for Listeria monocytogenes and other Listeria species. Among 315 samples, prevalence of L. monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and a group of Listeria seeligeri-Listeria welshimeri-Listeria ivanovii was 21.6, 13.0 and 29.5%, respectively. No Listeria grayi was detected in this survey. While no L. monocytogenes strains were isolated from catfish skins and intestines, the strains were found with a frequency of 76.7% in chilled fresh catfish fillets and 43.3% in unchilled fillets. L. monocytogenes and Listeria spp. were also detected in fish contact surfaces such as deheading machine, trimming board, chiller water, conveyor belts at different stages, and fillet weighing table. Among L. monocytogenes, 1/2b (47.0%), 3b (16.0%) and 4c (14%) were the predominant serotypes isolated, whereas 4b, 4e, 1/2c and 1/2a were detected at much lower frequencies. Genotype analyses of L. monocytogenes isolates using serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR revealed that chiller water represented an important contamination source of L. monocytogenes in the chilled catfish fillets of two processing facilities, whereas fillet weighing table significantly contributed to the catfish fillet contamination of the third facility. This study suggests that L. monocytogenes contamination in the processed catfish fillets originates from the processing environment, rather than directly from catfish. Results from this study can aid the catfish industry to develop a plant-specific proper cleaning and sanitation procedure for equipment and the processing environment designed to specifically target L. monocytogenes contamination.
20483611,4,2010,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,2' biaryl amides as novel and subtype selective M1 agonists. Part I: Identification, synthesis, and initial SAR.,Biaryl amides were discovered as novel and subtype selective M(1) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonists. The identification, synthesis, and initial structure-activity relationships that led to compounds 3j and 4c, possessing good M(1) agonist potency and intrinsic activity, and subtype selectivity for M(1) over M(2-5), are described.
20448539,4,2010,Obesity (Silver Spring),Quantitative magnetic resonance fat measurements in humans correlate with established methods but are biased.,Precision and accuracy of the quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) system for measuring fat in phantoms and total body fat (TBF) in humans were investigated. Measurements were made using phantoms: oil, beef with water, beef with oil, and humans with oil and water. TBF(QMR) in humans was compared with TBF by a four-compartment model (TBF(4C)). The coefficient of variation (CV) for replicate TBF(QMR) was 0.437%. QMR fat was lower at 23 °C vs. 37 °C. The fat increase in QMR phantom studies was consistent with the oil increase. When oil was added with humans, the increase in TBF(QMR) was &gt;250 g for the initial 250 g of oil. With additional oil increments, the increase in TBF(QMR) was consistent with the amount of oil added. When water was added with humans, the TBF(QMR) increased independent of the amount of water added. TBF(QMR) was significantly less (mean ± s.e.) than TBF(4C) (females: -0.68 ± 0.27 kg, males: -4.66 ± 0.62 kg; P = 0.0001), TBF(BV) (females: -1.90 ± 0.40 kg; males: -5.68 ± 0.75 kg; P = 0.0001), and TBF(D2O) for males, but greater for females (1.19 ± 0.43 kg vs. -3.69 ± 0.81 kg for males; P = 0.0003). TBF(QMR) was lower than TBF(iDXA) with the difference greater in males (P = 0.001) and decreased with age (P = 0.011). The strong linear relationships between TBF(QMR) and TBF(4C), TBF(BV), and TBF(D2O) with slopes consistent with unity suggest that modifications are required to improve the accuracy. Should the latter be accomplished, QMR holds promise as a highly precise, rapid, and safe, noninvasive method for estimating the amount of and changes in TBF in overweight and severely obese persons.
20352055,4,2010,Tetrahedron Lett,Gold-catalyzed Intermolecular [4C + 3C] Cycloaddition Reactions.,In the presence of the N-heterocyclic carbene gold catalyst (NHC-AuIPr, 7), propargyl esters 1a-f and 13 undergo a [4C + 3C] cycloaddition reaction with cyclopentadiene and furan under mild conditions. The evidence suggests the formation of the seven-membered ring occurs by a direct cycloaddition process, rather than a stepwise cyclopropanation/Cope rearrangement sequence.
20655626,3,2010,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and CYP24A1 inhibitory activity of (E)-2-(2-substituted benzylidene)- and 2-(2-substituted benzyl)-6-methoxy-tetralones.,A series of (E)-2-(2-substituted benzylidene)- and 2-(2-substituted benzyl)-6-methoxy-tetralones were prepared, using an efficient synthetic scheme, and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against cytochrome P450C24A1 (CYP24A1) hydroxylase. In general the reduced benzyl tetralones were more active than the parent benzylidene tetralones. The 2-ethyl and 2-trifluoromethyl benzyl tetralone derivatives (4c and 4b) showed optimal activity in this series with IC(50) values of 1.92 microM and 2.08 microM, respectively compared with the standard ketoconazole IC(50) 0.52 microM. The 2-bromobenzyl tetralone (4d) showed a preference for CYP27A1 (IC(50) 59 nM) over CYP24A1 (IC50 16.3 microM) and may be a useful lead in CYP27A1 inhibition studies. The 2-ethylphenyl benzyl derivative (9c), which showed weak activity against the wild type CYP24A1 (IC(50) 25.57 microM), exhibited enhanced inhibitory activity towards L148F and M416T mutants, this difference in activity for the L148F mutant has been explained using molecular modelling.
20639111,3,2010,Bioorg Med Chem,Novel anti-viability ceramide analogs: design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship studies of substituted (S)-2-(benzylideneamino)-3-hydroxy-N-tetradecylpropanamides.,A group of novel L-serinamides, substituted (S)-2-(benzylideneamino)-3-hydroxy-N-tetradecylpropanamides (3a-o) and substituted (S)-2-(benzylamino)-3-hydroxy-N-tetradecyl propanamides (4c, 4i, 4l, and 4o), were synthesized as potential anti-tumor lead compounds. In vitro cell viability assay results indicate treatment with 3a-o compounds resulted in significant inhibition of cell viability in the chemoresistant breast cancer cell line, MCF-7TN-R. Compounds 3i and 3l, both ortho-substituted analogs, show the greatest efficacy with IC50 values of 10.3 microM and 12.5 microM, respectively. The SAR analysis indicate that the imine functional group of 3a-o is critical for the cellular anti-viability effect, and the partial atomic charge (PAC) value of imine C atom is a valuable structural parameter for predicting the activity of these ceramide analogs.
20608741,3,2010,J Med Chem,Potent antagonist for the vitamin D receptor: vitamin D analogues with simple side chain structure.,We previously reported that 22S-butyl-25,26,27-trinor-1alpha,24-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) 2 was a potent VDR antagonist. The X-ray crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of VDR complexed with 2 indicated that this ligand induces an extra cavity within the ligand-binding pocket. The structure also showed that the ligand forms only poor hydrophobic interactions with helix 12 of the protein. Here, to study the effects of the induction of the extra cavity and of insufficient interactions with helix 12 on antagonism, we designed and synthesized a series of vitamin D(3) analogues with or without a 22-alkyl substituent and evaluated their biological potency. We found that the 22-butyl analogues 3c and 5c act as full antagonists, the 22-ethyl analogues 3b, 4b, 5b, and 22-butyl analogue 4c act as partial agonists, and the others (3a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 6b, and 6c) act as full agonists for VDR. It is intriguing that 6c is a potent agonist for VDR, whereas its 26,27-dinor analogue 5c is a potent antagonist. Analogue 6c recruited coactivator SRC-1 well, but 5c did not. These results indicate that a combination of induction of the extra cavity and insufficient hydrophobic interactions with helix 12 is important for VDR antagonism in this class of ligands.
20528055,3,2010,Psychol Assess,Development and psychometric evaluation of the Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF-4C+).,The measurement of dental fear is important due to its high prevalence and appreciable individual, clinical, and public health consequences. However, existing measures of dental anxiety and fear (DAF) have theoretical or practical limitations. This study describes the development and subsequent assessment of the reliability and validity of test scores of a new DAF scale for adults. The Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF-4C+) contains 3 modules that measure DAF, dental phobia, and feared dental stimuli. The final 8-item DAF module (IDAF-4C) assesses emotional, behavioral, physiological, and cognitive components of the anxiety and fear response. The proposed scale dimensionality received support from exploratory factor analysis. IDAF-4C items showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .94) and test-retest reliability at 4 months (r = .82), and the scale was strongly associated with other dental fear scales as well as with dental visiting patterns, avoidance of the dentist, and dental phobia diagnosis. The convergent and predictive validity of the IDAF-4C compared positively to Corah's (1969; Corah, Gale, &amp; Illig, 1978) Dental Anxiety Scale and a single-item measure of dental fear, and the scale predicted future dental visiting and visit perceptions. Both phobia and stimulus modules showed strong and statistically significant associations with DAF ratings. In all, sufficient evidence is provided to demonstrate that the new scale would be a useful tool to assess DAF in an adult population. The IDAF-4C+ is based on strong theoretical underpinnings, yet the scale is practical enough for application across a variety of potential uses.
20524426,3,2010,Acta Pol Pharm,Synthesis of novel 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.,Some new 3-acetyl-5-(3-chloro-1-benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)-2-substituted phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-oxadiazoles and 2-(3-chloro-1-benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)-5-substituted phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles have been synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial activity. Initially, 3-chloro-1-benzo[b]thiophene-2-carbonyl chloride (1) was prepared from cinnamic acid in the presence of chlorobenzene and thionyl chloride. This compound (1) was treated with hydrazine hydrate to afford 3-chloro-1-benzo[b]thiophene-2-carbohydrazine (2) which was further reacted with various aromatic aldehydes to yield hydrazones (3a-h). Further reaction of these hydrazones (3a-h) with acetic anhydride gave 3-acetyl-5-(3-chloro-1-benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)-2-substituted phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-oxadiazoles (4a-h). Reaction of the same compounds (3a-h) in the presence of chloramine-T afforded 2-(3-chloro-1-benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)-5-substituted phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles (5a-h). The structures of newly synthesized compounds (4a-h) and (5a-h) have been confirmed by spectroscopic techniques such as IR, 1H NMR and elemental analysis. All the compounds were screened for their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and for antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Asperigillus niger. The compounds exhibited significant antibacterial and moderate antifungal activities. Compounds 4c and 4e were found to be most potent with activities, even better than standard drug ciprofloxacin against S. aureus and B. subtilis.
20484832,3,2010,J Oleo Sci,Anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive effects of triterpene cinnamates and acetates from shea fat.,Four triterpene acetates, alpha-amyrin acetate (1a), beta-amyrin acetate (2a), lupeol acetate (3a), and butyrospermol acetate (4a), and four triterpene cinnamates, alpha-amyrin cinnamate (1c), beta-amyrin cinnamate (2c), lupeol cinnamate (3c), and butyrospermol cinnamate (4c), were isolated from the kernel fat (n-hexane extract) of the shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa; Sapotaceae). Upon evaluation of these eight triterpene esters for inhibitory activity against 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced inflammation (1 microg/ear) in mice, all of the compounds tested exhibited marked anti-inflammatory activity, with ID50 values in the range of 0.15-0.75 micromol/ear, and among which compound 3c showed the highest activity with ID(50) of 0.15 micromol/ear. Compound 3c (10 mg/kg) further exhibited anti-inflammatory activity on rat hind paw edema induced by carrageenan, with the percentage of inflammation at 1, 3, and 5 h of 35.4, 41.5, and 45.5%, respectively. The eight triterpene esters were then evaluated for their inhibitory effects on Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) in Raji cells as a primary screening test for inhibitors of tumor promoters. All the compounds showed moderate inhibitory effects. Furthermore, compound 3c exhibited inhibitory effect on skin tumor promotion in an in vivo two-stage carcinogenesis test using 7,12-dimethylbenz [a] anthracene (DMBA) as an initiator and TPA as a promoter. The biological activities of triterpene acetate and cinnamate esters, together with the exceptionally high levels of these triterpenes in shea fat, indicate that shea nuts and shea fat (shea butter) constitute a significant source of anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor promoting compounds.
20403339,3,2010,Brain Res,Instruction dependent activation during optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) stimulation: An FMRI study at 3T.,Modifying experimental conditions of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) result in different outcomes and may not optimally translate into clinical testing. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of subject instruction on the anatomical correlates of OKN. The instructions were to voluntarily look or stare at the same moving grating with fixed contrast and spatial and temporal frequencies. Look and stare OKN were generated under identical stimulus &quot;ON&quot; conditions (vertical sine wave grating of 1.14c/deg drifting right to left at 11.4c/s with binocular viewing). FMRI was undertaken utilizing a 3.0T GE system and the BOLD technique. Subjects included 6 normal adults ranging in age from 18 to 54 years with normal visual acuity (20/20 or better) and normal stereoacuity (40s of arc or better). The results reveal that look OKN generated significantly more cortical FMRI activation than stare OKN. Look OKN areas included the culmen, parahippocampal, lingual, middle temporal gyri, inferior and superior parietal lobules and precuneus, all of which were unilaterally activated in the left hemisphere. The middle occipital gyrus was unilaterally activated in the right hemisphere while the cuneus was bilaterally activated. These results show that the activation sites for OKN studies are dependent on subject instruction which influence the type of OKN generated. Specifically, voluntary look OKN involved more brain sites than stare OKN. In so doing, we illustrate the importance of subject instruction and recommend that FMRI investigators of OKN be cognizant of these effects. The anatomical correlates of the look versus stare are discussed.
20395150,3,2010,Bioorg Med Chem,Antitumor activity and COMPARE analysis of bis-indole derivatives.,This paper reports the synthesis of new derivatives (formed by two indole systems separated by a central moiety) analogous of potent antitumor agents previously described. The activity of the bis-indoles bearing a pyridine core confirms the good result described in the previous paper and compound 4c was chosen for the first in vivo experiment (Hollow Fiber Assay). COMPARE analysis and structure-activity relationships were also considered. Contrary to data reported by other Authors, no correlations were found between antitumor activity and NQO1 induction.
20166180,3,2010,J Med Virol,Analysis of hepatitis C virus strains circulating in Republic of the Congo.,The aim of this study was to assess the seroprevalence, viremia, genotype distribution, and demographic history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the Republic of the Congo. Testing was carried out on sera samples collected in 2005 from 807 Bantus belonging to the Kongo, Teke, and Ngala subgroups and 80 Pygmies. Positive HCV serology was found in 50 (5.6%) individuals including 31 (60%) who were viremic. Seroprevalence increased with age with a cutoff at 50 years: 2.8% &lt;50 versus 12% &gt;50. Twenty-one strains belonged to four described subtypes, that is, 4c in eight cases, 4h in two, 4k in three, and 4r in eight. Ten strains could not be assigned to any known subtype and may represent six new variants, that is, subtype 4 in five cases and subtype 2 in one. Evolutionary analysis of subtype 4c and 4r sequences indicated a period of enhanced transmission in the mid-twentieth century probably due to iatrogenic causes. This study underlines the high genetic diversity of strains in the Republic of the Congo with nine subtypes 4 and one subtype 2.
20134171,3,2010,Med Princ Pract,Polymorphisms in NOS3, ACE and PAI-1 genes and risk of spontaneous recurrent miscarriage in the Gaza Strip.,OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate the correlation between spontaneous recurrent miscarriage (RM) and common polymorphisms in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and endothelium-derived nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) genes among women experiencing RM in the Gaza Strip.METHODS: The presence of these genetic profiles was determined for 100 women who had had at least 3 constitutive abortions and 100 controls without any history of abortion using molecular biological techniques.RESULTS: The ACE D/D polymorphism was present in 49% of the study population and in 54% of the controls (p = 0.479). Similarly, there was no significant difference detected in the distribution of polymorphisms for PAI-1, with the 4G/4G genotype present in the study group and in controls (p = 1.00). NOS3 4a/4a was present in 4% of the study group and in none of the 100 controls (p = 0.123). In this study, we also discovered a new variant in the NOS3 gene which was named 4c allele and was encountered in 1 patient and in 1 control subject.CONCLUSION: There was no significant association between ACE I/D, PAI-1 4G/5G and NOS3 4a/4b and the occurrence of first-trimester RM. In-depth investigation of the association of NOS3 4a/4a with RM is strongly recommended.
20091072,3,2010,J Biol Inorg Chem,Rhodium(III) and iridium(III) complexes with 1,2-naphthoquinone-1-oximate as a bidentate ligand: synthesis, structure, and biological activity.,The synthesis and characterization of three novel iridium(III) complexes and one rhodium(III) complex with 1-nitroso-2-naphthol (3) chelating as a 1,2-naphthoquinone-1-oximato ligand are described. The reaction of mu(2)-halogenido-bridged dimers [(eta(5)-C(5)Me(5))IrX(2)](2) [X is Cl (1a), Br (1b), I (1c)] and [(eta(5)-C(5)Me(5))RhCl(2)](2) (2a) with 3 in CH(2)Cl(2) yields the mononuclear complexes (eta(5)-C(5)Me(5))IrX(eta(2)-C(10)H(6)N(2)O) (4a, 4b, 4c) and (eta(5)-C(5)Me(5))RhCl(eta(2)-C(10)H(6)N(2)O) (5a). All compounds were characterized by their (1)H and (13)C NMR, IR, and mass spectra, UV/vis spectra were recorded for 4a and 5a. The X-ray structure analyses revealed a pseudo-octahedral &quot;piano-stool&quot; configuration for the metals with bidentate coordination through oximato-N and naphthoquinone-O, forming a nearly planar five-membered metallacycle. The metal complexes 4a and 5a were evaluated in respect to their cytotoxicity and binding affinity toward double-stranded DNA. As determined in the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, both exerted a much stronger cytotoxic effect toward HeLa and HL60 cancer cell lines than did cisplatin. The remarkable cytotoxicity of the compounds tested may be attributed to necrosis, rather than to apoptosis, as it is evidenced by the caspase-3/7 activation assay. No clear evidence was found for interaction with double-stranded DNA. The melting experiments showed no significant differences between thermodynamic parameters of intact DNA and DNA incubated with 3, 4a, or 5a, although these derivatives altered DNA recognition by the BamHI restriction enzyme. Therefore, the screened iridium and rhodium complexes 4a and 5a may still be interesting as potential anticancer drugs owing to their high cytotoxicity toward cancer cell lines, whereas they do not modify DNA in a way similar to that of cisplatin.
20065958,3,2010,Int J Obes (Lond),Evaluation of DXA against the four-component model of body composition in obese children and adolescents aged 5-21 years.,BACKGROUND: Body composition is increasingly measured in pediatric obese patients. Although dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is widely available, and is precise, its accuracy for body composition assessment in obese children remains untested.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate DXA against the four-component (4C) model in obese children and adolescents in both cross-sectional and longitudinal contexts.DESIGN: Body composition was measured by DXA (Lunar Prodigy) and the 4C model in 174 obese individuals aged 5-21 years, of whom 66 had a second measurement within 1.4 years. The Bland-Altman method was used to assess agreement between techniques for baseline body composition and change therein.RESULTS: A significant minority of individuals (n=21) could not be scanned successfully due to their large size. At baseline, in 153 individuals with complete data, DXA significantly overestimated fat mass (FM; Delta=0.9, s.d. 2.1 kg, P&lt;0.0001) and underestimated lean mass (LM; Delta=-1.0, s.d. 2.1 kg, P&lt;0.0001). Multiple regression analysis showed that gender, puberty status, LM and FM were associated with the magnitude of the bias. In the longitudinal study of 51 individuals, the mean bias in change in fat or LM did not differ significantly from zero (FM: Delta=-0.02, P=0.9; LM: Delta=0.04, P=0.8), however limits of agreement were wide (FM: +/-3.2 kg; LM: +/-3.0 kg). The proportion of variance in the reference values explained by DXA was 76% for change in FM and 43% for change in LM.CONCLUSIONS: There are limitations to the accuracy of DXA using Lunar Prodigy for assessing body composition or changes therein in obese children. The causes of differential bias include variability in the magnitude of tissue masses, and stage of pubertal development. Further work is required to evaluate this scenario for other DXA models and manufacturers.
21167238,2,2010,Peptides,Distribution of substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in pseudocapsules of uterine fibroids.,The authors examined the presence of Substance P (SP) and Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) and their related fibers in the pseudocapsule of uterine fibroids (PUF) and in normal myometrium (NM) during myomectomies in 57 non-pregnant women. 4 samples were removed from the normal myometrium (NM) and from PUF. The samples were sent for histological and immune-fluorescent investigations. SP and VIP values were found non-significantly higher in PUF than in NM: SP values were 10.2±0.1 conventional units (C.U.) in PUF at the fundus of the uterus (FU) vs. 8.1±0.6C.U. of NM in the FU (p&gt;0.05), and SP values were 25.1±0.9C.U. in PUF in the uterine body (UB) compared to. 23.2±1.4C.U. of NM in the myometrium of the UB (p&gt;0.05). VIP values were 11.5±0.9C.U. in the PUF in FU compared to 9.8±1.4C.U. of NM in the FU (p&gt;0.05), and VIP values were 33.9±3.9C.U. in the PUF in the UB vs. 32.6±4.8C.U. of the NM in the UB (p&gt;0.05). These findings show that SP and VIP neurofibers are present in the fibroid pseudocapsule, similar to the values in the normal myometrium of a non-pregnant uterus. An intracapsular myoma excision which respects the pseudocapsule permits a physiological healing process of the uterine scar, due to a neurotransmitter sparing at the hysterotomic site. In women planning pregnancy, the myomectomy should be preferably performed respecting the pseudocapsule in order to preserve the neurotransmission.
21051298,2,2010,Mol Oncol,Spatio-temporal composition of the mitotic Chromosomal Passenger Complex detected using in situ proximity ligation assay.,Cell division is orchestrated by a complex protein network that aims to maintenance of genomic stability. Visualisation of mitotic protein-protein associations in space and time has been limited due to the lack of proper biochemical and easy-to-use imaging tools. Here we report adaptation of the in situ proximity ligation assay (is-PLA) to study mitotic protein interactions with spatio-temporal resolution. We examined the composition of the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) at various mitotic phases and after chemical treatments using is-PLA with antibodies against the core CPC subunits Aurora B, INCENP, Survivin and Borealin. Our results support the notion that the core CPC functions as a single structural unit at centromeres in early mitosis and at central spindle after the onset of anaphase. Treatment of cells with the Aurora B inhibitor ZM447439 diminished the is-PLA signals at centromeres suggesting that Aurora B activity contributes to structural maintenance and/or proper subcellular localization of the core CPC. Is-PLA-based analysis of interaction between INCENP and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) proposes that the kinase co-travels with CPC during late mitosis. The data illustrates both the strengths and limitations of the is-PLA in the analysis of mitotic macromolecule associations at sub-organelle level.
20929233,2,2010,J Agric Food Chem,Synthesis, fungicidal activity, and structure-activity relationship of 2-oxo- and 2-hydroxycycloalkylsulfonamides.,To explore new potential fungicides, a series of novel compounds, including 11 2-oxocycloalkylsulfonamide (3) and 21 2-hydroxycycloalkylsulfonamide (4) derivatives, were synthesized and their structures were confirmed by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR), and elemental analysis. The results of the bioassay showed that the compounds 3 and 4 possessed excellent fungicidal activity against Botrytis cinerea Pers. both in vitro and in vivo. The fungicidal activity of the compounds with 7- or 8-membered rings is better than those with 5-, 6-, or 12-membered rings. According to the results of the mycelium growth rate test, the EC50 values of the compounds 3C, 4C, 3D, and 4D were 0.80, 0.85, 1.22, and 1.09 μg/mL, respectively, and similar to or better than commercial fungicide procymidone. The bioassay results of spore germination indicated that most of the compounds exhibited obvious inhibitory effects against B. cinerea and the inhibition rates of 2-oxocycloalkylsulfonamides were higher than 2-hydroxycycloalkylsulfonamides, among them. The EC50 values of compounds 3A, 3B17, 3E, and 4A were 4.21, 4.21 3.24, and 5.29 μg/mL, respectively. Those compounds containing 5- or 6-membered rings showed better activity than those containing 7-, 8-, or 12-membered rings. Furthermore, the results of the pot culture test showed that almost all of the compounds had effective control activity in vivo and 2-hydroxycycloalkylsulfonamides were obviously superior to 2-oxocycloalkylsulfonamides. The compounds 3E, 4C and 4D presented higher control efficacy than procymidone and pyrimethanil against gray mold disease on cucumber plants.
20925363,2,2010,J Org Chem,Dual reactivity of hydroxy- and methoxy- substituted o-quinone methides in aqueous solutions: hydration versus tautomerization.,4-Hydroxy-6-methylene-2,4-cyclohexadien-1-one (1) and 4-methoxy-6-methylene-2,4-cyclohexadien-1-one (2) were generated by efficient (Φ = 0.3) photodehydration of 2-(hydroxymethyl)benzene-1,4-diol (3a) and 2-(hydroxymethyl)-4-methoxyphenol (4a), respectively. o-Quinone methides 1 and 2 can be quantitatively trapped as Diels-Alder adducts with ethyl vinyl ether or intercepted by good nucleophiles, such as azide ion (k(N3)(1) = 3.15 × 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) and k(N3)(2) = 3.30 × 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)). In aqueous solution, o-quinone methide 2 rapidly adds water to regenerate starting material (τ(H(2)O)(2) = 7.8 ms at 25 °C). This reaction is catalyzed by specific acid (k(H(+))(2) = 8.37 × 10(3) s(-1) M(-1)) and specific base (k(OH(-))(2) = 1.08 × 10(4) s(-1) M(-1)) but shows no significant general acid/base catalysis. In sharp contrast, o-quinone methide 1 decays (τ(H(2)O)(1) = 3.3 ms at 25 °C) via two competing pathways: nucleophilic hydration to form starting material 3a and tautomerization to produce methyl-p-benzoquinone. The disappearance of 1 shows not only specific acid (k(H(+))(1) = 3.30 × 10(4) s(-1) M(-1)) and specific base catalysis (k(OH(-))(1) = 3.51 × 10(4) s(-1) M(-1)) but pronounced catalysis by general acids and bases as well. The o-quinone methides 1 and 2 were also generated by the photolysis of 2-(ethoxymethyl)benzene-1,4-diol (3b) and 2-(ethoxymethyl)-4-methoxyphenol (4b), as well as from (2,5-dihydroxy-1-phenyl)methyl- (3c) and (2-hydroxy-5-methoxy-1-phenyl)methyltrimethylammonium iodides (4c). Short-lived (τ(25°)(C) ≈ 20 μs) precursors of o-quinone methides 1 and 2 were detected in the laser flash photolysis of 3a,b and 4a,b. On the basis of their reactivity, benzoxete structures have been assigned to these intermediates.
20716468,2,2010,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis, cytotoxic activities and DNA binding properties of β-carboline derivatives.,In a continuing effort to develop novel β-carbolines endowed with better pharmacological profile, a series of water-soluble β-carbolines bearing a flexible amino side chain was designed and synthesized, and the cytotoxic activities in vitro of these compounds were evaluated. The N(9)-arylated alkyl substituted β-carbolines represented the most interesting cytotoxic agents, and compounds 4c and 4d were found to be the most potent compounds with IC(50) values lower than 10 μM against ten human tumor cell lines. The results confirmed that the N(9)-arylated alkyl substituents of β-carboline played a very important role in the modulation of the cytotoxic potencies. In addition, the interaction with DNA of these compounds was also investigated, these compounds were found to exhibit significant DNA binding affinity.
20676983,2,2010,Methods Mol Biol,A modified inverse PCR procedure for insertion, deletion, or replacement of a DNA fragment in a target sequence and its application in the ligand interaction scan method for generation of ligand-regulated proteins.,Functional analysis of a protein of interest, by generation of functional alterations in a target protein, often requires the performance of site-directed mutagenesis within the gene sequence. These manipulations are usually performed using &quot;cut and paste&quot; techniques, combined with PCR. Here we describe a simple and general procedure to specifically insert a DNA fragment into any site within a given DNA sequence. We demonstrate this insertional mutagenesis by describing the insertion of a tetracysteine (4C) hexapeptide-encoding sequence into the coding sequence of the antibiotic hydrolyzing enzyme TEM-1 beta-lactamase. This procedure could also be applied to insert different DNA sequences or to replace, or delete, existing fragments in a given gene. We have recently used this procedure to develop a general method (ligand interaction scan - LIScan) to generate ligand-regulated proteins.
20675142,2,2010,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis, activity, and pharmacokinetic properties of a series of conformationally-restricted thiourea analogs as novel hepatitis C virus inhibitors.,A series of novel conformationally-restricted thiourea analogs were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their anti-HCV activity. Herein we report the synthesis, structure-activity relationships (SARs), and pharmacokinetic properties of this new class of thiourea compounds that showed potent inhibitory activities against HCV in the cell-based subgenomic HCV replicon assay. Among compounds tested, the fluorene compound 4b was found to possess the most potent activity (EC(50)=0.3 microM), lower cytotoxicity (CC(50)&gt;50 microM), and significantly better pharmacokinetic properties compared to its corresponding fluorenone compound 4c.
20664848,2,2010,Dalton Trans,Amidinate aluminium complexes: synthesis, characterization and ring-opening polymerization of rac-lactide.,A series of aluminium alkyl complexes {PhC(NR')(NR'')}AlR(2) (4a-n, R' = 2,6-(i)Pr(2)C(6)H(3), 2,6-Me(2)C(6)H(3); R'' = aryl groups with various ortho-, para- or meta-substituents, tert-butyl; R = methyl, ethyl) bearing non-symmetrically N-substituted benzamidinate ligands were synthesized via the reaction of trialkylaluminium and the corresponding benzamidine proligands. Complex 5 bearing symmetric amidinate ligand was also obtained for comparison purposes. The X-ray diffraction studies of complexes 4b, 4c and 5 show in each case a distorted tetrahedral geometry around the aluminium center. All the amidinate aluminium complexes were found to catalyze the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of rac-lactide with moderate activities. The steric and electronic characteristics of the ancillary ligands have a significant influence on the polymerization performance of the corresponding aluminium complexes. The introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents at the ortho-positions of N-phenyl ring of the ligands resulted in an obvious increase in catalytic activity. Complex 4b showed the highest activity among the investigated aluminium complexes due to the high electrophilicity of the metal center induced by the ortho-chloro substituents on the phenyl ring. The existence of ortho-substituents of small steric bulkiness is also beneficial for the increase of activity of these catalysts. However, further increase of steric hindrance of the ligands by introducing bulky ortho-substituents onto the phenyl moieties resulted in a decrease of activity and an increase in the isotactic bias of the obtained polylactides. The broad molecular weight distributions (PDI = 1.13-2.02) of the polymer samples indicated that the ROP of rac-lactide initiated by these complexes was not well-controlled.
20649064,2,2010,J Med Assoc Thai,Biopsy rate and positive predictive value for breast cancer in BI-RADS category 4 breast lesions.,OBJECTIVE: To examine the biopsy rate and positive predictive value (PPV) for breast cancer in lesions categorized as BI-RADS (Breast Imaging reporting and Data System) category 4.MATERIAL AND METHOD: The medical records of patients with BIRADS 4 breast lesion diagnosed at the breast diagnostic center Ramathibodi Hospital between December 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. PPV was calculated for patients who had biopsy performed or had clinical follow-up for at least two years. The radiographic and pathological findings were compared.RESULTS: The biopsy rate of 536 lesions categorized as BI-RADS 4 was 75% (403 of 536). Malignancy was found in 95 of 460 patients; or a PPV of 21%, PPVs for subcategories 4A, 4B and 4C, were 9%, 21% and 57%, respectively. The most common malignancy was invasive ductal carcinoma (67%). Patients with advanced age, having a clinically palpable breast mass of large size, with mammographic findings of architectural distortion and asymmetrical density were significantly associated with a higher risk of breast cancer.CONCLUSION: PPV for malignancy in the present study was comparable to previous studies. In subcategories 4B and 4C, the malignancy rate was higher than that in subcategory 4A.
20599776,2,2010,Biochem Pharmacol,Inactivation by Hg2+ and methylmercury of the glutamine/amino acid transporter (ASCT2) reconstituted in liposomes: Prediction of the involvement of a CXXC motif by homology modelling.,The effect of HgCl(2), methylmercury and mersalyl on the glutamine/amino acid (ASCT2) transporter reconstituted in liposomes has been studied. Mercuric compounds externally added to the proteoliposomes, inhibited the glutamine/glutamine antiport catalyzed by the reconstituted transporter. Similar effects were observed by pre-treating the proteoliposomes with the mercurials and then removing unreacted compounds before the transport assay. The inhibition was reversed by DTE, cysteine and N-acetyl-cysteine but not by S-carboxymethyl-cysteine. The data demonstrated that the inhibition was due to covalent reaction of mercuric compounds with Cys residue(s) of the transporter. The IC(50) of the transporter for HgCl(2), methylmercury and mersalyl, were 1.4+/-0.10, 2.4+/-0.16 or 3.1+/-0.19 microM, respectively. Kinetic studies of the inhibition showed that the reagents behaved as non-competitive inhibitor. The presence of glutamine or Na(+) during the incubation of the mercuric compounds with the proteoliposomes did not exerted any protective effect on the inhibition. None of the compounds was transported by the reconstituted transporter. A metal binding motif CXXC has been predicted as possible site of interaction of the mercuric compounds with the transporter on the basis of the homology structural model of ASCT2 obtained using the glutamate transporter homologue from Pyrococcus horikoshii as template.
20460950,2,2010,Stereotact Funct Neurosurg,Using Monte-Carlo-simulated radiation transport to calculate dose distribution in rats before irradiation with Leksell Gamma Knife 4C: technical note.,BACKGROUND: Gamma knife surgery (GKS) is used at subnecrotic doses for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) treatment. Rat models of TLE have been used to probe the mechanisms underlying GKS. Previous GKS studies on rats have used the Leksell GammaPlan (LGP) treatment planning system to determine the irradiation time to achieve the dose to deliver. Since LGP is not designed for such small structures, it is important to calibrate the system for the rat brain.METHODS: We have used a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) radiation transport scheme, with CT data as anatomical and tissue-specific information, to simulate the dose distribution in a rat brain when using a Leksell Gamma Knife.RESULTS: We show how dose distributions obtained by MCS quantitatively compare to those predicted by LGP, and discuss whether LGP should be used for studies involving rats. The energy deposited when using the 4-mm collimators was calculated for targets on both sides of the rat brain in the dorsal hippocampus, which allowed us to determine the exact time to irradiate rats with a given dose.CONCLUSION: The MCS method used in this study can easily be used for future GKS studies on small animals when accurate dose distributions are required.
20449149,2,2010,Dalton Trans,Synthesis, structural characterisation and anti-proliferative activity of NHC gold amino acid and peptide conjugates.,We report the synthesis of new NHC gold(I) and NHC gold(III) halide, amino acid and dipeptide complexes. Transmetallation of the N-phenylalanine-substituted NHC silver complex 3 with Me2SAuCl yields the phenylalanine-NHC gold(I) conjugate 4a. Halide exchange with LiBr and oxidation of 4a with Br2 in CH2Cl2 yields the phenylalanine-NHC Au(I) and Au(III) bromides 4b and 4c, respectively. Reaction of N-Boc protected cysteine methyl ester (Boc-Cys-OMe) or the dipeptide N-Boc-Leu-Cys-OMe with the NHC gold chloride 6a yields the (NHC)Au-S complexed amino acid and dipeptide derivatives 8 and 9. The NHC gold(III) complexes 4c and 6c were characterised by single crystal X-ray analysis. All of the tested gold carbene complexes showed significant anti-tumor activity on the HeLa, HepG2 and HT-29 cancer cell lines. The best compounds show activity comparable to the well-known anti-cancer drug cisplatin. There seems to be no clear cut structure-activity relationship in the compounds tested, nor did we observe a dependence on the metal oxidation state or the different halide substituents. Given the ease of preparation, stability and high activity of the compounds described herein, it may be possible to design tumor-specific anti-cancer agents based on NHC gold amino acid conjugates in the future.
20439329,2,2010,J Med Ethics,Scientific dishonesty--questionnaire to doctoral students in Sweden.,
20430485,2,2010,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel series of 2,2-bisaminomethylated aurone analogues as anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial agents.,This is the first report on aurones as a new class of drugs with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial agents. A series of 2,2-bisaminomethylated aurone analogues (4a-j) were synthesized by Mannich reaction from 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene in three steps. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, (1)H NMR and mass spectral analysis. All the synthesized compounds were screened against the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6) and antimicrobial (antibacterial and antifungal) activity. Compounds 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, and 4e showed promising results against IL-6 at 10 microM concentration (74-100%). Compounds 4a, 4b and 4c were found to be active against TNF-alpha (76-100%) at 10 microM. Interestingly, all compounds have shown good antimicrobial activity. Compounds 4d, 4e and 4f showed excellent antimicrobial activity as compared with standard drugs.
20388574,2,2010,Int J Food Microbiol,Isolation and characterization of Listeria monocytogenes from commercial asazuke (Japanese light pickles).,Asazuke is a ready-to-eat Japanese light pickle, mainly made of vegetables which are known to be one of the sources of Listeria monocytogenes contamination. Although asazuke is a popular side-dish in Japan, the hazard of bacterial contamination has not been evaluated yet. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of L. monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) and coliforms in 108 asazuke samples that randomly collected from supermarkets in Obihiro (Hokkaido prefecture, Japan) during the period of June to November 2007. Twelve (11.11%) L. monocytogenes were isolated with predominant serotype 4b (seven isolates) followed by 1/2a (two isolates), 1/2b, 3b and 4c (one isolate each) while Salmonella spp., VTEC and coliforms were not detected. All L. monocytogenes isolates demonstrated hemolytic activity by CAMP test and possessed all the virulence-associated genes (prfA, actA, mpl, inlA, inlC, plcA, plcB, hly, iap, clpC and opuCA) as resulted in PCR, thus revealed their potential pathogenicity. Moreover, 7 out of 12 isolates were from asazuke samples produced by the same factory and their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles suggested that 6 of them were indistinguishable and one was different. L. monocytogenes contamination in the asazuke factory environment was further investigated and 23 out of 60 environmental swabs (38.33%) contained the bacterium. Comparison of PFGE profiles showed relatedness between food and environmental isolates indicating that contamination probably occurred in the asazuke factory during manufacturing. Interestingly, after HACCP training course conducted to the factory workers, 20 samples collected during the period of November to December 2008 were negative to L. monocytogenes revealing that the hygienic status has improved.
20372103,2,2010,J Vis Exp,Quantification of gammaH2AX foci in response to ionising radiation.,DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are induced by either endogenous metabolic processes or by exogenous sources, are one of the most critical DNA lesions with respect to survival and preservation of genomic integrity. An early response to the induction of DSBs is phosphorylation of the H2A histone variant, H2AX, at the serine-139 residue, in the highly conserved C-terminal SQEY motif, forming gammaH2AX(1). Following induction of DSBs, H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated by the phosphatidyl-inosito 3-kinase (PIKK) family of proteins, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-protein kinase catalytic subunit and ATM and RAD3-related (ATR)(2). Typically, only a few base-pairs (bp) are implicated in a DSB, however, there is significant signal amplification, given the importance of chromatin modifications in DNA damage signalling and repair. Phosphorylation of H2AX mediated predominantly by ATM spreads to adjacent areas of chromatin, affecting approximately 0.03% of total cellular H2AX per DSB(2,3). This corresponds to phosphorylation of approximately 2000 H2AX molecules spanning approximately 2 Mbp regions of chromatin surrounding the site of the DSB and results in the formation of discrete gammaH2AX foci which can be easily visualized and quantitated by immunofluorescence microscopy(2). The loss of gammaH2AX at DSB reflects repair, however, there is some controversy as to what defines complete repair of DSBs; it has been proposed that rejoining of both strands of DNA is adequate however, it has also been suggested that re-instatement of the original chromatin state of compaction is necessary(4-8). The disappearence of gammaH2AX involves at least in part, dephosphorylation by phosphatases, phosphatase 2A and phosphatase 4C(5,6). Further, removal of gammaH2AX by redistribution involving histone exchange with H2A.Z has been implicated(7,8). Importantly, the quantitative analysis of gammaH2AX foci has led to a wide range of applications in medical and nuclear research. Here, we demonstrate the most commonly used immunofluorescence method for evaluation of initial DNA damage by detection and quantitation of gammaH2AX foci in gamma-irradiated adherent human keratinocytes(9).
20362442,2,2010,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Cytotoxicity against KB and NCI-H187 cell lines of modified flavonoids from Kaempferia parviflora.,Flavones 1-4 isolated from Kaempferia parviflora were used for structural modification. Sixteen flavonoid derivatives, including four new derivatives, were synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxicity against KB and NCI-H187 cell lines. Flavanones 2a-4a demonstrated higher cytotoxic activity than the parent compounds. Cytotoxicity against KB cell line of oxime 1c was about 7 times higher than the ellipticine standard. Interestingly, oximes 1c and 2c exhibited highly potent cytotoxicity against NCI-H187 cell line with IC(50) values of 0.014 and 0.23 microM, respectively. Oximes 4c and 5c showed strong cytotoxicity against NCI-H187 cell line with IC(50) values of 4.04 and 2.32 microM, respectively.
20307312,2,2010,Nutr Metab (Lond),Accuracy of DXA in estimating body composition changes in elite athletes using a four compartment model as the reference method.,BACKGROUND: Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) provides an affordable and practical assessment of multiple whole body and regional body composition. However, little information is available on the assessment of changes in body composition in top-level athletes using DXA. The present study aimed to assess the accuracy of DXA in tracking body composition changes (relative fat mass [%FM], absolute fat mass [FM], and fat-free mass [FFM]) of elite male judo athletes from a period of weight stability to prior to a competition, compared to a four compartment model (4C model), as the criterion method.METHODS: A total of 27 elite male judo athletes (age, 22.2 +/- 2.8 yrs) athletes were evaluated. Measures of body volume by air displacement plethysmography, bone mineral content assessed by DXA, and total-body water assessed by deuterium dilution were used in a 4C model. Statistical analyses included examination of the coefficient of determinant (r2), standard error of estimation (SEE), slope, intercept, and agreement between models.RESULTS: At a group level analysis, changes in %FM, FM, and FFM estimates by DXA were not significantly different from those by the 4C model. Though the regression between DXA and the 4C model did not differ from the line of identity DXA %FM, FM, and FFM changes only explained 29%, 36%, and 38% of the 4C reference values, respectively. Individual results showed that the 95% limits of agreement were -3.7 to 5.3 for %FM, -2.6 to 3.7 for FM, and -3.7 to 2.7 for FFM. The relation between the difference and the mean of the methods indicated a significant trend for %FM and FM changes with DXA overestimating at the lower ends and underestimating at the upper ends of FM changes.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that both at group and individual levels DXA did not present an expected accuracy in tracking changes in adiposity in elite male judo athletes.
20233086,2,2010,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Sulfonamide derivatives of thiazolidin-4-ones with anticonvulsant activity against two seizure models: synthesis and pharmacological evaluation.,A series of 4-thiazolidinones bearing a sulfonamide group (4a-w) were prepared by cyclizing various 5-bromo-2-methoxy-N'-[(1E)-arylmethylene/arylethylidene]benzenesulfonohydrazides. All the compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, and elemental analysis. The compounds were tested for their anticonvulsant activity utilizing MES and scPTZ animal models. The majority of the compounds exhibited significant activity against both animal models; however, compounds 4c, 4m, and 4o displayed promising activity and could be considered as leads for further investigations.
20206644,2,2010,Steroids,Studies on novel D-ring substituted steroidal pyrazolines as potential anticancer agents.,An efficient and facile synthesis of 17-pyrazolinyl derivatives of pregnenolone and their evaluation as potential anticancer agents against various human cancer cell lines are reported. The scheme involves the transformation of the starting pregnenolone acetate into pregnenolone, conversion of pregnenolone to the corresponding benzylidine derivatives and finally the conversion of this derivative to the stable steroidal 17-pyrazoline. Various compounds 4b, 4c, 4e, 4f, 4h and 4j showed significant cytotoxic activity especially against HT-29, HCT-15, 502713 cell lines.
20124685,2,2010,Acta Crystallogr C,Seven 3-methylidene-1H-indol-2(3H)-ones related to the multiple-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib.,The solid-state structures of a series of seven substituted 3-methylidene-1H-indol-2(3H)-one derivatives have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and are compared in detail. Six of the structures {(3Z)-3-(1H-pyrrol-2-ylmethylidene)-1H-indol-2(3H)-one, C(13)H(10)N(2)O, (2a); (3Z)-3-(2-thienylmethylidene)-1H-indol-2(3H)-one, C(13)H(9)NOS, (2b); (3E)-3-(2-furylmethylidene)-1H-indol-2(3H)-one monohydrate, C(13)H(9)NO(2).H(2)O, (3a); 3-(1-methylethylidene)-1H-indol-2(3H)-one, C(11)H(11)NO, (4a); 3-cyclohexylidene-1H-indol-2(3H)-one, C(14)H(15)NO, (4c); and spiro[1,3-dioxane-2,3'-indolin]-2'-one, C(11)H(11)NO(3), (5)} display, as expected, intermolecular hydrogen bonding (N-H...O=C) between the 1H-indol-2(3H)-one units. However, methyl 3-(1-methylethylidene)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-1-carboxylate, C(13)H(13)NO(3), (4b), a carbamate analogue of (4a) lacking an N-H bond, displays no intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The structure of (4a) contains three molecules in the asymmetric unit, while (4b) and (4c) both contain two independent molecules.
21580440,2,2010,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,Bis(oxonium) tetra-kis(o-toluidinium) cyclo-hexa-phosphate.,In the title compound, 4C(7)H(10)N(+)·2H(3)O(+)·P(6)O(18) (6-), the complete cyclo-hexa-phosphate anion is generated by crystallographic inversion symmetry. In the crystal, the H(3)O(+) ions and the [P(6)O(18)](6-) anions are linked by O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, generating infinite layers lying parallel to the ab plane at z = 1/2. These layers are inter-connected by the organic cations, which establish N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds with the [P(6)O(18)](6-) anions.
21135954,1,2010,Metallomics,Novel benzyl-substituted N-heterocyclic carbene-silver acetate complexes: synthesis, cytotoxicity and antibacterial studies.,From the reaction of 1-methylimidazole (1a), 4,5-dichloro-1H-imidazole (1b(I)) and 1-methylbenzimidazole (1c) with p-cyanobenzyl bromide (2a), non-symmetrically substituted N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) [(3a-c)] precursors, 5,6-dimethyl-1H-benzimidazole (1d) and 4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazole (1e) with p-cyanobenzyl bromide (2a) and benzyl bromide (2b), symmetrically substituted N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) [(3d-f)] precursors were synthesised. These NHC-precursors were then reacted with silver(i) acetate to yield the NHC-silver complexes (1-methyl-3-(4-cyanobenzyl)imidazole-2-ylidene)silver(i)acetate (4a), (4,5-dichloro-1-(4-cyanobenzyl)-3-methyl)imidazole-2-ylidene)silver(i)acetate (4b), (1-methyl-3-(4-cyanobenzyl)benzimidazole-2-ylidene)silver(i)acetate (4c), (1,3-bis(4-cyanobenzyl)5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole-2-ylidene) silver(i) acetate (4d), (1,3-dibenzyl-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole-2-ylidene) silver(i) acetate (4e) and (1,3-dibenzyl-4,5-diphenylimidazol-2-ylidene) silver(i) acetate (4f) respectively. Three NHC-precursors 3c-e and four NHC-silver complexes 4b and 4d-f were characterised by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Preliminary in vitro antibacterial activity of the NHC-precursors and NHC-silver complexes was investigated against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli using the qualitative Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion method. NHC-silver complexes have shown very high antibacterial activity compared to the NHC-precursors. All six NHC-silver complexes were tested for their cytotoxicity through MTT based in vitro tests on the human renal-cancer cell line Caki-1 in order to determine their IC₅₀ values. NHC-silver complexes 4a-f were found to have IC₅₀ values of 6.2 (±1.0), 7.7 (±1.6), 1.2 (±0.6), 10.8 (±1.9), 24.2 (±1.8) and 13.6 (±1.0) μM, respectively. These values represent improved cytotoxicity against Caki-1, most notably for 4c, which is a three times more cytotoxic than cisplatin (IC₅₀ value = 3.3 μM) itself.

21071604,1,2010,Am J Epidemiol,The factor XII -4C&gt;T variant and risk of common thrombotic disorders: A HuGE review and meta-analysis of evidence from observational studies.,Coagulation factor XII is involved in thrombus formation and therefore may play a role in the etiology of thrombotic disorders. A common variant in the factor XII (F12) gene (-4C&gt;T, rs1801020) results in decreased plasma levels of this coagulation factor. The existence of associations between low factor XII levels or F12 variants and thrombotic outcomes has been debated for more than a decade. The authors conducted a review and meta-analysis to evaluate the evidence for an association between F12 -4C&gt;T and 2 common thrombotic outcomes: venous thromboembolism and myocardial infarction, which are hypothesized to share some etiologic pathways. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and HuGE Navigator were searched through July 2009 to identify relevant epidemiologic studies, and data were summarized using random-effects meta-analysis. Sixteen candidate gene studies (4,386 cases, 40,089 controls) were analyzed. None of the investigated contrasts reached statistical significance at P &lt; 0.05, apart from a very weak association with myocardial infarction for the TT + CT versus CC contrast (odds ratio = 1.13, 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.27). Overall, based on the synthesis of observational studies, the evidence for an association between F12 -4C&gt;T and venous thromboembolism and myocardial infarction is weak.
21041091,1,2010,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and bio-evaluation of alkylaminoaryl phenyl cyclopropyl methanones as antitubercular and antimalarial agents.,A series of 4-alkylaminoaryl phenyl cyclopropyl methanones (6a-6u and 8a-8c) were synthesized from 4-fluorochalcones (3a and 3b) by cyclopropanation of double bond followed by nucleophilic substitution of F with different amines. The compounds were screened for their antitubercular and antimalarial activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strains in vitro respectively. Several compounds (6a, 6d-6h, 6p, 6q and 8a-8c) exhibited good in vitro antitubercular activities with MIC values 3.12-12.5μg/mL and preferentially inhibited the growth of P. falciparum in vitro (4a, 4c, 6a-6d, 6f, 6s, 8a and 8c) with IC₅₀ as low as 0.080 and 0.035μg/mL and SI values 4975 and 6948, respectively. Molecular docking studies and in vitro evaluation against FAS-II enzymes using reporter gene assays were carried out to elucidate the mode of action of these molecules. Two compounds 4a and 6g showed significant inhibition at 25μM concentration of the compound.
20947223,1,2010,Eur J Med Chem,Regiospecific synthesis and biological evaluation of spirooxindolopyrrolizidines via [3+2] cycloaddition of azomethine ylide.,Reaction of (E)-3-aryl-1-(thiophen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-ones with azomethine ylide (generated in situ via decarboxylative condensation of isatin with l-proline) in refluxing methanol afforded 1'-(aryl)-2'-(2-thienylcarbonyl)-spiro[3H-indole-3,3'-[3H]pyrrolizin]-2-ones as the sole product in a regiospecific manner. The synthesized compounds have been characterized by their elemental, analytical and spectral studies. The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against a spectrum of microbial organisms. These studies proved that compounds 1'-(p-chlorophenyl)-2'-(2-thienylcarbonyl)-spiro[3H-indole-3,3'-[3H]pyrrolizin]-2-one (4b), 1'-(p-fluorophenyl)-2'-(2-thienylcarbonyl)-spiro[3H-indole-3,3'-[3H]pyrrolizin]-2-one (4d) and 1'-(p-methoxyphenyl)-2'-(2-thienylcarbonyl)-spiro[3H-indole-3,3'-[3H]pyrrolizin]-2-one (4h) against Staphylococcus aureus, 1'-(p-chlorophenyl)-2'-(2-thienylcarbonyl)-spiro[3H-indole-3,3'-[3H]pyrrolizin]-2-one (4b), 1'-(p-methylphenyl)-2'-(2-thienylcarbonyl)-spiro[3H-indole-3,3'-[3H]pyrrolizin]-2-one (4c) and 1'-(p-fluorophenyl)-2'-(2-thienylcarbonyl)-spiro[3H-indole-3,3'-[3H]pyrrolizin]-2-one (4d) against Salmonella typhi show maximum inhibition potency at low concentration (6.25 μg/mL) whereas 4d against Candida albicans and 4b and 4d against Rhizopus sp. showed beneficial antifungal activity at minimum concentration.
20927371,1,2010,PLoS One,Analysis of β-globin chromatin micro-environment using a novel 3C variant, 4Cv.,Higher order chromatin folding is critical to a number of developmental processes, including the regulation of gene expression. Recently developed biochemical techniques such as RNA TRAP and chromosome conformation capture (3C) have provided us with the tools to probe chromosomal structures. These techniques have been applied to the β-globin locus, revealing a complex pattern of interactions with regions along the chromosome that the gene resides on. However, biochemical and microscopy data on the nature of β-globin interactions with other chromosomes is contradictory. Therefore we developed a novel 4C variant, Complete-genome 3C by vectorette amplification (4Cv), which allows an unbiased and quantitative method to examine chromosomal structure. We have used 4Cv to study the microenvironment of the β-globin locus in mice and show that a significant proportion of the interactions of β-globin are inter-chromosomal. Furthermore, our data show that in the liver, where the gene is active, β-globin is more likely to interact with other chromosomes, compared to the brain where the gene is silent and is more likely to interact with other regions along the same chromosome. Our data suggest that transcriptional activation of the β-globin locus leads to a change in nuclear position relative to the chromosome territory.
20890645,1,2010,J Fluoresc,The synthesis, X-ray crystal structure and optical properties of novel 5-aryl-3-ferrocenyl-1-pyridazinyl-pyrazoline derivatives.,A series of novel 5-aryl-3-ferrocenyl-1-pyridazinyl pyrazoline derivatives was synthesized by the reaction of ferrocenyl chalcone and 3-chloro-6-hydrazinylpyridazine in 10-65% yields. The compounds were characterized using IR, (1)H NMR, HRMS spectroscopic techniques and representative compounds 3c and 4c were assigned based on the X-ray crystallographic structure. The absorption and fluorescence characteristics of the compounds were investigated in chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile, respectively. The results showed that the absorption maxima of the compounds varied from 323 to 327 nm depending on the groups bonded to benzene and pyridazine ring. The maximum emission spectra of compounds in CHCl(3) were dependent on groups in pyridazine ring in which a strong donating-electron group such as propoxyl group on pyridazine ring in N-1 position of pyrazoline made the emission wavelength of 4a-4e small red shifte than that of compounds 3a-3e with chlorine group. The intensity of absorption and fluorescence was also correlated with substituent on aryl ring in C-5 position of pyrazoline. In addition, the absorption spectra of these compounds changed very little, but the fluorescence spectra had much change with increasing solvent polarity.

The molecular techniques applied were random amplification of polymorphic DNA and restriction enzyme analysis. In addition to the molecular analysis, the antimicrobial resistance profile was determined.RESULTS: The strains studied showed a low degree of diversity. In relation to the antimicrobial resistance profile of those microorganisms from the samples analyzed, all of them were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested.CONCLUSIONS: The molecular techniques that were used presented good discriminatory power for the strains studied. Furthermore, all of the samples that were analyzed were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested.
20673629,1,2010,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis of 3,3-diindolyl oxyindoles efficiently catalysed by FeCl3 and their in vitro evaluation for anticancer activity.,A simple and highly efficient method has been developed for the synthesis of 3,3-diindolyl oxyindoles by the reaction of indoles with isatin or 5-fluoro isatin using a catalytic amount (5 mol%) of FeCl(3) at room temperature in a short reaction time in high yields. All these compounds were evaluated against a panel of five human cancer lines and most of them showed potent cytotoxicity. Compound 4b showed IC(50) of 4.7 and 5 microM against SK-N-SH and DU-145 cell lines, respectively, whereas 4c, 4d, 4f and 4k showed IC(50) of 2.2, 1.2, 3.6 and 3.6 microM, respectively, against DU-145 cell line. Interestingly, some of the compounds are selectively potent in prostate cancer (DU-145) with IC(50) values of 1.2-19.6 microM.
20658121,1,2010,Theor Appl Genet,A new chromosome nomenclature system for oat (Avena sativa L. and A. byzantina C. Koch) based on FISH analysis of monosomic lines.,Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with multiple probes was used to analyze mitotic and meiotic chromosome spreads of Avena sativa cv 'Sun II' monosomic lines, and of A. byzantina cv 'Kanota' monosomic lines from spontaneous haploids. The probes used were A. strigosa pAs120a (a repetitive sequence abundant in A-genome chromatin), A. murphyi pAm1 (a repetitive sequence abundant in C-genome chromatin), A. strigosa pITS (internal transcribed spacer of rDNA) and the wheat rDNA probes pTa71 (nucleolus organizer region or NOR) and pTa794 (5S). Simultaneous and sequential FISH employing pairs of these probes allowed the identification and genome assignation of all chromosomes. FISH mapping using mitotic and meiotic metaphases facilitated the genomic and chromosomal identification of the monosome in each line. Of the 17 'Sun II' lines analyzed, 13 distinct monosomic lines were found, corresponding to four monosomes of the A-genome, five of the C-genome and four of the D-genome. In addition, 12 distinct monosomic lines were detected among the 20 'Kanota' lines examined, corresponding to six monosomes of the A-genome, three of the C-genome and three of the D-genome. The results show that 19 chromosomes out of 21 of the complement are represented by monosomes between the two genetic backgrounds. The identity of the remaining chromosomes can be deduced either from one intergenomic translocation detected on both 'Sun II' and 'Kanota' lines, or from the single reciprocal, intergenomic translocation detected among the 'Sun II' lines. These results permit a new system to be proposed for numbering the 21 chromosome pairs of the hexaploid oat complement. Accordingly, the A-genome contains chromosomes 8A, 11A, 13A, 15A, 16A, 17A and 19A; the C-genome contains chromosomes 1C, 2C, 3C, 4C, 5C, 6C and 7C; and the D-genome consists of chromosomes 9D, 10D, 12D, 14D, 18D, 20D and 21D. Moreover, the FISH patterns of 16 chromosomes in 'Sun II' and 15 in 'Kanota' suggest that these chromosomes could be involved in intergenomic translocations. By comparing the identities of individually translocated chromosomes in the two hexaploid species with those of other hexaploids, we detected different types of intergenomic translocations.
20637806,1,2010,Behav Brain Res,Carbon chain length and the stimulus problem in olfaction.,Understanding how odour quality perception is encoded in its molecular properties arguably poses one of the most significant problems in olfaction. Determining the odour structure-quality relationships of structurally similar odorants could provide a key tool to this problem. We tentatively explored whether a mixture of two molecules, differing only in carbon chain length (C), would yield the same percept as a single odorant with an intermediate carbon chain length, akin to colour vision, or be perceived as a different quality. Ability to discriminate between pairs of iso-intense solutions of n-butanol (4C), n-propanol (3C), n-pentanol (5C), and an intermediate 50/50 molecular weight mixture of n-propanol and n-pentanol (3C/5C) was assessed in 20 healthy young adults. We found that participants were able to discriminate 4C from the 50/50 molecular weight mixture of n-propanol and n-pentanol (3C/5C), and also from the other alcohols. In conclusion, we successfully replicated previous data demonstrating that participants are able to discriminate between structurally similar alcohols, and, more importantly, the present study shows that an odour mixture of two molecules differing only in carbon chain length is clearly distinguishable from a single odorant with an intermediate carbon chain length. These findings suggest that although carbon chain length matters to odour quality, carbon chain length is not a physical continuum within homologous series of substances that corresponds to a single qualitative dimension akin to the wavelength-hue relation for monochromatic light.
20603785,1,2010,Ultraschall Med,Influence of age on PPV of sonographic BI-RADS categories 3, 4, and 5.,PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV) of sonographic Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories 3, 4, and 5 in different age groups to investigate whether age influences the PPV of the BI-RADS category in breast ultrasound.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From our sonography-guided core biopsy database of breasts between 2006 and 2008, we identified 2817 BI-RADS category 3, 4, and 5 lesions with known pathological diagnosis in 2587 women, all of whom underwent the earlier breast assessment via ultrasound with a sonographic BI-RADS lexicon and later sonography-guided core biopsy. All lesions were classified into three age groups (&lt; 45, 45 - 59, and &gt; 59 years). The age-related PPVs of each BI-RADS category among three age groups were calculated on the basis of pathological diagnoses and were compared using a χ(2)-test.RESULTS: The overall PPV of each BI-RADS category was 2.2 % in category 3, 6.5 % in category 4a, 35.2 % in category 4b, 79.6 % in category 4c, and 99.6 % in category 5. The age-related PPVs of category 3 varied significantly among the three age groups (0.9 % versus 3.9 % versus 2.0 % p = 0.048), and notably, the age-related PPV in group 2 was higher than the others. Additionally, there was a significant positive association between the age-related PPVs and increasing age in categories 4a and 4b (4a, p &lt; 0.0001 and 4b, p = 0.0139), but not in categories 4c and 5 (4c, p = 0.1853 and 5, p = 0.2871).CONCLUSION: The incidence of female breast cancer differs not only in different sonographic BI-RADS categories, but also in different age groups. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the special age group that we found for sonographic BI-RADS categories 3, 4a, and 4b.

20572178,1,2010,Chemistry,Effect of the nature of the substituent in N-alkylimidazole ligands on the outcome of deprotonation: ring opening versus the formation of N-heterocyclic carbene complexes.,Complexes [Re(CO)(3)(N-RIm)(3)]OTf (N-RIm=N-alkylimidazole, OTf=trifluoromethanesulfonate; 1a-d) have been straightforwardly synthesised from [Re(OTf)(CO)(5)] and the appropriate N-alkylimidazole. The reaction of compounds 1a-d with the strong base KN(SiMe(3))(2) led to deprotonation of a central C-H group of an imidazole ligand, thus affording very highly reactive derivatives. The latter can evolve through two different pathways, depending on the nature of the substituents of the imidazole ligands. Compound 1a contains three N-MeIm ligands, and its product 2a features a C-bound imidazol-2-yl ligand. When 2a is treated with HOTf or MeOTf, rhenium N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) 3a or 4a are afforded as a result of the protonation or methylation, respectively, of the non-coordinated N atom. The reaction of 2a with [AuCl(PPh(3))] led to the heterobimetallic compound 5, in which the N-heterocyclic ligand is once again N-bound to the Re atom and C-coordinated to the gold fragment. For compounds 1b-d, with at least one N-arylimidazole ligand, deprotonation led to an unprecedented reactivity pattern: the carbanion generated by the deprotonation of the C2-H group of an imidazole ligand attacks a central C-H group of a neighbouring N-RIm ligand, thus affording the product of C-C coupling and ring-opening of the imidazole moiety that has been attacked (2c, d). The new complexes featured an amido-type N atom that can be protonated or methylated, thus obtaining compounds 3c, d or 4c, d, respectively. The latter reaction forces a change in the disposition of the olefinic unit generated by the ring-opening of the N-RIm ligand from a cisoid to a transoid geometry. Theoretical calculations help to rationalise the experimental observation of ring-opening (when at least one of the substituents of the imidazole ligands is an aryl group) or tautomerisation of the N-heterocyclic ligand to afford the imidazol-2-yl product.
20515045,1,2010,Bioconjug Chem,Effect of RGD-4C position is more important than disulfide bonds on antiangiogenic activity of RGD-4C modified endostatin derived synthetic polypeptide.,ES-2 (IVRRADRAAVP), an endostatin-derived synthetic polypeptide, contains the amino acids 50-60 of endostatin from its N terminus, and it had no inhibitory effects on tumor growth in vivo. In order to increase the targeted delivery of ES-2 to tumors and further enhance the activity, the polypeptide RGD-4C (ACDCRGDCFC) was introduced into ES-2, and the effects of RGD-4C position and RGD-4C disulfide bonds on polypeptides activity were investigated. When RGD-4C polypeptides (with or without disulfide bonds) were introduced to the N-terminals of synthesized ES-2, the modified ES-2 showed significant antitumor activity in vivo. Cell proliferation and chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay results showed that disulfide bonds had no significant effects on RGD-4C-modified ES-2 antiangiogenic activity. Furthermore, the target of modified peptides was integrin alpha5beta1, rather than integrin alphavbeta3 as previous studies mentioned.
20429537,1,2010,Inorg Chem,Highly convenient regioselective intermolecular hydroamination of alkynes yielding ketimines catalyzed by gold(I) complexes of 1,2,4-triazole based N-heterocyclic carbenes.,A series of highly efficient gold(I) precatalysts of 1,2,4-triazole based N-heterocyclic carbenes, [1-R-4-R'-1,2,4-triazol-5-ylidene]AuCl [R = CH(2)CO(t)Bu, R' = CH(2)Ph (1c); R = CH(2)CONH(t)Bu, R' = CH(2)Ph (2c); R = CH(2)CO(t)Bu, R' = CH(2)CO(t)Bu (3c), and R = C(6)H(10)OH, R' = CH(2)Ph (4c)] are reported for the hydroamination of terminal alkynes with a variety of sterically demanding o/p-substituted aryl amines yielding the corresponding ketimines in air. The gold 1c-4c complexes exhibited extremely high activity in comparison to the silver analogues 1b-4b, thereby highlighting the role of gold as a metal in the catalysis of the hydroamination reaction. Additionally, the 1,2,4-triazole based 1c-4c precatalysts showed significantly superior activity in comparison to the two representative imidazole analogues, namely, [1-(benzyl)-3-(N-t-butylacetamido)imidazol-2-ylidene]AuCl and [1-(2-hydroxy-cyclohexyl)-3-(benzyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]AuCl, thereby underscoring the importance of the 1,2,4-triazole based N-heterocyclic carbenes over the imidazole based ones in designing the gold(I) precatalysts for the hydroamination reaction. The gold(I) complexes (1c-4c) were synthesized by transmetalation reaction of the silver analogues 1b-4b with (SMe(2))AuCl in 60-76% yield while the silver 1b-4b complexes in turn were synthesized from the respective 1,2,4-triazolium halide salts by treatment with Ag(2)O in 43-64% yield.
20416665,1,2010,Meat Sci,High prevalence, low counts and uncommon serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes in linguiça, a Brazilian fresh pork sausage.,Linguiça is a highly popular and appreciated pork product in Brazil, frequently consumed undercooked. Aiming at collection of data for a future risk assessment, this study evaluated the prevalence and counts of Listeria monocytogenes in linguiça samples collected at retail level in Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. ISO methods were used for detection and enumeration of the pathogen (11290-1 and 11290-2, respectively). Isolates were submitted to Simplex-PCR for hlyA gene and those with biochemical features of L. monocytogenes and hlyA positive were serotyped using a Multiplex PCR. Ninety percent of the samples were positive for Listeria spp., and L. monocytogenes was detected in 42% of the samples, with counts below 10(2)CFU/g in all samples. A prevalence of uncommon serotypes 4a and 4c was observed.
20237594,1,2010,Genome,Nuclear DNA content variation associated with muscle fiber hypertrophic growth in decapod crustaceans.,We tested the hypothesis that hypertrophic muscle growth in decapod crustaceans is associated with increases in both the number of nuclei per fiber and nuclear DNA content. The DNA-localizing fluorochrome DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and chicken erythrocyte standards were used with static microspectrophotometry and image analysis to estimate nuclear DNA content in hemocytes and muscle fibers from eight decapod crustacean species: Farfantepenaeus aztecus, Palaemonetes pugio, Panulirus argus, Homarus americanus, Procambarus clarkii, Cambarus bartonii, Callinectes sapidus, and Menippe mercenaria. Mean diploid (2C) values in hemocytes ranged from 3.6 to 11.7 pg. Hemocyte 2C estimates were used to extrapolate ploidy level in the multinucleated skeletal muscle tissue of juvenile and adult animals. Across all species, mean muscle fiber diameters from adult animals were significantly larger than those in juveniles, and nuclear domains were greater in larger fibers. The number of nuclei per fiber increased with increasing fiber size, as hypothesized. Maximum nuclear DNA content per species in muscle ranged from 4C to 32C, consistent with endopolyploidy. Two patterns of body- and fiber-size-dependent shifts in ploidy were observed: four species had a significantly higher ploidy in the larger fibers of adults, while three species exhibited a significantly lower ploidy in adults than in juveniles. Thus, across species, there was no systematic relationship between nuclear domain size and nuclear DNA content.
20160701,1,2010,J Appl Clin Med Phys,Target and peripheral dose during patient repositioning with the Gamma Knife automatic positioning system (APS) device.,The GammaPlan treatment planning system does not account for the leakage and scatter dose during APS repositioning. In this study, the dose delivered to the target site and its periphery from the defocus stage and intershot couch transit (couch motion from the focus to defocus position and back) associated with APS repositioning are measured for the Gamma Knife model 4C. A stereotactic head-frame was attached to a Leksell 16 cm diameter spherical phantom with a calibrated ion chamber at its center. Using a fiducial box, CT images of the phantom were acquired and registered in the GammaPlan treatment planning system to determine the coordinates of the target (center of the phantom). An absorbed dose of 10 Gy to the 50% isodose line was prescribed to the target site for all measurements. Plans were generated for the 8, 14 and 18 mm collimator helmets to determine the relationship of measured dose to the number of repositions of the APS system and to the helmet size. The target coordinate was identical throughout entire study and there was no movement of the APS between various shots. This allowed for measurement of intershot transit dose at the target site and its periphery. The couch was paused in the defocus position, allowing defocus dose measurements at the intracranial target and periphery. Measured dose increases with frequency of repositioning and with helmet collimator size. During couch transit, the target receives more dose than peripheral regions; however, in the defocus position, the greatest dose is superior to the target site. The automatic positioning system for the Leksell Gamma Knife model 4C results in an additional dose of up to 3.87 +/- 0.07%, 4.97 +/- 0.04%, and 5.71 +/- 0.07% to the target site; its periphery receives additional dose that varies depending on its position relative to the target. There is also dose contribution to the patient in the defocus position, where the APS repositions the patient from one treatment coordinate to another. This may be important for treatment areas around critical structures within the brain. Further characterization of the defocus and transit exposures and development of a dose calculation algorithm to account for these doses would improve the accuracy of the delivered plan.
20159014,1,2010,Exp Parasitol,Giardia duodenalis: kinetics of cyst elimination and the systemic humoral and intestinal secretory immune responses in gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) experimentally infected.,This study aimed to determine the pre-patent period and to evaluate the kinetics of cyst elimination and the systemic humoral (IgA, IgG(1), IgG(2a), IgM, IgE) and intestinal secretory (IgA) immune responses in gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) experimentally innoculated with different doses of Giardia duodenalis trophozoites. Forty-eight animals aged 6-8 weeks were used, equally distributed among six groups, five groups innoculated with different doses of trophozoites (10(1), 10(2), 10(3), 10(4), 10(5)) and one control (non-infected) group. Coproparasitological examinations were carried out daily up to 91 days after inoculation (d.a.i.) to determine the pre-patent period and the kinetics of cyst elimination. Blood and stool samples were weekly collected for antibody assays. The pre-patent period was observed from the 9 d.a.i. onwards, with intermittent elimination of variable quantities of cysts up to 27 d.a.i.. All infected gerbils, irrespective of the dose received, were able to mount systemic humoral immune responses as evidenced by specific IgM titers from 7 to 28 d.a.i., corresponding to the peak of cyst elimination, followed by high and persistent IgG1 titers. Intestinal secretory responses were also seen with two peaks of fecal IgA titers, corresponding to IgM and IgG1 response peaks, respectively. In conclusion, systemic and intestinal humoral immune responses were related to the control of giardiasis in this experimental model.
20113207,1,2010,Foodborne Pathog Dis,Efficacy of ultraviolet light exposure against survival of Listeria monocytogenes on conveyor belts.,Listeria monocytogenes has been repeatedly isolated from foods and food-processing facilities including food contact surfaces such as conveyor belts (CB). CBs are often difficult to clean and require rigorous sanitation programs for decontamination. Ultraviolet (UV) light has exhibited microbicidal properties on food contact surfaces and this study was conducted to determine the efficacy of UV against L. monocytogenes on CB made of different materials. A four-strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes (serotypes 3A, 4A, 4B, and 4C) was made to give a suspension of approximately 10(7) CFU/mL. CBs made from four different types of materials, (1) Ropanyl DM 8/2 A2 + 04 (belt 1), (2) Volta FRMW-3.0 (belt 2), (3) Volta FRMB-3.0 (belt 3), and (4) Ropanyl DM (belt 4), were inoculated with 1 mL of the four-strain cocktail (approximately 10(7) CFU/mL) of the bacterial suspension. CBs were treated with UV light (254 nm) for 1 and 3 sec at 5.53 and 5.95 mW/cm(2). Three replications of the experiments were conducted. Two-way analysis of variance of survival populations of L. monocytogenes showed that bacterial counts were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) on all belt types irrespective of UV light intensities and times of exposure. L. monocytogenes populations were reduced (p &lt; 0.05) to below detection limits on belts 1, 2, and 3 after exposure to 5.95 mW/cm(2) UV light intensity for 3 sec. L. monocytogenes-inoculated CBs that were exposed to 5.53 mW/cm(2) showed higher (p &lt; 0.05) survival populations of L. monocytogenes compared with 5.95 mW/cm(2) on all the four CBs. Belt 4 showed survival populations of L. monocytogenes ranging from 1.42 to 1.73 log(10) CFU/cm(2) after UV light treatment for 1 and 3 sec. UV light can be effectively used to reduce L. monocytogenes contamination on CBs.
20073481,1,2010,J Org Chem,Synthesis of sulfanyl-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl-substituted bicyclic dioxetanes and their base-induced chemiluminescence.,The singlet oxygenation of 4-tert-butyl-3,3-dimethyl-5-(3-oxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydrothiophenes 5c-e bearing an acetoxy or methoxy group at the 2-position exclusively gave the corresponding sulfanyl-substituted bicyclic dioxetanes 2c-e, while that of 5a without 2-substituent mainly gave sulfoxide 11 along with a small amount of dioxetane 2a. These dioxetanes were sufficiently stable thermally to permit handling at room temperature. Sulfanyl-substituted dioxetanes, 2c and 2e, were further oxidized with m-chloroperbenzoic acid to afford the corresponding sulfinyl-substituted dioxetanes 3c, 3e and sulfonyl-substituted dioxetanes 4c, 4e. X-ray single crystallographic analysis was performed for 2c and 4e. Base-induced decomposition of the dioxetanes in DMSO gave light with a maximum wavelength lambda(max)(CL) at 554 nm for 2a and 565 nm for 2e in moderate light yields, while sulfinyl-derivative 3e gave weak light with lambda(max)(CL) = 795 nm and sulfonyl-derivative 4e gave very weak light with lambda(max)(CL) = 848 nm.
21580548,1,2010,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,NA,The title compound, [Na(C(23)H(28)N(17)OS(2))(CH(3)OH)(C(6)H(5)OH)]·4C(6)H(5)OH, is a five-coordinate Na(I) complex. The Na(+) cation is bound to three N atoms of the triazinide ligand, two from each pyrazole ring and one from the central deprotonated triazine ring system. O atoms from a methanol and a phenol mol-ecule complete the five-coordinate NaN(3)O(2) coordination environment. The asymmetric unit also includes three complete and two half phenol mol-ecules, four of which are hydrogen bonded to the N atoms of the thia-diazole ring. Two of the phenol solvent mol-ecules are disordered over two discrete inversion centres. The triazinide ligand is essentially planar (mean deviation from the least-squares plane = 0.0524 Å), with the methyl groups of the tert-butyl substituents on the pyrazole rings located above and below the plane. The planarity of this system is further assisted by the formation of four intra-molecular N-H⋯N hydrogen bonds between the N-H bonds of both amino groups on the pyrazole rings and the N atoms of the triazine ring and also from each of the adjacent diazene (-N=N-) bonds. The highly polar mol-ecules are stacked along the a axis through the central Na atom sandwiched by two kinds of alternating inter-molecular hydrogen bonds: O(carbon-yl)⋯H-O(methanol)/Na/O-H(phenol)⋯O(carbon-yl). These inter-actions form two polymer chains per mol-ecule.
21191754,0,2010,Arch Pharm Res,Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 1,2,3-triazoles containing quinoline moiety.,A new series of substituted 1,2,3-triazoles (4a-n) were synthesized from 4-azido-2,8-bistrifluoromethylquinoline 2. The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of 2 with ethyl acetoacetate afforded 1-(2,8-Bistrifluoromethylquinolin-4-yl)-5-methyl-1,2,3-triazole-4-carboxylic acid 3, which was then converted into its corresponding acid hydrazide 3a. Condensation of this hydrazide with different aromatic aldehydes resulted in the formation of Schiff's bases, N-[1-Arylmethylene]-1-[2,8-bistrifluoromethylquinoline-4-yl]-5-methyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carbohydrazides (4a-n). These newly synthesized 1,2,3-triazole derivatives were characterized by analytical and spectral data. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro for their antibacterial and antifungal activity. A brief investigation of the structure activity relationships revealed that the nature of the substituent on position 4 of the triazole ring influences the antimicrobial activity. Among the newly synthesized compounds, the most active compound was 4n, which contained the 3-methylthien-2-yl moiety and showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against all the strains used for testing. Compounds 4b, 4c, 4e, 4f, 4h and 4l showed significant antimicrobial activity at the concentration of 6.25 μg/mL.
21146903,0,2010,Eur J Med Chem,One-pot microwave assisted synthesis under green chemistry conditions, antioxidant screening, and cytotoxicity assessments of benzimidazole Schiff bases and pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazol-3(4H)-ones.,The synthesis of a number of benzimidazole Schiff bases 3 and 3-oxo-pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles 4 in excellent yields by a one-step sequence from the reaction of 2-aminobenzimidazole under green chemistry conditions is described. Structural assignments of the new compounds as well as complete assignment of (1)H and (13)C NMR signals have been unambiguously achieved based on the analysis of their (1)H and (13)C NMR (1D and 2D), IR, MS and elemental analysis data. To the synthesized Schiff bases the E-configuration was assigned on the basis of comparison of experimental and calculated (DFT) (13)C NMR chemical shifts. Compounds 3 and 4 were evaluated as inhibitors of lipoxygenase (LOX) and of lipid peroxidation (LPO). All the tested derivatives showed inhibition of lipid peroxidation, whereas most of them were found to have higher activation than the reference compound trolox; The Schiff bases 3e, 3h, and 3i, and the pyrimidobenzimidazoles 4a, 4e and 4f were found to be the most potent. The most potent LOX inhibitor within the subset of Schiff bases was found compound 3i, followed by 3f, whereas compounds 4a and 4g were found the most potent of the 3-oxo-pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazole group. Moreover, some cytotoxicity assessments were undertaken, whereupon it was found that Schiff base 3i and pyrimidobenzimidazoles 4e and 4f did not exhibit cytotoxicity at similar concentrations resembling thus the inhibitory activity of lipid peroxidation. The most cytotoxic Schiff base and pyrimidobenzimidazole were found to be 3d and 4c, respectively.
21141934,0,2010,J Med Chem,Gd-complexes of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) conjugates of tranexamates as a new class of blood-pool magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents.,Gd-complexes of the type [Gd(L)(H(2)O)]·xH(2)O (5a-c), where L is DOTA conjugates of tranexamic acid (4a) and tranexamic esters (4b,c), have been prepared as a new class of MRI blood-pool contrast agents (BPCAs). Thermodynamic stability (K(GdL)) and pharmacokinetic inertness of 5 compare well with or better than those of analogous MRI contrasting agents (CAs) such as Gd-DOTA and Gd-DTPA-BMA. Their R(1)-relaxivities are significantly higher than those of any of the clinically used MRI CAs. T(1)-weighted MR images of mice administered by 5c demonstrate high blood-pool effect with simultaneous contrast enhancement in liver. The structural uniqueness of 5c lies in the fact that it adopts macrocyclic DOTA instead of acyclic DTPA. In addition, 5c is nonionic and makes no resort to aromatic substituent(s) in the chelate backbone for the blood-pool enhancement. The nature of hepatobiliary uptake demonstrated by 5c may be explained in terms of lipophilicity of tranexamate in the chelate (4c). The cell cytotoxicity test shows no toxicity found with 5, suggesting their use as a practical MRI BPCAs.
21133400,0,2010,J Phys Chem A,Oxygen nonstoichiometry of tetragonal La2-xSr(x)CuO4-δ (x = 0.15-1.2) and in situ XPS studies at elevated temperatures.,The peculiarities of oxygen nonstoichiometry (δ) in tetragonal La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4-δ) solid solution with x(Sr) = 0.15-1.2 were studied by XRD, NPD, in situ high-temperature XPS, and chemical analysis. Temperature dependences of oxygen nonstoichiometry, δ = δ(T), were obtained for different Sr contents at 1 bar of O(2). Two types of charge compensation during replacement of lanthanum by strontium are discussed: an increase of the average copper oxidation state and a formation of oxygen vacancies. The average copper oxidation state V(Cu) exhibits a maximum of 2.32 at x(Sr) = 0.6, while δ increases with x(Sr). Oxygen vacancies are unambiguously located on the 4c site ({CuO(2)} plane) for compositions with different strontium contents, which electronic state is described by the O 2p core electron peak at about 531 eV. Thermal stability of the solid solution in a vacuum is associated with the extraction of practically the entire oxygen from CuO(2) layers and the formation of Cu(+) at least in the near-surface region. The higher average copper oxidation state after synthesis in the Sr-rich phases in comparison with the Sr-poor compositions prevents oxygen removal and the formation of Cu(+) and, therefore, stabilizes the structure during heating in a vacuum.
21129985,0,2010,Bioorg Med Chem,3-[(Imidazolidin-2-yl)imino]indazole ligands with selectivity for the α(2)-adrenoceptor compared to the imidazoline I(1) receptor.,A series of 3-[(4,5-dihydroimidazolidin-2-yl)imino]indazoles has been synthesized as positional analogues of marsanidine, a highly selective α(2)-adrenoceptor ligand. Parent compound 4a and its 4-chloro (4c) and 4-methyl (4d) derivatives display α(2)-adrenoceptor affinity at nanomolar concentrations (K(i)=39.4, 15.9 and 22.6nM, respectively) and relatively high α(2)/I(1) selectivity ratios of 82, 115 and 690, respectively. Evidence was obtained that these compounds act as partial agonists at α(2A)-adrenoceptors. Compound 4d with intrinsic activity comparable with that of marsanidine, but lower than that of clonidine, elicited pronounced cardiovascular effects in anesthetized rats at doses as low as 0.01mg/kg iv.
21117500,0,2010,Arzneimittelforschung,Effects of the new benzimidazole derivative TAS-203, an orally active phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, on airway inflammation in rats and emetic responses in ferrets.,TAS-203 (2-[3-(cyclopropylmethoxy)-4-methoxyphenyl]-5-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazole, CAS 223909-92-0) is a novel phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor that has been found to have good anti-inflammatory effects and low emetogenic activity in vivo. In the present studies, the anti-inflammatory profile of TAS-203 was examined and compared with that of cilomilast (CAS 153259-65-5), the most advanced PDE4 inhibitor. TAS-203 inhibited the activity of purified human PDE4 with an IC50 value of 88 nM and also the recombinant PDE4 subtypes (4A, 4B, 4C and 4D) with respective IC50 values of 47, 35, 227 and 43 nM. In the experiments using inflammatory cells, TAS-203 concentration-dependently inhibited platelet-activating factor-induced eosinophil chemotaxis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-a release from human monocytes with respective IC50 values of 250 and 38.5 nM. For airway inflammation, TAS-203 at 10 mg/kg and cilomilast at 30 mg/kg significantly inhibited antigen-induced airway eosinophilia and LPS-induced airway neutrophilia in rats. The emetogenicity of TAS-203 and cilomilast was evaluated in a ferret model of emesis. The maximum dose of TAS-203 not carrying emesis was 100 mg/kg, while that of cilomilast was less than 10 mg/kg. Finally, TAS-203 was found to be poorly distributed to the brain after oral administration of 10 mg/kg TAS-203 in rats. These results indicate that TAS-203 is an orally active PDE4 inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory activities and low emetogenicity that may be useful in the treatment of airway inflammatory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
21115919,0,2010,Anticancer Res,Prognostic markers for detection of coexistent carcinoma in high-risk endometrial hyperplasia.,OBJECTIVES: Reliable predictive uterus-sparing methods are crucial for treatment decisions among women who wish to preserve fertility and for seriously ill patients for whom surgery is hazardous. Thus, prediction of myoinvasive carcinoma by objective histomorphometry (4C-rule) and subjective diagnosis (endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia, EIN) were investigated in high-risk endometrial biopsies.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 45 patients retrospectively diagnosed with high-risk hyperplasia, of whom ten were found to have concurrent carcinoma, were investigated. The histomorphometric 4C-rule and the EIN classification system were used for outcome prediction.RESULTS: Myoinvasive disease was predicted with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 79% by using 4C-rule assessment. The sensitivity and specificity of the EIN classification to predict coexistent carcinoma or not was 50% and 97%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Six out of the seven reported cases with myoinvasion were correctly diagnosed with the 4C-rule assessment. In contrast, only three out of the seven myoinvasive cases were diagnosed as cancer using the EIN approach.
20971773,0,2010,Radiology,Benign papilloma without atypia diagnosed at US-guided 14-gauge core-needle biopsy: clinical and US features predictive of upgrade to malignancy.,PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonographically (US)-guided 14-gauge core-needle biopsy (CNB) for benign papilloma without atypia and to determine whether clinical and radiologic features could be used to predict an upgrade to malignancy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an institutional review board-approved retrospective study, with a waiver of informed consent. The histologic results of US-guided CNB procedures performed from January 2006 through January 2009 were reviewed. A total of 160 benign papillomas without atypia that were diagnosed at CNB and excised surgically in 143 women (age range, 19-77 years) were assessed. Medical records and sonograms in the women were reviewed. Two radiologists working in consensus correlated imaging findings with the biopsy result to determine concordance. For the upgrade to malignancy after excision, malignant lesions were compared with nonmalignant lesions for the collected clinical and radiologic variables, which included patient age, lesion size, and lesion distance from the nipple, by using the χ(2) or Fisher exact test for categoric variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables.RESULTS: Eight (5.0%) of 160 papillomas were upgraded to malignancy. Lesions that were 1 cm or larger (seven [11%] of 63) showed a higher upgrade rate than lesions that were smaller than 1 cm (one [1%] of 97) (P = .006). The upgrade rate was higher in patients aged 50 years or older (six [16%] of 37) than in patients younger than 50 years (two [2%] of 123) (P = .002). Lesions that were 3 cm or farther from the nipple (four [13%] of 31) showed a higher upgrade rate than lesions that were less than 3 cm from the nipple (four [3.1%] of 129) (P = .046). Upgrade rates for Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 lesions were 0%, 2.5%, 6%, 27%, and 25%, respectively (P = .010).CONCLUSION: At US-guided 14-gauge CNB, benign papilloma without atypia could be diagnosed accurately. Discordance between imaging and pathology results, as well as patient age of 50 years or older, lesion size of 1 cm or greater, lesion distance from the nipple of 3 cm or greater, and BI-RADS category may be helpful in predicting the possibility of upgrade to malignancy.
20971650,0,2010,Bioorg Med Chem,Discovery and synthesis of novel luteolin derivatives as DAT agonists.,Luteolin, 5,7-dihydroxy-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4H-chromen-4-one, has been proposed and proved to be a novel dopamine transporter (DAT) activator. In order to develop this potential of luteolin, a series of novel luteolin derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their DAT agonistic activities, utilizing constructed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines stably expressing rat DAT. Biological screening results demonstrated that luteolin derivatives 1d, 1e, and 4c carry great DAT agonistic potency (EC(50)=0.046, 0.869, and 1.375μM, respectively) compared with luteolin 8 (EC(50)=1.45±0.29μM). Luteolin derivative 1d, notably, exhibited a 32-fold-higher DAT agonistic potency than luteolin. These luteolin derivatives represent a novel DAT agonist class, from which lead compounds useful for exploration of additional novel DAT agonists could be drawn.
20964226,0,2010,Med Phys,Assessment of variation in Elekta plastic spherical-calibration phantom and its impact on the Leksell Gamma Knife calibration.,PURPOSE: Traditionally, the dose-rate calibration (output) of the Leksell Gamma Knife (LGK) unit is performed using a 160 mm diameter plastic spherical phantom provided by the vendor of the LGK, Elekta Instrument AB. The purpose of this study was to evaluate variations in the Elekta spherical phantom and to assess its impact and use for the LGK calibration.METHODS: Altogether, 13 phantoms from six different centers were acquired, 10 of these phantoms were manufactured within the past 10 years and the last 3 approximately 15-20 years ago. To assess variation in phantoms, the diameter and mass densities were measured. To assess the impact on LGK calibration, the output of two models of LGK (LGK Perfexion and LGK 4C) were measured under identical irradiation conditions using all 13 phantoms for each LGK model.RESULTS: The mean measured deviation in diameter from expected nominal 160 mm for 13 phantoms was 0.51 mm (range of 0.09-1.51 mm). The mean measured phantom mass density for 13 phantoms was 1.066 +/- 0.019 g/cm3 (range of 1.046-1.102 g/cm3). The percentage deviation of output for individual phantom from mean of 13 phantom outputs ranged from -0.37% to 0.55% for LGK Perfexion. Similarly, the percentage deviation of output for individual phantom from mean of 13 phantom outputs ranged from -0.72% to 0.47% for LGK 4C.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that small variations in terms of phantom size and mass density of the phantom material do not have a significant impact on dose-rate measurements of the Leksell Gamma Knife. Also, date of manufacture of the phantom did not show up to be a significant factor in this study.
20936791,0,2010,J Med Chem,A diverse series of substituted benzenesulfonamides as aldose reductase inhibitors with antioxidant activity: design, synthesis, and in vitro activity.,We have previously reported the successful replacement of a carboxylic acid functionality with that of a difluorophenolic group on the known aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) of 2-(phenylsulfonamido)acetic acid chemotype. In the present work, based on bioisosteric principles, additional 2,6-difluorophenol and tetrazole, methylsulfonylamide, and isoxazolidin-3-one phenylsulfonamide derivatives were synthesized and tested in vitro in protocols primarily related to the long-term diabetic complications. Most of the compounds were found as ARIs at IC(50) &lt; 100 μM, while the introduction of the 4-bromo-2-fluorobenzyl group in a phenylsulfonamidodifluorophenol structure resulted in a compound (4c) presenting a submicromolar inhibitory profile. However, the derivatives of tetrazole, methylsulfonylamine, and the (R)-enantiomer of isoxazolidin-3-one did not exhibit appreciable ARI activity. The selectivity of the active ARIs is also discussed. Furthermore, the synthesized compounds exhibited potent antioxidant potential (homogeneous and heterogeneous systems).
20933408,0,2010,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Efficient synthesis, spectral analysis and antimicrobial studies of nitrogen and sulfur containing spiro heterocycles from 2,4-diaryl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-ones.,Acetyl and propionyl group substituted thiadiazole derivatives (4a-4h, 5a-5h, 6a, 6b, 7a and 7b) have been synthesized by the cyclization of 2,4-diaryl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one thiosemicarbazones (2a-2h, 3a and 3b) with acetic anhydride/propionic anhydride and were characterized by Elemental analysis, IR, (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR spectral analysis. Single crystal X-ray diffraction has also been recorded for compounds 4c and 5a. From the NMR and Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, compounds 4b-4d, 4f-4h, 5b, 5c, 5f-5h, 6a, 7a and 7b were found to adopt twin-chair conformations whereas compounds 4a, 4e, 5a, 5d, 5e and 6b adopt chair and boat conformation of cyclohexane and piperidine rings, respectively. Besides, the synthesized compounds were screened for antibacterial and antifungal activities using serial dilution method. The microbiological analysis showed that the electron withdrawing function substituted phenyl group at C-2 and C-4 of azabicyclononane based thiadiazoles 4c/4h and 5c/5h exposed significant antimicrobial activity against Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans at MIC of 6.25 μg/ml.

The cytotoxic effect of these compounds was studied on U87 human glioma cells, compounds 4c, 4d and 4e are found to exhibit excellent activity at a concentration as low as 0.06 µg/ml.
20927530,0,2010,Childs Nerv Syst,A novel NF1 gene mutation in an Italian family with neurofibromatosis type 1.,PURPOSE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with an estimated incidence of one in 3,500 births. Clinically, NF1 is characterized by café-au-lait (CAL) spots, neurofibromas, freckling of the axillary or inguinal region, Lisch nodules, optic nerve glioma, and bone dysplasias. NF1 is caused by inactivating mutations of the 17q11.2-located NF1 gene. We present a clinical and molecular study of an Italian family with NF1.METHODS: The proband, a 10-year-old boy, showed large CAL spots and freckling on the axillary region and plexiform neurofibromas on the right side only. His father (47 years old) showed, in addition to the similar signs, numerous neurofibromas of various sizes on his thorax, abdomen, back, and shoulder. Two additional family members (a brother and a sister of the proband) presented only small CAL spots. The coding exons of NF1 gene were analyzed for mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing in all family members.RESULTS: The mutational analysis of the NF1 gene revealed a novel frameshift insertion mutation in exon 4c (c.654 ins A) in all affected family members. This novel mutation creates a shift on the reading frame starting at codon 218 and leads to the introduction of a premature stop at codon 227.CONCLUSIONS: The segregation of the mutation with the affected phenotype and its absence in the 200 normal chromosomes suggest that it is responsible for the NF1 phenotype.
20857460,0,2010,Chemistry,An unexplored O2-involved pathway for the decarboxylation of saturated carboxylic acids by TiO2 photocatalysis: an isotopic probe study.,The aerobic decarboxylation of saturated carboxylic acids (from C(2) to C(5)) in water by TiO(2) photocatalysis was systematically investigated in this work. It was found that the split of C(1)-C(2) bond of the acids to release CO(2) proceeds sequentially (that is, a C(5) acid sequentially forms C(4) products, then C(3) and so forth). As a model reaction, the decarboxylation of propionic acid to produce acetic acid was tracked by using isotopic-labeled H(2)(18)O. As much as ≈42% of oxygen atoms of the produced acetic acids were from dioxygen ((16)O(2)). Through diffuse reflectance FTIR measurements (DRIFTS), we confirmed that an intermediate pyruvic acid was generated prior to the cut-off of the initial carboxyl group; this intermediate was evidenced by the appearance of an absorption peak at 1772 cm(-1) (attributed to C=O stretch of α-keto group of pyruvic acid) and the shift of this peak to 1726 cm(-1) when H(2)(16)O was replaced by H(2)(18)O. Consequently, pyruvic acid was chosen as another model molecule to observe how its decarboxylation occurs in H(2)(16)O under an atmosphere of (18)O(2). With the α-keto oxygen of pyruvic acid preserved in the carboxyl group of acetic acid, ≈24% new oxygen atoms of the produced acetic acid were from molecular oxygen at near 100% conversion of pyruvic acid. The other ≈76% oxygen atoms were provided by H(2)O through hole/OH radical oxidation. In the presence of conduction band electrons, O(2) can independently accomplish such C(1)-C(2) bond cleavage of pyruvic acid to generate acetic acid with ≈100% selectivity, as confirmed by an electrochemical experiment carried out in the dark. More importantly, the ratio of O(2) participation in decarboxylation increased along with the increase of pyruvic acid conversion, indicating the differences between non-substituted acids and α-keto acids. This also suggests that the O(2)-dependent decarboxylation competes with hole/OH-radical-promoted decarboxylation and depends on TiO(2) surface defects at which Ti(4c) sites are available for the simultaneous coordination of substrates and O(2).
20839799,0,2010,Inorg Chem,Nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes of azobenzene-containing ligands as dichroic dyes.,A large series of complexes has been synthesized with two chelating, Schiff base azobenzene derivatives connected linearly by coordination to a central nickel(II) or palladium(II) ion. These compounds have the general formulas M(II)(OC(6)H(3)-2-CHNR-4-N═NC(6)H(4)-4-CO(2)Et)(2) [M = Ni; R = n-Bu (3c), n-C(6)H(13) (3d), n-C(8)H(17) (3e), n-C(12)H(25) (3f), Ph (3g), OH (3h), C(6)H(4)-4-CO(2)Et (3i). M = Pd; R = i-Pr (4a), t-Bu (4b), n-Bu (4c), n-C(6)H(13) (4d), n-C(8)H(17) (4e), n-C(12)H(25) (4f), Ph (4g)], M(II)[OC(6)H(3)-2-CHN(n-C(8)H(17))-4-N═NC(6)H(4)-4-CO(2)(n-C(8)H(17))](2) [M = Ni (9), Pd (10)], M(II)[OC(6)H(3)-2-CHN(n-C(8)H(17))-4-N═NC(6)H(4)-4-C(6)H(4)-4-O(n-C(7)H(15))](2) [M = Ni (14), Pd (15)], and M(II)[OC(6)H(3)-2-CHN(CMe(2))-4-N═NC(6)H(4)-4-CO(2)Et](2) [M = Ni (17), Pd (18); the CMe(2) groups are connected]. These compounds have been characterized by using various physical techniques including (1)H NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Single-crystal X-ray structures have been obtained for two pro-ligands and five complexes (3e, 4e, 14, 15, and 17). The latter always show a strictly square planar arrangement about the metal center, except for the Ni(II) complex of a salen-like ligand (17). In solution, broadened (1)H NMR signals indicate distortions from square planar geometry for the bis-chelate Ni(II) complexes. Electronic absorption spectroscopy and ZINDO_S (Zerner's intermediate neglect of differential overlap) and TD-DFT (time-dependent density functional theory) calculations show that the lowest energy transition has metal-to-ligand charge-transfer character. The λ(max) of this band lies in the range of 409-434 nm in dichloromethane, and replacing Ni(II) with Pd(II) causes small blue-shifts. Dichroic ratios measured in various liquid crystal hosts show complexation-induced increases with Ni(II), but using Pd(II) has a detrimental effect.
20822833,0,2010,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and anti-tubercular and antimicrobial activities of some 2r,4c-diaryl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one N-isonicotinoylhydrazone derivatives.,In this study, seven 2r,4c-diaryl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one N-isonicotinoylhydrazones 8-14 were synthesized. The structure and stereochemistry of these compounds were established by IR and NMR spectral data. The purities were checked by elemental analysis. The synthesized compounds adopt twin-chair conformation with equatorial orientations of the aryl groups. The compounds were evaluated for their in vitro anti-tubercular and antimicrobial activities. The initial screen was conducted against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv (ATTCC 27294) and INH-TB by luciferase reporter phage assay method. All the synthesized compounds showed very good activity against MTB and INH-TB. Though all the compounds showed good antimicrobial activity only 11 (Ar = p-chlorophenyl), 12 (Ar = p-fluorophenyl), 13 (Ar = m-chlorophenyl) and 14 (Ar = m-methoxyphenyl) exhibited activity against all the tested (bacterial and fungal) microorganisms. The results suggest that the formation of hydrogen bonds may play a significant role in drug action.
20815333,0,2010,Inorg Chem,Diphenyl(1-naphthyl)phosphine ancillary for assembling of red and orange-emitting Ir(III) based phosphors; strategic synthesis, photophysics, and organic light-emitting diode fabrication.,Treatment of a series of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes [(fnazo)(2)Ir(μ-Cl](2), [(fpiq)(2)Ir(μ-Cl](2), and [(fppy)(2)Ir(μ-Cl](2) with diphenyl(1-naphthyl)phosphine (dpnH) in decalin at 100 °C afforded the simple adducts, trans-N,N'-[(fnazo)(2)Ir(dpnH)Cl] (1a), trans-N,N'-[(fpiq)(2)Ir(dpnH)Cl] (1b), and trans-N,N'-[(fppy)(2)Ir(dpnH)Cl] (1c), for which the C(∧)N cyclometalating reagents, that is, fnazoH, fpiqH and fppyH, stands for 4-(4-fluorophenyl)quinazoline, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)isoquinoline and 4-fluorophenylpyridine, respectively. Single crystal X-ray diffraction study on 1a revealed existence of two trans-N,N' cyclometalates, with both chloride and dpnH donors located at the positions opposite to the phenyl substituents. Subsequent heating of 1a-1c at higher temperature afforded the second isomer (2a-2c), showing formation of cis-N,N' orientation for the aforementioned cyclometalates. Further thermolysis of either trans or cis-Ir(III) complexes 1 or 2 in presence of sodium acetate, which serves as both activator and chloride scavenger, gave successful isolation of a mixture of two fully cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes trans-N,N'-[(C(∧)N)(2)Ir(dpn)] (3a-3c) and cis-N,N'-[(C(∧)N)(2)Ir(dpn)] (4a-4c). Structural and photophysical properties of complexes 3a-3c and 4a-4c were measured and compared. Time-dependent density functional theory (DFT) studies suggested that, upon changing the C(∧)N cyclometalates from quinazolinyl, isoquinolinyl, and, finally, to pyridyl fragment, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are gradually shifted from the cyclometalating nitrogen heterocycles to the 1-naphthyl group of the phosphine chelate and, concomitantly altered the photophysical properties. An organic light-emitting diode (OLED) using orange-red phosphors 4a and 4b has been successfully fabricated. At the practical brightness of 500 cd·m(-2), decent external quantum efficiency of 10.6% and 12.5% could be reached for 4a and 4b, respectively, revealing the usefulness of relevant molecular architecture in designing triplet OLED emitters.
20814097,0,2010,Acta Crystallogr C,[Cr(8)(PhCO(2))(16)O(4)].4CH(3)CN.2H(2)O: structural origin of magnetic anisotropy in a molecular spin cluster.,The Cr(4)O(4) hetero-cubane-centered octachromium(III) cluster [Cr(8)(PhCO(2))(16)O(4)] crystallizes from fluorobenzene-acetonitrile as dodeca-mu(2)-benzoato-tetrabenzoatotetra-mu(4)-oxido-octachromium(III) acetonitrile tetrasolvate dihydrate, [Cr(8)(C(7)H(5)O(2))(16)O(4)].4C(2)H(3)N.2H(2)O, (I). Crystals produced by this method are significantly more stable than the originally published dichloromethane pentasolvate, [Cr(8)(PhCO(2))(16)O(4)].5CH(2)Cl(2) [Atkinson et al. (1999). Chem. Commun. pp. 285-286], leading to a significantly higher quality structure and allowing the production of large quantities of high-quality nondeuterated and deuterated material suitable for inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. Compound (I) reveals a higher symmetry structure in which the cluster sits on a twofold rotation axis, and is based on an asymmetric unit containing four crystallographically independent Cr positions, two oxide ligands, eight benzoate ligands, two acetonitrile solvent molecules and one disordered water molecule. All the Cr atoms are six-coordinate, with an octahedral geometry for the inner cubane and a more highly distorted coordination environment in the outer positions. Despite the higher symmetry, the coordination geometries observed in (I) are largely similar to the dichloromethane pentasolvate structure, indicating that crystal-packing effects have little influence on the molecular structure of [Cr(8)(PhCO(2))(16)O(4)]. Close structural analysis reveals that the high magnetic anisotropy observed in the INS measurements is a consequence of the distorted coordination geometry of the four outer Cr atoms.
20812743,0,2010,J Am Chem Soc,Synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of strained nickel-, palladium-, and platinum-bridged [1]ferrocenophanes.,The group 10 bis(phosphine)metalla[1]ferrocenophanes, [{Fe(η(5)-C(5)H(4))(2)}M(Pn-Bu(3))(2)] [M = Ni (4a), Pd (4b), and Pt (4c)], have been prepared by the reaction of Li(2)[Fe(η(5)-C(5)H(4))(2)]·tmeda (5, tmeda = N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) with trans-[MCl(2)(Pn-Bu(3))(2)] [M = Ni (trans-6a) and Pd (trans-6b)] and cis-[PtCl(2)(Pn-Bu(3))(2)] (cis-6c), respectively. Single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed highly tilted, strained structures as characterized by α angles of 28.4° (4a), 24.5° (4b), and 25.2° (4c) and a distorted square planar environment for the group 10 metal center. UV/visible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry indicated that all three compounds had smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps and were more electron-rich in nature than ferrocene and other comparable [1]ferrocenophanes. DFT calculations suggested that these differences were principally due to the electron-releasing nature of the M(Pn-Bu(3))(2) metal-ligand fragments. Attempts to induce thermal or anionic ring-opening polymerization of 4a-c were unsuccessful and were complicated by, for example, competing ligand dissociation processes or unfavorable chain propagation. In contrast, these species all reacted rapidly with acids effecting clean extrusion of the bis(phosphine)metal fragment. Carbon monoxide inserted cleanly into one of the palladium-carbon bonds of 4b to afford the ring-expanded, acylated product [{Fe(η(5)-C(5)H(4))(η(5)-C(5)H(4))(CO)}Pd(Pn-Bu(3))(2)] (10). The nickel analogue 4a, however, afforded [Ni(CO)(2)(Pn-Bu(3))(2)] whereas the platinum-bridged complex 4c was inert. Remarkably, all compounds 4a-c were readily oxidized by elemental sulfur to afford the [5,5']bicyclopentadienylidene (pentafulvalene) complexes [{η(4):η(0)-C(5)H(4)(C(5)H(4))}M(Pn-Bu(3))(2)] [M = Ni (11a)] and [(η(2)-C(10)H(8))M(Pn-Bu(3))(2)] [M = Pd (11b) and Pt (11c)] by a formal 4-electron oxidation of the carbocyclic ligands. Compounds 11b and 11c represent the first examples of [5,5']bicyclopentadienylidene as a neutral η(2)-ligand. The relative energies of η(2)-coordination with respect to that of η(4):η(0) bonding were investigated for 11a-c by DFT calculations.
20803622,0,2010,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4''-O-carbamoyl erythromycin-A derivatives.,Novel 4''-O-carbamoyl erythromycin-A derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their in-vitro antibacterial activities. All of the 4''-O-carbamoyl derivatives showed excellent activity against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC49619. Most of the 4''-O-arylalkylcarbamoyl derivatives displayed potent activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the mef gene and greatly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm gene or the erm and mef genes. In particular, the 4''-O-arylalkyl derivatives 4c-4e and 4g were found to possess the most potent activity against all the tested erythromycin-susceptible strains, which were comparable to those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin. 4''-O-Arylalkyl derivatives 4e and 4g were the most effective against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the mef gene (0.25 and 0.25 microg/mL). 4''-O-Arylalkyl derivatives 4a and 4b exhibited significantly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm gene. In contrast, the 4''-O-alkylcarbamoyl derivatives hardly showed improved activity against all the tested erythromycin-resistant strains.
20737504,0,2010,Dev Dyn,Conservation, expression, and knockdown of zebrafish plxnb2a and plxnb2b.,In mice lacking Plexin B2, a receptor of the axon guidance molecules Semaphorin 4C and Semaphorin 4D, the closure of the neural tube and structural organization of the cerebellum are severely impaired. We cloned two Plexin B2 orthologs, plxnb2a and plxnb2b, in zebrafish, which is a widely used model for the development of the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). The predicted proteins, Plexin B2a and Plexin B2b, contain all the conserved and functional domains of the plexin B-subfamily. During embryonic development, plxnb2a is expressed, e.g., in pharyngeal arches while plxnb2b expression is more confined to neuronal structures like the cerebellum. However, both plxnb2a and plxnb2b are expressed at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, in the otic vesicles, facial ganglia, and pectoral fins. Knockdown of both plxnb2a and plxnb2b simultaneously (&gt;95% and 45%, respectively) resulted in normal CNS structure, axon guidance and swimming performance of the morphants.
20692834,0,2010,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Discovery of biphenylketones as dual modulators of inflammation and bone loss.,Biphenylketones were identified as novel inhibitors of NFkappaB activation. Structure-activity studies led to the identification of compound 4c, which had good potency against osteoclasts (IC50=0.8 microM), showed oral activity, and was able to completely prevent inflammation and bone loss in vivo.
20657494,0,2010,Molecules,Thionation of some alpha,beta-unsaturated steroidal ketones.,The reactions of selected alpha,beta-unsaturated steroidal ketones with Lawesson's reagent (LR) in CH(2)Cl(2) and toluene under the standard reaction conditions and with a combination of phosphorus pentasulfide with hexamethyldisiloxane (P(4)S(10)/HMDO) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) under microwave irradiation were investigated and for this purpose several cholestane, androstane and pregnane carbonyl derivatives were chosen. Depending on the reagent and the solvent, 19 new sulfur containing compounds, including dithiones 4c and 4d, alpha,beta-unsaturated 3-thiones 3a-e, dimer-sulfides 2a-e, 1,2,4-trithiolanes 5a-e and phosphonotrithioates 6b-e were synthesized. All newly prepared compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H- and (13)C-NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis.
20636331,0,2010,Chem Biol Drug Des,Structural combination of established 5-HT(2A) receptor ligands: new aspects of the binding mode.,MH.MZ, MDL 100907, and altanserin are structurally similar 4-benzoyl-piperidine derivatives and are well accommodated to receptor interaction models. We combined structural elements of different high-affinity and selective 5-HT(2A) antagonists, as MH.MZ, altanserin, and SR 46349B, to improve the binding properties of new compounds. Three new derivatives were synthesized with a 4-benzoyl-piperidine moiety as the lead structure. The in vitro affinity of the novel compounds was determined by a [³H]MDL 100907 competition binding assay. The combination of MH.MZ and SR 46349B resulted in a compound (8) with a moderate affinity toward the 5-HT(2A) receptor (K(i) = 57 nm). The remarkably reduced affinity of other compounds (4a), (4b), and (4c) (K(i) = 411, 360 and 356 nm respectively) indicates that MH.MZ can only bind to the 5-HT(2A) receptor with the p-fluorophenylethyl residue in a sterically restricted hydrophobic binding pocket.
22247864,0,2010,J Adv Pharm Technol Res,Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of novel schiff bases of 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin 4-(3H)-one.,In the present study, novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes. The 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-one was synthesized from anthranilic acid via the 2-methyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by means of Infrared (IR), (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, Mass spectral, and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 11298)) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC 9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 46645) activities, using the paper disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by the agar streak dilution method. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(4-hydroxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4g and 4c was found to exhibit the highest anti-bacterial activity and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4k exhibited the highest anti-fungal activity.
20532269,0,2010,Dalton Trans,Syntheses of mono- and dinuclear silylplatinum complexes bearing a diphosphino ligand via stepwise bond activation of unsymmetric disilanes.,Zero-valence platinum complex [Pt(dppe)(eta(2)-C(2)H(4))] (1, dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) treated with disilanes HR(1)R(2)SiSiMe(3) (a, R(1) = R(2) = Me; b, R(1) = R(2) = Ph; c, R(1) = H, R(2) = Ph) afforded the corresponding disilanylplatinum hydrides [Pt(dppe)(H)(SiR(1)R(2)SiMe(3))] (2a-c) by oxidative addition of the Si-H bond to the platinum center. The 1,2-silyl migration in 2a,b led to the formation of bis(silyl)platinum complexes [Pt(dppe)(SiHR(1)R(2))(SiMe(3))] (3a,b) with a first-order rate constant of 7.2(2) x 10(-4) s(-1) at 25 degrees C for 2a and 3.86(4) x 10(-4) s(-1) at 40 degrees C for 2b, whereas 2c with R(1) = H followed by the transient generation of 3c dimerized rapidly to give the bis(mu-silylene)diplatinum complex [Pt(dppe)(mu-SiHPh)](2) (4c) in a mixture of cis/trans isomers. Heating of the toluene solution of 3b at 100 degrees C resulted in a similar dimerization to 4b. In addition, a trinuclear platinum complex [Pt(3)(dppe)(3)(mu(3)-SiPh)(2)] (5) with a trigonal bipyramidal Pt(3)Si(2) core arose from the reaction of 4c with 1 at 60 degrees C in toluene. Unsymmetric disilanes therefore accomplished the syntheses of various monomeric and dimeric platinum complexes via 1,2-hydrogen and silyl migration to the platinum center.
20512462,0,2010,Arch Pharm Res,Synthesis and in Vitro cytotoxic activities of 2-alkyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-2,6-diazacyclopenta[b]anthracene-5,10-diones.,A series of 2-alkyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-2,6-diazacyclopenta[b]anthracene-5,10-diones (4a-f) was synthesized and their in vitro cytotoxic activities were evaluated against six human cancer cell lines (HCT15, SK-OV-3, SNB19, A549, MCF7 and MCF7/ADR). They all appeared to be less potent than doxorubicin against all doxorubicin sensitive human cancer cell lines tested. However, these compounds retained considerable cytotoxic activity against the doxorubicin-resistant cell line MCF7/ADR, implying their therapeutic potential to treat doxorubicin-resistant tumors. The most active compound 4c was equipotent with doxorubicin against HCT15 cell line.
20462756,0,2010,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4''-O-arylalkylcarbamoyl and 4''-O-((arylalkylamino)-4-oxo-butyl)carbamoyl clarithromycin derivatives.,Novel series of novel 4''-O-arylalkylcarbamoyl and 4''-O-((arylalkylamino)-4-oxo-butyl)carbamoyl clarithromycin derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activities. These derivatives retained excellent activity against the erythromycin-susceptible strains and showed significantly improved activity against all of the tested erythromycin-resistant strains. Among them, compound 4c was the most effective (0.06 microg/mL) against Streptococcus pneumonia encoded by the erm gene and compound 4a was had the most potent activity (0.25 microg/mL) against S. pneumonia encoded by the erm and mef genes.
20451540,0,2010,Steroids,Facile synthesis of carbon-11-labeled cholesterol-based cationic lipids as new potential PET probes for imaging of gene delivery in cancer.,Gene therapy based on gene delivery is a promising strategy for the treatment of various human diseases such as cancer. Cationic lipids represent one of the important synthetic gene delivery systems. There is a great interest in imaging of gene therapy using the biomedical imaging technique positron emission tomography (PET). Carbon-11-labeled cholesterol-based cationic lipids were first designed and synthesized as new potential PET probes for imaging of gene delivery in cancer. The [(11)C-methyl]quaternary amine target tracers, N-[(11)C]methyl-N-[4-(cholest-5-en-3beta-yloxycarbonyl)butyl]pyrrolidinium iodide ([(11)C]4a), N-[(11)C]methyl-N'-[4-(cholest-5-en-3beta-yloxycarbonyl)butyl]imidazolium iodide ([(11)C]4b), N-[(11)C]methyl-N-[4-(cholest-5-en-3beta-yloxycarbonyl)butyl]piperidinium iodide ([(11)C]4c), N-[(11)C]methyl-N-[4-(cholest-5-en-3beta-yloxycarbonyl)butyl]-4-methylpiperidinium iodide ([(11)C]4d), and N-[(11)C]methyl-N-[4-(cholest-5-en-3beta-yloxycarbonyl)butyl]morpholinium iodide ([(11)C]4e), were prepared from their corresponding tertiary amine precursors with [(11)C]methyl iodide ([(11)C]CH(3)I) through N-[(11)C]methylation and isolated by a simplified solid-phase extraction (SPE) method using a Silica Sep-Pak cartridge in 50-60% radiochemical yields decay corrected to end-of-bombardment (EOB), based on [(11)C]CO(2), and 111-185GBq/mumol specific activity at the end of synthesis (EOS).
20449445,0,2010,Dalton Trans,Synthesis, characterisation and photochemistry of platinum diselenolenes.,The reaction between [Pt(PPh(3))(4)] and cycloocteno-1,2,3-selenadiazole or bis-cycloocteno-1,4-diselenin in toluene under reflux yielded the poorly soluble mononuclear platinum diselenolene [Pt(Se(2)C(8)H(12))(PPh(3))(2)], 1c. Treatment of [Pt(C(2)H(4))(PR(3))(2)] with a bis-cycloalkeno-1,4-diselenin in a mixture of 1,4-dioxane, THF and toluene under reflux led in good yield to the platinum diselenolenes [Pt(Se(2)C(n+4)H(2n+4))(PR(3))(2)] (R = Et (2), Bu (3); n = 3 (b), 4 (c)). The analogous complexes [Pt(Se(2)C(8)H(12))(L)] (L = dppm: 4c; L = dppe: 5c; L = dppp: 6c) were prepared from 1c via ligand exchange with chelating phosphines. All new compounds have been characterised by multinuclear NMR, IR and UV-visible spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and their luminescence properties have been examined. The molecular structures of [Pt(Se(2)C(7)H(10))(PEt(3))(2)] (2b), [Pt(Se(2)C(8)H(12))(PEt(3))(2)] (2c) and [Pt(Se(2)C(8)H(12))(dppm)] (4c) have been determined by X-ray crystallography.
20403702,0,2010,Bioorg Med Chem,Silica-supported fluoroboric acid (HBF(4)-SiO(2)) catalyzed highly productive synthesis of thiomorpholides as activators of l-asparaginase as well as the antioxidant agent.,An efficient solvent-free procedure for the synthesis of thiomorpholides in the presence of a catalytic amount of solid-supported fluoroboric acid (HBF(4)-SiO(2)) is described. The advantages of this method are high yields, short reaction times, ease of product isolation, low cost, and the catalyst can be recycled for a number of times without significant loss of activity. Three thiomorpholides possessing electron-donating group (4c, 4g, and 4h) were exhibiting excellent stimulatory activities against Erwinia carotovoral-asparaginase. The most potent activator, compound 4h displayed the following kinetic parameters, K(m)=75microM and V(max)=1000micromolmg(-1)min(-1) and K(A)=0.985microM. Furthermore, these compounds (4g, 4h, 4c, 4f, 4a, and 4d) have also shown promising 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) reducing antioxidant activity (21-36%) at 1mM concentration as compared to standard butylated hydroxyl anisole (72% at 1mM).
20378350,0,2010,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Symmetrical alpha-bromoacryloylamido diaryldienone derivatives as a novel series of antiproliferative agents. Design, synthesis and biological evaluation.,In a continuing study of hybrid compounds containing the alpha-bromoacryloyl moiety as potential anticancer drugs, we synthesized a novel series of hybrids 4a-h, in which this moiety was linked to a 1,5-diaryl-1,4-pentadien-3-one system. Many of the conjugates prepared (4b, 4c, 4e and 4g) demonstrated pronounced, submicromolar antiproliferative activity against four cancer cell lines. Moreover, compound 4b induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway and activated caspase-3 in a concentration-dependent manner.
20376222,0,2010,Indian J Pharm Sci,Synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of 5-iodopyrimidine analogs.,4-Substituted-5-iodo-2-benzylthiopyrimidines were prepared efficiently in three steps. 2-Benzylthiopyrimidine on iodination in presence of base gave 5-iodo-2-benzylthiopyrimidine (1), which on chlorination with excess of POCl(3) furnished 4-chloro-5-iodo-2-benzylthiopyrimidine (2). Reaction of 2 with substituted aromatic amines, 2-aminopyridine and hydrazine hydrate yielded 4-amino-5-iodo-2-benzylthiopyrimidines 3(a-e), (3f) and (3g) respectively. Further, 4-hydrazino-5-iodo-2-benzylthiopyrimidine on condensation with substituted aromatic and heterocyclic aldehydes afforded the corresponding schiff bases 4(a-h). The structure of synthesized compounds have been established by spectral studies and elemental analysis. Synthesized compounds have been screened for antimicrobial activity. Compound 3f exhibited good antifungal activity against A. niger. The compounds 4a, 4c, 4d, 4g and 4h exhibited good antibacterial activity.
20368076,0,2010,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,[One-stage repair of the interrupted aortic arch associated with cardiac anomaly].,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical experiences of one-stage repair of the interrupted aortic arch (IAA) associated with cardiac anomaly in neonates and infants.METHODS: From July 1996 to October 2008, 48 neonates or infants with IAA associated with cardiac anomaly underwent one-stage repair. There are 30 males and 18 females ranging from 0.08 to 7.00 years old (1.97 +/- 2.05) with body weight 3 - 20 (9 +/- 5) kg. 42 patients had the middle-severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), the pulmonary pressure was 61 - 106 (82 +/- 14) mm Hg and the pulmonary arterial resistance was 66 - 762 (315 +/- 259) dynxsxcm(-5). There are 40 patients with type A IAA and 8 patients with type B IAA, all patients had an associated patent ductus arteriosus, other combined malformations included ventricular septal defect (VSD) in 33 cases, atrial septal defect (ASD) in 8 cases, mitral valve insufficiency in 6 cases, tricuspid valve insufficiency in 5 cases, aortopulmonary window in 4 cases, double outlet of the right ventricule in 3 cases, mitral valve stenosis in 2 cases, and et al. the operation was performed through median sternotomy under the general anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB, the deep hypothermia with circulatory arrest, the deep hypothermia with low flow rate, or the deep hypothermia with low flow rate and circulatory arrest), the interrupted aortic arch repair was achieved with the arch anastomosis in 30 patients and with an interposition graft in 18 patients, the concomitant operations included VSD repair in 33 cases, ASD repair in 8 cases, mitral valve plasty in 7 cases, tricuspid valve plasty in 4c ases, aortopulmonary window repair in 4 cases, intraventricular baffle tube repair in 2 cases, arterial switch operation in 1 case, and et al.RESULTS: The time of the CPB and the aortic occlusion were 112 to 375 min (182 +/- 52) and 24 to 287 min (99 +/- 45) respectively. The endotracheal intubation time were 8 to 936 hours (179 +/- 133) and the ICU stay were 1 - 57 days (14 +/- 14). By echocardiograph examination after operation, the pressure gradient across the arch was obvious relieved and the combined cardiac malformations was satisfied corrected. 3 patients (3/48, 6.25%) died during the perioperative period. The cause of death included severe pulmonary hypertension crisis, dysfunction of the pulmonary or the serious low cardiac output syndrome. the main complications included reopen for bleeding in 2 cases, tracheostomy in 2 cases, the right diaphragma paralysis in 1 case, delayed sternal closure in 1 case, hydrothorax in 1 case, the severe pulmonary infection in 1 case. Physical activities of the survivals increased obviously and discharged from hospital uneventfully, all surviving patients had no late complications and death during the follow-up 3 months to 12 years.CONCLUSION: One-staged primary repair of IAA with other intracardiac anomalies can be the preferred surgical approach and safely applied with good results as to lead a better life.
20363628,0,2010,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Design of environmentally sensitive fluorescent 2'-deoxyguanosine containing arylethynyl moieties: distinction of thymine base by base-discriminating fluorescent (BDF) probe.,We have synthesized various substituted 8-arylethynylated 2'-deoxyguanosine derivatives. Among them, acetyl substituted deoxyguanosine analogue 4c showed a remarkable solvent dependent fluorescence property, that is, an intense fluorescence in non-polar solvents but extremely weak fluorescence in polar solvents like methanol. By using solvatofluorochromic deoxyguanosine analogue 4c, we have developed highly thymine (T) selective fluorescent DNA probes that can sense T opposite 4c in a target DNA regardless of the flanking sequences. We were able to demonstrate that 4c can be used as a T specific base-discriminating fluorescent (BDF) nucleoside in homogeneous fluorescence assay.
20356270,0,2010,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,Polythiophenes containing in-chain cobaltabisdicarbollide centers.,New cobalt(III) bis(dicarbollide) complexes covalently linked to two 2-oligothienyl units have been synthesized and electropolymerized in acetonitrile electrolyte in order to produce the corresponding polythiophene films containing in-chain metallic centers. The polymer films electrogenerated from the bithienyl (4b) and terthienyl (4c) derivatives display redox processes attributed to the Co(III)/Co(II) couple at ca. -1.1 V vs SCE and to the p-doping/undoping of the expected quaterthienyl and sexithienyl segments at ca. 0.8 V vs SCE. In contrast, the anodic oxidation of the thienyl (4a) derivative leads to passivation of the electrode surface. As the length of the oligothiophene substituents increases, the metallic and dicarbollide cage carbon atoms contributions in the HOMO decrease dramatically so that the highest occupied frontier orbitals of 4b and 4c can be considered as almost purely oligothiophene-based. From further UV-vis spectroscopy analysis, it is demonstrated that the polymer incorporating the sexithienyl segments is more conjugated than that with the quaterthienyl segments as the absorption maximum for the interband pi-pi* transition was observed at 410 and 448 nm for poly(4b) and poly(4c) respectively. Furthermore, these polymers display a more extended degree of conjugation than the parent oligothiophenes. Such features indicate a significant electronic delocalization through the cobaltabisdicarbollide moiety. Their conducting probe atomic force microscopy characterization indicates that poly(4b) and poly(4c) behave like heavily doped semiconductors rather than pure semiconductors. Mean conductivity values extracted from the current-voltage profiles are 1.4 x 10(-4) and 7.5 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) for poly(4b) and poly(4c), respectively. Such materials are found to be efficient for the electrocatalytic reduction of protons to dihydrogen, as exemplified for poly(4b). The overpotential for hydrogen evolution is significantly decreased by ca. 230 mV with respect to that obtained with the bare electrode (measured for a current density of 1.4 mA cm(-2) in the presence of 20 mM HBF(4)).
20334960,0,2010,Eur J Med Chem,Cytotoxic N-(fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl) (Fmoc)-dipeptides: structure-activity relationships and synergistic studies.,The synthesis and cytotoxic evaluation of a series of Fmoc-based dipeptides are described. Among the thirty compounds, 4a, 8a, 12a, 2b, 4b, 10b, 3c, 4c and 6c showed potent activity against HepG2, Hep3B, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, A549 and Ca9-22 human cancer cell lines. The most active compounds (10a and 10c) showed relatively good sensitivity toward HepG2 and Ca9-22 cell lines with IC50 values of 1.0 and 0.4 microM, respectively. Additionally, compound 10c was threefold more potent than doxorubicin, the positive control, against the Ca9-22 cell line. Furthermore, 10c showed a synergistic effect and increased the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin against the MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line. Therefore, 10c could be used as a new lead compound for therapeutic development.
20232372,0,2010,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis of new 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-one derivatives for analgesic and anti-inflammatory evaluation.,Starting from isatoic anhydrides, several new 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-one derivatives bearing chalcone or pyrazole or thiazole moieties at the third position were synthesized. The analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities for most compounds were studied at a dose level of 50 mg/kg via the acetic-acid-induced writhing-response method and carrageenan-induced edema method, respectively. The study showed that the chalcones bearing a 4-chlorophenyl group 4c or 4-nitrophenyl group 4b were the most active ones as analgesics. Both chalcone 4c and N-phenyl pyrazole bearing 4-methoxy phenyl group 5b showed a higher anti-inflammatory activity than celecoxib but still lower than that of diclofenac sodium. Moreover, the chalcone 4c has nearly the same ulcerogenic index as the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib.
20210947,0,2010,Vet Surg,Evaluation of a collagenase generated osteoarthritis biomarker in the synovial fluid from elbow joints of dogs with medial coronoid disease and unaffected dogs.,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether synovial fluid concentrations of an osteoarthritis biomarker in dysplastic canine elbows with medial coronoid disease (MCD) are elevated compared with unaffected elbows and to determine if these concentrations correlate to the degree of articular cartilage damage.STUDY DESIGN: Cross sectional clinical study.ANIMALS: Dogs (n=19; 35 elbows) with MCD and dogs (8; 16 elbows) with unaffected elbows.METHODS: Concentrations of a collagenase-generated cleavage neoepitope of type II collagen (Col2-3/4C(long mono), or C2C) in joint fluid from elbows were analyzed and compared between dogs with MCD and unaffected dogs. Correlation of C2C concentration with subjective grading of articular cartilage surface damage was also evaluated.RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) C2C concentration from MCD dogs was significantly higher (112.3+/-24.8 ng/mL) than in unaffected dogs (76.1+/-16.9 ng/mL; P&lt;.05). There was a moderate correlation between cartilage damage grade and increasing C2C concentrations (P&lt;.05, r=0.62)CONCLUSION: C2C concentrations are elevated in the synovial fluid of dogs with MCD compared with unaffected elbows, and a moderate, significant correlation was identified between these concentrations and subjective grading of articular cartilage damage.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This preliminary data suggest that C2C concentrations in synovial fluid may have potential as a biomarker for diagnosis of articular cartilage damage associated with MCD and as a means of objectively determining the degree of articular cartilage damage.
20207093,0,2010,J Pharm Biomed Anal,Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based structural analysis of soyasaponin Ab metabolites by human fecal microflora.,Soyasaponin Ab, a major constituent of soybean by human intestinal microflora, was anaerobically incubated with fecal suspensions from ten individuals for 48 h and its metabolites were measured by LC-MS/MS analysis. Ten metabolites were detected. The spectra of the parental constituent soyasaponin Ab showed a peak at m/z 1435 [M-H](-) ion and those of its nine metabolites showed peaks at m/z 1310.0 [M-3C(2)H(2)O-H](-) ion, m/z 1267.9 [M-4C(2)H(2)O-H](-) ion, m/z 1105.3 [M-Glc-4C(2)H(2)O-H](-) ion, m/z 973.2 [M-Glc-Ara-4C(2)H(2)O-H](-) ion, m/z 943.4 [M-2Glc-4C(2)H(2)O-H](-) ion, m/z 811.1 [M-2Glc-Ara-4C(2)H(2)O-H](-) ion, m/z 781.2 [M-2Glc-Gal-4C(2)H(2)O-H](-) ion, m/z 649.0 [M-2Glc-Gal-Ara-4C(2)H(2)O-H](-) ion, and m/z 458.8 [Soyasapogenol A+H](+) ion. Metabolic activity varied significantly between individuals. The metabolic pathway was classified into two groups: the first group potently produced soyasapogenol A and the second group accumulated soyasapogenol A 3-beta-D-glucuronide.
20183580,0,2010,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,Synthesis and in vitro antitumor activity of new substituted thiopyrimidine acyclic nucleosides and their thioglycoside analogs.,Some new thiopyrimidine acyclic nucleosides and thioglycoside derivatives 3a-c, 4a-c, 6a,b, and 7a,b were synthesized. The cytotoxicity and antitumor evaluation of all prepared compounds have been tested in vitro against Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma cell line and their activity against glutathione peroxidase and catalase were reported. The role of the prepared compounds as free radical regulators and the therapeutic antitumor effect of a balanced generation of free radicals are discussed. Compounds 2, 3b, 3c, 4a, and 4c inhibited significantly in a dose dependent manner the growth of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells while the other compounds did not show any antitumor activity even at higher concentrations.
20180325,0,2010,Pak J Biol Sci,Survey of Listeria monocytogenes and other Listeria sp. contamination in different common ready-to-eat food products in Jordan.,Incidence and contamination levels of different Listeria monocytogenes serovars and different Listeria sp. in 360 samples of common ready-to-eat food products in Jordan were investigated. The presence of L. monocytogenes was determined using EN ISO protocol and confirmed using PCR technique. Five Listeria sp.: L. monocytogenes, L. innocua, L. ivanovvi, L. welshimeri and L. seeligeri were isolated. L. monocytogenes was isolated from 19 samples (5.3%), from 6 RTE dairy samples; 6 RTE vegetables samples and 4 traditional dishes samples and 3 miscellaneous samples. L. innocua and L. ivanovvi were the most and least frequently isolated species, 24 and 3 samples, respectively. L. welshimeri was isolated from 8 samples and L. seeligeri from 7 samples. The contamination levels of L. monocytogenes were found to be &lt; or = 100 CFU g(-1) in 84.2% (16 samples) of the positive samples. Only 15.8% (3 samples; 1 vegetable, 1 traditional dish and 1 miscellaneous samples) of the positive samples were found with counts &gt;100 CFU g(-1). L. monocytogenes strains isolated fell into 2 serotype, 1 and 4 and to 5 different serovars, 1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c, 4a, 4c.
20179858,0,2010,Dalton Trans,Amidomethylation of elemental tellurium: synthesis and solid state structures of N-substituted amidomethyltellurium(IV &amp; II) derivatives.,Amidomethylation of Te(0) (elemental tellurium) as well as Te(II) (aryltellurium bromide, in situ) proceeds readily under mild conditions. It involves oxidative insertion of low valent tellurium into the C-Br bond of N-substituted alpha-bromoacetamides and provides a direct synthetic route to the stable, crystalline amidomethyltellurium(IV) dibromides, (RR'NCOCH(2))(2)TeBr(2) (RR'N = Et(2)N (1b), MePhN (2b), Me(c-Hex)N (3b), O(CH(2)CH(2))(2)N (4b)) and (Et(2)NCOCH(2))ArTeBr(2) (Ar = mesityl, 5b; 1-naphthyl, 6b). Biphasic bisulfite reduction of the dialkyltellurium dibromides afforded yellow to orange coloured amido functionalized symmetrical telluroethers, (RR'NCOCH(2))(2)Te (RR'N = Et(2)N (1), MePhN (2), Me(c-Hex)N (3), O(CH(2)CH(2))(2)N (4)), of which compound 2 was isolated as a crystalline solid. Oxidation of the new dialkyltelluroethers with dihalogens (Br(2), I(2)) or SO(2)Cl(2) afforded the corresponding amidomethyltellurium(IV) dihalides, (RR'NCOCH(2))(2)TeX(2) (RR'N = Et(2)N, X = Cl (1a), Br (1b), I (1c); RR'N = MePhN, X = Cl (2a), Br (2b), I (2c); RR'N = Me(c-Hex)N, X = Cl (3a), Br (3b), I (3c); RR'N = O(CH(2)CH(2))(2)N, X = Cl (4a), Br (4b), I (4c)) that were characterized by elemental analyses and multinuclear ((1)H, (13)C, (125)Te) NMR. Single crystal X-ray data on 1b, 1c, 2, 2b, 2c, 4b, 5b and 6b suggest that the N-substituted amidomethyl group acts as a small-bite chelating ligand, via intramolecular 1,4-Te...O coordination, towards the Te(IV) centre. Steric congestion around Te(IV) due to intramolecular secondary bonding interaction(s), reduced electrophilicity of Te(II) and the partial positive charge on N due to the resonating character of the amido group presumably prevents these atoms from participating in the intermolecular associative forces in the solid state. Instead, weak C-H...O and C-H...X H-bonding interactions take centre-stage in the self assembly.
20172630,0,2010,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel 5-substituted-1-(phenylsulfonyl)-2-methylbenzimidazole derivatives as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents.,A series of novel 5-substituted-1-(phenylsulfonyl)-2-methylbenzimidazole derivatives have been synthesized. The structures of these compounds were established by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, Mass spectral data and elemental analyses. Compounds were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity as well as gastric ulcerogenic effects. Derivatives 4a, 4b and 4c exhibited moderate to good anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema and acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, respectively, with low ulcerogenicity compared with the standard drug indomethacin.
20171761,0,2010,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and potential cytotoxic activity of new phenanthrylphenol-pyrrolobenzodiazepines.,New phenanthrylphenol-pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PP-PBD) conjugates have been synthesized and evaluated for their biological activity. One of the compounds 4a has been evaluated for its antiproliferative activity on 57 human tumour cell lines. The growth inhibition of 4a-c has been determined by MTT viability assay on MCF-7 cell line. Among them, 4c showed most potent growth inhibition. Based on this, an attempt was made to rationalize their mechanism of action through cell cycle analysis and DNA interaction studies. The effect of the lead compound 4c on MCF-7 cell growth associated with cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, followed by apoptosis. Our findings suggested the phenanthrylphenol-PBD conjugate 4c, which is a cyclin D1 inhibitor could be considered as a promising lead compound against breast cancer for further investigation.
20162218,0,2010,Dalton Trans,Controlled oxidation of organic sulfides to sulfoxides under ambient conditions by a series of titanium isopropoxide complexes using environmentally benign H2O2 as an oxidant.,Controlled oxidation of organic sulfides to sulfoxides under ambient conditions has been achieved by a series of titanium isopropoxide complexes that use environmentally benign H(2)O(2) as a primary oxidant. Specifically, the [N,N'-bis(2-oxo-3-R(1)-5-R(2)-phenylmethyl)-N,N'-bis(methylene-R(3))-ethylenediamine]Ti(O(i)Pr)(2) [R(1) = t-Bu, R(2) = Me, R(3) = C(7)H(5)O(2) (1b); R(1) = R(2) = t-Bu, R(3) = C(7)H(5)O(2) (2b); R(1) = R(2) = Cl, R(3) = C(7)H(5)O(2) (3b) and R(1) = R(2) = Cl, R(3) = C(6)H(5) (4b)] complexes efficiently catalyzed the sulfoxidation reactions of organic sulfides to sulfoxides at room temperature within 30 min of the reaction time using aqueous H(2)O(2) as an oxidant. A mechanistic pathway, modeled using density functional theory for a representative thioanisole substrate catalyzed by 4b, suggested that the reaction proceeds via a titanium peroxo intermediate 4c', which displays an activation barrier of 22.5 kcal mol(-1) (DeltaG(++)) for the overall catalytic cycle in undergoing an attack by the S atom of the thioanisole substrate at its sigma*-orbital of the peroxo moiety. The formation of the titanium peroxo intermediate was experimentally corroborated by a mild ionization atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) mass spectrometric technique.
20110769,0,2010,Aging Clin Exp Res,Prevalence of vertebral fracture in postmenopausal women with lumbar osteopenia using MorphoXpress® (OSTEOXPRESS Study).,BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vertebral fracture (VF) is the most common complication of osteoporosis. However, more than half of all VF are asymptomatic and may go unnoticed, even in patients with osteoporosis. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of VF in postmenopausal women with osteopenic lumbar densitometry by means of vertebral morphometry, using the MorphoXpress® software.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an epidemiological, cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted among 289 postmenopausal women (&gt;1 year of amenorrhoea), diagnosed with lumbar osteopenia (not due to chronic treatment with corticosteroids or immobilization). Vertebral deformities ≥20% were considered as VF.RESULTS: Demographic and clinical characteristics showed mean age (±SD) 64±9 years, body mass index 27±5 kg/m2, and time from diagnosis of 2±3 years. A total of 25% of subjects had a family history of osteoporotic fracture in first-degree relatives, and 23% had previous fragility fracture. The prevalence of VF was 50% (CI 95% 44-56), the most frequent being the dorsal wedge (34%). Previous fragility fracture was a risk factor for VF (OR 3.13, p=0.0004). A total of 76.5% of patients were receiving treatment, mainly calcium and vitamin D supplements (70%) and bisphosphonates (27%).CONCLUSIONS: MorphoXpress® revealed that 50% of postmenopausal women with osteopenic lumbar densitometry showed VF. This result is important since only 7% of all evaluated subjects had previously been diagnosed with VF.
20102169,0,2010,J Nat Prod,Caste-specific tyramides from Myrmicine ants.,Analysis of the extracts of male ants of Monomorium minimum and Monomorium ebeninum by GC-MS and GC-FTIR revealed the presence of tyramides 2 and 4c, for which the structures were established by comparison with synthetic samples. These compounds and their analogues 1 and 3 were also found in males of other Monomorium species, males of Myrmicaria opaciventris, and males of several Solenopsis (Diplorhoptrum) species. Vapor-phase FTIR spectra revealed critically important structural clues to two of the tyramides, which had methyl branching in the tyramide acyl moiety. Tyramide 4c exhibited a strong intramolecular amide NH hydrogen bond where an alpha-keto group was deduced to be present in the acyl moiety and also showed the overlap of this ketone group frequency with that of the amide nu(C horizontal lineO). The biological function of these compounds is uncertain; however, their role in ant-mating behavior may be suggested by a large body of evidence.
20099285,0,2010,Chemistry,Resolution of the first nonracemic diquats.,Three tricyclic diquats with an eight-membered ring were prepared and shown to be the first configurationally stable derivatives of their kind. Resolution was achieved by using chiral hexacoordinated phosphorus BINPHAT and TRISPHAT anions. The diquat cations were obtained in high diastereo- and enantiomeric purity (ee&gt;96% in most cases). X-ray diffraction analysis coupled with circular dichroism (CD) measurements allowed a precise determination of the relative and absolute configuration of the salts. The barriers to racemization of these compounds were calculated by using CD time-course measurements at different temperatures, affording DeltaG(++) values above 25 kcal mol(-1). Derivatives 4a, 4b, and 4c are the first eight-membered-ring derivatives with only three ring constraints to be resolved. This manuscript also reports the first procedure to remove TRISPHAT anions after diastereomeric separation.
20098935,0,2010,Neotrop Entomol,[Dipterans of forensic interest in two vegetation profiles of cerrado in Uberlândia, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil].,Carrion breeding insects may be of great utility in crimes briefing. Studies on forensic entomology are restricted to few localities in Brazil and very few of them were done in the cerrado vegetation (a type of Savannah) until now. This work aimed to survey the main species of dipterans associated with the decomposition process of Sus scrofa and the insect succession pattern in carcasses in the Cerrado. The study was carried out in the dry and humid season of the year, in two cerrado vegetation profiles in Uberlândia, MG. Two pig carcasses were placed in each vegetation profile and time period of the year. The decomposition process was slower and insects were more abundant in the dry season. Differences in temperature, air humidity and pluvial precipitation seemed to be the main physical factors responsible for the differences in the time of decomposition of the pig carcasses between the two seasons. Fourteen species of dipterans (59,467 specimens) bred in the decomposing carcasses. Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) was the species more abundantly breed in the two periods. The other species that breed in the carcasses were: C. putoria (Wiedemann), Hemilucilia segmentaria(Fabricius), Lucilia eximia(Wiedemann) (Calliphoridae), Peckia (Pattonella) intermutans(Walker), Peckia (Squamatoides) trivitatta(Curran), Sarcodexia lambens(Wiedemann) (Sarcophagidae), Musca domestica(L.), Ophyra aenescens(Wiedemann), Stomoxys calcitransL. (Muscidae), Fannia pusio(Wiedemann), Fannia sp. (Fanniidae), Hermetia illuscens L. (Stratiomyidae) and Phoridae sp. The Cerrado of this region presents many dipterans potential forensic indicators.
20098561,0,2010,J Med Phys,First year experience with newly developed Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion.,A new model of Leksell Gamma Knife(R) (LGK), known as Perfexion (LGK PFX), was introduced by Elekta Instrument, AB, Sweden, in 2006. This model has a radically different design from the earlier models U, B, C and 4C. Dosimetric characteristics of LGK PFX, technical differences between LGK PFX and LGK 4C, experience gained with acceptance testing and commissioning of the LGK PFX, and comparison between LGK PFX and LGK 4C are presented in this study. Excellent agreement is found between the manufacturers recommended values of absorbed dose rate, relative output factors for 4 and 8 mm collimators, coincidence of mechanical and dosimetric isocenter, FWHM for beam profiles for various collimators and those reported in the present study. Excellent agreement is also found between the dosimetric characteristics of LGK PFX and LGK 4C for the 4 and 8 mm collimators. Examples of clinical cases treated with LGK PFX and impact of LGK PFX on workflow and dosimetric conformity of treatment planning is also given. The set up and treatment of patients on the LGK PFX is much more efficient since it is a fully automated system. The system also provides more options to generate plan with high dosimetric conformity.
20072886,0,2010,Methods Mol Biol,A &quot;dock and lock&quot; approach to preparation of targeted liposomes.,We developed a strategy for covalent coupling of targeting proteins to liposomes decorated with a standard adapter protein. This strategy is based on &quot;dock and lock&quot; the interactions between two mutated fragments of human RNase I, a 1-15-aa fragment with the R4C amino acid substitution, (Cys-tag), and a 21-127-aa fragment with the V118C substitution, (Ad-C). Upon binding to each other, Cys-tag and Ad-C spontaneously form a disulfide bond between the complimentary 4C and 118C residues. Therefore, any targeting protein expressed with Cys-tag can be easily coupled to liposomes decorated with Ad-C. Here, we describe the preparation of Ad-liposomes followed by coupling them to two Cys-tagged targeted proteins, human vascular endothelial growth factor expressed with N-terminal Cys-tag, and a 254-aa long N-terminal fragment of anthrax lethal factor carrying C-terminal Cys-tag. Both proteins retain functional activity after coupling to Ad-C-decorated drug-loaded liposomes. We expect that our &quot;dock and lock&quot; strategy will open new opportunities for development of targeted therapeutic liposomes for research and clinical use.
21589077,0,2010,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,Tetra-imidazolium piperazinediium bis-(benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxyl-ate) dihydrate.,During the crystallization of the title compound, 4C(3)H(5)N(2) (+)·C(4)H(12)N(2) (+)·2C(9)H(3)O(6) (3-)·2H(2)O, the acidic protons were transferred to the imidazole and piperazine N atoms, forming the final 4:1:2:2 hydrated mixed salt. The mean planes of the three carboxyl-ate groups in the anion are twisted with respect to the the central benzene ring, making dihedral angles of 13.5 (1), 14.5 (1) and 16.9 (1)°. In the crystal, the component ions are linked into a three-dimensional network by a combination of inter-molecular N-H⋯O, O-H⋯O and weak C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds. Further stabilization is provided by π-π stacking inter-actions with centroid-centroid distances of 3.393 (2) Å and weak C=O⋯π inter-actions [O-centroid = 3.363 (2) Å].
21587865,0,2010,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,1,3,5,7-Tetra-kis(4-iodo-phen-yl)adamantane benzene tetra-solvate.,The title mol-ecule, C(34)H(28)I(4)·4C(6)H(6), has crystallographic symmetry and crystallizes with four symmetry-related benzene solvent mol-ecules. The phenyl group is eclipsed with one of the adamantane C-C bonds. The tetra-phenyl-adamantane units and the benzene solvent mol-ecules are connected by weak inter-molecular phen-yl-benzene C-H⋯π and benzene-benzene C-H⋯π inter-actions. In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked along the c-axis direction via the iodo-phenyl groups by a combination of weak inter-molecular I⋯I [3.944 (1) Å] and I⋯π(phen-yl) [3.608 (6) and 3.692 (5) Å] inter-actions.

19559093,36,2009,Semin Cell Dev Biol,Genomic interactions: chromatin loops and gene meeting points in transcriptional regulation.,The chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique and its genome-wide applications ('4C') have identified a plethora of distal DNA sequences that are frequently in close spatial proximity. In many cases, these have been correlated with transcriptional regulation of the interacting genes, but the functional significance of many of the extreme long-range and interchromosomal interactions remains unclear. This review summarises our current understanding of how chromatin conformation can impinge on gene expression, the major questions that need to be addressed to understand this more fully, and how these questions may be answered in the near future.
19776262,24,2009,J Neurosci,NA,Achromatic visual information is transferred from the retina to the brain through two parallel channels: ON-center cells carry &quot;white&quot; information and OFF-center cells &quot;black&quot; information (Nelson et al., 1978; Schiller, 1982; Schiller et al., 1986). Responses of ON and OFF retinal and thalamic neurons are approximately equal in magnitude (Krüger and Fischer, 1975; Kremers et al., 1993), but psychophysical studies have shown that humans detect light decrements (black) better and faster than increments (white) (Blackwell, 1946; Short, 1966; Krauskopf, 1980; Whittle, 1986; Bowen et al., 1989; Chan and Tyler, 1992; Kontsevich and Tyler, 1999; Chubb and Nam, 2000; Dannemiller and Stephens, 2001). From recordings of single-cell activity in the macaque monkey's primary visual cortex (V1), we found that black-dominant neurons substantially outnumbered white-dominant neurons in the corticocortical output layers 2/3, but the numbers of black- and white-dominant neurons were nearly equal in the thalamocortical input layer 4c. These results strongly suggest that the black-over-white preference is generated or greatly amplified in V1. The predominance of OFF neurons in layers 2/3 of V1, which provide visual input to higher cortical areas, may explain why human subjects detect black more easily than white. Furthermore, our results agree with human EEG and fMRI findings that V1 responses to decrements are stronger than to increments, though the OFF/ON imbalance we found in layers 2/3 of macaque V1 is much larger than in the whole V1 population in the human V1 experiments (Zemon et al., 1988, 1995; Olman et al., 2008).
19588093,22,2009,Methods Mol Biol,Chromosome conformation capture (from 3C to 5C) and its ChIP-based modification.,Chromosome conformation capture (3C) methodology was developed to study spatial organization of long genomic regions in living cells. Briefly, chromatin is fixed with formaldehyde in vivo to cross-link interacting sites, digested with a restriction enzyme and ligated at a low DNA concentration so that ligation between cross-linked fragments is favored over ligation between random fragments. Ligation products are then analyzed and quantified by PCR. So far, semi-quantitative PCR methods were widely used to estimate the ligation frequencies. However, it is often important to estimate the ligation frequencies more precisely which is only possible by using the real-time PCR. At the same time, it is equally necessary to monitor the specificity of PCR amplification. That is why the real-time PCR with TaqMan probes is becoming more and more popular in 3C studies. In this chapter, we describe the general protocol for 3C analysis with the subsequent estimation of ligation frequencies by using the real-time PCR technology with TaqMan probes. We discuss in details all steps of the experimental procedure paying special attention to weak points and possible ways to solve the problems. A special attention is also paid to the problems in interpretation of the results and necessary control experiments. Besides, in theory, we consider other approaches to analysis of the ligation products used in frames of the so-called 4C and 5C methods. The recently developed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-loop assay representing a combination of 3C and ChIP is also discussed.
19820713,20,2009,Nat Methods,High-resolution identification of balanced and complex chromosomal rearrangements by 4C technology.,Balanced chromosomal rearrangements can cause disease, but techniques for their rapid and accurate identification are missing. Here we demonstrate that chromatin conformation capture on chip (4C) technology can be used to screen large genomic regions for balanced and complex inversions and translocations at high resolution. The 4C technique can be used to detect breakpoints also in repetitive DNA sequences as it uniquely relies on capturing genomic fragments across the breakpoint. Using 4C, we uncovered LMO3 as a potentially leukemogenic translocation partner of TRB@. We developed multiplex 4C to simultaneously screen for translocation partners of multiple selected loci. We identified unsuspected translocations and complex rearrangements. Furthermore, using 4C we detected translocations even in small subpopulations of cells. This strategy opens avenues for the rapid fine-mapping of cytogenetically identified translocations and inversions, and the efficient screening for balanced rearrangements near candidate loci, even when rearrangements exist only in subpopulations of cells.
19697936,18,2009,J Am Chem Soc,Gold-catalyzed [4C+2C] cycloadditions of allenedienes, including an enantioselective version with new phosphoramidite-based catalysts: mechanistic aspects of the divergence between [4C+3C] and [4C+2C] pathways.,Gold(I) complexes featuring electron acceptor ligands such as phosphites and phosphoramidites catalyze the [4C+2C] intramolecular cycloaddition of allenedienes. The reaction is chemo- and stereoselective, and provides trans-fused bicyclic cycloadducts in good yields. Moreover, using novel chiral phosphoramidite-based gold catalysts it is possible to perform the reaction with excellent enantioselectivity. Experimental and theoretical data dismiss a cationic mechanism involving intermediate II and suggest that the formation of the [4C+2C] cycloadducts might arise from a 1,2-alkyl migration (ring contraction) in a cycloheptenyl Au-carbene intermediate (IV), itself arising from a [4C+3C] concerted cycloaddition of the allenediene. Therefore, these [4C+2C] allenediene cycloadditions and the previously reported [4C+3C] counterparts most likely share such cycloaddition step, differing in the final 1,2-migration step.
19671461,18,2009,Alcohol,Opioid antagonists block the acquisition of ethanol-mediated conditioned tactile preference in infant rats.,It has been difficult to find conditioned preference for tactile cues paired with ethanol intoxication in rats. Toward understanding the ontogeny of ethanol reinforcement, we aimed at establishing a simple and reliable procedure for (1) assessing primary appetitive conditioning to ethanol in infant rats and (2) discerning the role the opioid system plays in ethanol-mediated conditioning at this age. Experiment 1 determined the parameters (i.e., dose, interval of conditioning) for assessing ethanol-mediated conditioning. Pups were then trained with differential Pavlovian conditioning (Experiments 2 and 3) in which ethanol intoxication (1.0-2.0 g/kg, intragastrically or intraperitoneally delivered) was paired with a tactile stimulus (sandpaper) while an alternative texture signaled the absence of ethanol's effects. Unpaired control conditions were also used. Tactile preferences were assessed after two conditioning sessions. Paired rats spent significantly more time on sandpaper than unpaired controls, an effect that was greater after intragastric administration of 1.0 than 2.0 g/kg ethanol. This effect was replicated in Experiments 4a and 4c and found to be inhibited by pretreatment with general (naloxone [NAL]) or specific (d-Pen-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 [CTOP] and naltrindole) opioid antagonists. Blood ethanol levels at conditioning were not altered by NAL (Experiment 4b). The study outlines a procedure that reveals appetitive conditioning to ethanol by infant rats. The results are discussed in terms of a potential ethanol-induced activation of the endogenous opioid system during the onset of the intoxication process.
19620183,16,2009,J Exp Bot,Germination of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds is not completed as a result of elongation of the radicle but of the adjacent transition zone and lower hypocotyl.,The completion of germination of seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana is marked by the appearance of the radicle through the surrounding endosperm and testa. Using confocal microscopy and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transformed embryos to highlight the epidermal cell walls it has been possible to conduct time-lapse photography of individual embryos during their germination. This reveals that the elongation of embryo cells to effect completion of germination does not occur within the radicle itself, but rather within a discrete region that is immediately proximal to the radicle. This region, identifiable as the lower hypocotyl and hypocotyl-radicle transition zone, is also definable by accumulation of carbohydrate-containing bodies during germination, and distinct GFP expression of GAL4-GFP in enhancer trap lines. Flow cytometric studies show that there is an increase in the proportion of 4C nuclei in the axis which coincides with a considerable increase in length of the hypocotyl, and the occurrence of endopolyploid (8C and 16C) nuclei accompanies the 2-fold increase in mean cell size in the region of elongation, the lower hypocotyl, and hypocotyl-radicle transition zone. Thus the observed cell elongation during germination is accompanied by an increase in nuclear DNA content, and the resultant elongation of the axis to effect radicle emergence is due to cell expansion, not to cell division. When studying the molecular events involved in the completion of germination, therefore, it may be prudent to focus on this region of elongation.
19805030,15,2009,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,SH3TC2/KIAA1985 protein is required for proper myelination and the integrity of the node of Ranvier in the peripheral nervous system.,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C (CMT4C) is an early-onset, autosomal recessive form of demyelinating neuropathy. The clinical manifestations include progressive scoliosis, delayed age of walking, muscular atrophy, distal weakness, and reduced nerve conduction velocity. The gene mutated in CMT4C disease, SH3TC2/KIAA1985, was recently identified; however, the function of the protein it encodes remains unknown. We have generated knockout mice where the first exon of the Sh3tc2 gene is replaced with an enhanced GFP cassette. The Sh3tc2(DeltaEx1/DeltaEx1) knockout animals develop progressive peripheral neuropathy manifested by decreased motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity and hypomyelination. We show that Sh3tc2 is specifically expressed in Schwann cells and localizes to the plasma membrane and to the perinuclear endocytic recycling compartment, concordant with its possible function in myelination and/or in regions of axoglial interactions. Concomitantly, transcriptional profiling performed on the endoneurial compartment of peripheral nerves isolated from control and Sh3tc2(DeltaEx1/DeltaEx1) animals uncovered changes in transcripts encoding genes involved in myelination and cell adhesion. Finally, detailed analyses of the structures composed of compact and noncompact myelin in the peripheral nerve of Sh3tc2(DeltaEx1/DeltaEx1) animals revealed abnormal organization of the node of Ranvier, a phenotype that we confirmed in CMT4C patient nerve biopsies. The generated Sh3tc2 knockout mice thus present a reliable model of CMT4C neuropathy that was instrumental in establishing a role for Sh3tc2 in myelination and in the integrity of the node of Ranvier, a morphological phenotype that can be used as an additional CMT4C diagnostic marker.
19186946,15,2009,J Med Chem,Malaria-infected mice are cured by a single oral dose of new dimeric trioxane sulfones which are also selectively and powerfully cytotoxic to cancer cells.,A new series of 6 dimeric trioxane sulfones has been prepared from the natural trioxane artemisinin in five or six chemical steps. One of these thermally and hydrolytically stable new chemical entities (4c) completely cured malaria-infected mice via a single oral dose of 144 mg/kg. At a much lower single oral dose of only 54 mg/kg combined with 13 mg/kg of mefloquine hydrochloride, this trioxane dimer 4c as well as its parent trioxane dimer 4b also completely cured malaria-infected mice. Both dimers 4c and 4b were potently and selectively cytotoxic toward five cancer cell lines.
20028792,14,2009,Hum Mol Genet,Mistargeting of SH3TC2 away from the recycling endosome causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C.,Mutations in the functionally uncharacterized protein SH3TC2 are associated with the severe hereditary peripheral neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C (CMT4C). Similarly, to other proteins mutated in CMT, a role for SH3TC2 in endocytic membrane traffic has been previously proposed. However, recent descriptions of the intracellular localization of SH3TC2 are conflicting. Furthermore, no clear functional pathogenic mechanisms have so far been proposed to explain why both nonsense and missense mutations in SH3TC2 lead to similar clinical phenotypes. Here, we describe our intracellular localization studies, supported by biochemical and functional data, using wild-type and mutant SH3TC2. We show that wild-type SH3TC2 targets to the intracellular recycling endosome by associating with the small GTPase, Rab11, which is known to regulate the recycling of internalized membrane and receptors back to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SH3TC2 interacts preferentially with the GTP-bound form of Rab11, identifying SH3TC2 as a novel Rab11 effector. Of clinical pathological relevance, all SH3TC2 constructs harbouring disease-causing mutations are shown to be unable to associate with Rab11 with consequent loss of recycling endosome localization. Moreover, we show that wild-type SH3TC2, but not mutant SH3TC2, influences transferrin receptor dynamics, consistent with a functional role on the endocytic recycling pathway. Our data therefore implicate mistargeting of SH3TC2 away from the recycling endosome as the fundamental molecular defect that leads to CMT4C.
19147683,14,2009,Hum Mol Genet,The Aurora Kinase C c.144delC mutation causes meiosis I arrest in men and is frequent in the North African population.,Infertility concerns a minimum of 70 million couples worldwide. An important proportion of cases is believed to have a genetic component, yet few causal genes have been identified so far. In a previous study, we demonstrated that a homozygous mutation (c.144delC) in the Aurora Kinase C (AURKC) gene led to the production of large-headed polyploid multi-flagellar spermatozoa, a primary infertility phenotype mainly observed in North Africans. We now want to estimate the prevalence of the defect, to improve our understanding of AURKC physiopathology in spermatogenesis and assess its implication in oogenesis. A carrier frequency of 1/50 was established from individuals from the Maghrebian general population, comparable to that of Y-microdeletions, thus far the only known recurrent genetic event altering spermatogenesis. A total of 62 patients were genotyped, all who had a typical phenotype with close to 100% large-headed spermatozoa were homozygously mutated (n = 32), whereas no AURKC mutations were detected in the others. Two homozygous females were identified; both were fertile indicating that AURKC is not indispensible in oogenesis. Previous FISH results had showed a great chromosomal heterogeneity in these patient's spermatozoa. We demonstrate here by flow cytometry that all spermatozoa have in fact a homogeneous 4C DNA content and are thus all blocked before the first meiotic division. Our data thus indicate that a functional AURKC protein is necessary for male meiotic cytokinesis while its absence does not impair oogenesis.
19744956,12,2009,Hum Mol Genet,Missense mutations in the SH3TC2 protein causing Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C affect its localization in the plasma membrane and endocytic pathway.,Mutations in SH3TC2 (KIAA1985) cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 4C, a demyelinating inherited neuropathy characterized by early-onset and scoliosis. Here we demonstrate that the SH3TC2 protein is present in several components of the endocytic pathway including early endosomes, late endosomes and clathrin-coated vesicles close to the trans-Golgi network and in the plasma membrane. Myristoylation of SH3TC2 in glycine 2 is necessary but not sufficient for the proper location of the protein in the cell membranes. In addition to myristoylation, correct anchoring also needs the presence of SH3 and TPR domains. Mutations that cause a stop codon and produce premature truncations that remove most of the TPR domains are expressed as the wild-type protein. In contrast, missense mutations in or around the region of the first-TPR domain are absent from early endosomes, reduced in plasma membrane and late endosomes and are variably present in clathrin-coated vesicles. Our findings suggest that the endocytic and membrane trafficking pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of CMT4C disease. We postulate that missense mutations of SH3TC2 could impair communication between the Schwann cell and the axon causing an abnormal myelin formation.
19777441,11,2009,J Gene Med,Engineering adeno-associated virus serotype 2-based targeting vectors using a new insertion site-position 453-and single point mutations.,BACKGROUND: Genetic modification of capsid proteins by peptide insertion has created the possibility of using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors for receptor specific gene transfer (AAV targeting). The most common site used for insertion in AAV serotype 2 capsids are amino acid positions 587 and 588 located at the second highest capsid protrusion. Reasoning that peptide insertions at the most exposed position augments target receptor interaction, we explored position 453 as a new insertion site.METHODS: Position 453 was identified in silico. Capsid mutants carrying the model ligand RGD-4C in position 453 with and without R585A/R588A substitutions were compared with respective mutants carrying the ligand in position 587. The accessibility of the inserted ligand was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas the transduction efficiency and specificity of receptor binding were assayed by gene transfer and competition experiments, respectively. Vector biodistribution was determined in mice by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis.RESULTS: Initially, RGD-4C, inserted at position 453, failed to efficiently bind its target receptor. R585 and R588, located at the neighboring peak and known to mediate primary receptor binding, were identified as interfering residues. R585A and R588A substitutions rendered position 453 mutants superior to those with the ligand in position 587 in target receptor binding and cell transduction efficiency. The in vivo biodistribution was independent of the insertion site, but directed by the inserted ligand when primary receptor binding was avoided.CONCLUSIONS: Position 453 emerged as a prominent site for the development of targeting mutants. Furthermore, we show for the first time that linearly distant residues can be critical for the efficiency of inserted peptide ligands.
19567644,11,2009,Radiology,Breast imaging reporting and data system lexicon for US: interobserver agreement for assessment of breast masses.,PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate the interobserver agreement of radiologists who used the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon to characterize and categorize ultrasonographic (US) features of breast masses.MATERIALS AND METHODS: No institutional review board approval or patient consent was required. Five breast radiologists retrospectively independently evaluated 267 breast masses (113 benign and 154 malignant masses in 267 patients) by using the BI-RADS US lexicon. Reviewers were blinded to mammographic images, medical history, and pathologic findings. Interobserver agreement was assessed with the Aickin revised kappa statistic.RESULTS: Interobserver agreement varied from fair for evaluation of mass margins (kappa = 0.36) to moderate for evaluation of lesion boundary (kappa = 0.48), echo pattern (kappa = 0.58), and posterior acoustic features (kappa = 0.47) to substantial for evaluation of mass orientation (kappa = 0.70) and shape (kappa = 0.64). For small (&lt; or =0.7 cm; n = 49) or malignant (n = 154) masses, low concordance was noted for margin descriptors (kappa = 0.30 and 0.28, respectively) and BI-RADS category (kappa = 0.21 and 0.26, respectively). Overall, only fair agreement was obtained for BI-RADS category (kappa = 0.30). Agreement for subdivisions 4a, 4b, and 4c of BI-RADS category 4 was fair (kappa = 0.33), fair (kappa = 0.32), and poor (kappa = 0.17), respectively.CONCLUSION: Reproducibility of US BI-RADS terminology is good except for margin evaluation. A trend toward lower concordance was noted for the evaluation of small masses and malignant lesions. Classification into subdivisions 4a, 4b, and 4c was poorly reproducible.
19297378,11,2009,J Antimicrob Chemother,Characterization of fluoroquinolone-resistant Shigella flexneri in Hangzhou area of China.,OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize fluoroquinolone-resistant Shigella and determine whether the qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes could contribute to sporadic shigellosis at the clinic in the Hangzhou area of China.METHODS: A total of 202 strains of Shigella (79 Shigella sonnei and 123 Shigella flexneri ) isolated from sporadic cases of shigellosis from 1998 to 2007 were analysed for their antimicrobial susceptibility. The gyrA, gyrB, parC, parE, qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes and the profiles and incompatibility of plasmids were characterized. Chromosomal DNA fingerprinting was determined by XbaI-based digestion and PFGE.RESULTS: All strains of S. sonnei were susceptible to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) while 15 out of 123 strains of S. flexneri were resistant. All of the 15 resistant strains displayed common mutations in the gyrA and parC genes and formed eight distinct groups with unique molecular characteristics. Notably, 10 isolates showed mutations at codon 87 of gyrA, and the other 5 were qnrS-positive. Two strains were positive for the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene. Importantly, this is the first report of qnrS- and aac(6')-Ib-cr-positive Shigella in China, the qnrS-positive S. flexneri serotypes 1a, 2a and 4c and the aac(6')-Ib-cr-positive S. flexneri serotypes 2a and 4c worldwide.CONCLUSIONS: The common mutations at position 83 of gyrA and position 80 of parC were crucial for resistance to nalidixic acid in S. flexneri. The mutation at position 87 of gyrA or the presence of the qnrS gene is necessary for high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in Shigella isolates from China.
19262691,11,2009,PLoS One,Intron evolution: testing hypotheses of intron evolution using the phylogenomics of tetraspanins.,BACKGROUND: Although large scale informatics studies on introns can be useful in making broad inferences concerning patterns of intron gain and loss, more specific questions about intron evolution at a finer scale can be addressed using a gene family where structure and function are well known. Genome wide surveys of tetraspanins from a broad array of organisms with fully sequenced genomes are an excellent means to understand specifics of intron evolution. Our approach incorporated several new fully sequenced genomes that cover the major lineages of the animal kingdom as well as plants, protists and fungi. The analysis of exon/intron gene structure in such an evolutionary broad set of genomes allowed us to identify ancestral intron structure in tetraspanins throughout the eukaryotic tree of life.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a phylogenomic analysis of the intron/exon structure of the tetraspanin protein family. In addition, to the already characterized tetraspanin introns numbered 1 through 6 found in animals, three additional ancient, phase 0 introns we call 4a, 4b and 4c were found. These three novel introns in combination with the ancestral introns 1 to 6, define three basic tetraspanin gene structures which have been conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Our phylogenomic approach also allows the estimation of the time at which the introns of the 33 human tetraspanin paralogs appeared, which in many cases coincides with the concomitant acquisition of new introns. On the other hand, we observed that new introns (introns other than 1-6, 4a, b and c) were not randomly inserted into the tetraspanin gene structure. The region of tetraspanin genes corresponding to the small extracellular loop (SEL) accounts for only 10.5% of the total sequence length but had 46% of the new animal intron insertions.SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that tests of intron evolution are strengthened by the phylogenomic approach with specific gene families like tetraspanins. These tests add to our understanding of genomic innovation coupled to major evolutionary divergence events, functional constraints and the timing of the appearance of evolutionary novelty.
19236188,11,2009,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Lubiprostone: chronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.,Lubiprostone is a bicyclic fatty acid metabolite analogue of prostaglandin E1. The FDA has approved lubiprostone for the treatment of chronic constipation in men and women and the treatment of women with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). Lubiprostone specifically activates type-2-chloride channels on the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Lubiprostone acts locally within the intestinal tract, is rapidly metabolized and has very low systemic bioavailability. Animal studies have demonstrated that lubiprostone increases gastrointestinal fluid secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Clinical studies performed in men and women with chronic constipation using 24 microg of lubiprostone twice-daily demonstrated objective improvement in stool frequency and consistency, as well as symptoms of straining and incomplete evacuation. A multi-center study of patients with IBS-C found that 8 microg of lubiprostone twice-daily improved both global and individual symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Lubiprostone is generally well tolerated and serious adverse events are rare. The most common reported side effects are nausea, headache and diarrhea. This monograph provides a brief overview on chloride channel function in the gastrointestinal tract, describes the structure, function, and pharmacokinetics of lubiprostone, and discusses the safety and efficacy of this new medication for the treatment of chronic constipation and IBS-C.
19581274,10,2009,J Med Genet,OPA1 increases the risk of normal but not high tension glaucoma.,BACKGROUND: Primary open angle glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy characterised by the selective loss of retinal ganglion cells, pathological optic disc cupping and visual field defects. The OPA1 gene encodes an inner mitochondrial membrane protein crucial for normal mitochondrial function, and pathogenic mutations cause autosomal dominant optic atrophy by specifically targeting retinal ganglion cells. This raises the distinct possibility that more subtle genetic variations in OPA1 could alter the risk of developing glaucoma.METHODS: 137 patients with primary open angle glaucoma (67 patients with high-tension glaucoma (HTG), 70 patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG)) and 75 controls from the North East of England were studied. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in intron 8 (IVS8+4c--&gt;t and IVS8+32t--&gt;c) and exon 4 (c.473A--&gt;G) of the OPA1 gene were genotyped in the study group. In addition, the entire OPA1 coding region was sequenced in 24 individuals with the CT/TT compound genotype using standard BigDye chemistries.RESULTS: There was no difference in either allele or genotype frequency for the IVS8+32t--&gt;c single-nucleotide polymorphisms between patients and controls, but there was a significant association between the T allele at IVS8+4c--&gt;t and the risk of developing NTG (OR=2.04, 95% CI=1.10 to 3.81, p=0.004), but not HTG. Logistic regression analysis also confirmed a strong association between the CT/TT compound genotype at IVS8+4 and IVS8+32 with NTG (OR=29.75, 95% CI=3.83 to 231.21, p=0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The CT/TT compound genotype at IVS8+4 and IVS8+32 is a strong genetic risk determinant for NTG but not HTG.
19344008,10,2009,Isr Med Assoc J,Computerized community cholesterol control (4C): meeting the challenge of secondary prevention.,BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients with coronary artery disease. The Computer-based Clinical Decision Support System provides an opportunity t close these gaps.OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of computerized intervention on secondary prevention of CAD.METHODS: The CDSS was programmed to automatically detect patients with CAD and to evaluate the availability of an updated lipoprotein profile and treatment with lipid-lowering drugs. The program produced automatic computer-generated monitoring and treatment recommendations. Adjusted primary clinics were randomly assigned to intervention (n=56) or standard care arms (n=56). Reminders were mailed to the primary medical teams in the intervention arm every 4 months updating them with current lipid levels and recommendations for further treatment. Compliance and lipid levels were monitored. The study group comprised all patients with CAD who were alive at least 3 months after hospitalization.RESULTS: Follow-up was available for 7448 patients (median 19.8 months, range 6-36 months). Overall, 51.7% of patients were adequately screened, and 55.7% of patients were compliant with treatment to lower lipid level. In patients with initial low density lipoprotein &gt;120 mg/dl, a significant decrease in LDL levels was observed in both arms, but was more pronounced in the intervention arm: 121.9 +/- 34.2 vs. 124.3 +/- 34.6 mg/dl (P &lt; 0.02). A significantly lower rate of cardiac rehospitalizations was documented in patients who were adequately treated with lipid-lowering drugs, 37% vs. 40.9% (P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: This initial assessment of our data represent a real-world snapshot where physicians and CAD patients often do not adhere to clinical guidelines, presenting a major obstacle to implementing effective secondary prevention. Our automatic computerized reminders system substantially facilitates adherence to guidelines and supports wide-range implementation.

A DFT study on dimethylallenyl precursors agreed with the formation and cycloaddition of a metal-allyl cation intermediate, and points to the 1,2-hydride shift as the key rate-limiting step.
19131939,10,2009,Obesity (Silver Spring),Validation of DXA body composition estimates in obese men and women.,The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived percentage fat estimates in obese adults by using four-compartment (4C) values as criterion measures. Differences between methods were also investigated in relation to the influence of fat-free mass (FFM) hydration and various anthropometric measurements. Six women and eight men (age 22-54 years, BMI 28.7-39.9 kg/m(2), 4C percent body fat (%BF) 31.3-52.6%) had relative body fat (%BF) determined via DXA and a 4C method that incorporated measures of body density (BD), total body water (TBW), and bone mineral mass (BMM) via underwater weighing, deuterium dilution, and DXA, respectively. Anthropometric measurements were also undertaken: height, waist and gluteal girth, and anterior-posterior (A-P) chest depth. Values for both methods were significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.894) and no significant difference (P = 0.57) was detected between the means (DXA = 41.1%BF, 4C = 41.5%BF). The slope and intercept for the regression line were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05) from 1 and 0, respectively. Although both methods were significantly correlated, intraindividual differences between the methods were sizable (4C-DXA, range = -3.04 to 4.01%BF) and significantly correlated with tissue thickness (chest depth) or most surrogates of tissue thickness (body mass, BMI, waist girth) but not FFM hydration and gluteal girth. DXA provided cross-sectional %BF data for obese adults without bias. However, individual data are associated with large prediction errors (+/-4.2%BF). This error appears to be associated with tissue thickness indicating that the DXA device used may not be able to accurately account for beam hardening in obese cohorts.
19723773,9,2009,Physiol Genomics,miR-290 acts as a physiological effector of senescence in mouse embryo fibroblasts.,The culture-induced senescence of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) correlates with reduction of cell proliferation. In this work we found that the accumulation of cells with 4C DNA content and the transcriptional change of several microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are relevant events in culture senescence. By comparing the miRNA expression profiles of physiologically senescent MEF and that of senescent MEF induced by the downregulation of leukemia-related factor, we identified miR-290 as a common upregulated miRNA. When miR-290 was transfected in presenescent MEF, SA-beta-gal(+) cells and p16, two markers of culture senescence, increased compared with control, indicating that miR-290 is causally involved in senescence. Interestingly, nocodazole (NCZ), which induces G2/M block, increased the percentage of senescent cells as well as the expression of miR-290 and of the tumor suppressor p16, thus mimicking culture senescence. As miR-290 was overexpressed in NCZ-treated cells and it was able to induce senescence in proliferating MEF, we investigated whether miR-290 and NCZ could share common mechanisms of culture senescence. Whereas the induction of SA-beta-gal(+) by miR-290 was not strengthened by coupling its transfection with NCZ treatment, the transfection of the antagomir 290 (d-290) plus NCZ treatment, while blocking cells at G2/M, suppressed SA-beta-gal(+) and p16 induction. On the basis of these findings we conclude that miR-290 might act as a physiological effector of NCZ induced as well as culture senescence via p16 regulation expanding the role of this miRNA from embryonic stem to differentiated cells.
19616008,9,2009,J Mol Biol,Characterization of two novel aldo-keto reductases from Arabidopsis: expression patterns, broad substrate specificity, and an open active-site structure suggest a role in toxicant metabolism following stress.,Aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) are widely distributed in nature and play numerous roles in the metabolism of steroids, sugars, and other carbonyls. They have also frequently been implicated in the metabolism of exogenous and endogenous toxicants, including those stimulated by stress. Although the Arabidopsis genome includes at least 21 genes with the AKR signature, very little is known of their functions. In this study, we have screened the Arabidopsis thaliana genomic sequence for genes with significant homology to members of the mammalian AKR1 family and identified four homologues for further study. Following alignment of the predicted protein sequences with representatives from the AKR superfamily, the proteins were ascribed not to the AKR1 family but to the AKR4C subfamily, with the individual designations of AKR4C8, AKR4C9, AKR4C10, and AKR4C11. Expression of two of the genes, AKR4C8 and AKR4C9, has been shown to be coordinately regulated and markedly induced by various forms of stress. The genes have been overexpressed in bacteria, and recombinant proteins have been purified and crystallized. Both enzymes display NADPH-dependent reduction of carbonyl compounds, typical of the superfamily, but will accept a very wide range of substrates, reducing a range of steroids, sugars, and aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes/ketones, although there are distinct differences between the two enzymes. We have obtained high-resolution crystal structures of AKR4C8 (1.4 A) and AKR4C9 (1.25 A) in ternary complexes with NADP(+) and acetate. Three extended loops, present in all AKRs and responsible for defining the cofactor- and substrate-binding sites, are shorter in the 4C subfamily compared to other AKRs. Consequently, the crystal structures reveal open and accommodative substrate-binding sites, which correlates with their broad substrate specificity. It is suggested that the primary role of these enzymes may be to detoxify a range of toxic aldehydes and ketones produced during stress, although the precise nature of the principal natural substrates remains to be determined.
19581597,9,2009,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Expression of immediate-early genes reveals functional compartments within ocular dominance columns after brief monocular inactivation.,Visual inputs from the 2 eyes in most primates activate alternating bands of cortex in layer 4C of primary visual cortex, thereby forming the well-studied ocular dominance columns (ODCs). In addition, the enzymatic reactivity of cytochrome oxidase (CO) reveals &quot;blob&quot; structures within the supragranular layers of ODCs. Here, we present evidence for compartments within ODCs that have not been clearly defined previously. These compartments are revealed by the activity-dependent mRNA expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs), zif268 and c-fos, after brief periods of monocular inactivation (MI). After a 1-3-h period of MI produced by an injection of tetrodotoxin, IEGs were expressed in a patchy pattern that included infragranular layers, as well as supragranular layers, where they corresponded to the CO blobs. In addition, the expressions of IEGs in layer 4C were especially high in narrow zones along boundaries of ODCs, referred to here as the &quot;border strips&quot; of the ODCs. After longer periods of MI (&gt;5 h), the border strips were no longer apparent. When either eyelid was sutured, changes in IEG expression were not evident in layer 4C; however, the patchy pattern of the expression in the infragranular and supragranular layers remained. These changes of IEG expression after MI indicate that cortical circuits involving the CO blobs of the supragranular layers include aligned groups of neurons in the infragranular layers and that the border strip neurons of layer 4C are highly active for a 3-h period after MI.
19535500,9,2009,J Gen Virol,Predominance of hepatitis C virus genotype 4 infection and rapid transmission between 1935 and 1965 in the Central African Republic.,The molecular epidemiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the Central African Republic (CAR) is poorly documented. Thus, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of NS5B gene sequences from 58 HCV-infected inhabitants of a remote area of south-west CAR, which indicated that 48 (82.8%) were infected with genotype 4 (HCV-4), five (8.6%) with genotype 2 and five (8.6%) with genotype 1. HCV-4 strains were highly heterogeneous, containing previously described subtypes 4k (48%), 4c (27%), 4r (4%), 4f (4%) and unclassified subtypes (17%). To estimate the epidemic history of these HCV-4 strains, an evolutionary analysis using the coalescent approach was used. The estimated date of the most recent common ancestor of the CAR HCV-4 strains was 1539 (95% confidence intervals, 1317-1697). They exhibited a rapid, exponential spread from 1935 to 1965, simultaneously with what was recently reported in neighbouring Cameroon and Gabon. The hypothesis of a massive iatrogenic transmission during interventions for the control of endemic tropical diseases is discussed.
19533160,9,2009,Chromosoma,Cohesin gene defects may impair sister chromatid alignment and genome stability in Arabidopsis thaliana.,In contrast to yeast, plant interphase nuclei often display incomplete alignment (cohesion) along sister chromatid arms. Sister chromatid cohesion mediated by the multi-subunit cohesin complex is essential for correct chromosome segregation during nuclear divisions and for DNA recombination repair. The cohesin complex consists of the conserved proteins SMC1, SMC3, SCC3, and an alpha-kleisin subunit. Viable homozygous mutants could be selected for the Arabidopsis thaliana alpha-kleisins SYN1, SYN2, and SYN4, which can partially compensate each other. For the kleisin SYN3 and for the single-copy genes SMC1, SMC3, and SCC3, only heterozygous mutants were obtained that displayed between 77% and 97% of the wild-type transcript level. Compared to wild-type nuclei, sister chromatid alignment was significantly decreased along arms in 4C nuclei of the homozygous syn1 and syn4 and even of the heterozygous smc1, smc3, scc3, and syn3 mutants. Knocking out SYN1 and SYN4 additionally impaired sister centromere cohesion. Homozygous mutants of SWITCH1 (required for meiotic sister chromatid alignment) displayed sterility and decreased sister arm alignment. For the cohesin loading complex subunit SCC2, only heterozygous mutants affecting sister centromere alignment were obtained. Defects of the alpha-kleisin SYN4, which impair sister chromatid alignment in 4C differentiated nuclei, do apparently not disturb alignment during prometaphase nor cause aneuploidy in meristematic cells. The syn2, 3, 4 scc3 and swi1 mutants display a high frequency of anaphases with bridges (~10% to &gt;20% compared to 2.6% in wild type). Our results suggest that (a) already a slight reduction of the average transcript level in heterozygous cohesin mutants may cause perturbation of cohesion, at least in some leaf cells at distinct loci; (b) the decreased sister chromatid alignment in cohesin mutants can obviously not fully be compensated by other cohesion mechanisms such as DNA concatenation; (c) some cohesin genes, in addition to cohesion, might have further essential functions (e.g., for genome stability, apparently by facilitating correct recombination repair of double-strand breaks).
19250795,9,2009,Eur J Surg Oncol,Neoadjuvant bevacizumab, docetaxel and capecitabine combination therapy for HER2/neu-negative invasive breast cancer: Efficacy and safety in a phase II pilot study.,PURPOSE: To evaluate the triplet combination of bevacizumab, capecitabine and docetaxel (XTA) as neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with invasive, HER2-negative, nonmetastatic breast cancer (T2-4c &gt;2cm) and no prior systemic therapy received six 21-day cycles of XTA (bevacizumab 15mg/kg, day 1, cycles 1-5; docetaxel 75mg/m(2), day 1 of each cycle; capecitabine 950mg/m(2) twice daily for 14 days of each cycle). Patients underwent surgery 2-4 weeks after completing XTA, followed by radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy according to institution guidelines. Pathologic complete response (pCR), the primary endpoint, was defined as no evidence of invasive tumour in the final surgical sample. Secondary endpoints included rates of clinical response and breast-conserving surgery and safety.RESULTS: Median age of the 18 enrolled patients was 48 years (range 34-69). Most patients (72%) received six cycles of neoadjuvant therapy. pCR rate was 22% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6-48). Nine of the patients without pCR achieved clinical partial response, giving a 72% overall clinical response rate (95% CI: 47-90). Fifteen patients underwent breast-conserving surgery (83%; 95% CI: 59-96). One additional patient had breast-conserving surgery, followed by mastectomy 1 month later. The remaining 2 patients underwent modified radical mastectomy. XTA was reasonably well tolerated, with no unexpected toxicities or treatment-related deaths.CONCLUSIONS: The 22% pCR rate in a HER2-negative population suggests that addition of bevacizumab increases the activity of neoadjuvant capecitabine-docetaxel. Further evaluation of this regimen in early breast cancer is recommended.
19216782,9,2009,Cardiovasc Ultrasound,A new 2D-based method for myocardial velocity strain and strain rate quantification in a normal adult and paediatric population: assessment of reference values.,BACKGROUND: Recent advances in technology have provided the opportunity for off-line analysis of digital video-clips of two-dimensional (2-D) echocardiographic images. Commercially available software that follows the motion of cardiac structures during cardiac cycle computes both regional and global velocity, strain, and strain rate (SR). The present study aims to evaluate the clinical applicability of the software based on the tracking algorithm feature (studied for cardiology purposes) and to derive the reference values for longitudinal and circumferential strain and SR of the left ventricle in a normal population of children and young adults.METHODS: 45 healthy volunteers (30 adults: 19 male, 11 female, mean age 37 +/- 6 years; 15 children: 8 male, 7 female, mean age 8 +/- 2 years) underwent transthoracic echocardiographic examination; 2D cine-loops recordings of apical 4-four 4-chamber (4C) and 2-chamber (2C) views and short axis views were stored for off-line analysis. Computer analyses were performed using specific software relying on the algorithm of optical flow analysis, specifically designed to track the endocardial border, installed on a Windows based computer workstation. Inter and intra-observer variability was assessed.RESULTS: The feasibility of measurements obtained with tissue tracking system was higher in apical view (100% for systolic events; 64% for diastolic events) than in short axis view (70% for systolic events; 52% for diastolic events). Longitudinal systolic velocity decreased from base to apex in all subjects (5.22 +/- 1.01 vs. 1.20 +/- 0.88; p &lt; 0.0001). Longitudinal strain and SR significantly increased from base to apex in all subjects (-12.95 +/- 6.79 vs. -14.87 +/- 6.78; p = 0.002; -0.72 +/- 0.39 vs. -0.94 +/- 0.48, p = 0.0001, respectively). Similarly, circumferential strain and SR increased from base to apex (-21.32 +/- 5.15 vs. -27.02 +/- 5.88, p = 0.002; -1.51 +/- 0.37 vs. -1.95 +/- 0.57, p = 0.003, respectively). Values of global systolic SR, both longitudinal and circumferential, were significantly higher in children than in adults (-1.3 +/- 0.2, vs. -1.11 +/- 0.2, p = 0.006; -1.9 +/- 0.6 vs. -1.6 +/- 0.5, p = 0.0265, respectively). No significant differences in longitudinal and circumferential systolic velocities were identified for any segment when comparing adults with children.CONCLUSION: This 2D based tissue tracking system used for computation is reliable and applicable in adults and children particularly for systolic events. Measured with this technology, we have established reference values for myocardial velocity, Strain and SR for both young adults and children.
19796900,8,2009,Eur J Radiol,Non-mass-like enhancement on contrast-enhanced breast MR imaging: lesion characterization using combination of dynamic contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MR images.,PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a combination of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) in characterization of lesions showing non-mass-like enhancement on breast MR imaging and to find the strongest discriminators between carcinoma and benignancy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed consecutive MR images in 45 lesions showing non-mass like enhancement in 41 patients. We analyzed lesion size, distribution, internal enhancement, kinetic curve pattern, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. We applied univariate and multivariate analyses to find the strongest indicators for malignancy. In a validation study, 22 non-mass-like enhancement lesions in 21 patients were examined. We calculated diagnostic accuracy when we presume category 4b, 4c, and 5 lesions as malignant or high to moderate suspicion for malignancy, and category 4a and 3 as low suspicion for malignancy or benign.RESULTS: Segmental distribution (P=0.018), clumped internal enhancement (P=0.005), and ADC less than 1.3 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (P=0.047) were the strongest MR indicators of malignancy. In a validation study, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 87% (13/15), 86% (6/7), 93% (13/14), 75% (6/8) and 86% (19/22), respectively.CONCLUSION: The combination of DCE-MRI and DWI showed high diagnostic accuracy in characterization of non-mass-like enhancement lesions on breast MR images.
19555757,8,2009,Free Radic Biol Med,Correlation of F4-neuroprostanes levels in cerebrospinal fluid with outcome of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in humans.,Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is one type of hemorrhagic stroke in humans. F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-IsoPs) and F(4)-neuroprostanes (F(4)-NPs), derived from arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), respectively, are specific markers of lipid peroxidation. We previously demonstrated that F(2)-IsoPs levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of aSAH patients positively correlated with poor clinical conditions. In this work, we refined F(4)-NPs analysis and investigated the role of potential oxidative damage to neurons in aSAH patients by detecting F(4)-NPs in CSF. [(2)H(4)]-15-F(2t)-IsoP, rather than [(18)O(2)]-17-F(4c)-NP or [(2)H(4)]-PGF(2 alpha), was used as the internal standard for F(4)-NPs analysis. One problem of the use of [(18)O(2)]-17-F(4c)-NP was the potential interference resulting from F(2)-dihomo-IsoPs in CSF. CSF specimens of 15 aSAH patients for up to 10 days and those of 12 non-aSAH controls were analyzed. First day, mean, and peak levels of F(4)-NPs were all significantly higher in aSAH patients than in controls and correlated with the Fisher Scale and 3-month Glasgow Outcome Scale, but only mean levels of F(4)-NPs correlated with Hunt and Hess Grade. The results first demonstrate oxidative damage to DHA in brain tissue following aSAH and suggest that F(4)-NPs in CSF could be a better predictor for outcome of aSAH than F(2)-IsoPs at early time points.
19406142,8,2009,Mutat Res,Polymorphism in cytochrome P450 2A6 and glutathione S-transferase P1 modifies head and neck cancer risk and treatment outcome.,A case control study was carried out to investigate the association of functionally important polymorphism in cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) and glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) genes with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and treatment response in cases receiving a combination of chemo-radiotherapy. The study group consisted of 350 males suffering from HNSCC and an equal number of male controls. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed statistically significant decrease in risk to HNSCC in cases with variant genotypes (CYP2A6*1B and CYP2A6*4C) of CYP2A6 (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.43-1.22; P=0.04) or GSTP1 (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51-1.00; P=0.05). The risk associated with these variant genotypes was found to be further decreased in cases carrying a combination of variant genotypes of CYP2A6 and GSTP1 (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.25-0.65; P=0.00). A similar decrease in risk was observed in cases with variant genotypes of CYP2A6 (OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.40-0.86; P=0.00) or GSTP1 (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42-0.91; P=0.01) and who were regular tobacco users (cigarette smokers or tobacco chewers). Interestingly, only 27% of the cases carrying the variant forms of CYP2A6 (*1A/*4C+*1B/*4C+*4C/*4C) responded to the treatment for HNSCC when compared to those with wild-type genotype (69%). However with GSTP1, cases with homozygous mutant genotype (Val/Val) showed a superior treatment response (75%) when compared to cases with wild-type genotype (25%). Further, cases carrying a combination of variant genotype of CYP2A6 and wild-type genotype of GSTP1 exhibited a very poor treatment response demonstrating that polymorphisms in CYP2A6 and GSTP1 not only modified the risk to HNSCC but also played a major role in determining the chemotherapeutic response.
19706551,7,2009,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Stimulus ensemble and cortical layer determine V1 spatial receptive fields.,The concept of receptive field is a linear, feed-forward view of visual signal processing. Frequently used models of V1 neurons, like the dynamic Linear filter--static nonlinearity--Poisson [corrected] spike encoder model, predict that receptive fields measured with different stimulus ensembles should be similar. Here, we tested this concept by comparing spatiotemporal maps of V1 neurons derived from two very different, but commonly used, stimulus ensembles: sparse noise and Hartley subspace stimuli. We found maps from the two methods agreed for neurons in input layer 4C but were very different for neurons in superficial layers of V1. Many layer 2/3 cells have receptive fields with multiple elongated subregions when mapped with Hartley stimuli, but their spatial maps collapse to only a single, less-elongated subregion when mapped with sparse noise. Moreover, for upper layer V1 neurons, the preferred orientation for Hartley maps is much closer to the preferred orientation measured with drifting gratings than is the orientation preference of sparse-noise maps. These results challenge the concept of a stimulus-invariant receptive field and imply that intracortical interactions shape fundamental properties of layer 2/3 neurons.
19557370,7,2009,Arch Pharm Res,Anti-tumor activity of noble indirubin derivatives in human solid tumor models in vitro.,Indirubin has been identified as a component of a traditional Chinese medicine, Danggui Longhui Wan, which is used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Indirubin inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. Many indirubin derivatives have been studied for their potential anti-solid tumor activity. We have synthesized and evaluated many indirubin derivatives. In order to compare and confirm the potential of our major derivatives as anti-solid tumor agents, we examined their anti-proliferative activity in monolayers, as well as in multicellular spheroids (MCS) cultures of human colorectal cancer cells, DLD-1 and HT-29. The MCS model is an in vitro solid tumor model that is increasingly used for the evaluation of anti-solid tumor activity. 5-nitro-indirubin-3'-oxime (4c) and 5'-bromo-5-nitro-indirubin-3'-oxime (4l), compared to 5-trimethylacetamido-indirubin-3'-oxime (11) and 5-diphenylacetamido-indirubin-3'-oxime (33) showed greater anti-proliferative effects in monolayers, but lower anti-proliferative effects in MCS. Overall, our data suggest that compounds 11 and 33 may exert a significant anti-solid tumor activity via a mechanism other than CDK inhibition, different from that of 4c and 4l. These compounds are worth further investigation with respect to their anti-solid tumor activity and their mechanism of action in various solid tumor models.
19448050,7,2009,Am J Sports Med,Chondrocyte death and cartilage degradation after autologous osteochondral transplantation surgery in a rabbit model.,BACKGROUND: Autologous osteochondral transplantation surgery requires an impact force on the graft that may cause chondrocyte death and matrix degradation. This study attempted to determine the degree to which this occurs in a rabbit model shortly after the procedure.HYPOTHESIS: Impaction of a press-fit autologous osteochondral graft in vivo results in chondrocyte necrosis, apoptosis, and matrix degradation at early time points.STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.METHODS: Twenty New Zealand White rabbits underwent unilateral osteochondral transplantation (OT) surgeries, and 10, bilateral sham surgeries. Fifteen animals were sacrificed at time zero (10 sham-0 limbs, 10 OT-0 limbs), and 15, 4 days after surgery (10 sham-4 limbs, 10 OT-4 limbs). Chondrocyte viability/necrosis was determined with cell vital staining. Chondrocyte apoptosis was determined by TUNEL, Bcl-2, and M30 assays. Cartilage matrix degradation was determined by routine light and polarized light microscopy and COL2-3/4C(short) immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis was performed with a 2-way analysis of variance (P &lt; .05).RESULTS: There were significantly fewer viable cells in OT-4 than in sham-4. A similar difference in cell viability was found in OT-0 versus sham-0. There were more TUNEL-positive cells in OT-4 as compared with OT-0, sham-0, and sham-4; however, there was little or no staining of Bcl-2 and M30. Mankin scores were higher in both OT groups versus both sham groups at time zero and day 4. The OT-4 group had positive staining for COL2-3/4C(short) that corresponded with a loss of collagen birefringence at the superficial zone.CONCLUSION: Osteochondral transplantation procedures performed by tamping a press-fit graft induce chondrocyte necrosis and matrix metalloproteinase-mediated cartilage matrix degradation. However, apoptosis was not found to a major contributor to cell death in this model.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of osteochondral transplantation procedures may be improved by atraumatic insertion and fixation techniques or by pharmacologic agents that can block these degradative processes.
19272779,7,2009,Neuromuscul Disord,The phenotype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C due to SH3TC2 mutations and possible predisposition to an inflammatory neuropathy.,Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a heterogeneous group of inherited peripheral motor and sensory neuropathies. The locus responsible for CMT4C was previously assigned to the chromosome 5q23 region by homozygosity mapping and mutations in the SH3TC2 (KIAA1985) gene have been subsequently identified mainly in families around the Mediterranean basin but also frequently in European Gypsies. No English families have been reported to date. To determine the frequency, phenotype and neuropathology of CMT due to SH3TC2 mutations we screened 23 English autosomal recessive (AR) demyelinating CMT families. Five families with AR demyelinating CMT and SH3TC2 mutations were identified, four families were homozygous for the R954X mutation and the fifth family was compound heterozygous for the R954X and E657K mutations. There was significant clinical variation between these families with some cases presenting with a severe childhood onset neuropathy with respiratory and cranial nerve involvement, compared to other families with mild scoliosis and foot deformity. Characteristic sural nerve neuropathology was seen in three families with frequent demyelinating fibres surrounded by excess Schwann cell lamellae forming basal lamina onion bulbs and abnormally long and attenuated Schwann cell processes. One patient homozygous for the R954X mutation had a 20-year history of an inflammatory neuropathy that was superimposed onto the hereditary form, indicating that structural alterations to the SH3TC2 gene could possibly predispose to peripheral nerve inflammation.
19235779,7,2009,Yeast,Repeated elements coordinate the spatial organization of the yeast genome.,The spatial organization of the chromosomes is crucial for gene expression and development. Inter- and intrachromosomal interactions form a crucial part of this epigenomic regulatory system. Here we use circular chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) to identify interactions between repetitive and non-repetitive loci within the yeast genome. The interacting regions occur in non-randomly distributed clusters. Furthermore, the SIR2 histone deacetylase has opposing roles in the organization of the inter- or intrachromosomal interactions. These data establish a dynamic domain model for yeast genome organization. Moreover, they point to the repeated elements playing a central role in the dynamic organization of genome architecture.
19190462,7,2009,Neurosurgery,Radiosurgery with the world's first fully robotized Leksell Gamma Knife PerfeXion in clinical use: a 200-patient prospective, randomized, controlled comparison with the Gamma Knife 4C.,OBJECTIVE: The world's first Leksell Gamma Knife PerfeXion (Elekta Instrument AB, Stockholm, Sweden) for radiosurgery of the head and neck became operational at Timone University Hospital in Marseille on July 10, 2006. To allow strict evaluation of the capabilities, advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of this new technology, patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized trial.METHODS: In 66 working days, between July 10 and December 20, 2006, 363 patients were treated by gamma knife surgery at Timone University Hospital, Marseille. Of these patients, 200 were eligible for the comparative prospective study (inclusion criteria were informed consent obtained, tumor or vascular indication, and no previous radiosurgery or radiotherapy). In accordance with the blinded randomization process, 100 patients were treated with the Leksell Gamma Knife 4C (Elekta Instrument AB) and Gamma Knife 100 (Elekta Instrument AB) with the Leksell Gamma Knife PerfeXion. Dose planning parameters, dosimetry measurements on the patient's body, workflow, patient comfort, quality assurance procedure, and a series of other treatment-related parameters were systematically and prospectively evaluated in both arms of the trial.RESULTS: No technical failure of the treatment procedure was encountered. The new dose-planning system led to the use of composite shots in 39.4% of the patients. The median number of different collimator sizes used was larger with the PerfeXion than with the 4C (2 and 1, respectively). The mean number of isocenters used was lower (10.67 and 13.08, respectively). The median total treatment time was significantly shorter with the PerfeXion (40 and 60 minutes, respectively), but there was no significant difference in the median radiation time (34.02 and 33.40 minutes, respectively). The procedure was performed using only a single run in 98.99% of the PerfeXion cases and in 42% of the 4C cases. Collision risk on the 4C forced us to change the frame gamma angle for at least 1 shot in 24% of the patients and led to treatment in manual mode for at least 1 shot in 21% of the patients. Collision risk requiring technical adaptation did not occur with the PerfeXion. In 1 patient treated with the PerfeXion, the system required a direct collision check. In terms of dose to structures outside the target area, the PerfeXion delivers 8.2 times less to the vertex, 10 times less to the thyroid, 12.9 times less to the sternum, and 15 times less to the gonads.CONCLUSION: Our prospective study indicates that procedures with the PerfeXion were collision-free, even with very eccentric lesions (e.g., multiple metastases). The duration of the surgical procedure, the amount of time required for nurse, physicist, and physician intervention on the machine, and the duration of the quality assurance procedure were all shown to be dramatically reduced with the PerfeXion gamma knife. Patient protection is greatly improved with the PerfeXion. In our experience, the technological advances of the Leksell Gamma Knife PerfeXion will make a very significant contribution to future progress in head and neck radiosurgery.
19913589,6,2009,Hum Immunol,Influence of CTLA-4/CD28/ICOS gene polymorphisms on the susceptibility to cervical squamous cell carcinoma and stage of differentiation in the Polish population.,Abnormal expressions of the costimulatory molecules CD28, &quot;inducible co-stimulator&quot; (ICOS), and inhibitory molecule cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) lead to disturbances of immune response and entail an increased risk of cancer. This study was undertaken to evaluate the association between the polymorphisms CTLA-4c.49A&gt;G, CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T, CTLA-4g.*642AT(8_33), CTLA-4g.*6230G&gt;A (CT60), CD28c.17+3T&gt;C, and ICOSc.1554+4GT(8_15), and susceptibility to CSCC. The association between CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T[T] allele and [TT+CT] genotype and susceptibility to CSCC was observed (OR = 1.99, p = 0.003, and OR = 2.07, p = 0.005, respectively). The CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T[T] allele and [TT+CT] genotype increased the risk of well-differentiated CSCC by a factor of 3.84 and 4.44 (p = 0.00001, and p = 0.00001, respectively). In patients with moderately differentiated CSCC, a trend toward increased frequency of CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T[T] allele and CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T[TT+CT] genotype was noticed (OR = 1.68, p = 0.09, and OR = 1.75, p = 0.09, respectively), whereas in low differentiated CSCC such relation was not observed. Both CTLA-4g.*642AT(8_33) [(AT)(8)]/[(AT)(8)] homozygote and [(AT)(8)] allele were overrepresented in CSCC patients in comparison with healthy women (p = 0.004, OR = 1.93, and p = 0.03, OR = 1.41, respectively) but this polymorphism was not related to histologic grade of tumor. CD28c.17+3T&gt;C polymorphism was not associated with susceptibility to CSCC in whole group of patients, but CD28c.17+3T&gt;C[C] allele and CD28c.17+3T&gt;C[CC+TC] genotype were more frequently observed among well differentiated CSCC patients compared with controls (OR = 1.89, p = 0.05, and OR = 2.05, p = 0.05, respectively). Other studied polymorphisms were not associated with susceptibility to CSCC and with histologic grade of CSCC. Our results suggest that the CTLA-4 gene is susceptibility gene to CSCC especially to well-differentiated tumor, while association between CD28 gene polymorphism and disease is restricted only to the well-differentiated CSCC.
19800716,6,2009,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and in vitro microbiological evaluation of novel 4-aryl-5-isopropoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidinones.,Seven 4-aryl-5-isopropoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones 4a-g and 4-phenyl-5-isopropoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-thione 4h have been synthesized by a one-pot cyclocondensation of aldehydes, isopropyl acetoacetate and urea/thiourea in ethanol by using strontium chloride hexahydrate as the catalyst. All the compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi and antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Rhizopus and Mucor. Compounds 4b, 4c, 4f, 4g exhibited excellent in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and potent in vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Rhizopus and Mucor. Compound 4f with a nitro group at the para position of the 4-aryl group and 4g with a fluorine at the para position of the 4-aryl group showed more activity than the standard drugs.
19488465,6,2009,Braz Oral Res,Flexural strength and hardness of direct and indirect composites.,The objective of this study was to evaluate the flexural strength (sigma f) and hardness (H) of direct and indirect composites, testing the hypotheses that direct resin composites produce higher sigma f and H values than indirect composites and that these properties are positively related. Ten bar-shaped specimens (25 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm) were fabricated for each direct [D250 - Filtek Z250 (3M-Espe) and D350 - Filtek Z350 (3M-Espe)] and indirect [ISin - Sinfony (3M-Espe) and IVM - VitaVM LC (Vita Zahnfabrik)] materials, according to the manufacturer's instructions and ISO4049 specifications. The sigma f was tested in three-point bending using a universal testing machine (EMIC DL 2000) at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min (ISO4049). Knoop hardness (H) was measured on the specimens' fragments resultant from the sigma f test and calculated as H = 14.2P/l(2), where P is the applied load (0.1 kg; dwell time = 15 s) and l is the longest diagonal of the diamond shaped indent (ASTM E384). The data were statistically analyzed using Anova and Tukey tests (alpha = 0.05). The mean sigma f and standard deviation values (MPa) and statistical grouping were: D250 - 135.4 +/- 17.6a; D350 - 123.7 +/- 11.1b; ISin - 98.4 +/- 6.4c; IVM - 73.1 +/- 4.9 d. The mean H and standard deviation values (kg/mm(2)) and statistical grouping were: D250 - 98.12 +/- 1.8a; D350 - 86.5 +/- 1.9b; ISin - 28.3 +/- 0.9 c; IVM - 30.8 +/- 1.0 c. The direct composite systems examined produce higher mean sigma f and H values than the indirect composites, and the mean values of these properties were positively correlated (r = 0.91), confirming the study hypotheses.
19357224,6,2009,J Gen Virol,Complete genomic sequences for hepatitis C virus subtypes 4b, 4c, 4d, 4g, 4k, 4l, 4m, 4n, 4o, 4p, 4q, 4r and 4t.,In this study, we characterized the full-length genomic sequences of 13 distinct hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 isolates/subtypes: QC264/4b, QC381/4c, QC382/4d, QC193/4g, QC383/4k, QC274/4l, QC249/4m, QC97/4n, QC93/4o, QC139/4p, QC262/4q, QC384/4r and QC155/4t. These were amplified, using RT-PCR, from the sera of patients now residing in Canada, 11 of which were African immigrants. The resulting genomes varied between 9421 and 9475 nt in length and each contains a single ORF of 9018-9069 nt. The sequences showed nucleotide similarities of 77.3-84.3 % in comparison with subtypes 4a (GenBank accession no. Y11604) and 4f (EF589160) and 70.6-72.8 % in comparison with genotype 1 (M62321/1a, M58335/1b, D14853/1c, and 1?/AJ851228) reference sequences. These similarities were often higher than those currently defined by HCV classification criteria for subtype (75.0-80.0 %) and genotype (67.0-70.0 %) division, respectively. Further analyses of the complete and partial E1 and partial NS5B sequences confirmed these 13 'provisionally assigned subtypes'.
19141087,6,2009,J Pineal Res,Melatonin applied to cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seeds improves germination during chilling stress.,The relationship between germination and melatonin applied during osmo- and hydropriming was studied in cucumber seeds. The proportion of nuclei with different DNA contents, the mean ploidy and the (2C + 4C = 8C)/2C ratio in unprimed and primed, dry and imbibed at 10 degrees C seeds were established by flow cytometry. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and protein oxidation were also estimated. Melatonin and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) concentrations in the seeds were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Being sensitive to chilling stress, seeds that germinated well (99%) at 25 degrees C showed only 30% germination at 15 degrees C, and almost no germination (4%) at 10 degrees C. Hydropriming in water improved seed germination to 50-60% at 15 degrees C and the addition of melatonin (25-100 M) also increased the rate of germination. Osmopriming in polyethylene glycol increased germination at 15 degrees C to 78%, and 98% when combined with 50 M melatonin. Osmoprimed seeds germinated even at 10 degrees C and reached 43%, and 83% when 50 M melatonin was applied. None of the treatments induced DNA synthesis, although during the first 24 hr of imbibition at 10 degrees C the mean ploidy and the (2C + 4C = 8C)/2C ratio increased, which is indicative of the advanced Phase II of germination. Hydro- and osmopriming slightly decreased IAA content in the seeds in most of the cases; only hydropriming with 100 and 500 M melatonin increased it. Melatonin protected membrane structure against peroxidation during chilling, but excessive melatonin levels in cucumber seeds (approximately 4 microg/g fresh weight) provoked oxidative changes in proteins. There is still lack of information explained clearly the role of melatonin in plant physiology. This molecule acts multidirectionally and usually is alliged to other compounds.
21578508,6,2009,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,Tetra-kis(2,6-diamino-pyridinium) diphthalate 2,6-diamino-pyridine.,In the title compound, 4C(5)H(8)N(3) (+)·2C(8)H(4)O(4) (2-)·C(5)H(7)N(3), the asymmetric unit consists of two protonated diamino-pyridine cations, one phthalate anion and one half of a diamino-pyridine mol-ecule, which has twofold rotation symmetry and is disordered over two positions with a site-occupancy ratio of 0.534 (3):0.466 (3). In the disordered structure, both pyridine rings are essentially planar, with maximum deviations of 0.011 (2) and 0.006 (2) Å, and these two rings are inclined to one another at a dihedral angle of 79.86 (10)°. In the crystal structure, inter-molecular N-H⋯O and C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds link the ions and mol-ecules into a three-dimensional network. The structure is further stabilized by C-H⋯π inter-actions.
19994893,5,2009,Chem Res Toxicol,Photocytotoxic trans-diam(m)ine platinum(IV) diazido complexes more potent than their cis isomers.,The photocytotoxicity of a series of anticancer trans-dihydroxido [Pt(N(3))(2)(OH)(2)(NH(3))(X)] (X = alkyl or aryl amine) platinum(IV) diazido complexes has been examined, and the influence of cis-trans isomerism has been investigated. A series of photoactivatable Pt(IV)-azido complexes has been synthesized: The synthesis, characterization, and photocytotoxicity of six mixed-ligand ammine/amine Pt(IV) diazido complexes, cis,trans,cis-[Pt(N(3))(2)(OH)(2)(NH(3))(X)] where X = propylamine (4c), butylamine (5c), or pentylamine (6c) and aromatic complexes where X = pyridine (7c), 2-methylpyridine (8c), or 3-methylpyridine (9c) are reported. Six all-trans isomers have also been studied where X = methylamine (2t), ethylamine (3t), 2-methylpyridine (8t), 4-methylpyridine (10t), 3-methylpyridine (9t), and 2-bromo-3-methylpyridine (11t). All of the complexes exhibit intense azide-to-Pt(IV) LMCT bands (ca. 290 nm for trans and ca. 260 nm for cis). When irradiated with UVA light (365 nm), the Pt(IV) complexes undergo photoreduction to Pt(II) species, as monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy. The trans isomers of complexes containing aliphatic or aromatic amines were more photocytotoxic than their cis isomers. One of the cis complexes (9c) was nonphotocytotoxic despite undergoing photoreduction. Substitution of NH(3) ligands by MeNH(2) or EtNH(2) results in more potent photocytotoxicity for the all-trans complexes. The complexes were all nontoxic toward human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and A2780 human ovarian cancer cells in the dark, apart from the 3-methylpyridine (9t), 2-bromo-3-methylpyridine (11t), and 4-methylpyridine (10t) derivatives.
19937709,5,2009,J Comp Neurol,Spatial compartmentalization of AMPA glutamate receptor subunits at the calyx of Held synapse.,The mature calyx of Held ending on principal neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) has very specialized morphological and molecular features that make it possible to transmit auditory signals with high fidelity. In a previous work we described an increased localization of the ionotropic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4 isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor (GluA) subunits at postsynaptic sites of the calyx of Held-principal cell body synapses from postnatal development to adult. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the pattern of the synaptic distribution of GluA2/3/4c and -4 in adult MNTB principal cell bodies correlated with preferential subcellular domains (stalks and swellings) of the calyx. We used a postembedding immunocytochemical method combined with specific antibodies to GluA2/3/4c and GluA4 subunits. We found that the density of GluA2/3/4c in calyceal swellings (19 +/- 1.54 particles/microm) was higher than in stalks (10.93 +/- 1.37 particles/microm); however, the differences for GluA4 were not statistically significant (swellings: 13.84 +/- 1.39 particles/microm; stalks: 10.42 +/- 1.24 particles/microm). Furthermore, GluA2/3/4c and GluA4 labeling co-localized to some extent in calyceal stalks and swellings. Taking these data together, the distribution pattern of GluA subunits in postsynaptic specializations are indicative of a spatial compartmentalization of AMPA subunits in mature calyx-principal neuron synapses that may support the temporally precise transmission required for sound localization in the auditory brainstem.
19765930,5,2009,Gastroenterol Clin Biol,Sexually transmitted HCV infection and reinfection in HIV-infected homosexual men.,Multiple, concomitant or successive hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections have been described in injection drug users and following organ transplantation and blood transfusion. However, data on sexual HCV reinfection is scarce. We report sexual HCV reinfection following viral eradication of a first HCV infection in two homosexual HIV-infected men. The first patient acquired HCV genotype 4 infection after resolution of an initial acute HCV genotype 1a infection. The second patient was infected with genotype 1a HCV following remission of an initial acute HCV genotype 4c/d infection. The two subjects were successfully treated with peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin for their first and second infection and achieved a sustained virological response on both occasions. Unprotected anal intercourse with multiple partners known to be HIV-positive (serosorting) was the only risk factor for HCV transmission reported by both patients. Therefore, sexual HCV reinfection can occur in homosexual men having unprotected sex and &quot;serosorting&quot; should be considered a risk factor for the sexual transmission of HCV.
19507864,5,2009,J Med Chem,Structure-based design of a benzodiazepine scaffold yields a potent allosteric inhibitor of hepatitis C NS5B RNA polymerase.,HCV NS5B polymerase, an essential and virus-specific enzyme, is an important target for drug discovery. Using structure-based design, we optimized a 1,5-benzodiazepine NS5B polymerase inhibitor chemotype into a new sulfone-containing scaffold. The design yielded potent inhibitor (S)-4c (K(D) = 0.79 nM), which has approximately 20-fold greater affinity for NS5B than its carbonyl analogue (R)-2c.
19419801,5,2009,Eur J Med Chem,A facile one-pot green synthesis and antibacterial activity of 2-amino-4H-pyrans and 2-amino-5-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromenes.,A facile one-pot expeditious synthesis of 2-amino-4H-pyrans and 2-amino-5-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromenes has been described under solvent-free conditions using magnesium oxide as a catalyst in very good yields. The reaction catalyst, magnesium oxide was reused and recycled without any loss of activity and product yield. All the synthesized compounds were screened for in vitro antibacterial activity, and compounds 3a, 3b, 3f, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e and 4g showed complete inhibition of bacterial growth at 128 microg/mL or less and the rest of the compounds exhibited incomplete inhibition.
19415821,5,2009,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Gene-gene interactions of CYP2A6 and MAOA polymorphisms on smoking behavior in Chinese male population.,OBJECTIVES: Nicotine is the major psychoactive ingredient in tobacco, and is responsible for dependence through the nicotine-stimulated reward pathway mediated by the central dopaminergic system. Consequently, genetic polymorphisms in both nicotine metabolism and dopamine catabolism genes may influence smoking behavior, and interact with each other resulting in risk modulation. In this study, we investigated the association and multilocus gene-gene interactions of cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), catechol O-methyl transferase (COMT), and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) polymorphisms with smoking behavior in a community-based Chinese male population.METHODS: The polymorphisms were genotyped in 203 current smokers, 66 former smokers, and 102 never smokers. Multivariate logistic regression models and the multifactor dimensionality reduction method were used to analyze the association and multilocus gene-gene interactions.RESULTS: Statistically significant trends were shown for increased risk of smoking initiation in participants with CYP2A6*1B/CYP2A6*1B genotypes compared with those with CYP2A6*1A/CYP2A6*1A genotypes [odds ratio (OR)=3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI)= 1.5-8.1], and participants with CYP2A6*1/CYP2A6*1 genotypes were at higher risk of smoking initiation (OR=2.4, 95% CI=1.2-4.5) and smoking persistence (OR=4.0, 95% CI=1.5-10.3) than those who have CYP2A6*4C genotypes. Moreover, the best model involved a gene-gene interaction between MAOA and CYP2A6 was characterized by the multifactor dimensionality reduction method (64.11% accuracy, P&lt;0.001), and indicated that carriers of the combined 1460 T/O genotype for MAOA EcoRV and CYP2A6*1/CYP2A6*1 genotypes were at higher risk of smoking (OR=15.4, 95% CI=4.5-52.5).CONCLUSION: These findings suggested a substantial influence of CYP2A6 polymorphism as well as the interaction with MAOA resulting in risk modulation on smoking behavior in Chinese male population.
19288092,5,2009,Immunogenetics,Identification of an additional two-cysteine containing type I interferon in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss provides evidence of a major gene duplication event within this gene family in teleosts.,Multiple type I interferons (IFNs) have recently been identified in salmonids, containing two or four conserved cysteines. In this work, a novel two-cysteine containing (2C) IFN gene was identified in rainbow trout. This novel trout IFN gene (termed IFN5) formed a phylogenetic group that is distinct from the other three salmonid IFN groups sequenced to date and had a close evolutionary relationship with IFNs from advanced fish species. Our data demonstrate that two subgroups are apparent within each of the 2C and 4C type I IFNs, an evolutionary outcome possibly due to two rounds of genome duplication events that have occurred within teleosts. We have examined gene expression of the trout 2C type I IFN in cultured cells following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, phytohaemagglutinin, polyI:C or recombinant IFN, or after transfection with polyI:C. The kinetics of gene expression was also studied after viral infection. Analysis of the regulatory elements in the IFN promoter region predicted several binding sites for key transcription factors that potentially play an important role in mediating IFN5 gene expression.
19218231,5,2009,Neuroscientist,Ocular dominance columns: enigmas and challenges.,In some mammalian species, geniculocortical afferents serving each eye are segregated in layer 4C of striate cortex into stripes called ocular dominance columns. Having described the complete pattern of ocular dominance columns in the human brain, the authors enumerate here the principal enigmas that confront future investigators. Probably the overarching challenge is to explain the function, if any, of ocular dominance columns and why they are present in some species and not others. A satisfactory solution must account for the enormous natural variation, even within the same species, among individuals in column expression, pattern, periodicity, and alignment with other components of the functional architecture. Another major priority is to explain the development of ocular dominance columns. It has been established clearly that they form without visual experience, but the innate signals that guide their segregation and maturation are unknown. Experiments addressing the role of spontaneous retinal activity have yielded contradictory data. These studies must be reconciled, to pave the way for new insights into how columnar structure is generated in the cerebral cortex.
19182679,5,2009,Anticancer Drugs,Infusional fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cisplatin followed by weekly paclitaxel plus bevacizumab in locally advanced breast cancer with unfavorable prognostic features.,The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical and biological activities of bevacizumab in combination with preoperative anthracyclines and taxane-based chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer selected for unfavorable prognostic features. Patients with cT2-4c, cN0-2, estrogen and progesterone receptors less than 10% of the cells or cT4d and any estrogen/progesterone receptors expression received four courses of ECF-chemotherapy (epirubicin, cisplatin, fluorouracil as continuous infusion) followed by three courses of weekly paclitaxel in combination with bevacizumab. Thirty patients were included in the study. An objective response, either complete or partial, was observed in 26 patients (87%; 95% confidence interval: 69-96%), stable disease was observed in two patients (7%), and two patients (7%) progressed. A pathological complete response was obtained in 10 patients (33%; 95% confidence interval: 17-53%). Side effects related to bevacizumab with grade &gt;or=2 included headache and hypertension. A nonstatistical significant decrease in the median value of circulating endothelial cells was observed at surgery (3.0/microl vs. 5.7/microl, P=0.19). In conclusion, high rates of both clinical and pathological responses with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy followed by weekly paclitaxel plus bevacizumab were observed in locally advanced breast cancer with unfavorable prognostic features. A non-negligible rate of progressive disease was observed, suggesting careful monitoring of the patients. Further studies evaluating the potential benefit of bevacizumab in neoadjuvant treatment need to be tested.
19123882,5,2009,J Neurosurg,Dosimetric comparison of the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion and 4C.,OBJECT: The recently introduced Leksell Gamma Knife (LGK) Perfexion is an entirely new system with a different beam geometry compared with the LGK 4C. The new Perfexion system has 192 cobalt-60 sources that are fixed on 8 sectors (each sector has 24 sources). Each sector can be moved independently of the others and can be set to 1 of 5 different positions: 3 positions defining collimator sizes of 4, 8, and 16 mm; an off position (sources are blocked); and a home position. The purpose of this study is to compare the dosimetric characteristics of the GK 4C and the Perfexion models. This comparison is important especially for the treatment of functional disorders when only a single shot with the 4- or 8-mm collimator is used.METHODS: A 160-mm-diameter spherical polystyrene phantom was used for all measurements and calculations. The irradiation geometry consisted of the placement of a single shot at the center of this phantom. Comparisons were made among different dosimetric parameters obtained from calculations performed using Leksell GammaPlan v. 8.0 and measurements performed using film dosimetry. The dosimetric parameters investigated were dose profiles for all collimators in all 3 stereotactic planes (x, y, and z) including the full width at half maximum and the penumbra for each profile, cumulative dose-volume histograms, the volume encompassed by the 50% isodose surface, the mean doses delivered to a defined matrix volume, and relative output factors for all collimator sizes.RESULTS: There was excellent agreement between the dosimetric parameters of GK 4C and Perfexion for the 4- and 8-mm collimators.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that consistent treatments of functional disorders will be delivered using either GK 4C or Perfexion.
21582302,5,2009,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,Bis(4-chloro-benzyl-ammonium) tetra-kis(2,6-diethyl-anilinium) cyclo-hexa-phosphate tetra-hydrate.,In the crystal of the title hydrated mol-ecular salt, 2C(7)H(9)ClN(+)·4C(10)H(16)N(+)·P(6)O(18) (6-)·4H(2)O, the packing consists of a three-dimensional O-H⋯O and N-H⋯O hydrogen-bonded network resulting from the association of anionic layers built up from centrosymmetric cyclohexaphosphate ions and water mol-ecules and the two types of organic cations.
19624115,4,2009,Biochemistry,Local and global effects of a cavity filling mutation in a metastable serpin.,The serpins are an unusual class of protease inhibitors which fold to a metastable form and subsequently undergo a massive conformational change to a stable form when they inhibit their target proteases. The driving force for this conformational change has been extensively investigated by site directed mutagenesis, and it has been found that mutations which stabilize the metastable form frequently result in activity deficiency. Here, we employ hydrogen/deuterium exchange to probe the effects of a cavity filling mutant of alpha(1)AT. The Gly117 --&gt; Phe substitution fills a cavity between the F-helix and the face of beta-sheet A, stabilizes the metastable form of alpha(1)AT by approximately 4 kcal/mol and results in a 60% reduction in inhibitory activity against elastase. Globally, the G117F substitution alters the unfolding mechanism by eliminating the molten globule intermediate that is seen in wild type unfolding. Remarkably, this is accomplished primarily by destabilizing the molten globule rather than stabilizing the metastable native state. Locally, conformational flexibility in the native state is reduced in specific regions: the top of the F-helix, beta-strands 5A, 1C, and 4C, and helix D. Except for strand 4C, all of these regions mediate or propagate conformational changes. The F-helix and strand 5A must be displaced during protease inhibition, displacement of strand 1C is required for polymer formation, and helix D is a site (in antithrombin) of allosteric regulation. Our results indicate that these functionally important regions form a delocalized network of residues that are dynamically coupled and that both local and global stability mediate inhibitory activity.
19460631,4,2009,Int J Dev Neurosci,Astroglia genesis in vitro: distinct effects of retinoic acid in different phases of neural stem cell differentiation.,In the developing CNS, the manifestation of the macro-glial phenotypes is delayed behind the formation of neurons. The &quot;neurons first--glia second&quot; principle seems to be valid for neural tissue differentiation throughout the neuraxis, but the reasons behind are far from clear. In the presented study, the mechanisms of this timing were investigated in vitro, in the course of the neural differentiation of one cell derived NE-4C neuroectodermal stem and P19 embryonic carcinoma cells. The data demonstrated that astrocyte formation coincided in time with the maturation of postmitotic neurons, but the close vicinity of neurons did not initiate astrocyte formation before schedule. All-trans retinoic acid, a well-known inducer of neuronal differentiation, on the other hand, blocked effectively the astroglia production if present in defined stages of the in vitro neuroectodermal cell differentiation. According to the data, retinoic acid plays at least a dual role in astrogliogenesis: while it is needed for committing neural progenitors for a future production of astrocytes, it prevents premature astrogliogenesis by inhibiting the differentiation of primed glial progenitors.
19378972,4,2009,J Med Chem,In vitro heavy-atom effect of palladium(II) and platinum(II) complexes of pyrrolidine-fused chlorin in photodynamic therapy.,Introduction of a heavy atom into photosensitizers generally facilitates intersystem crossing and improves the quantum yield (Phi(Delta)) of singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)), which is a key species in photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, little information is available about the physiological importance of this heavy-atom effect. The aim of this study is to examine the heavy-atom effect in simple metallochlorins in vitro at the cellular level. 1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylide to 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrinato palladium(II) and platinum(II) afforded metallochlorins 4b and 4c in yields of 17.1 and 12.9%, respectively. The Phi(Delta) values increased in the order of 4a (0.28) &lt; 4b (0.89) &lt; 4c (0.92) in C(6)D(6). The photocytotoxicity of 4a, 4b, and 4c was evaluated in HeLa cells at a light dose of 16 J x cm(-2) with lambda &gt; 500 nm and increased in the order of 4a &lt; 4b &lt; 4c at the concentration of 0.5 microM. The photocytotoxicity of 4b and 4c was significantly inhibited by addition of sodium azide, but not D-mannitol, suggesting that (1)O(2) is the major species causing cell death. Our results clearly indicate that 4b and 4c act as efficient (1)O(2) generators due to the heavy-atom effect in a cellular microenvironment as well as in nonphysiological media.
19359186,4,2009,Bioorg Med Chem,Asymmetric synthesis and biological evaluation of Danshensu derivatives as anti-myocardial ischemia drug candidates.,The synthesis and bioactivities of Danshensu derivatives (R)-methyl 2-acetoxy-3-(3,4-diacetoxyphenyl)propanoate (1a), (R)-methyl 2-acetoxy-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propanoate (1b) and their racemates 7 and 10 were reported in this paper. These derivatives were designed to improve their chemical stability and liposolubility by protecting Danshensu's phenolic hydroxyl groups with acetyl or methylene which could be readily hydrolyzed to release bioactive Danshensu. The asymmetric synthesis of 1a and 1b were achieved by catalytic hydrogenation of (Z)-methyl 2-acetoxy-3-(3,4-diacetoxyphenyl)-2-propenoate (6a) and (Z)-methyl 2-acetoxy-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-propenoate (6b) in excellent enantiomeric excesses (92% ee and 98% ee, respectively) and good yields (&gt;89%). An unexpected intermediate product, (Z)-2-acetoxy-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acrylic acid (4c) was obtained with high chemoselectivity in 86% yield by keeping the reaction temperature at 60 degrees C and its structure was identified by X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis. 1a, 1b and their racemates 7, 10 as well as 4c exhibited potent protective activities against hypoxia-induced cellular damage. The in vitro test showed that all these compounds could increase cell viability, and inhibit lipid hyperoxidation. Furthermore, 1a and 4c could inhibit apoptosis by regulating the expression of apoptosis-related molecule in gene and protein levels, up-regulating the expression of bcl-2 and down-regulating bax and caspase-3. The in vivo test indicated that 4c exhibited anti-myocardial ischemic effects featured by reducing infarction size and increasing the level of the intracellular enzymes detectable in serum. Therefore, these Danshensu derivatives may be good drug candidates for anti-myocardial ischemia therapy and merit further investigation.
19296600,4,2009,J Med Chem,Novel peptidomimetics containing a vinyl ester moiety as highly potent and selective falcipain-2 inhibitors.,This paper describes the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new class of peptidomimetic falcipain-2 inhibitors based on a 1,4-benzodiazepine scaffold combined with various alpha,beta-unsaturated electrophilic functions such as vinyl-ketone, -amide, -ester, and -nitrile. The profile of reactivity of this class of derivatives has been evaluated and 4c, containing a vinyl ester warhead, proved to be a highly potent and selective falcipain-2 inhibitor.
19225680,4,2009,Org Biomol Chem,6- and 14-Fluoro farnesyl diphosphate: mechanistic probes for the reaction catalysed by aristolochene synthase.,The catalytic mechanism of the enzyme aristolochene synthase from Penicillium roqueforti (PR-AS) has been probed with the farnesyl diphosphate analogues 6- and 14-fluoro farnesyl diphosphate (1a and 1c). Incubation of these analogues with PR-AS followed by analysis of the reaction products by GC-MS and NMR spectroscopy indicated that these synthetic FPP analogues were converted to the fluorinated germacrene A analogues 3b and 3c, respectively. In both cases the position of the fluorine atom prevented the formation of the eudesmane cation analogues 4b and 4c. These results highlight that germacrene A is an on-path reaction intermediate during PR-AS catalysis and shed light on the mechanism by which germacrene A is converted to eudesmane cation. They support the proposal that the role of PR-AS in the cyclisation is essentially passive in that it harnesses the inherent chemical reactivity present in the substrate by promoting the initial ionisation of farnesyl diphosphate and by acting as a productive template to steer the reaction through an effective series of cyclisations and rearrangements to (+)-aristolochene (7a).
20005707,3,2009,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and biological evaluation of nitrogen-containing chalcones as possible anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents.,A novel series of nitrogen-containing chalcones were synthesized by Mannich reaction and were screened for anti-inflammatory related activities such as inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), trypsin and beta-glucuronidase. The antioxidant potential was demonstrated using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazine (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. The results of the above studies shows that the compounds synthesized were found to be effective inhibitors of above pro-inflammatory enzymes, and were found to be possess moderate radical scavenging potential. Overall, the results of the studies reveal that the chalcones with N-methyl piperazine methyl and piperidine methyl substitution (4c, 3b, 4d, 6b) seems to be important for inhibition of beta-glucuronidase. Whereas the chalcones with piperidine methyl substitution (8b, 7b, 7c, 6c, 4b, 3c, 3b) were observed as effective inhibitors of COX-2, while the same compounds were found to be less reactive against COX-1 as compared to COX-2.
19929890,3,2009,Breast J,Clinical implications of subcategorizing BI-RADS 4 breast lesions associated with microcalcification: a radiology-pathology correlation study.,Currently radiologists have the option of subcategorizing BI-RADS 4 breast lesions into 4A (low suspicion for malignancy), 4B (intermediate suspicion of malignancy), and 4C (moderate concern, but not classic for malignancy). To determine the clinical significance of BI-RADS 4 subcategories and the common pathologic changes associated with these mammographic lesions, a retrospective review of 239 consecutive stereotactic-needle core biopsies (SNCB) for microcalcifications was performed. All 239 SNCBs were BI-RADS 4 lesions, and of these, 191 were subcategorized to 4A, 4B or 4C. Ninety-four of 191 (49%) were 4A, 73 (38%) were 4B, and 24 (13%) were 4C. Fibrocystic change was the most common finding (66/239; 28%) followed by ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounting for 23% of cases. This was followed by columnar cell alteration with or without atypia (47/239; 19%), and fibroadenoma (45/239; 19%). While 70% (17/24) of BI-RADS 4C category lesions were DCIS, only 21% (15/73) of BI-RADS 4B and 10% (10/94) of BI-RADS 4A were DCIS. Without sub-categorization, carcinoma was diagnosed in 23% (55/239) of all cases with BI-RADS 4. Therefore, subcategorizing BI-RADS 4 lesions is important since it not only benefits the patient and clinician in understanding the level of concern for carcinoma, but will also alert the pathologist.
19809786,3,2009,Acta Neurochir (Wien),A quantitative comparison of radiosurgical treatment parameters in vestibular schwannomas: the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion versus Model 4C.,PURPOSE: The world's first Gamma Knife Perfexion (PFX)was installed in Marseille in July 2006. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the PFX technology on the quality of dose planning for vestibular schwannomas (VS).METHODS: When the PFX was first introduced, a comparative randomized prospective study of 200 patients was conducted.Seventy-eight of the 200 patients in that study had VS, of whom 38 were randomized to treatment with the Gamma Knife Model 4C (group 4C) and 40 were randomized to treatment with PFX (group P1). The authors also incorporated a matched group of 40 patients with VS consecutively treated with PFX after the initial learning curve period (group P2). Dose planning was compared and evaluated by measuring the conformity index (CI), selectivity index (SI), gradient index(GI), energy index (EI), unit isocenters (UI) and cochlear dose. Patients were also stratified into subgroups according to target volume (&gt; or = 0.5 ml).RESULTS: In the whole population, CI, EI and cochlear dose were significantly better in group P2 (CI=0.917, EI=1.35,cochlear dose=3.55) than in group 4C (CI=0.864, EI=1.27,cochlear dose=5.10). In the subgroup of lesions &gt; or = 0.5 ml, CI,GI, EI, UI and cochlear dose in group P2 (CI=0.929, GI=2.67, EI=1.37, UI=10.6, cochlear dose=3.55) were significantly better than in group 4C (CI=0.874, GI=2.85, EI=1.30, UI=14.5, cochlear dose=5.10).CONCLUSIONS: The investigation of the dose planning capabilities of the PFX on a cohort of VS demonstrates a better conformity and energy distribution, with better cochlear sparing and without any particular drawback. In addition,there is an improvement in peripheral dose gradient in larger lesions. Further clinical studies will be required before drawing any conclusions about the clinical benefit achieved by these dose planning improvements.
19703033,3,2009,Chem Biol Drug Des,One-pot synthesis of highly functionalized seleno amino acid derivatives.,We herein provide a new and rapid protocol to generate derivatives of seleno amino acid, including methyl selenocysteine, selenomethionine, and selenocystine. Applying the isocyanide-based multicomponent reaction Ugi-4C-5C reaction, we show that each of the commercially available seleno amino acids are good substrate for these reactions and can be used together with complementary oxocomponents and isocyanides to generate highly diverse functionalized selenium-containing compounds. These compounds might become useful tools for applications in chemical biology to elucidate the role of selenium in biochemistry.
19696753,3,2009,Obesity (Silver Spring),Quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) for longitudinal evaluation of body composition changes with two dietary regimens.,We have recently reported a validation study of a prototype low-field strength quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) instrument for measurement of human body composition (EchoMRI-AH). QMR was very precise, but underreported fat mass (FM) by 2-4 kg when compared to a 4-compartment (4C) model in this cross-sectional study. Here, we report the performance of an updated instrument in two longitudinal studies where FM was decreasing. Healthy obese volunteers were given a modest energy deficit diet for 8 weeks (study A) and obese patients with heart failure and/or at high cardiovascular risk were prescribed a low energy liquid diet for 6 weeks (study B). FM was measured at the start and end of these periods by QMR, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and 4C. A higher proportion of the weight lost came from fat in study A compared with study B, where loss of total body water (TBW) played a greater part. The intraclass correlation between QMR and 4C estimates of FM loss (DeltaFat) was 0.95, but 20 of 22 estimates of DeltaFat by QMR were lower than the corresponding estimate by the 4C model. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated that estimates of FM loss by QMR were ~1.0 and 0.7 kg lower than those obtained with 4C (P = 0.0008) and DXA (P = 0.049), respectively. Measurement precision remained high. QMR measurement should prove valuable for quantifying modest changes of FM in small trials.
19650661,3,2009,J Am Chem Soc,Photochemical generation and the reactivity of o-naphthoquinone methides in aqueous solutions.,Irradiation of 3-hydroxy-2-naphthalenemethanol (3a) and 2-hydroxy-1-naphthalenemethanol (4a) results in efficient (Phi(254) = 0.17 and 0.20) dehydration and the formation of isomeric naphthoquinone methides, 2,3-naphthoquinone-3-methide (1) and 1,2-naphthoquinone-1-methide (2), respectively. In aqueous solution, naphthoquinone methides 1 and 2 undergo rapid hydration to regenerate starting materials (tau(H2O) (1) = 7.4 ms and tau(H2O) (2) = 4.5 ms at 25 degrees C). The hydration reaction is strongly catalyzed by the hydroxide ion but shows acid catalysis only at pH &lt; 1. Reactive intermediates 1 and 2 can be intercepted by other nucleophiles, such as the azide ion (k(N3)(1) = 2.0 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) and k(N3)(2) = 3.0 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)) or thiol (k(SH)(1) = 2.2 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) and k(SH)(2) = 3.3 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1)). Ethyl vinyl ether readily reacts with 1 and 2 (k(DA)(1) = 4.1 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) and k(DA)(2) = 6.0 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)) to produce Diels-Alder adducts in excellent yield. o-Naphthoquinone methides 1 and 2 were also generated by photolysis of 3-ethoxymethyl- (3b) and 1-(ethoxymethyl)-2-naphthols (4b), as well as from (2-hydroxy-3-naphthyl)methyl- (3c) and [(2-hydroxy-1-naphthyl)methyl] trimethylammonium iodides (4c). Laser flash photolysis of 3a,b and 4a,b allows the detection of short-lived (tau(25 degrees C) approximately 12 micros) precursors of naphthoquinone methides 1 and 2. On the basis of the precursor reactivity and the results of DFT calculations, 2H-naphthoxete structure was assigned to these species.
19632747,3,2009,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis of 3,6-disubstituted 7H-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b]-1,3,4-thiadiazines as novel analgesic/anti-inflammatory compounds.,In this study, a new class of 4-amino-3-substituted-1,2,4-triazole-5-thiones (1-4) and their corresponding condensed derivatives 3,6-disubstituted 7H-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b]-1,3,4-thiadiazines (1a-4c) were synthesized and evaluated for their analgesic/anti-inflammatory activities. All synthesized compounds were also tested for their gastric toxicity and antioxidant activity on acute administration. Most of the compounds showed significant activity in both carrageenan-induced oedema and acetic acid-induced writhing tests besides negligible gastrointestinal toxicity. The compounds showing less ulcerogenic effect also showed less lipid peroxidation (LPO) level. Most promising results were obtained with the compounds that placed a fluoro or a chloride on the phenyl ring at the sixth position of the fused ring.
19545604,3,2009,Neurosci Lett,Translocator protein (TSPO 18kDa) is expressed by neural stem and neuronal precursor cells.,Translocator protein 18 kDa, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor by its earlier name, is a mitochondrial membrane protein associated with the mitochondrial permeability pore. While the function of the protein is not properly understood, it is known to play roles in necrotic and apoptotic processes of the neural tissue. In the healthy adult brain, TSPO expression is restricted to glial cells. In developing or damaged neural regions, however, TSPO appears in differentiating/regenerating neurons. Using immunocytochemical, molecular biological and cell biological techniques, we demonstrate that TSPO mRNA and protein, while missing from mature neurons, are present in neural stem cells and also in postmitotic neuronal precursors. Investigating some distinct stages of in vitro differentiation of NE-4C neural stem cells, TSPO 18 kDa was found to be repressed in a relatively late phase of neuron formation, when mature neuron-specific features appear. This timing indicates that mitochondria in fully developed neurons display specific characteristics and provides an additional marker for characterising neuronal differentiation.
19494568,3,2009,Stereotact Funct Neurosurg,Efficiency and dose planning comparisons between the Perfexion and 4C Leksell Gamma Knife units.,AIMS: We analyzed the efficiency of the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion (LGK PFX) in the treatment of multiple metastases and benign tumors. We also compared treatment planning conformity between LGK PFX and LGK 4C for benign tumors.METHOD: Over a 6-week interval, 37 patients (21 with multiple brain metastases and 16 with benign tumors) underwent radiosurgery using LGK PFX at the University of Pittsburgh. We created dose plans for all patients using Leksell Gamma Plan for LGK PFX and LGK 4C. The same doses were prescribed for both LGK PFX and LGK 4C.RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between LGK 4C and LGK PFX for total beam-on time. The median reduction in setup time on the LGK PFX was 53 min per patient (range 19-125 min) for multiple metastases. The median reduction in setup time on the LGK PFX for benign tumors was 16 min per patient (range 5-53 min). There was no significant difference in the dose conformality between LGK 4C and LGK PFX.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that in addition to its enhanced cranial reach, LGK PFX provided a significant improvement in efficiency for patients with multiple brain metastases. For benign tumor radiosurgery LGK PFX provided improvement in efficiency without a significant difference in conformality.
19420340,3,2009,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Enzymatic breakdown of type II collagen in the human vitreous.,PURPOSE: To investigate whether enzymatic collagen breakdown is an active process in the human vitreous.METHODS: Human donor eyes were used for immunohistochemistry to detect the possible presence of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-induced type II collagen breakdown product col2-3/4C-short in the vitreous. Western blot and slot blot analyses were used to further identify vitreal type II collagen breakdown products in three age groups with average ages of 25, 45, and 65 years. Purified type II collagen was cleaved by MMPs that are known to occur naturally in the vitreous to elucidate what possible type II collagen breakdown products could thus be formed in the human vitreous.RESULTS: By means of both immunohistochemistry and slot blot analysis, col2-3/4C-short was detected in the vitreous. Using Western blot analysis, a range of type II collagen breakdown products was found, mostly in younger eyes, but none of these products contained the neoepitope that characterizes the col2-3/4C-short molecule. Digestion of purified type II collagen by MMPs did not give the same breakdown products as found in the vitreous.CONCLUSIONS: The presence of collagen degradation products in the human vitreous supports the hypothesis that enzymatic breakdown is most likely an active process in this extracellular matrix. Based on the size of the degradation products found by Western blot analysis, it is likely that in addition to MMPs, other proteolytic enzymes able to digest type II collagen are also active.
19399836,3,2009,Laryngoscope,Gamma knife radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas: results of hearing preservation in relation to the cochlear radiation dose.,HYPOTHESIS: This study was designed to evaluate hearing preservation after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and to determine the relation between hearing preservation and cochlear radiation dose in patients with a sporadic vestibular schwannoma (VS).METHODS: Prospective study involving patients suffering from VS who received GKRS from June 2003 until November 2007. Pure tone and speech audiometry were conducted before and after GKRS. The thresholds at pure tone audiometry were taken as a measure of hearing. Pure tone average (PTA) was defined as the mean threshold at 0.5 kHz, 1.0 kHz, 2.0 kHz, and 4.0 kHz. Hearing was classified according to the 2003 consensus meeting in Tokyo. Stereotactic surgery was performed using a Leksell 4C Gamma Knife (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden).RESULTS: A total of 69 patients were included in the study. Mean tumor size was 17 mm. Mean marginal dose at the tumor was 11.0 Gy (range, 9.3 Gy-12.3 Gy), mean maximal dose was 19.7 Gy (range, 16 Gy-25.5 Gy). Mean maximal dose at the cochlea was 10.27 Gy (range, 3.1 Gy-16.1 Gy), and mean minimal dose at the cochlea was 2.6 Gy (range, 0.9 Gy-7.4 Gy). Mean PTA before GKRS was 43 dB (standard deviation [SD] 20 dB), mean PTA after GKRS was 63 dB (SD 30 dB). Mean interval between pre-GKRS audiometry and GKRS was 8.0 months. Between GKRS and post-GKRS audiometry, mean interval was 14.2 months. Hearing was considered to be preserved (max +1 class, Tokyo classification) in 52 (75%) of 69 patients. However, only 32 patients had class A, B, or C (serviceable hearing) before GKRS. Within this group, only 13 patients (41%) had a hearing class A, B, or C after GKRS. A significant relation was found between the maximal cochlear dose and the difference in PTA before and after GKRS.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing preservation is correlated to the maximal radiation dose at the cochlea. The purpose of developing GKRS techniques was to avoid collateral damage in healthy tissues. This study emphasizes the need for exact radiation planning to reduce the cochlear radiation dose if the hearing is to be preserved. Laryngoscope, 2009.
19246084,3,2009,Theriogenology,Effect of trychostatin A treatment on gene expression in cloned mouse embryos.,Histone deacetylation occurs upon the transfer of somatic nuclei into enucleated oocytes, but its role in reprogramming somatic chromatin to the totipotent state is unknown. To investigate the importance of histone deacetylation in reprogramming, we constructed embryos by electrofusing breast cancer cells with enucleated mouse oocytes. The reconstructed embryos were then cultured before and/or after activation for 6h in the presence of trychostatin A (TSA), a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase. Total RNA was isolated from these TSA-treated and untreated embryos and real-time reverse transcription PCR was conducted to monitor transcription of ErbB2, Muc1, eIF-4C, MuERV-L, and c-mos genes. The nuclear-cytoplasmic interaction inhibited typical expression of ErbB2 and Muc1 in the somatic cells. Moreover, the inhibition of histone deacetylation prior to activation did not increase the levels of eIF-4C, MuERV-L, and c-mos expression in the nuclear transfer (NT) embryos (P&gt;0.05), whereas additional treatment with 100nM TSA beyond the activation point improved expression of these genes (P&lt;0.05). Trychostatin A treatment also improved the development rates of NT embryos at the 2-cell, 4-cell, and blastocyst stages (78.6% vs. 90.2%, 45.2% vs. 68.9%, and 16.7% vs. 30.3%, respectively, P&lt;0.05). We hypothesized that the reprogramming of gene expression in NT embryos is independent of somatic histone deacetylation, and that hyperacetylation may have a positive effect on NT embryo development.
19169070,3,2009,Eat Weight Disord,Night eating status and influence on body weight, body image, hunger, and cortisol pre- and post- Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) surgery.,Night Eating Syndrome is a common disorder in severely obese individuals and may be associated with hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation. This study compared night eaters (NE) and comparably obese controls (C) pre- and post-Roux-en- Y Gastric Bypass surgery at 2 and 5 months, following an overnight fast on hormonal measures associated with HPA axis and related appetite and psychological measures. There were 24 (10 NE, 14 C) clinically severely obese participants (body mass index =47.0+/-8.4 SD). At pre-surgery baseline, afternoon fasting hunger ratings differed significantly and were lower for NE than for C (p=0.01). Eight of the participants (4 NE, 4C) returned for all 3 study visits. At 5 months post-surgery, NE and C did not differ in weight loss, reductions in waist circumference, insulin levels, and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment). However, NE as compared to C, did not improve in self ratings of body image (p&lt;0.05), and had significant increases in fasting afternoon cortisol levels 5 months after surgery (p=0.01).
19793020,2,2009,Drug Chem Toxicol,A review of smoking behavior and smokers evidence (chemical modification, inducing nicotine metabolism, and individual variations by genotype: dopaminergic function and personality traits).,The nicotine metabolism of CYP2A6 (CYP2A6*1A,*1B, and *1C), and the cholecystokinin (CCK; which modulates the release of dopamine) and CCK-A receptor gene and personality traits for NEO-FFI, was investigated for the mechanism for elucidation of the smoking behavior in Japanese populations. The frequency of the CYP2A6*4C allele, which is a whole deleted allele of the human CYP2A6 gene, was higher, whereas that of CYP2A6*1A/*1B heterozygotes with higher nicotine metabolism activity was lower in nonsmokers than in smokers. There was also a significant difference between the current smoking and nonsmoking groups in the allele frequency of the CCK -45C/T polymorphism. It was also shown that the Openness (O) factor for smokers was significantly higher than that of nonsmokers; however, there were no significant differences in the Neuroticism (N), Extraversion (E), Agreeable (A), and Conscientiousness (C) scores among smokers than nonsmokers. It was suggested that the CYP2A6*4C allele may prevent the carrier from smoking, and being a CYP2A6*1A/*1B heterozygote and the CCK T allele may be risk factors for developing smoking behavior. Also, it is possible that persons with a low score in Openness may be refraining from smoking because they have a general negative impression toward smoking.
19765370,2,2009,Curr Gastroenterol Rep,Common anorectal disorders: diagnosis and treatment.,Anorectal disorders affect men and women of all ages. Their management is not limited to the evaluation and treatment of hemorrhoids. Rather, a spectrum of anorectal disorders ranges from benign and irritating (pruritus ani) to potentially life-threatening (anorectal cancer). Symptoms are nonspecific, which can make the evaluation of patients difficult. In addition, treatment can be frustrating because clinicians are hamstrung by a lack of well-designed, prospective, clinical trials. Some of the most common anorectal disorders include fecal incontinence, pelvic floor dyssynergia, anal fissures, pruritus ani, proctalgia fugax, and solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. This article provides an update on the evaluation and treatment of common anorectal disorders.
19675495,2,2009,J Strength Cond Res,Are skinfold-based models accurate and suitable for assessing changes in body composition in highly trained athletes?,This study was designed to assess the usefulness of skinfold (SKF) equations developed by Jackson and Pollock (JP) and by Evans (Ev) in tracking body composition changes (relative fat mass [%FM], absolute fat mass [FM], and fat-free mass [FFM]) of elite male judo athletes before a competition using a 4-compartment (4C) model as the reference method. A total of 18 male, top-level (age: 22.6 +/- 2.9 yr) athletes were evaluated at baseline (weight: 73.4 +/- 7.9 kg; %FM4C: 7.0 +/- 3.3%; FM4C: 5.1 +/- 2.6 kg; and FFM4C: 68.3 +/- 7.3 kg) and before a competition (weight: 72.7 +/- 7.5 kg; %FM4C: 6.5 +/- 3.4%; FM4C: 4.8 +/- 2.6 kg; and FFM4C: 67.9 +/- 7.1 kg). Measures of body density assessed by air displacement plethysmography, bone mineral content by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and total-body water by bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy were used to estimate 4C model %FM, FM, and FFM. Seven SKF site models using both JP and Ev were used to estimate %FM, FM, and FFM along with the simplified Ev3SKF site. Changes in %FM, FM, and FFM were not significantly different from the 4C model. The regression model for the SKF in question and the reference method did not differ from the line of identity in estimating changes in %FM, FM, and FFM. The limits of agreement were similar, ranging from -3.4 to 3.6 for %FM, -2.7 to 2.5 kg for FM, and -2.5 to 2.7 kg for FFM. Considering the similar performance of both 7SKF- and 3SKF-based equations compared with the criterion method, these data indicate that either the 7- or 3-site SFK models are not valid to detect %FM, FM, and FFM changes of highly trained athletes. These results highlighted the inaccuracy of anthropometric models in tracking desired changes in body composition of elite male judo athletes before a competition.
19620006,2,2009,Bioorg Med Chem,Development of antitubercular compounds based on a 4-quinolylhydrazone scaffold. Further structure-activity relationship studies.,A series of 4-quinolylhydrazones was synthesized and tested in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. At a concentration of 6.25microg/mL, most of the newly synthesized compounds displayed 100% inhibitory activity against M. tuberculosis in cellular assays. Further screening allowed the identification of very potent antitubercular agents. Compound 4c was also tested in a time-course experiment and against mtb clinical isolates, displaying interesting results.
19567267,2,2009,Protein Expr Purif,Over-expression in E. coli and purification of the human OCTN1 transport protein.,The hOCTN1 amplified from skin fibroblast RNA was cloned in pET-28a(+) or in pH6EX3 plasmid. The encoded recombinant hOCTN1 resulted in a 6-His tagged fusion protein with a 34 or 21 amino acid extra N-terminal sequence in the pET-28a(+)-hOCTN1 or in the pH6EX3-hOCTN1 constructs, respectively. Both constructs were used to express the hOCTN1 in Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS. The best over-expression was obtained with the pH6EX3-hOCTN1 after 6h of induction with IPTG at 28 degrees C. The expressed protein with an apparent molecular mass of 54kDa, was collected in the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate. Further improvement was obtained using the E. coli RosettaGami2(DE3)pLysS strain to express the protein encoded by pH6EX3-hOCTN1. After 6h of induction with IPTG at 28 degrees C, hOCTN1 accounted for 30% of the total protein in the insoluble pellet. This protein fraction was washed with Triton X-100 and deoxycholate, solubilized with a buffer containing 0.8% Sarkosyl, 3M urea and applied to a Ni2+-chelating chromatography column. The homogeneously purified hOCTN1 was eluted with a buffer containing 50 mM imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. A yield of about 3mg purified protein per liter of cell culture was obtained.
19447663,2,2009,Gynecol Obstet Fertil,[Function of aurora kinase C (AURKC) in human reproduction].,Infertility concerns at least 70 million couples worldwide. An important proportion of cases is believed to have a genetic component, yet few causal genes have been identified so far. Hundreds of genes are probably involved in spermatogenesis and oogenesis and this genetic heterogeneity has so far hindered the identification of genes causing infertility in the human. Careful morphological examination of spermatozoa can provide cues to identify homogeneous cohorts of patients likely to have the same genetic defect. We studied a cohort of North-Africans patients with a rare phenotype of large-headed spermatozoa. Using a homozygosity mapping strategy, we could map the morbid gene and we identified the same homozygous mutation (c.144delC) in the aurora kinase C gene (AURKC) of all patients studied initially. We then genotyped a total of 62 patients. All who had a typical phenotype with close to 100% large-headed spermatozoa were homozygously mutated (n=34), whereas no AURKC mutations were detected in the others. A carrier frequency of 1/50 was established from individuals from the Maghrebian population, indicating that 1 in 10,000 men from North-African can be expected to present this form of infertility, a frequency comparable to that of Y-microdeletions, thus far the only known recurrent genetic event altering spermatogenesis. Then we demonstrated by flow cytometry that all spermatozoa have in fact a homogeneous 4C. We recommend the realisation of a molecular diagnosis to all patients with large-headed spermatozoa. ICSI is formally contraindicated for all homozygous patients who can have recourse to donor sperm or adoption. One cannot be as categorical for the patients not harbouring an AURKC mutation.
19415660,2,2009,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Novel 3,6-disubstituted 7H-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazines: synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of analgesic/anti-inflammatory, antioxidant activities.,In this study, the synthesis of a new series of 3,6-disubstituted-7H-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazine 1a-4c compounds derived from 4-amino-3-substituted-1,2,4-triazole-5-thiones 1-4 is described. All of the synthesized compounds were screened for their possible analgesic / anti-inflammatory, antioxidant activities and gastric toxicity. The compound 2c was found to have both significant analgesic and consistent anti-inflammatory activity without inducing any gastric lesions along with minimal lipid peroxidation. A deep insight into the structures of the active compounds revealed that the compounds carrying an electron withdrawing group (a chloride or fluoride) on the phenyl ring at 6-position of the condensed heterocyclic derivatives exhibited noticeable higher activity.
21475838,2,2009,Mol Med Rep,Genome-wide gene expression profiles of ovarian carcinoma: Identification of molecular targets for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma.,This study aimed to clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in ovarian carcinogenesis, and to identify candidate molecular targets for its diagnosis and treatment. The genome-wide gene expression profiles of 22 epithelial ovarian carcinomas were analyzed with a microarray representing 38,500 genes, in combination with laser microbeam microdissection. A total of 273 commonly up-regulated transcripts and 387 down-regulated transcripts were identified in the ovarian carcinoma samples. Of the 273 up-regulated transcripts, only 87 (31.9%) were previously reported as up-regulated in microarray studies using bulk cancer tissues and normal ovarian tissues for analysis. CHMP4C (chromatin-modifying protein 4C) was frequently overexpressed in ovarian carcinoma tissue, but not expressed in the normal human tissues used as a control. Our data should contribute to an improved understanding of tumorigenesis in ovarian cancer, and aid in the development of diagnostic tumor markers and molecular-targeting therapy for patients with the disease.
19382663,2,2009,New Microbiol,Epidemiology of human cytomegalovirus strains through comparison of methodological approaches to explore gN variants.,Genomic variation among human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) wild-type strains is a well-documented phenomenon probably implicated in HCMV-induced immunopathogenesis. Extensive genetic polymorphism has been detected for the envelope glycoprotein N (gN) and HCMV clinical isolates have been clustered into seven distinct gN variants (gN-1, gN-2, gN-3a, gN-3b, gN-4a, gN-4b, gN-4c). Several studies from different research groups worldwide have addressed this topic using different methodological approaches (PCR-RFLP, PCR-Cloning, PCR-Sequencing) and sometimes yielding apparently conflicting results. This paper analyses the epidemiology of HCMV strains through analysis of gN variants, criticizing the methodological approaches and study populations by comparison of published reports.

19123884,2,2009,J Neurosurg,Image registration accuracy of GammaPlan: a phantom study.,OBJECT: The authors evaluated the accuracy of the automatic image coregistration function implemented in the Leksell GammaPlan treatment planning software (Version 4C with MultiView Extension and Version 8.0).METHODS: The authors used a phantom with 9 landmarks (tips of thin cylindrical acrylic rods) evenly distributed in the treatment space. Two sets of images of the phantom were taken with both CT and MR imaging systems. The first image was obtained with the phantom aligned with the scanner's axis and the second scan was made by intentionally shifting and rotating the phantom relative to the scanner's axis. The authors attempted image registration of 2 CT image sets, CT and MR image sets, and 2 MR image sets. The accuracy of image registration was evaluated by measuring the x, y, and z coordinate values of the landmarks on each image set after 2 image sets were coregistered. The authors calculated the differences of the x, y, and z values and the distance, d, between corresponding landmarks in 2 image sets. To minimize interobserver dependence of coordinate measurements, 2 physicists did measurements independently.RESULTS: The distances, d, averaged over the 9 landmarks, were 2.63 +/- 1.64 and 0.95 +/- 0.25 mm for CT-CT and MR-MR image registrations, respectively. When the CT images of the air-filled phantom and MR images were coregistered, however, the algorithm performed poorly: d = 13.8 +/- 1.23 mm. To remedy this, the authors undertook a 2-step process by first performing landmark-based registration of the 2 image sets and subsequently applying the automatic registration. With this approach, the mean distance drastically improved: d = 0.74 +/- 0.31 mm. When the water-filled phantom was used for CT scans, the registration accuracy of CT and MR image sets was acceptable without the 2-step registration process: d = 1.18 +/- 0.36 mm.CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of automatic registration of image sets from the same modality was within the voxel size of the scanned images. The accuracy of CT-MR image registration strongly depended on whether the phantom for CT scans was filled with air or water. This indicates the significant effect of the amount of common data available for a mutual information-based algorithm on the accuracy.
19124492,2,2009,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,The association of bone mineral density with prostate cancer risk in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study.,We investigated the association of bone mineral density (BMD) measures with prostate cancer (PCa) risk in older men enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study. We hypothesized that men with higher BMD, a marker of exposure to endogenous sex hormones, would have an increased incidence of PCa. The cohort included 4,597 men (89% White, 65 years or older) with no prior history of PCa. Baseline total body, total hip, and spine BMD were assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Prostate cancer was confirmed by review of medical records. Cox regression was used to assess the association of BMD quartiles with incident PCa, adjusting for age, body mass index, and other covariates. During an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 5.6% (n = 255) of men developed PCa. Total body BMD was inversely associated with incident PCa, with a significant trend for decreasing PCa risk with increasing BMD quartiles (P(trend) = 0.007). Men in the highest total body BMD quartile had a 41% reduced risk for PCa (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.86), compared with men in the lowest quartile. Total hip and spine BMD did not exhibit significant relationships with PCa. Associations of BMD measures differed for low-grade (Gleason sum, 2-6) versus high-grade tumors (Gleason sum, &gt;or=7). Significant inverse relationships with high-grade disease were noted at the total body and total hip sites. However, no associations were observed with low-grade disease. Our results provide support for an inverse association between BMD and PCa risk. Possible pathophyisological mechanisms linking BMD and PCa should be elucidated.
23344171,2,2009,J Res Health Sci,Acidity rate and fluoride content of consumed beverages in kerman/iran.,BACKGROUND: High consumption of nonalcoholic beverages is one of the causes of dental erosion. Annual consumption of beverages in Iran is 48 LPCY (Lit per capita per year) that is equal to 144 bottles per capita in year and is relatively a high rate. Taking this into consideration, the present study was planned to determine the pH and fluoride content of beverages consumed in Kerman, south east of Iran.METHODS: In a descriptive cross-sectional study during 2006-2007, samples of any type of beverages in Kerman were taken once every 4 months and each sample was examined for its acidity and fluoride content in ambient and refrigerator temperatures. A total of 744 experiments were conducted on 62 brands of beverages with different colors to determine the acidity and on 31 brands of beverages to determine their fluoride content. Acidity was determined by pH-meter in the ambient temperature and refrigerator temperature (+4◦C). Fluoride content was determined using specific electrode method. Data analysis was done by SPSS software package.RESULTS: Mean acidity of the consumed beverages in Kerman was 2.55 and 2.78 mg/L in the ambient temperature and refrigerator temperature, respectively. Mean fluoride concentration in the temperature of the ambient and refrigerator were 1.13 and 1.27 mg/L respectively. Therefore beverages consumption in Kerman had a higher acidity than national standard.CONCLUSION: Since some of the consumed beverages in Kerman are distributed and consumed in other parts of Iran as well, necessary precautions for controlling dental erosion especially in Kerman residents should be taken.
20028110,1,2009,Inorg Chem,Template synthesis of iron(II) complexes containing tridentate P-N-S, P-N-P, P-N-N, and tetradentate P-N-N-P ligands.,A series of mer-tridentate iron(II) complexes bearing P-N-S (3), P-N-P (4), and P-N-N (5) ligands have been prepared via the metal template effect in one pot involving air-stable phosphonium dimers [cyclo-(-PPh(2)CH(2)C(OH)H-)(2)](Br)(2) (1) and [cyclo-(-PCy(2)CH(2)C(OH)H-)(2)](Br)(2) (2), KOtBu, [Fe(H(2)O)(6)][BF(4)](2) and 2-aminothiolphenol (for 3), 2-(diphenylphosphino)ethylamine (for 4), and 2-(aminomethyl)pyridine (for 5). The new phosphonium dimer 2 was prepared via an S(N)2 reaction of PCy(2)H with BrCH(2)CH(OEt)(2). The complexes Fe{PR(2)CH(2)CH=N(2-C(6)H(4))S}(2)FeBr(2) (3a, R = Ph; 3b, R = Cy) are paramagnetic, and X-ray diffraction studies revealed that they are bimetallic, in which the S atoms of the bis-tridentate (PNS)(2)Fe unit bridge to a FeBr(2) fragment. Complexes [Fe(PR(2)CH(2)CH=NC(2)H(4)PPh(2))(NCMe)(3)]X(2) (4a, R = Ph; 4b, R = Cy; X(2) = FeBr(4) or (BF(4))(2)) form when 1 equiv of iron is reacted with PPh(2)CH(2)CH(2)NH(2) and 0.5 equiv of the appropriate phosphonium dimer. The evidence for P-N-P coordination is the large (2)J(PP) coupling constant in the (31)P {(1)H} NMR spectrum for the trans phosphorus nuclei. If 0.5 equiv of [Fe(H(2)O)(6)][BF(4)](2) were added in the synthesis, the complex trans-[Fe(NCMe)(2)(Ph(2)PC(2)H(4)NH(2))(2)][FeBr(4)] (4c) formed, and this has been characterized by X-ray diffraction. Complexes [Fe{PR(2)CH(2)CH=NCH(2)(2-C(5)H(4)N)}(2)](BPh(4))(2) (5) are bis-tridentate iron(II) complexes with pyridyl donors trans to the phosphine donors. Interestingly, addition of the diamines ethylenediamine, (1R,2R)-(-)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane, (1R,2R)-(-)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine, or o-phenylenediamine, in the template synthesis with 2 led directly to tetradentate P-N-N-P iron(II) complexes trans-[Fe(NCMe)(2)(PCy(2)CH(2)CH=N-Q-N=CHCH(2)PCy(2)](BPh(4))(2) (Q = CH(2)CH(2), 6a; Q = (1R,2R)-cyclo-C(6)H(10), 6b; Q = (1R,2R)-CHPhCHPh, 6c; Q = C(6)H(4), 6d). In contrast, similar reactions under the same conditions with dimer 1 led to complexes mer-[Fe(P-N-N)(2)](2+) as reported previously. Complexes 6a and 6b have been characterized by X-ray diffraction and exhibited large P-Fe-P bond angles of 112.92(2) and 111.96(4) degrees, respectively.
20005098,1,2009,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,One pot synthesis and SAR of some novel 3-substituted 5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazines as antifungal agents.,An improved protocol for the synthesis of a novel series of 1,2,4-triazines possessing 1,2,3-triazole and piperidine ring using 1-(1-substituted piperidin-4-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carbohydrazide, benzil, ammonium acetate and ZrOCl(2).8H(2)O as a catalyst in ethanol-water has been presented. The yields obtained are in the range of 87-94%. All the synthesized compounds (4a-4l) are novel and were evaluated for their in vitro antifungal activity. SAR for the series has been developed by comparing their MIC values with miconazole and fluconazole. Based on activity data SAR for the series has been developed. Compound 4c from the series was equipotent to miconazole against Candida albicans (MIC-25), Aspergillus niger (MIC-12.5) and Cryptococcus neoformans (MIC-25). Compound 4d was equipotent with miconazole against all tested organisms except Cryptococcus neoformans. Also compound 4i was equipotent with miconazole against C. albicans, A. niger and Fusarium oxysporum.
20003347,1,2009,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,Visualization of anomalous origin and course of coronary arteries in 748 consecutive symptomatic patients by 64-slice computed tomography angiography.,BACKGROUND: Coronary artery anomalies (CAAs) are currently undergoing profound changes in understanding potentially pathophysiological mechanisms of disease. Aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of anomalous origin and course of coronary arteries in consecutive symptomatic patients, who underwent cardiac 64-slice multidetector-row computed tomography angiography (MDCTA).METHODS: Imaging datasets of 748 consecutive symptomatic patients referred for cardiac MDCTA were analyzed and CAAs of origin and further vessel course were grouped according to a recently suggested classification scheme by Angelini et al.RESULTS: An overall of 17/748 patients (2.3%) showed CAA of origin and further vessel course. According to aforementioned classification scheme no Subgroup 1- (absent left main trunk) and Subgroup 2- (anomalous location of coronary ostium within aortic root or near proper aortic sinus of Valsalva) CAA were found. Subgroup 3 (anomalous location of coronary ostium outside normal &quot;coronary&quot; aortic sinuses) consisted of one patient with high anterior origin of both coronary arteries. The remaining 16 patients showed a coronary ostium at improper sinus (Subgroup 4). Latter group was subdivided into a right coronary artery arising from left anterior sinus with separate ostium (subgroup 4a; n = 7) and common ostium with left main coronary artery (subgroup 4b; n = 1). Subgroup 4c consisted of one patient with a single coronary artery arising from the right anterior sinus (RAS) without left circumflex coronary artery (LCX). In subgroup 4d, LCX arose from RAS (n = 7).CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of CAA of origin and further vessel course in a symptomatic consecutive patient population was similar to large angiographic series, although these patients do not reflect general population. However, our study supports the use of 64-slice MDCTA for the identification and definition of CAA.
19927310,1,2009,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Fungicide activity of 5-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-(Z)-2-dimethylamino-1,3-thiazol-4-one against Cryptococcus neoformans.,The present work describes the synthesis and antifungal evaluation of new 5-arylidene-(Z)-2-dimethylamino-1,3-thiazol-4-ones 4a-f, obtained by the reaction of aromatic aldehydes 1 and rhodanine 2 followed by treatment with DMF. All compounds were tested against a panel of yeasts, hialohyphomycetes, and dermatophytes using the microbroth dilution method. Compounds 4a and 4c showed antifungal activity, with compound 4a being the most active one. Compound 4a demonstrated to be fungicidal rather than fungistatic and selective activity against Cryptococcus neoformans and dermatophytes. MIC(100), MIC(80), and MIC(50) of 4a were determined against a panel of clinical isolates of C. neoformans showing ranges of MICs between 2 and 16 microg/mL.
19898930,1,2009,J Assist Reprod Genet,The number of blastomeres in post-thawing embryos affects the rates of pregnancy and delivery in freeze-embryo-transfer cycles.,PURPOSE: To observe the differences in pregnancy rates (PRs), delivery rates, and abortion rates associated with frozen-embryo-transfer (FET)-based use of post-thawing embryos with different numbers of blastomeres.METHODS: 959 FET cycles and 361 successful FET cycles performed between January 2007 and December 2007. Compare the PRs and abortion rates in post-thawing embryos with 8 blastomeres (8c), 7c, 6c, 5c, 4c,and 3c.RESULTS: 1. The total PRs of post-thawing 8c, 7c, 6c, 5c, 4c, and 3c embryos were 44.1%, 41.0%, 34.4%, 23.8%, 12.5%, and 0%, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). 2. The abortion rates for the transferred embryos of the 8c, 7c, 6c, 5c, and 4c groups were 17.92%, 19.35%, 27.69%, 24%, 20%, respectively (p &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: The number of blastomeres in the post-thawing embryos is an important factor influencing the occurrence of pregnancy in FET procedures; however, the criterion that post-thawing embryos with 50% intact blastomeres will lead to pregnancy may not be valid.
19894058,1,2009,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,Quality of life after gamma knife radiosurgery treatment in patients with a vestibular schwannoma: the patient's perspective.,This study evaluates the impact of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) on the quality of life (QOL) of patients with a sporadic vestibular schwannoma (VS). This study pertains to 108 VS patients who had GKRS in the years 2003 through 2007. Two different QOL questionnaires were used: medical outcome study short form 36 (SF36) and Glasgow benefit inventory (GBI). Radiosurgery was performed using a Leksell 4C gamma knife. The results of the QOL questionnaires in relation to prospectively and retrospectively gathered data of the VS patients treated by GKRS. Eventually, 97 patients could be included in the study. Their mean tumor size was 17 mm (range 6-39 mm); the mean maximum dose on the tumor was 19.9 Gy (range 16-25.5 Gy) and the mean marginal dose on the tumor was 11.1 (range 9.3-12.5 Gy). SF36 scores showed results comparable to those for a normal Dutch population. GBI showed a marginal decline in QOL. No correlation was found between QOL and gender, age, tumor size, or radiation dose. Increased audiovestibular symptoms after GKRS were correlated with a decreased GBI score, and decreased symptoms were correlated with a higher QOL post-GKRS. In this study shows that GKRS for VS has little impact on the general QOL of the VS patient. However, there is a wide range in individual QOL results. Individual QOL was influenced by the audiovestibular symptoms. No predictive patient, tumor, or treatment factors for QOL outcome after GKRS could be determined. Comparison with microsurgery is difficult because of intra group variability.
19831407,1,2009,Inorg Chem,Synthesis, structures, and properties of 1,2,4,5-benzenetetrathiolate linked group 10 metal complexes.,Dimetallic compounds [(P-P)M(S(2)C(6)H(2)S(2))M(P-P)] (M = Ni, Pd; P-P = chelating bis(phosphine), 3a-3f) are prepared from O=CS(2)C(6)H(2)S(2)C=O or (n)Bu(2)SnS(2)C(6)H(2)S(2)Sn(n)Bu(2), which are protected forms of 1,2,4,5-benzenetetrathiolate. Selective monodeprotections of O=CS(2)C(6)H(2)S(2)C=O or (n)Bu(2)SnS(2)C(6)H(2)S(2)Sn(n)Bu(2) lead to [(P-P)Ni(S(2)C(6)H(2)S(2)C=O)] or [(P-P)Ni(S(2)C(6)H(2)S(2)Sn(n)Bu(2))]; the former is used to prepare trimetallic compounds [(dcpe)Ni(S(2)C(6)H(2)S(2))M(S(2)C(6)H(2)S(2))Ni(dcpe)] (M = Ni (6a) or Pt (6b); dcpe = 1,2-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane). Compounds 3a-3f are redox active and display two oxidation processes, of which the first is generally reversible. Dinickel compound [(dcpe)Ni(S(2)C(6)H(2)S(2))Ni(dcpe)] (3d) reveals two reversible oxidation waves with DeltaE(1/2) = 0.66 V, corresponding to K(c) of 1.6 x 10(11) for the mixed valence species. Electrochemical behavior is unstable to repeated scanning in the presence of [Bu(4)N][PF(6)] electrolyte but indefinitely stable with Na[BArF(24)] (BArF(24) = tetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)borate), suggesting that the radical cation generated by oxidation is vulnerable to reaction with PF(6)(-). Chemical oxidation of 3d with [Cp(2)Fe][BArF(24)] leads to formation of [3d][BArF(24)]. Structural identification of [3d][BArF(24)] reveals appreciable shortening and lengthening of C-S and C-C bond distances, respectively, within the tetrathioarene fragment compared to charge-neutral 3d, indicating this to be the redox active moiety. Attempted oxidation of [(dppb)Ni(S(2)C(6)H(2)S(2))Ni(dppb)] (3c) (dppb = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene) with AgBArF(24) produces [[(dppb)Ni(S(2)C(6)H(2)S(2))Ni(dppb)](2)(mu-Ag(2))][BArF(24)](2), [4c][BArF(24)](2), in which no redox chemistry has occurred. Crystal structures of bis(disulfide)-linked compounds [(P-P)Ni(S(2)C(6)H(2)(mu-S(2))(2)C(6)H(2)S(2))Ni(P-P)] are reported. Near IR spectroscopy upon cationic [3d](+) and neutral 6a reveals multiple intense absorptions in the 950-1400 nm region. Time-dependent density functional theory (DFT) calculations on a 6a model compound indicate that these absorptions are transitions between ligand-based pi-type orbitals that have significant contributions from the sulfur p orbitals.
19780625,1,2009,Inorg Chem,Tetrazole-5-carboxylic acid based salts of earth alkali and transition metal cations.,The tetrazole-5-carboxylate anion was investigated as ligand for earth alkali metal and transition metal complexes. Therefore, the strontium 4a (*3 H(2)O, *2.75 H(2)O, *2.5 H(2)O), barium 4b (*3 H(2)O), copper 4c (*3.5 H(2)O, *4 H(2)O), manganese 4d (*4 H(2)O, *5 H(2)O), and silver tetrazol-5-carboxylate 4e (*1.56 H(2)O) were synthesized and characterized by vibrational spectroscopy (IR), and the crystal structures of 4a (*2.75 H(2)O, *2.5 H(2)O), 4b*3 H(2)O, 4c*4 H(2)O, and 4d*5 H(2)O were determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction. The thermal stability was investigated by DSC-measurements, and the sensitivity toward impact and friction was determined by BAM-standards. The copper, strontium, and barium tetrazole-5-carboxyate proved to be suitable thermal and physical stable colorants for pyrotechnic compositions. The crystal structure of the tetragonal modification of strontium tetrazole-5-carboxyate possesses channels along the c-axis, leading to a porous material.
19707956,1,2009,World J Biol Psychiatry,Are masking abnormalities in schizophrenia specific to type-B masking?,The abnormal visual masking in those with schizophrenia, it has been proposed, arises from a deficiency in their magnocellular system. Two kinds of masking exist: Type-A and Type-B. Type-A masking is characterized by the masking being strongest when target and mask are presented simultaneously. Type-B masking is characterized by a non-monotonic masking curve, i.e. the masking is largest when the mask is presented at some time after the target. The proposed link between masking and magnocellular activity applies mainly to Type-B masking. Thus, a magnocellular deficiency, if it exists, should effect Type-B masking more prominently than Type-A masking. Here we review the relevant literature. The majority of studies of masking in those with schizophrenia, it is found, have examined only Type-A masking. These find substantial evidence for abnormal masking. Where Type-B masking has been obtained, evidence also exists for abnormalities. However, the abnormal masking in these cases is largely unrelated to the defining characteristic of Type-B masking (i.e. to the non-monotonic masking function). It is concluded that the evidence for linking masking abnormalities in schizophrenia specifically to Type-B masking is weak. This undermines the proposal that masking abnormalities in schizophrenia have a magnocellular origin.
19646804,1,2009,Brain Cogn,On using Vernier acuity to assess magnocellular sensitivity.,A recent study [Keri, S., &amp; Benedek, G. (2009). Visual pathway deficit in female fragile x premutation carriers: A potential endophenotype. Brain and Cognition, 69, 291-295] has found Vernier acuity deficiencies together with contrast sensitivity defects consistent with a magnocellular deficit in female fragile x premutation carriers. This may appear to support the notion that Vernier acuity may serve as a test of magnocellular sensitivity. However, Vernier acuity deficiencies have been reported in other conditions (e.g., schizophrenia, amblyopia and cortical visual impairment) where there is little evidence for magnocellular deficits. The observation that Vernier acuity deficiencies can occur without magnocellular deficits indicates that Vernier acuity is not a reliable test of magnocellular sensitivity.
19645519,1,2009,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Simulated gamma knife head frame placement for radiosurgical pre-planning.,The Leksell Gamma Knife (GK) is capable of targeting intracranial lesions with a high degree of accuracy. A headframe is rigidly attached to the patient's skull to establish a stereotactic coordinate system and provide a means for precisely positioning the patient in stereotactic space. After stereotactic target localization and radiosurgical treatment planning the skull and headframe are then moved with sub-millimeter precision to bring a target volume to the radiological focus of the GK unit. However, for GK models 4C and earlier, the treatable intracranial volume may be limited by collisions between the skull/headframe and the GK collimator helmet, or by mechanical travel limits of the skull/headframe within the collimator helmet. Both of these treatment-limiting conditions can be found only after the headframe has been placed on the patient. If the volume of interest cannot be treated with the initial headframe placement, additional headframe placements or a different course of treatment are needed. We have developed a software package that allows for simulated headframe placement and collision checks using pre-treatment day image sets, in order to minimize the need for multiple headframe placements. We performed a small validation experiment with an anthropomorphic head phantom to evaluate the software's capabilities for predicting a clinically useable headframe position. We also used the software in an IRB-approved retrospective review for twenty-five GK image sets for a group of patients that could not be treated with the initial headframe placement, to determine if the software tool could locate an optimized headframe position to enable GK radiosurgery of all identified targets with a single headframe placement. We found that four of the cases could have been completed with a single optimized headframe placement and twenty-four of the cases could not be treated with any single headframe placement.
19607718,1,2009,Virol J,Most common genotypes and risk factors for HCV in Gaza strip: a cross sectional study.,BACKGROUND: The present work aims at determining HCV genotypes in patients with chronic HCV infection, in Gaza strip, Palestine. The most common risk factors for HCV transmission were also evaluated in conjunction with the genotyping data.RESULTS: The study shows that there are only two major genotypes of HCV in Gaza Strip: Genotype 1 (subtypes 1a and 1b) collectively contribute to 28.3% of the cases, and genotype 4 (subtypes 4a and 4c/d) collectively contribute to 64.1% of the cases. Mixed infection with the two genotypes was also present among 7.6% of the cases. In this study a statistically significant relationship was established between the distribution of these genotypes and the patients' living place, traveling history, history of blood transfusion and history of surgical operations.CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to link HCV genotyping in Gaza strip with its possible roots of transmission. Traveling to endemic countries, especially Egypt; blood transfusion and surgical operations are major roots of HCV infection in Gaza strip. The results indicate that iatrogenic and nosocomial procedures may be responsible for the majority of HCV infections in Gaza strip.

19488455,1,2009,Dalton Trans,Triangular tricopper(I) clusters supported by donor-substituted triazacyclohexanes.,Triazacyclohexanes (R(3)TAC,1a-i ) with pyridyl or thioether functionalities (R) in the N-substituents react with three equivalents of CuX (X = Cl (2), Br (3) or I (4)) in MeCN to give the triangular tri-copper clusters [R(3)TAC(CuX)(3)] (R = 2-pyridylmethyl (2a, 3a ), 5-(t)butyl-2-pyridyl (3b). 2-(3-phenylpropylthio)ethyl (3c), 2-(2-ethyl-butylthio)ethyl (3d), 2-(4-heptylthio)ethyl (2e, 3e ), 2-(1-heptylthio)ethyl (3f), 2-(2,4,6-trimethyl-benzylthio)ethyl (3g), 2-(o-methyl-benzylthio)ethyl (3h) and 2-(o-fluoro-benzylthio)ethyl (2i, 3i 4i)). The thioether complexes are stable towards air and water. The bromide bridge in the clusters can be replaced by chloride (2c, e, f, i) or iodide (4c, e, f, i ) by the reaction of a dichloromethane solution of the cluster with aqueous NaI or AgCl, respectively. Crystal structures of 2a, 3a, 3b, 2e, 3h and show triangular halide-bridged Cu(3) clusters capped by the triazacyclohexane and stabilised by the coordination of one pyridyl or thioether arm to each copper atom. DFT calculations confirm the NMR assignments and reveal the electronic structure of the copper triangle.
19472627,1,2009,Med Phys,Unintended attenuation in the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion calibration-phantom adaptor and its effect on dose calibration.,The calibration of Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion (LGK PFX) is performed using a spherical polystyrene phantom 160 mm in diameter, which is provided by the manufacturer. This is the same phantom that has been used with LGK models U, B, C, and 4C. The polystyrene phantom is held in irradiation position by an aluminum adaptor, which has stainless steel side-fixation screws. The phantom adaptor partially attenuates the beams from sectors 3 and 7 by 3.2% and 4.6%, respectively. This unintended attenuation introduces a systematic error in dose calibration. The overall effect of phantom-adaptor attenuation on output calibration of the LGK PFX unit is to underestimate output by about 1.0%.
19449232,1,2009,Acta Radiol,Ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy of microcalcifications detected at screening mammography.,BACKGROUND: Microcalcifications detected at screening mammography are frequently diagnosed by means of a stereotactic biopsy. Ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous breast biopsy has several advantages over stereotactic biopsy, e.g., it offers real-time needle visualization, improves patient comfort, the procedure time is generally considered to be shorter, and it usually does not require ionizing radiation or dedicated equipment.PURPOSE: To assess the frequency of calcification retrieval and factors affecting retrieval success for US-guided 11-G vacuum-assisted biopsies of microcalcifications.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-five consecutive women (age range: 25-68 years, mean age: 47 years) with 75 lesions of microcalcifications detected at screening mammography underwent US-guided 11-G vacuum-assisted biopsy. Calcification retrieval was defined as being successful when calcifications were detected in radiographs of specimens. Mammographic, ultrasonographic, and histologic findings were analyzed to identify factors that affected calcification retrieval.RESULTS: Among 75 lesions that had US-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy, calcifications were retrieved in 53 (71%) lesions. Calcification retrieval was more frequent for lesions; associated with masses or dilated ducts at US (85% [41/48] vs. 44% [12/27], P&lt;0.001), located in the anterior or middle part of the breast vs. posterior part of the breast (81% [47/58] vs. 35% [6/17], P=0.001), of maximal diameter more than 10 mm (82% [41/50] vs. 48% [12/25], P=0.002), with a segmental or regional distribution vs. clustered distribution (95% [18/19] vs. 63% [35/56], P=0.008), or lesions of category 4c or 5 vs. category 4a or 4b (100% [8/8] vs. 67% [45/67], P=0.054) at mammography.CONCLUSION: US-guided 11-G vacuum-assisted biopsy retrieved calcifications from 71% (53/75) of lesions. Successful calcification retrieval was found to be related to the visibility of associated masses or dilated ducts by US, and to lesion depth, size, and distribution, and level of suspicion at mammography.
19441814,1,2009,J Am Chem Soc,Comparative analysis of the multicenter, long bond in [TCNE]*- and phenalenyl radical dimers: a unified description of multicenter, long bonds.,The nature of the multicenter, long bond in neutral phenalenyl dimers is analyzed in detail and compared to the multicenter, long bond in [TCNE](2)(2-). These dimers are prototypes of multicenter, long bond in dimers of neutral and anion radicals. This was done by examining the number of electrons (m) and atomic centers (c) involved in the long bond for these dimers, as well as identifying the dominant attractive components of their interaction energy (SOMO-SOMO bonding, dispersion, and the sum of the exchange-repulsion and electrostatic components) in accord with Pauling's focus on total bond energies. The long bond in [TCNE](2)(2-) is a 2e(-)/4c bond, the electrostatic component is repulsive, and the dominant attractive component is the dispersion component (-27.7 kcal/mol), about two times larger than the bonding component. In phenalenyl dimers the dispersion component (-31.7 kcal/mol) is about 2.5 times stronger (than the SOMO-SOMO bonding component; hence, the multicenter, long bond in these dimers is closer to a van der Waals bond than to a covalent bond. Consequently, it possesses a two-electrons/fourteen center 2e(-)/14c bond, rather than the 2e(-)/12c bond suggested by the SOMO-SOMO bonding component. The covalent-like properties in phenalenyl dimers result from the dominant dispersion component that enable the fragments to approach each other so that their SOMOs overlap and produce a qualitative MO diagram identical to that found in conventional covalent bonds.
19419876,1,2009,Bioorg Med Chem,A library of novel allosteric inhibitors against fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase.,The identification of a proper lead compound for fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a critical step in the process of developing novel therapeutics against type-2 diabetes. Herein, we have successfully generated a library of allosteric inhibitors against FBPase as potential anti-diabetic drugs, of which, the lead compound 1b was identified through utilizing a virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) system, which we have developed. The thiazole-based core structure was synthesized via the condensation of alpha-bromo-ketones with thioureas and substituents on the two aryl rings were varied. 4c was found to inhibit pig kidney FBPase approximately fivefold better than 1b. In addition, we have also identified 10b, a tight binding fragment, which can be use for fragment-based drug design purposes.
19406654,1,2009,Appl Radiat Isot,Development of boron nanocapsules for neutron capture therapy.,High accumulation and selective delivery of boron into tumor tissues are the most important requirements to achieve efficient neutron capture therapy of cancers. We focused on liposomal boron delivery system in order to achieve a large amount of boron delivery to tumor. We synthesized the double-tailed boron cluster lipid 4c according to our reported procedure with modification. Size distribution of liposomes prepared from the boron cluster lipid 4c, DMPC, PEG-DSPE, and cholesterol was determined as 100 nm in diameter by an electrophoretic light scattering spectrophotometer. A high level of (10)B concentration (22 ppm) was observed in tumor tissue at 24 h after the administration of boron liposomes.
19362835,1,2009,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and biological activities of a pH-dependently activated water-soluble prodrug of a novel hexacyclic camptothecin analog.,CH0793076 (1) is a novel hexacyclic camptothecin analog showing potent antitumor activity in various human caner xenograft models. To improve the water solubility of 1, water-soluble prodrugs were designed to generate an active drug 1 nonenzymatically, thus expected to show less interpatient PK variability than CPT-11. Among the prodrugs synthesized, 4c (TP300, hydrochloride) having a glycylsarcosyl ester at the C-20 position of 1 is highly water-soluble (&gt;10mg/ml), stable below pH 4 and rapidly generates 1 at physiological pH in vitro. The rapid (ca. &lt;1min) generation of 1 after incubation of TP300 with plasma (mouse, rat, dog and monkey) was also demonstrated. TP300 showed a broader antitumor spectrum and more potent antitumor activity than CPT-11 in various human cancer xenograft models.
19304560,1,2009,Acta Pharm,Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of 3-cyclohexyl-2-substituted hydrazino-3H-quinazolin-4-ones as analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents.,A series of novel 3-cyclohexyl-2-substituted hydrazino-quinazolin-4(3H)-ones were synthesized by reacting the amino group of 3-cyclohexyl-2-hydrazino quinazolin-4(3H)-one with a variety of aldehydes and ketones. The starting material, 3-cyclohexyl-2-hydrazino quinazolin-4(3H)-one, was synthesized from cyclohexyl amine. Title compounds were investigated for analgesic, anti-inflammatory and ulcerogenic behavior. The compound 3-cyclohexyl-2-(1-methylbutylidene-hydrazino)-3H-quinazolin-4-one (4c) emerged as the most active compound of the series and is moderately more potent in its analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities compared to the reference standard diclofenac sodium. Interestingly, test compounds showed only mild ulcerogenic potential when compared to acetylsalicylic acid.
19257347,1,2009,Phys Rev Lett,Non-Gaussian fluctuations near the QCD critical point.,We study the effect of the QCD critical point on non-Gaussian moments (cumulants) of fluctuations of experimental observables in heavy-ion collisions. We find that these moments are very sensitive to the proximity of the critical point, as measured by the magnitude of the correlation length xi. For example, the cubic central moment of multiplicity (deltaN)3 approximately xi4.5 and the quartic cumulant (deltaN)4c approximately xi7. We estimate the magnitude of critical point contributions to non-Gaussian fluctuations of pion and proton multiplicities.
19242717,1,2009,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Optic nerve head topography in nonglaucomatous, normotensive patients with unilateral exfoliation syndrome.,BACKGROUND: Optic nerve head damage may result from high intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with the exfoliation syndrome (EXS). At equal IOP levels, eyes with EXS may suffer damage more easily than eyes without EXS. Opinion differs as to whether EXS alone, without the contributory effect of a raised IOP, is a risk factor for optic nerve head damage.METHODS: 36 nonglaucomatous, normotensive patients (mean age 68.4 +/- 7.1 years) with unilateral EXS were examined for optic disc topography with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph). The only patients included were those with an IOP difference of &lt; or =3 mmHg between fellow eyes and with IOP fluctuation &lt; or =5 mmHg in diurnal curves.RESULTS: Mean IOP was higher in the EXS than in the fellow non-EXS eyes (15.0 +/- 2.8 vs 14.1 +/- 2.7 mmHg, P &lt; 0.001). According to the multivariate analysis of variance, no differences existed in the global parameters between EXS and non-EXS eyes (P = 0.778). Nor did differences appear in sectoral parameters between fellow eyes in the temporal (P = 0.634), temporal superior (P = 0.236), temporal inferior (P = 0.330), nasal (P = 0.711), nasal superior (P = 0.307), and nasal inferior (P = 0.434) sectors.CONCLUSION: EXS may not in itself be a risk factor for optic disc damage when IOP is not elevated from its base level, and when its variation is normal.
19226932,1,2009,Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr,Occurrence and distribution of Listeria monocytogenes and other Listeria species in ready-to-eat and raw meat products.,The present study was undertaken to estimate the occurrence and distribution of Listeria monocytogenes and other Listeria species in ready-to-eat food items (pasteurized milk, cheese, ice cream, and cakes) and raw meat products (minced beef, pork, and chicken carcasses). A total of 711 randomly selected samples were collected from supermarkets and pastry shops in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Listeria monocytogenes and other Listeria species were isolated and identified according to the techniques recommended by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 11290-1). Serotyping of L. monocytogenes strains was carried out at the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA), Ploufragan, France. Of the 711 food samples examined, 189 (26.6%) were Listeria positive of which 34 (4.8%) were L. monocytogenes. Pork was the most contaminated with Listeria species (62.5%) followed by minced beef (47.7%), ice cream (42.7%), soft cheese (16.8%), chicken carcasses (16.0%), and cakes (12.1%). All pasteurized milk and cottage cheese samples examined were Listeria negative. Listeria monocytogenes strains were isolated in ready-to-eat food items consisting of ice cream (11.7%), cakes (6.5%), and soft cheese (3.9%) and in meat products ranging from 3.7% to 5.1%. Among the 34 isolates of L. monocytogenes serotyped, serotypes 4b/4e (n = 32), 4c, and 4e (n = 2) were identified. The presence of L. monocytogenes in some ready-to-eat food items could pose public health hazards to the consumer, particularly to the high-risk group of the population.
19144027,1,2009,Reprod Domest Anim,Nuclear replacement of in vitro-matured porcine oocytes by a serial centrifugation and fusion method.,The objective of the present study was to establish a method for nuclear replacement in metaphase-II (M-II) stage porcine oocytes. Karyoplasts containing M-II chromosomes (K) and cytoplasts without chromosomes (C) were produced from in vitro-matured oocytes by a serial centrifugation method. The oocytes were then reconstructed by fusion of one karyoplast with 1, 2, 3 or 4 cytoplasts (K + 1C, K + 2C, K + 3C and K + 4C, respectively). Reconstructed oocytes, karyoplasts without fusion of any cytoplast (K) and zona-free M-II oocytes (control) were used for experiments. The rates of female pronucleus formation after parthenogenetic activation in all groups of reconstructed oocytes (58.2-77.4%) were not different from those of the K and control groups (58.2% and 66.0%, respectively). In vitro fertilization was carried out to assay the fertilization ability and subsequent embryonic development of the reconstructed oocytes. The cytoplast : karyoplast ratio did not affect the fertilization status (penetration and male pronuclear formation rates) of the oocytes. A significantly high monospermy rate was found in K oocytes (p &lt; 0.05, 61.6%) compared with the other groups (18.2-32.8%). Blastocyst formation rates increased significantly as the number of the cytoplasts fused with karyoplasts increased (p &lt; 0.05, 0.0-15.3%). The blastocyst rate in the K + 4C group (15.3%) was comparable with that of the control (17.8%). Total cell numbers in both the K + 3C and K + 4C groups (16.0 and 15.3 cells, respectively) were comparable with that of the control (26.2 cells). Our results demonstrate that a serial centrifugation and fusion (Centri-Fusion) is an effective method for producing M-II chromosome transferred oocytes with normal fertilization ability and in vitro development. It is suggested that the number of cytoplasts fused with a karyoplast plays a critical role in embryonic development.
19123883,1,2009,J Neurosurg,Effect of composite sector collimation on average dose fall-off for Gamma Knife Perfexion.,OBJECT: The new capability of composite sector collimation in Gamma Knife Perfexion produces complex, nonspherical, and nonelliptical dose distributions. In this study, the authors investigated the effect of composite sector collimation on average dose fall-off compared with the previous Gamma Knife model.METHODS: A general formalism was derived to describe the peripheral dose distribution of all Gamma Knife models in the form of (V/V(0)) = (D/D(0))(gamma), where V is the volume of the peripheral isodose line with the value of D, V(0) is the reference prescription isodose volume, D(0) is the prescription dose, and gamma is the fitting parameter that determines how fast the dose falls off near the target. Based on this formula, the authors compared 40 cases involving patients treated with Gamma Knife Perfexion with 40 similar cases involving patients treated with Gamma Knife model 4C. The cases were grouped based on the use of the sector collimators in the treatment planning process. For each group as well as all cases combined, the mean gamma values were compared by means of the Student t-test for varying ranges of the peripheral dose distribution-from 100% of the prescription dose to 75, 50, and 25% of the prescription dose.RESULTS: The fit of general formula to the data was excellent for both Gamma Knife Perfexion and Gamma Knife 4C with R(2)&gt; 0.99 for all the cases. The overall gamma values (mean +/- 2 standard deviations) were as follows: gamma = -1.74 +/- 0.47 (Model 4C) versus -1.77 +/- 0.40 (Perfexion) within 100-75% of the prescription dose; gamma = -1.57 +/- 0.26 (Model 4C) versus -1.58 +/- 0.25 (Perfexion) within 100-50% of the prescription dose; gamma = -1.47 +/- 0.18 (Model 4C) versus -1.50 +/- 0.16 (Perfexion) within 100-25% of the prescription dose. No statistical significance between the mean differences for Gamma Knife Perfexion and Model 4C was found within these ranges. The probability values were 0.65, 0.84, and 0.22, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The use of composite sector collimators in Gamma Knife Perfexion demonstrated no statistically significant effects on the volume-averaged dose fall-off near a target periphery for typical treatment cases.
19128974,1,2009,Bioorg Med Chem,Discovery of N-[(1R,2S,5S)-2-{[(5-chloroindol-2-yl)carbonyl]amino}-5-(dimethylcarbamoyl)cyclohexyl]-5-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridine-2-carboxamide hydrochloride: a novel, potent and orally active direct inhibitor of factor Xa.,In the early 1990's, we reported on the low-molecular selective fXa inhibitor DX-9065a having two amidino groups. However, it had poor oral bioavailability due to its strong basic amidino groups. To obtain fXa inhibitors with improved oral bioavailability, we investigated various non-amidino fXa inhibitors and finally discovered cis-1,2-diaminocyclohexane derivative 4c to have potent fXa inhibition, promising anticoagulant activity, and good oral bioavailability, compared with amidino compound DX-9065a. In addition, we will discuss the influence of the third substituent on the cyclohexane ring on anti-fXa activity, anticoagulant activity, PK profile, and lipophilicity.

20022411,0,2009,Eur J Med Chem,New pyrazoles incorporating pyrazolylpyrazole moiety: synthesis, anti-HCV and antitumor activity.,Three series of novel pyrazole derivatives 2b-d, 4a-d and 6a-d were synthesized via two step procedure that utilizes hydrazonoyl chlorides 1a-d and enaminones 3a-d and 5a-d, respectively as starting materials. The structures of all the newly synthesized products have been established on the basis of analytical and spectral data. Moreover, some of the products 2-6 were tested against HCV and Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE). In addition, compounds 2-6 were also tested for the inhibition of peroxynitrite-induced tyrosine nitration and antioxidant activity. The tested compounds are highly effective at very low concentration as anti-HCV, SSPE antioxidant and anticancer in the following ascending order 2d, 4c, 6b, 3b, 6c, 4d, 2b, 2c, 2a, 6a, 5b, 5a, 3a, 4b and 5c. It is worth to mention that all tested compounds are more potent than the reference standards used for comparing activity. All the measurements revealed that the mechanism of action of the anti cancer activities of all the tested compounds is topoisomerase I inhibitor.
19950669,0,2009,Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,[Fluorescence analysis of trace glucose using glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase].,In acetate buffer solution and in the presence of glucose oxidase (GOD), glucose reduced the dissolved oxygen to form H2O2 that oxidized catalytically the excess KI to from I3- by horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The I3- combines respectively with rhodamine S (RhS), rhodamine 6G(Rh6G), butyl-rhodamine B(b-RhB) and rhodamine B(RhB) to form RhS-I3, Rh6G-I3, b-RhB-I3 and RhB-I3 associated particles that result in fluorescence quenching at 556, 556, 584 and 584 nm, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, the concentration of glucose in the range of 0.083-9.99, 0.17-8.33, 0.33-8.33 and 0.33-9.99 micromol x L(-1) is linear with their fluorescence quenching at 556, 556, 584 and 584 nm, with detection limits of 0.059, 0.17, 0.21 and 0.16 micromol x L(-1) glucose. And the regression equation was deltaF = 40.0c + 3.0, deltaF = 23.9c + 8.1, deltaF = 25.6c + 4.2, and deltaAF = 18.4c + 0.8, respectively. The RhS system was the most sensitive and stable, and was chosen for use. Influence of some foreign substances on the RhS fluorescence quenching determination of 6.67 micromol x L(-1) glucose was examined, with a relative error of +/- 10%. Results showed that 1000-fold Mg2+ and Cu2+, 300-fold Mn2+, 100-fold Zn2+, Al3+ and Co2+, 60-fold L-tyrosine, urea and nicotinic acid, 50-fold Fe3+, HSA and BSA, 10-fold sucrose, vitamin B2, L-lysine, L-glutamic acid and L-cystine did not interfere with the determination. This RhS fluorescence quenching assay was applied to the determination of glucose in the serum samples with satisfactory results.

19927308,0,2009,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis and antiproliferative activity of novel diaryl ureas possessing a 4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one group.,We herein disclose a series of novel diaryl urea derivatives possessing a 4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one group as novel potent anticancer compounds. The structures were confirmed by IR,(1)H-NMR, and MS. All the compounds were screened for their antiproliferative activity against the human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). The pharmacological results indicated that most of the compounds showed moderate activity. The best of this series is compound 4c (IC(50)= 0.7 micromol/L), with a potency 3.6-fold higher than Sorafenib (IC(50) = 2.5 micromol/L), which was approved in 2005.
19923694,0,2009,Acta Crystallogr B,Magnetic behaviour of synthetic Co(2)SiO(4).,Synthetic Co(2)SiO(4) crystallizes in the olivine structure (space group Pnma) with two crystallographically non-equivalent Co positions and shows antiferromagnetic ordering below 50 K. We have investigated the temperature variation of the Co(2)SiO(4) magnetic structure by means of non-polarized and polarized neutron diffraction for single crystals. Measurements with non-polarized neutrons were made at 2.5 K (below T(N)), whereas polarized neutron diffraction experiments were carried out at 70 and 150 K (above T(N)) in an external magnetic field of 7 T parallel to the b axis. Additional accurate non-polarized powder diffraction studies were performed in a broad temperature range from 5 to 500 K with small temperature increments. Detailed symmetry analysis of the Co(2)SiO(4) magnetic structure shows that it corresponds to the magnetic (Shubnikov) group Pnma, which allows the antiferromagnetic configuration (G(x), C(y), A(z)) for the 4a site with inversion symmetry 1 (Co1 position) and (0,C(y),0) for the 4c site with mirror symmetry m (Co2 position). The temperature dependence of the Co1 and Co2 magnetic moments obtained from neutron diffraction experiments was fitted in a modified molecular-field model. The polarized neutron study of the magnetization induced by an applied field shows a non-negligible amount of magnetic moment on the oxygen positions, indicating a delocalization of the magnetic moment from Co towards neighbouring O owing to superexchange coupling. The relative strength of the exchange interactions is discussed based on the non-polarized and polarized neutron data.
19912067,0,2009,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Synthesis of 8-substituted-4-(2/4-substituted phenyl)-2H-[1,3,5]triazino[2,1-b][1,3]benzothiazole-2-thiones and their anticonvulsant, anti-nociceptive, and toxicity evaluation in mice.,A number of new 8-substituted-4-(2/4-substituted phenyl)-2H-[1,3,5]triazino[2,1-b][1,3]benzothiazole-2-thiones (4a-t) were synthesized and evaluated for their anticonvulsant, anti-nociceptive, hepatotoxic, and neurotoxic properties. The titled compounds (4a-t) were obtained by cyclization of N-{[6-substituted-1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)amino]carbonothioyl}-2/4-substituted benzamides (3a-t) by refluxing in n-butanol. All the newly synthesized compounds were screened for their anticonvulsant activity in a mouse seizure model and were compared with the standard drug phenytoin. Compounds 4a, 4c, 4f, and 4l showed complete protection after time periods of 0.5 h and 4 h. Some of the selected compounds were evaluated for their neurotoxic and hepatotoxic effects, and none of these showed any sign of neurotoxicity or hepatotoxicity. Compounds 4a-t were also evaluated for their anti-nociceptive activity by a thermal stimulus technique using diclofenac as standard. Compounds 4o, 4q, and 4t displayed highly potent analgesic activity with p &lt; 0.01.
19893222,0,2009,Acta Crystallogr C,A benzene-rich pseudopolymorph of bis[mu-1,3-bis(pentafluorophenyl)propane-1,3-dionato]-kappa(3)O,O':O';kappa(3)O:O,O'-bis{aqua[1,3-bis(pentafluorophenyl)propane-1,3-dionato-kappa(2)O,O']nickel(II)} benzene tetrasolvate.,The title complex comprises two Ni(2+) ions, four fluorinated ligands and two water molecules in a centrosymmetric dinuclear complex. This compound was crystallized from benzene-CH(2)Cl(2), and two types of crystals, viz. the title benzene tetrasolvate, [Ni(2)(C(15)HF(10)O(2))(4)(H(2)O)(2)].4C(6)H(6), (I), and the previously reported benzene disolvate, [Ni(2)(C(15)HF(10)O(2))(4)(H(2)O)(2)].2C(6)H(6), (II) [Hori et al. (2009). Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn, 82, 96-98], were obtained as pseudopolymorphs. In the crystal structure of (I), the four benzene solvent molecules interact closely with all the pentafluorophenyl groups of the complex through arene-perfluoroarene interactions. The molecular structures of the two compounds show essentially the same conformation, although the benzene molecules are accommodated in a columnar packing in (I), while they are isolated from each other in (II).
21784037,0,2009,Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,The influence of CYP2A6 polymorphisms and cadmium on nicotine metabolism in Thai population.,We investigated the influence of genetic, cadmium exposure and smoking status, on cytochrome P450-mediated nicotine metabolism (CYP2A6) in 182 Thai subjects after receiving 2mg of nicotine gum chewing for 30min. The urinary excretion of cotinine was normally distributed over a 2h period (logarithmically transformed). Individuals with urinary cotinine levels in the ranges of 0.01-0.21, and 0.52-94.99μg/2h were categorized as poor metabolizes (PMs: 6.5%), and extensive metabolizers (EMs: 93.5%), respectively. The majority of EMs (45%) carried homozygous wild-type genotypes (CYP2A6*1A/*1A, CYP2A6*1A/*1B and CYP2A6*1B/*1B), whereas only 1% of PMs carried these genotypes. Markedly higher frequencies of EMs were also observed in all heterozygous defective genotypes including the null genotype (*4C/*4C; 1 subject). A weak but significant positive correlation was observed between total amounts of urinary cadmium excretion and total cotinine excretion over 2h. Our study shows generally good agreement between CYP2A6 genotypes and phenotypes. Smokers accumulated about 3-4-fold higher mean total amounts of 2-h urinary cadmium excretion (127.5±218.2ng/2h) than that of non-smokers (40.5±78.4ng/2h). Among the smokers (n=16), homologous wild-type genotype *1/*1 was significantly the predominant genotype (6/16) compared with other defective allele including *4C/*4C. In addition, 2h urinary excretion of cotinine in smokers of all genotypes was significantly higher than non-smokers. The proportion of smokers who smoked more than 5 cigarettes/day was significantly higher in EMs in all CYP2A6 genotypes (n=14) than in PMs (n=0).
19842131,0,2009,Chem Biodivers,Antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of a new class of pyrazole derivatives in HL-60 cells.,A series of N-substituted pyrazole derivatives have been synthesized and tested for their anticancer effect on the HL-60 leukaemia cell line. Four were active both in cell-growth inhibition and in inducing apoptosis. The inhibition of cell growth mainly reflects a compound-induced reduction in the number of cells in phases from S to M, whereas the induction of apoptosis involves inhibition of expression of Bcl-2 and enhanced expression of Bax with consequent reduced activation of the proapoptotic caspase 3. Finally, preliminary experiments carried out with tumor cells from myelogenous leukaemic patients showed that the compounds 4c, 4l, 4m, and 4n are indeed capable of inducing apoptosis.
19805863,0,2009,Acta Crystallogr C,EuI2, a low-temperature europium(II) iodide phase.,Light-yellow europium(II) diiodide, prepared by the low-temperature reaction of europium and ammonium iodide in liquid ammonia at 200 K and characterized by high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction, represents a new phase for EuI2 that adopts an orthorhombic Pnma structure with all three atoms lying on 4c positions (.m.). It is isotypic with SrI2(IV). Temperature-dependent X-ray measurements performed to investigate the thermal stability of the new phase show that it decomposes irreversibly to amorphous material around 673 K. Total-energy density-functional calculations using the generalized gradient approximation suggest this to be the ground-state structure of EuI2.
19718831,0,2009,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,[Ultrastructural change of lactobacilli during suppression of their growth by clinical strains of Candida albicans].,AIM: Detection of morphophysiological changes in cells of manufacturing strains of lactobacilli suppressed by antagonistically active clinical cultures of Candida albicans, isolated from women with torpid course of vaginosis and vaginitis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three clinical strains of C. albicans suppressing growth of bacterial cells from manufacturing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum 8-PA-3, L. fermentum 90-4C and L. acidophilus D75 on modified agar-added nutrient medium were used. Using electron microscopy, ultrastructural changes in lactobacilli suppressed by C. albicans were studied.RESULTS: In places of tight contacts of interacting microorganisms, destructive changes in cell walls of lactobacilli appeared as desquamation of small layerwise fragments of peptidoglycan layers were observed. Rearrangement of ultrafine structure of lactobacilli's cytoplasm which expressed as destruction of protein-ribosomal complex was also noted. Local defects of cellular components led to total destruction of cytoplasmic contents and appearance of &quot;cellular shadows&quot;.CONCLUSION: Surmounting by C. albicans the antagonistic action of lactobacilli with destruction of peptidoglycan layer of their cell walls could explain persistence of yeast fungi during chronic forms of vaginosis in women.
19709783,0,2009,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis of sigma receptor ligands with unsymmetrical spiro connection of the piperidine moiety.,The symmetrically connected spiro[[2]benzopyran-1,4'-piperidines] 1 are highly potent and selective sigma(1) receptor ligands. Changing the position of the spirocyclic nitrogen atom led to the unsymmetrically connected spiro[[2]benzopyran-1,3'-piperidines] 2 with a reduced distance between the aromatic system and the basic nitrogen atom. The synthesis of 2 was performed by halogen-metal exchange at the aryl bromide 3 followed by addition to the piperidone 5 and intramolecular transacetalization. The yield of 2a was considerably improved by transmetallation of the aryllithium intermediate 4a with CeCl(3) (4c). The cis and trans diastereomers cis-2 and trans-2 were separated and characterized by nuclear Overhauser effect. After removal of the benzyl group, the secondary amine 2b was alkylated with various alkyl and arylalkyl halides. The sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptor affinity of the spirocyclic piperidines 2 were determined with receptor binding studies. Compared with the spirocyclic piperidines 1, the unsymmetrically connected piperidines 2 show remarkably reduced sigma(1) receptor affinities, whereas the selectivity over sigma(2) and NMDA receptors was retained. A stereoselective interaction of the sigma(1) receptor protein with the cis- or trans-configured spirocyclic compounds 2 was not observed. It was shown that alkyl residues at the N-atom can replace the lipophilic N-arylalkyl groups and interact with the primary hydrophobic binding site of the sigma(1) receptor protein.
19695354,0,2009,Am J Cardiol,Oral antiplatelet therapy in unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention: is it time for a guideline update?,Oral antiplatelet drugs are central in the management of acute coronary syndromes, including unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the mechanisms that confer the benefits of these agents also increase bleeding risk. Thus, the selection of appropriate pharmacotherapy requires close attention to the delicate balance between reducing the risk of ischemic events and minimizing bleeding risk. A critical review of the 2007 guidelines in these areas and new clinical data with currently available and soon-to-be-approved antiplatelet agents are presented.
19679605,0,2009,Eur Respir J,Acute inflammatory response secondary to intrapleural administration of two types of talc.,Intrapleural instillation of talc has been used in the treatment of recurrent pleural effusions but can, in rare instances, result in respiratory failure. Side-effects seem to be related to composition, size and inflammatory power of talc particles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory response to intrapleural injection of talc containing small particles (ST) or talc containing particles of mixed size (MT). 100 rabbits received intrapleural talc, 50 with ST (median 6.41 mum) and 50 with MT (median 21.15 mum); the control group was composed of 35 rabbits. Cells, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor were evaluated in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage at 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Lung histology and the presence of talc were also analysed. Statistics were performed using ANOVA and an unpaired t-test. Most of the parameters showed greater levels in the animals injected with talc than in the controls, suggesting a systemic and pulmonary response. Higher serum levels of CRP and IL-8 were observed in the animals injected with ST. Talc particles were observed in both lungs with no differences between groups. Lung cell infiltrate was more evident in the ST group. In conclusion, talc with larger particles should be the preferred choice in clinical practice in order to induce safer pleurodesis.
19625260,0,2009,Angiology,The functional promoter polymorphism of the coagulation factor XII gene is not associated with peripheral arterial disease.,Coagulation factor XII (FXII) plays a key role in both coagulation and fibrinolysis and has been associated with cardiovascular disease in some studies. Plasma FXIIa levels are strongly determined by a common functional polymorphism in the promoter of the FXII gene (F12-4C&gt;T). To investigate the potential association of this polymorphism with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), we performed a case-control study including 668 patients with PAD and 762 controls participants without cardiovascular disease. F12 genotype frequencies were not significantly different between patients with PAD and control participants. After adjustment for classical risk factors, the odds ratio of carriers of a F12 -4T allele for PAD was 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.86-1.32). F12 genotypes were associated with a modest increase of the mean-activated partial thromboplastin time but not with PAD stage or severity. We conclude that the functional F124C&gt;T polymorphism is not associated with PAD.
19610589,0,2009,Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai Kaiho,[Cartilage palisade tympanoplasty for adhesive otitis media].,PURPOSE: We evaluated the clinical utility of cartilage palisade tympanoplasty (CRPT) in adhesive otitis media, a condition known to recur frequently with poor success in hearing gain.OBJECTIVE: Specimens were 9 ears having adhesive otitis media and undergoing CPT in January 2006 and December 2007. Cases of pars tensa cholesteatoma were excluded. Mean subject age was 35.2 years. Seven had total drum adhesion and 2 posterior half-adhesion. Preoperative pure-tone hearing averaged 20-102 dB (mean: 56 dB).METHODS: A small piece of cartilage harvested from the cymba was obliquely sectioned to yield wide, thin cartilage strips. Strips were overlapped slightly anteriorly to posteriorly parallel to the malleus handle when present. Tympanoplasty type 1 was conducted in 2 cases, type 3c in 6, and type 4c in 1.RESULTS: No ears undergoing CPT produced recurrent adhesion or perforation although 2 suffered transient partial erosion healed easily in topical management. An air-bone gap of &lt;15 dB was achieved in 3 ears, a hearing gain exceeding 15 dB in 5, and a hearing level of less than 30 dB in 3. Conditions falling in at least 1 of the above categories are considered successful based on Japan Otological Society criteria. Seven of the 9 (78%) were regarded as audiologically successful.CONCLUSION: CPT conducted for adhesive otitis media appears worthwhile, given the present better-than-expected results in our cases, although further study is needed to confirm this conclusion.
19601685,0,2009,J Am Chem Soc,Homoconjugation/homoaromaticity in main group inorganic molecules.,Quantum chemical computations show that three groups of inorganic ions and neutral molecules, whose structures have long been known and characterized, are aromatic due to through-space homoconjugation: (i) I(4)(2+), S(6)N(4)(2+), and S(2)I(4)(2+) dications and the (O(2))(4) cluster with pericyclic transition-state-like (PTS-like) homoaromaticity; (ii) the bishomoaromatic Te(6)(2+) and 1,5-diphosphadithiatetrazocines; and (iii) the spherically homoaromatic Te(6)(4+). The S(2)I(4)(2+) dication has an unusually high S-S bond order (approximately 2.3) and dual PTS-like aromaticity arising from two separate sets of four-center, six-electron (4c-6e) in-plane through-space conjugation. The diamagnetic (O(2))(4) structural unit recently observed in epsilon-phase oxygen solid has quadruple PTS-like aromaticity, each arising from 4c-6e in-plane through-space conjugation within an O(2)-O(2) plane. Finally, we note that the lighter S(6)(4+) and Se(6)(4+) homologues of Te(6)(4+) also are spherically homoaromatic and might be observable in complexes.
19565603,0,2009,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Benzothiazole incorporated barbituric acid derivatives: synthesis and anticonvulsant screening.,A series of 1-(6-substituted-1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)-3-(substituted phenyl)hexahydro-2,4,6-pyrimidinetriones 4a-t were synthesized starting from substituted anilines. These compounds contained two active anticonvulsant pharmacophores, benzothiazole and barbituric acid. Structures of the compounds were confirmed on the basis of different spectroscopic techniques. All the compounds were evaluated for their anticonvulsant activity. Three compounds 4c, 4d, and 4s showed promising anticonvulsant activities in Maximal Electroshock Seizure test (MES) and subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole test (scPTZ). They also displayed a wide safety profile when tested for the minimal motor impairment test.
19547870,0,2009,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,Echovirus 30 associated with cases of aseptic meningitis in state of Pará, Northern Brazil.,Investigation of the aetiology of viral meningitis in Brazil is most often restricted to cases that occur in the Southern and Southeastern Regions; therefore, the purpose of this study is to describe the viral meningitis cases that occurred in state of Pará, Northern Brazil, from January 2005-December 2006. The detection of enterovirus (EV) in cerebrospinal fluid was performed using cell culture techniques, RT-PCR, nested PCR and nucleotide sequencing. The ages of the 91 patients ranged from &lt; one year old to &gt; 60 years old (median age 15.90 years). Fever (87.1%), headache (77.0%), vomiting (61.5%) and stiffness (61.5%) were the most frequent symptoms. Of 91 samples analyzed, 18 (19.8%) were positive for EV. Twelve were detected only by RT- PCR followed by nested PCR, whereas six were found by both cell culture and RT-PCR. From the last group, five were sequenced and classified as echovirus 30 (Echo 30). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Echo 30 detected in Northern Brazil clustered within a unique group with a bootstrap value of 100% and could constitute a new subgroup (4c) according to the phylogenetic tree described by Oberste et al. (1999). This study described the first molecular characterization of Echo 30 in Brazil and this will certainly contribute to future molecular analyses involving strains detected in other regions of Brazil.

19495961,0,2009,Ecotoxicology,Toxicity of the Yangtze River source of drinking water on reproductive system of male mice (Mus musculus).,The toxicological tests of the Yangtze River source of drinking water on the reproductive system of male mice (Mus musculus) were conducted in order to protect human and environmental health. The mice were fed with the source water for 90-day and their body weights and relative organ weights were not significantly altered. The results of flow cytometry analysis showed that the relative percentage of the primary spermatocytes (4C) increased significantly, however, significant depletion was observed in the relative percentage of elongated spermatid (HC). These alterations in different germ cell populations were reflected in the various germ cell ratios. The ratio of 1C:4C showed declines while the ratio of 4C:2C increased and the percentage of abnormal sperm increased significantly. There were obvious testicular histopathology distinguishes observed in expansion of interstitial space and reduction in the number and size of Leydig cells. The data demonstrated that the source of drinking water from Yangtze River had actual toxicity on male mice reproductive system and suggested that the source water pollution should be controlled for protection of human health.
19495527,0,2009,Singapore Med J,MECP2 mutations in Malaysian Rett syndrome patients.,INTRODUCTION: Rett syndrome (RS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by normal neurological development followed by progressive developmental regression. The X-linked dominant inheritance of RS has been mapped to the gene that encodes the methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MECP2) at Xq28. In the present study, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used to detect mutations in the MECP2 gene in 20 Malaysian RS patients.METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out to amplify the MECP2 coding exons 2, 3, and 4 in a total of eight reactions (exons 2, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d and 4e). Subsequently, PCR products were analysed by DHPLC.RESULTS: Mutations in the MECP2 gene were detected in 13 of the 20 (65 percent) RS patients. 11 patients had mutations in exons 3b and 4a and six patients had mutations in exon 4c. These mutations were mainly concentrated in the methyl-CpG-binding domain and the transcriptional-repression domain.CONCLUSION: Through the use of post-PCR high-performance liquid chromatography, 65 percent of 20 RS patients were found to have mutation(s) in the MECP2.
19481936,0,2009,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis of 4-substituted pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(1H)-one as analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents.,4-Substituted-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(1H)-ones 4a-c were synthesized by oxidation of 4-substituted-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(1H)-ones 3a-c which were in turn prepared from arylidenemalononitriles 1a-c and 6-aminothiouracil 2. The reactivity of compounds 4a-c towards some reagents such as formamide, carbon disulfide, urea, thiourea, formic and acetic acids were studied. All the synthesized compounds were characterized by spectroscopic means and elemental analysis. Compound 4c exhibited 64% and 72% analgesic activity. Also, compound 4b showed 50% and 65% anti-inflammatory activity. Interestingly these compounds showed one-third of ulcer index of the reference aspirin and diclofenac.
19467642,0,2009,Ann Cardiol Angeiol (Paris),[Correlation between atrial function and functional capacity in highly trained subjects].,AIM: The aim of the study is to show the relationship existing between tissular Doppler imaging (TDI) parameters and functional capacity in highly trained subjects.METHODS AND PATIENTS: We therefore studied 46 patients including 22 untrained and 24 trained subjects. Each subject had pulsed TDI recording of systolic (S) and diastolic (E and A) longitudinal myocardial velocities in the basal portion of the RV free wall (RV), the septum (sep) and the LV free wall (LV) from apical 4C view. Athletes underwent the same day a cardiopulmonary test during which we measured peak V(O)2 (ml/kg/min) and anaerobic threshold (AT, ml/kg/min) and calculated VE/V(CO)2 slope. We studied differences between echocardiographic parameters in the two groups using Student test. Coefficients of correlations were calculated using the Spearman method.RESULTS: Differences between two groups concerned Tei index of right (RV) and left ventricle (LV), telediastolic diameter of LV, and A waves on each wall. In athletes RV, sep and LV S waves did not correlate with V(O)2, AT or VE/V(CO)2 RV, sep and LV A waves correlated significantly and negatively with V(O)2, RV and sep A waves negatively with AT, and sep and LV A waves positively with VE/V(CO)2.CONCLUSION: In athletes, atrial function shows a negative relationship with cardiopulmonary exercise parameters: the lower the proportion of LV filling due to atrial contraction, the better the level of functional capacity. This is probably due to myocardial structure, which allows more efficient early filling in hypertrophic athlete's heart.
19452076,0,2009,Dalton Trans,Hypovalency--a kinetic-energy density description of a 4c-2e bond.,A bond descriptor based on the kinetic energy density, the localized-orbital locator (LOL), is used to characterize the nature of the chemical bond in electron deficient multi-center bonds. The boranes B(2)H(6), B(4)H(4), B(4)H(10), [B(6)H(6)](2-), and [B(6)H(7)](-) serve as prototypical examples of hypovalent 3c-2e and 4c-2e bonding. The kinetic energy density is derived from a set of Kohn-Sham orbitals obtained from pure density functional calculations (PBE/TZVP), and the topology of LOL is analyzed in terms of (3,-3) attractors (Gamma). The B-B-B and B-H-B 3c-2e, and the B-B-H-B 4c-2e bonding situations are defined by their own characteristic LOL profiles. The presence of one attractor in relation to the three or four atoms that are engaged in electron deficient bonding provides sufficient indication of the type of 3c-2e or 4c-2e bond present. For the 4c-2e bond in [B(6)H(7)](-) the LOL analysis is compared to results from an experimental QTAIM study.
19445231,0,2009,Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,[Study on the energy transfer fluorescence quenching reaction of acridine orange-4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol-V(V) system and analytical application].,An energy transfer technique for 4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol (PAR)-vanadium(V) and acridine orange (AO) was studied, and the optimum conditions of energy transfer system were also experimented. It was found that in citrate-Na2 HPO4 buffer solution at pH = 5.5, energy transfers from AO to vanadium(V)-PAR complexes. A new method based on energy transfer fluorescence quenching for the determination of trace vanadium(V) with AO-PAR-V(V) was established. The equation of linear regression is deltaF = 165.4c+2.5, and the determination range of vanadium is 0.012-0.5 microg x mL(-1), with detection limit of 0.004 5 microg x mL(-1). The correlation coefficient is R = 0.998 5, and relative standard deviation is 0.6%. The fluorescence reaction is completed within 15 minutes, and relative fluorescence intensity remains unchanged for 2.5 hours. The influence of foreign ions on the determination of V (0.5 microg x mL(-1)) was examined, with a related error of 5%. The method has been used in the determination of trace vanadium in biological samples with the relative error of 6.98%, which meets the requirements of trace analysis.
19410467,0,2009,Bioorg Med Chem,N-tert-butyl and N-methyl nitrones derived from aromatic aldehydes inhibit macromolecular permeability increase induced by ischemia/reperfusion in hamsters.,N-alquil nitrones 1c and 3-6 were prepared from aromatic aldehydes and N-tert-butylhydroxylamine or N-methylhydroxylamine in good yields and soft conditions. Their protective effect against microvascular damages caused by ischemia/reperfusion in 'hamster cheek pouch' assay was investigated and compare with that observed for nitrones 1a,b and 2, previously studied. Nitrones 3b, 4b and 4c were the most active ones in inhibiting macromolecular permeability increase induced by ischemia/reperfusion when administered by gavage and intravenous, while 3a and 4a were active only after intravenous administration. N-tert-butylhydroxylamine and Nt-methylhydroxylamine, products of the hydrolysis of these nitrones, were weakly active when administered by gavage or intravenous. Nitrone (4a) was the most potent in inhibiting macromolecular permeability increase induced by histamine. In this case, N-tert-butylhydroxylamine was as active as 4a. The lypophylicity in nitrones, specially in N-methyl nitrones, play an important role on the protective action when compounds were administered by gavage.
19371568,0,2009,Homeopathy,A nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy comparison of 3C trituration derived and 4C trituration derived remedies.,BACKGROUND: Trituration of base substances, commonly to the 3cH level, is the cornerstone of the homeopathic pharmaceutical process or insoluble solutions. Becker and Ehrler claim that trituration to 4cH gives a new, spiritual dimension to the homoeopathic medicine picture.AIM AND METHOD: This study sought to establish whether the claim that C4-derived potencies possess different physicochemical qualities to the homoeopathic medicines derived from a 3cH trituration is valid. All potencies were produced by hand according to the German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (GHP). Five different samples were analysed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy.RESULTS: The results indicated a significant difference between the 12cH samples of potassium dichromate (Kalium bichromicum) produced from 3cH and 4cH triturations. This was especially prominent in the chemical shift values of all four peaks and the relative integration levels of the H(2)O, OH and CH(3) peaks when comparing two sample groups.CONCLUSION: Trituration plays a part in the development of physicochemical properties specific to homoeopathic medicines. The higher the level of trituration, the more pronounced is the alteration of the physical structure of the active ingredient. The study concludes that 4cH potencies are physicochemically distinct from 3cH-derived potencies (as currently employed).
19346601,0,2009,Acta Crystallogr C,A monoclinic pseudopolymorph of manganese squarate dihydrate, Mn(mu-C(4)O(4))(H(2)O)(2), built from cubic units.,The structure of poly[[[hexaaquatrimanganese(II)]-tri-mu-squarato] monohydrate], {[Mn(3)(C(4)O(4))(3)(H(2)O)(6)].H(2)O}(n), synthesized hydrothermally, consists of a new three-dimensional framework described by secondary building units (SBUs) containing two MnO(6) octahedra and three squarate groups in a cube-shaped arrangement. In the asymmetric unit, one squarate group is located around an inversion centre (4a; 0, 0, 0), two Mn atoms [4d (3/4, 1/4, 0) and 4c (1/4, 1/4, 0)] are located on inversion centres and the third Mn atom is on a twofold axis (4e; 0, y, 1/4). This report illustrates the concept of the SBU and the flexibility of the squarate spacer in the design of new porous topologies.
19319470,0,2009,Acta Neurochir (Wien),The value of image coregistration during stereotactic radiosurgery.,BACKGROUND: Coregistration of any neuroimaging studies into treatment planning for stereotactic radiosurgery became easily applicable using the Leksell Gamma Knife 4C, a new model of gamma knife. The authors investigated the advantage of this image processing.METHOD: Since installation of the Leksell Gamma Knife 4C at the authors' institute, 180 sessions of radiosurgery were performed. Before completion of planning, coregistration of frameless images of other modalities or previous images was considered to refine planning. Treatment parameters were compared for planning before and after refinement by use of coregistered images.FINDINGS: Coregistered computed tomography clarified the anatomical structures indistinct on magnetic resonance imaging. Positron emission tomography visualized lesions disclosing metabolically high activity. Coregistration of prior imaging distinguished progressing lesions from stable ones. Diffusion-tensor tractography was integrated for lesions adjacent to the corticospinal tract or the optic radiation. After refinement of planning in 36 sessions, excess treated volume decreased (p = 0.0062) and Paddick conformity index improved (p &lt; 0.001). Maximal dose to the white matter tracts was decreased (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: Image coregistration provided direct information on anatomy, metabolic activity, chronological changes, and adjacent critical structures. This gathered information was sufficiently informative during treatment planning to supplement ambiguous information on stereotactic images, and was useful especially in reducing irradiation to surrounding normal structures.
19275709,0,2009,Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel pyrazole derivatives as anti-inflammatory antimicrobial agents.,The synthesis of novel series of structurally related 4-pyrazolyl benzenesulfonamide derivatives is described. All the newly synthesized compounds were examined for their anti-inflammatory activity using cotton pellet induced granuloma and carrageenan induced rat paw edema bioassays. In addition the inhibitory activities of cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-1 and COX-2), ulcerogenic effect and acute toxicity were determined. Furthermore, all the compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against Eischerichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Docking poses for compounds 6b and 7b separately in the active site of the human COX-2 enzyme and DNA-gyrase B were also obtained. The results revealed that compounds 3c, 4b, 4c, 5c, 6b and 7b exhibited comparable or better anti-inflammatory activity compared to indomethacin and celecoxib with no or minimal ulcerogenic effect and high safety margin. Compounds 3b, 3c, 4b, 4c, 5a-c, 6a, 6b and 7a-c displayed appreciable antibacterial activity against both E. coli and S. aureus compared with ampicillin. Compounds 5a-c and 7a had antibacterial activity against E. coli similar to ampicillin whereas compounds 3b, 3c, 4b, 4c, 6a and 7b displayed considerable activity against the microorganism. Compounds 3a, 3c, 4c, 5a-c, 6b and 7a-c had appreciable activity against S. aureus. Overall, compounds 4c, 6b and 7b are the most distinctive derivatives in the present study because of their remarkable anti-inflammatory potency and significant antibacterial activity. Furthermore, compounds 6b and 7b exhibited good selective inhibitory activity against COX-2 enzyme. Therefore, such compounds would represent a suitable template for the design of anti-inflammatory antimicrobial candidates with reasonable COX-2 selectivity.
19266835,0,2009,Middle East J Anaesthesiol,Management of A2B blood group in a patient for hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass surgery--a case report.,A2 is one of the rare subgroups in the ABO blood group system. Because of the weak antigenic power of A2 subgroup, the hemolytic reaction is not severe under normothermic situations. Under hypothermic conditions, however, such as in cardiac surgery under hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), lethal hemolytic reaction may occur. Autologous blood transfusion helps the anesthesiologist to avoid banked blood and thus avoid unwanted transfusion reactions. The following case report is a 59 yrs old man with an &quot;A2B&quot; negative blood group who underwent CABG under hypothermic CPB (28C, using cold cardioplegia 4C). Following induction, the anesthesiologist drew three units of patient's own blood (1200 cc) and replaced it with the same volume of colloid solution (Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution-ANH). The collected autologous blood was then re-transfused at the end of surgery. With the use of the ANH technique, the patient was successfully managed during hypothermic CPB without the risk of a hemolytic reaction.

X-Ray crystal structure analyses for complexes and revealed that C1C2C4C3 is twisted in two ways with a torsion angle of 21.6-30.7 degrees for 3a, 4a, and 4b and about 42 degrees for 3c and 4c, and that their crystals are racemic mixtures. Due to the more electronegative chloride atoms in the ligand, complexes and show higher nu(M-S) vibrational frequencies in their Raman spectra, smaller spin-spin coupling constants (J(Pt-P)) in their (195)Pt{(31)P} NMR spectra and higher anodic potentials (E(pa)) in their cyclic voltammograms than complexes 3a, 3b, 4a and 4b. Moreover, only complex containing the chlorinated ligand and Pt(ii) ion exhibits luminescence (lambda(ob) = 610 nm and lambda(ex) = 440 nm) in the solid state at 298 K. This emissive transition can be assigned as the d-pi(dithiolate) metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and the feasibility of this spin-forbidden transition is ascribed to the effective spin-orbit coupling of ligand c containing heavy chloride atoms and the large spin-orbit coupling in Pt(ii).
19235951,0,2009,Inorg Chem,Oxidative reactions of tetrametal Pd(0)...Mo(II)-Mo(II)...Pd(0) clusters: electrochemical communication of two Pd(0) centers through the Mo(2) moiety and oxidative formation of a Pd(I)-Mo(II)-Mo(II)-Pd(I) array.,Reaction of Mo(2)(pyphos)(4) (1) (pyphos = 6-diphenylphosphino-2-pyridonate) with Pd(dba)(2) (dba = dibenzylideneacetone) afforded the Pd(0) complex Mo(2)Pd(2)(pyphos)(4) (2) which has two Pd(0) centers at both axial positions of the Mo(2) core. The unsaturated Pd(0) centers of 2 were coordinated with donor molecules such as olefins, acetylenes, isonitriles, carbon monoxide, and triphenylphosphine to give the corresponding adducts, Mo(2)Pd(2)(pyphos)(4)(L)(2) (3a: L = acrylonitrile, 3b: L = fumaronitrile, 3c: L = tetracyanoethylene, 3d: L = diisopropyl fumarate, 3e: L = diethyl fumarate, 3f: L = dimethyl fumarate, 3g: L = dimethyl maleate, 3h: L = 2,6-xylylisocyanide, 3i: L = tert-butylisocyanide, 3j: L = dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate, 3k: L = 1,4-benzoquinone, 3l: L = 1,4-naphthoquinone, 3m: L = carbon monooxide, and 3n: L = triphenylphosphine). Oxidative 1,4-addition of ArSSAr and benzoyl peroxide to the Pd(0) centers of 2 afforded the corresponding Pd(I) complexes Mo(2)Pd(2)(SAr)(2)(pyphos)(4) (7a: Ar = C(6)H(5), 7b: Ar = 4-Me(3)CC(6)H(4), 7c: Ar = 4-MeC(6)H(4), 7d: 4-NO(2)C(6)H(4)) and Mo(2)Pd(2)(OCOPh)(2)(pyphos)(4) (9). Chemical oxidation of 2 with [Cp(2)Fe][BF(4)] in CH(3)CN afforded a dicationic Pd(I) complex [Mo(2)Pd(2)(pyphos)(4)(CH(3)CN)(2)][BF(4)](2) (10a). Similarly, the reaction of 2 with [Cp(2)Fe][BF(4)] in the presence of excess amounts of various donor molecules in THF gave rise to corresponding dicationic Pd(I) complexes [Mo(2)Pd(2)(pyphos)(4)(L')(2)][BF(4)](2) (10b; L' = dimethylsulfoxide, 10c: L' = THF, 10d: L' = benzonitrile, 10e: L' = p-methoxyphenylnitrile, 10f: L' = p-trifluoromethylphenylnitrile, 10g: L' = pyridine, and 10h: L' = p-dimethylaminopyridine), whereas complexes [Mo(2)Pd(2)(pyphos)(4)(CNXyl)(2)][BF(4)](2) (10i) and [Mo(2)Pd(2)(pyphos)(4)(CN(t)Bu)(2)][BF(4)](2) (10j) were prepared by oxidation of the corresponding isonitrile-Pd(0) complexes 3h and 3i. Cyclic voltammetry of 10aj displayed two different oxidation profiles of Pd(0) depending on the donor molecules: complexes 10af showed two waves ascribed to electron communication through monocationic species as intermediates, whereas complexes 10gj showed one wave due to two-electron process. Furthermore, the oxidative addition of alkyl and aryl halides to 2 gave rise to two different reaction patterns: excess amounts of benzyl halides BnX (X = Cl, Br, I), PhCl, and PhBr, and 2 equiv of PhI reacted with 2 to give Pd(I) complexes Mo(2)Pd(2)(X)(2)(pyphos)(4) (4a: X = Cl, 4b: X = Br, 4c: X = I), and the reactions of 2 with excess amounts of PhI and MeI afforded Pd(II) complexes Mo(2)Pd(2)(Ph)(2)I(2)(pyphos)(4) (11) and Mo(2)Pd(2)(CH(3))(2)I(2)(pyphos)(4) (13) bearing two &quot;Pd(Ph)I&quot; and &quot;Pd(CH(3))I&quot; moieties.
19223188,0,2009,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of new arylpiperazines N-[4-[4-(aryl) piperazine-1-yl]-phenyl]-amine derivatives: putative role of 5-HT1A receptors.,In an attempt to design novel 5-HT(1A) agonists/partial agonists, based on an arylpiperazine nucleus, a series of N-{4-[4-(aryl)piperazine-1-yl]-phenyl}-amine derivatives were synthesized and biologically tested. The anxiolytic effect of the compounds was investigated employing the Elevated plus Maze (EPM) task. On the basis of in vivo functional test, compound 1c (3mg/kg) and 4c (3mg/kg) induced significant increments in open arm entries and time on EPM as compared to Buspirone. The anxiolytic effects of compounds 1c and 4c were effectively antagonized by WAY-100635, a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist (0.5mg/kg). Furthermore, we have also evaluated the concentration of 5-HT in the brain tissue using HPLC with fluorescent detection. Our result showed that serotonin levels were significantly decreased by approximately 38% (p&lt;0.001) and approximately 32% (p&lt;0.001) after acute administration of compounds 1c and 4c, respectively. These findings suggest that the anxiolytic like activity of these new arylpiperazines is mediated via 5-HT(1A) receptors in the brain.
21186613,0,2009,Zhongguo Ying Yong Sheng Li Xue Za Zhi,[The effect of chronic intermittent hypoxia on p38MAPK in cerebral tissues of weanling rats].,AIM: To study the effect of chronic intermittent hypoxia on p38MAPK in partial cerebral tissues of weanling rats.METHODS: Randomly, fifty male SD rats (3-week-old-4-week-old) were divided into five groups: 2-week-CIH group (2IH), 4-week-CIH group (4IH), 4-week-recovery group (4F), 2-week-control group (2C) and 4-week-control group (4C). Intermittent hypoxia model was induced by an intermittent hypoxia cabin. The expression of p38MAPK mRNA and the phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK (p-p38 protein) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were measured by RT-PCR or Western blot respectively.RESULTS: No matter in the hippocampus, or in the prefrontal cortex, the expression of p38MAPK mRNA and p-p38 protein in 2IH, 4IH and 4F groups were respectively higher than 2C and 4C groups (P &lt; 0.05, respectively).CONCLUSION: Chronic intermittent hypoxia can activate the p38MAPK in partial cerebral tissues of weanling rats.
19175335,0,2009,J Phys Chem A,Deciphering chemical bonding in golden cages.,The recently developed adaptive natural density partitioning (AdNDP) method has been applied to a series of golden clusters. The pattern of chemical bonding in Au(20) revealed by AdNDP shows that 20 electrons form a four-center-two-electron (4c-2e) bond in each of 10 tetrahedral cavities of the Au(20) cluster. This chemical bonding picture can readily explain the tetrahedral structure of the Au(20) cluster. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the recovered 4c-2e bonds corresponding to independent structural fragments of the cluster provide important information about chemically relevant fragmentation of Au(20). In fact, some of these bonds can be removed from the initial tetrahedral structure together with the associated atomic fragments, leading to the family of smaller gold clusters. Chemical bonding in the systems formed in such a manner is yet closely related to the bonding in the parental systems showing persistence of the 4c-2e bonding motif. Thus, the multicenter bonds in golden cages recovered by the AdNDP analysis correspond to the fragments that should be seen as building blocks of these chemical systems.
19175140,0,2009,Med Phys,An experimental palladium-103 seed (OptiSeedexp) in a biocompatible polymer without a gold marker: characterization of dosimetric parameters including the interseed effect.,Permanent implantation of 125I (iodine) or 103Pd (palladium) sources is a popular treatment option in the management of early stage prostate cancer. New sources are being developed, some of which are being marketed for different clinical applications. A new technique of adjuvant stereotactic permanent seed breast implant, similar to that used in the treatment of prostate cancer, has been proposed by [N. Jansen et al., Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 67, 1052-1058 (2007)] with encouraging results. The presence of artifacts from the metallic seeds, however, can disturb follow-up imaging. The development of plastic seeds has reduced these artifacts. This paper presents a feasibility study of the advantages of palladium-103 seeds, encapsulated with a biocompatible polymer, for future clinical applications, and on the effect of the gold marker on the dosimetric characteristics of such seeds. Experimental palladium seeds, OptiSeedexp, were manufactured by International Brachytherapy (IBt), Seneffe, Belgium, from a biocompatible polymer, including the marker. Apart from the absence of a gold marker, the studied seed has an identical design to the OptiSeed103 [Phys. Med. Biol. 50, 1493-1504 (2005)]; [Appl. Radiat. Isot. 63, 311-321 (2005)]. Polymer encapsulation was preferred by IBt in order to reduce the quantity of radioactive material needed for a given dose rate and to reduce the anisotropy of the radiation field around the seed. In addition, this design is intended to decrease the interseed effects that can occur as a result of the marker and the encapsulation. Dosimetric measurements were performed using LiF thermoluminescent dosimeters (1 mm3) in solid water phantoms (WT1). Measured data were compared to Monte Carlo simulated data in solid water using the MCNP code, version 4C. Updated cross sections [Med. Phys. 30, 701-711 (2003)] were used. As the measured and calculated data were in agreement, Monte Carlo calculations were then performed in liquid water to obtain relevant dosimetric data as required by TG-43U1 recommendations. Comparison of the results with previous studies of OptiSeed103 [Phys. Med. Biol. 50, 1493-1504 (2005)]; [Appl. Radiat. Isot. 63, 311-321 (2005)], and of InterSource103 [Appl. Radiat. Isot. 57, 805-811 (2002)] showed very good agreement for the dose rate constant and for the radial dose function. With respect to the anisotropy function, the relative dose (anisotropy value relative to 90 degrees) from the polymer seed at a distance of 3 cm was close to unity (105%) at 0 degrees, whereas the relative values for the OptiSeed103 with a gold marker and the titanium-encapsulated InterSource103 seed decreased to 70% and 40%, respectively. The interseed effect from one seed was negligible and in the order of calculation uncertainty, making calculation of the dose rate distribution of the studied seeds, according to TG43U1 recommendations, more accurate and closer to reality. This feasibility study shows that due to the low energy of palladium-103, the negligible interseed effect and the reduced artifacts in postimplant medical imaging, this experimental plastic seed would be a good source for breast brachytherapy. This feasibility study was carried out in collaboration with IBt and will be continued with a study of its visibility in different tissues.
19152626,0,2009,Vet Surg,Evaluation of a collagenase generated osteoarthritis biomarker in naturally occurring canine cruciate disease.,OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical value of a novel osteoarthritis (OA) biomarker in detecting canine cruciate disease.STUDY DESIGN: Cross sectional clinical study.ANIMALS: Dogs (n=22) with cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture and 12 control dogs.METHODS: Concentrations of collagenase-generated cleavage epitope of type II collagen (Col2-3/4C(long mono), or C2C) in serum, urine, and joint fluid were compared between a group of dogs with CCL rupture and a control group. Correlation of C2C concentrations to the clinical stage of stifle OA was also evaluated.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in C2C concentrations in serum, urine, and joint fluid between groups (P&gt;.05). Subjective scores of lameness, joint effusion, osteophytosis were significantly more severe in the CCL rupture group compared with the control group (P&lt;.05). There was no significant correlation of C2C concentrations with clinical stage of stifle OA (P&gt;.05).CONCLUSION: This OA biomarker did not detect pathology associated with CCL rupture. Our results suggest that collagenase-specific degradation of type II collagen in articular cartilage may not be involved in the early stage of naturally occurring canine cruciate disease, and that pathology associated with naturally occurring CCL rupture is different from that of experimental OA model.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: C2C is not clinically useful in detecting CCL rupture in dogs.
19139974,0,2009,Mol Cell Biochem,Capillary isotachophoresis study of lipoprotein network sensitive to apolipoprotein E phenotype. 2. ApoE and apoC-III relations in triglyceride clearance.,The plasma (P), VLDL (V) triglyceride and apoB (B) clearance rates were measured both as 'mass' clearance (k (1)) and 'within the particle' clearance in three patient groups (E33, E23 and E34 phenotypes) at heparin-induced lipolysis in vivo. The lipid (C)- and apoE (E)-specific lipoprotein profiles both before and after heparin were followed by capillary isotachophoresis. The displacement of apoE by exogenous apoC-III at plasma titration in vitro was measured as well. The phenotype-sensitive lipoprotein networks were constructed based on an established set of metabolic rules. The k (1)(V) values did not differ between the three groups, but the lower k (1)(P) values showed significant differences. The k (1)(P) values for E33 and E23 groups were twofold higher compared to E34. A twofold increase in the rate constant for VLDL triglyceride clearance within the particle in E34 group compared to E23 reflected the inhibition of lipolysis by apoE2. For E33 group, (i) the k (1)(V) value was negatively correlated to the size of non-displaceable apoE pool in 2E lipoprotein and to the maximal apoE sorbtion capacity for 2E and 3E lipoproteins; (ii) the k (1)(P) value was not associated to the apoE binding parameters; (iii) the k (1)(V) value was positively correlated to the 4C level and the magnitude of apoC-III removal from VLDL particle; (iv) the k (1)(P) value was positively correlated to the content of apoE, while negatively with apoC-III, in VLDL remnants. For E34 group, the k (1)(V) value was positively correlated to 11C and 1-7C pool levels. Lipolysis- and receptor-mediated TG runways seem to be mostly balanced in E33 group, and VLDL TG clearance may be controlled by HDL through apoE dissociation from VLDLs and apolipoprotein accumulation within 'fast' HDLs at lipolysis.
19129606,0,2009,Acta Crystallogr C,Hydrogen-bonded assemblies of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin with dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and water.,The title free base porphyrin compound forms hydrogen-bonded adducts with N,N-dimethylformamide, C(44)H(30)N(4)O(4).4C(3)H(7)NO, (I), a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide and water, C(44)H(30)N(4)O(4).4C(3)H(7)NO.H(2)O, (II), and a mixture of N,N-dimethylacetamide and water, C(44)H(30)N(4)O(4).6C(3)H(7)NO.2H(2)O, (III). Total solvation of the four hydroxy functions of the porphyrin molecules characterizes all three compounds, thus preventing its supramolecular association into extended network architectures. In (I), the asymmetric unit consist of two five-component adduct species, while in (III), the nine-component entities reside on centres of inversion. This report provides the first structural characterizations of the free base tetra(hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin. It also demonstrates that the presence of strong Lewis bases, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide, in the crystallization mixture prevents direct supramolecular networking of the porphyrin ligands via O-H...O-H hydrogen bonds, due to their competing O-H...N(base) interaction with the hydroxy functions. The crystal packing of compounds (I)-(III) resembles that of other hydrogen-bonding-assisted tetraarylporphyrin clathrates.
19122212,0,2009,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,DXRaySMCS: a user-friendly interface developed for prediction of diagnostic radiology X-ray spectra produced by Monte Carlo (MCNP-4C) simulation.,In this work, the general purpose Monte Carlo N-particle radiation transport computer code (MCNP-4C) was used for the simulation of X-ray spectra in diagnostic radiology. The electron's path in the target was followed until its energy was reduced to 10 keV. A user-friendly interface named 'diagnostic X-ray spectra by Monte Carlo simulation (DXRaySMCS)' was developed to facilitate the application of MCNP-4C code for diagnostic radiology spectrum prediction. The program provides a user-friendly interface for: (i) modifying the MCNP input file, (ii) launching the MCNP program to simulate electron and photon transport and (iii) processing the MCNP output file to yield a summary of the results (relative photon number per energy bin). In this article, the development and characteristics of DXRaySMCS are outlined. As part of the validation process, output spectra for 46 diagnostic radiology system settings produced by DXRaySMCS were compared with the corresponding IPEM78. Generally, there is a good agreement between the two sets of spectra. No statistically significant differences have been observed between IPEM78 reported spectra and the simulated spectra generated in this study.
19117762,0,2009,Appl Radiat Isot,Calculations of the thermal and fast neutron fluxes in the Syrian miniature neutron source reactor using the MCNP-4C code.,The MCNP-4C code, based on the probabilistic approach, was used to model the 3D configuration of the core of the Syrian miniature neutron source reactor (MNSR). The continuous energy neutron cross sections from the ENDF/B-VI library were used to calculate the thermal and fast neutron fluxes in the inner and outer irradiation sites of MNSR. The thermal fluxes in the MNSR inner irradiation sites were also measured experimentally by the multiple foil activation method ((197)Au (n, gamma) (198)Au and (59)Co (n, gamma) (60)Co). The foils were irradiated simultaneously in each of the five MNSR inner irradiation sites to measure the thermal neutron flux and the epithermal index in each site. The calculated and measured results agree well.

The pyridinone ring, the carbamide group and the bicyclic fragment in both independent mol-ecules are planar within 0.03 Å due to the formation of intra-molecular O-H⋯O and N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds. The formation of these latter inter-actions also causes the redistribution of the electron density within the hydroxy-pyridone fragment, with the result that some bonds are elongated compared with values in the literature and some others are shorter. In the crystal phase, the pyridine-3-carboxyl-ate mol-ecules form layers parallel to (010), which are inter-linked through hydrogen bonds mediated by the bridging solvate mol-ecules. A terminal ethyl group in one of the mol-ecules is disordered over two sites of equally occupancy.

Contamination of the chloride counter-anion with bromide occured during the preparation, due to the use of 1,2-dibromo-ethane. One of the solvent mol-ecules is disordered, with occupancies 0.53 (3):0.47 (3). The crystal packing is stabilized by an infinite two dimensional ⋯X⋯H-N-H⋯X⋯ hydrogen-bonding network (X: Br(-)/Cl(-) ≃ 1:12). In addition, O-H⋯X and O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds involving solvent mol-ecules are observed.

Two of the 4,4'-bipyridine mol-ecules lie on general positions and the other three on centers of inversion. The two 4,4'-bipyridine mol-ecules on general positions and one of the three on special positions are disordered over two positions each with an occupancy of 0.50.

In the crystal, the Schiff base, N-heterocycle and water mol-ecules engage in O-H⋯O, O-H⋯N and N-H⋯O hydrogen-bonding inter-actions, generating a layer structure.

Here, we have developed a method for the comparison of mRNA expression levels of most human genes across 9,783 Affymetrix gene expression array experiments representing 43 normal human tissue types, 68 cancer types, and 64 other diseases. This database of gene expression patterns in normal human tissues and pathological conditions covers 113 million datapoints and is available from the GeneSapiens website.
18650403,76,2008,Plant Physiol,Global analysis of Arabidopsis gene expression uncovers a complex array of changes impacting pathogen response and cell cycle during geminivirus infection.,Geminiviruses are small DNA viruses that use plant replication machinery to amplify their genomes. Microarray analysis of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transcriptome in response to cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV) infection uncovered 5,365 genes (false discovery rate &lt;0.005) differentially expressed in infected rosette leaves at 12 d postinoculation. Data mining revealed that CaLCuV triggers a pathogen response via the salicylic acid pathway and induces expression of genes involved in programmed cell death, genotoxic stress, and DNA repair. CaLCuV also altered expression of cell cycle-associated genes, preferentially activating genes expressed during S and G2 and inhibiting genes active in G1 and M. A limited set of core cell cycle genes associated with cell cycle reentry, late G1, S, and early G2 had increased RNA levels, while core cell cycle genes linked to early G1 and late G2 had reduced transcripts. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of nuclei from infected leaves revealed a depletion of the 4C population and an increase in 8C, 16C, and 32C nuclei. Infectivity studies of transgenic Arabidopsis showed that overexpression of CYCD3;1 or E2FB, both of which promote the mitotic cell cycle, strongly impaired CaLCuV infection. In contrast, overexpression of E2FA or E2FC, which can facilitate the endocycle, had no apparent effect. These results showed that geminiviruses and RNA viruses interface with the host pathogen response via a common mechanism, and that geminiviruses modulate plant cell cycle status by differentially impacting the CYCD/retinoblastoma-related protein/E2F regulatory network and facilitating progression into the endocycle.
18252809,45,2008,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Lorcaserin, a novel selective human 5-hydroxytryptamine2C agonist: in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterization.,5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2C) receptor agonists hold promise for the treatment of obesity. In this study, we describe the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of lorcaserin [(1R)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-methyl-1H-3 benzazepine], a selective, high affinity 5-HT(2C) full agonist. Lorcaserin bound to human and rat 5-HT(2C) receptors with high affinity (K(i) = 15 +/- 1 nM, 29 +/- 7 nM, respectively), and it was a full agonist for the human 5-HT(2C) receptor in a functional inositol phosphate accumulation assay, with 18- and 104-fold selectivity over 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2B) receptors, respectively. Lorcaserin was also highly selective for human 5-HT(2C) over other human 5-HT receptors (5-HT(1A), 5-HT(3), 5-HT(4C), 5-HT5(5A), 5-HT(6), and 5-HT(7)), in addition to a panel of 67 other G protein-coupled receptors and ion channels. Lorcaserin did not compete for binding of ligands to serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine transporters, and it did not alter their function in vitro. Behavioral observations indicated that unlike the 5-HT(2A) agonist (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-phenyl)-2-aminopropane, lorcaserin did not induce behavioral changes indicative of functional 5-HT(2A) agonist activity. Acutely, lorcaserin reduced food intake in rats, an effect that was reversed by pretreatment with the 5-HT(2C)-selective antagonist 6-chloro-5-methyl-1-[6-(2-methylpyridin-3-yloxy)pyridin-3-yl-carbamoyl]indoline (SB242,084) but not the 5-HT(2A) antagonist (R)-(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl)]-4-piperidine-methanol (MDL 100,907), demonstrating mediation by the 5-HT(2C) receptor. Chronic daily treatment with lorcaserin to rats maintained on a high fat diet produced dose-dependent reductions in food intake and body weight gain that were maintained during the 4-week study. Upon discontinuation, body weight returned to control levels. These data demonstrate lorcaserin to be a potent, selective, and efficacious agonist of the 5-HT(2C) receptor, with potential for the treatment of obesity.
18286208,36,2008,PLoS One,Maintenance of long-range DNA interactions after inhibition of ongoing RNA polymerase II transcription.,A relationship exists between nuclear architecture and gene activity and it has been proposed that the activity of ongoing RNA polymerase II transcription determines genome organization in the mammalian cell nucleus. Recently developed 3C and 4C technology allowed us to test the importance of transcription for nuclear architecture. We demonstrate that upon transcription inhibition binding of RNA polymerase II to gene regulatory elements is severely reduced. However, contacts between regulatory DNA elements and genes in the beta-globin locus are unaffected and the locus still interacts with the same genomic regions elsewhere on the chromosome. This is a general phenomenon since the great majority of intra- and interchromosomal interactions with the ubiquitously expressed Rad23a gene are also not affected. Our data demonstrate that without transcription the organization and modification of nucleosomes at active loci and the local binding of specific trans-acting factors is unaltered. We propose that these parameters, more than transcription or RNA polymerase II binding, determine the maintenance of long-range DNA interactions.
18274532,24,2008,Nat Protoc,High-resolution circular chromosome conformation capture assay.,The pioneering chromosome conformation capture (3C) method provides the opportunity to study chromosomal folding in the nucleus. It is based on formaldehyde cross-linking of living cells followed by enzyme digestion, intramolecular ligation and quantitative (Q)-PCR analysis. However, 3C requires prior knowledge of the bait and interacting sequence (termed interactor) rendering it less useful for genome-wide studies. As several recent reports document, this limitation has been overcome by exploiting a circular intermediate in a variant of the 3C method, termed 4C (for circular 3C). The strategic positioning of primers within the bait enables the identification of unknown interacting sequences, which form part of the circular DNA. Here, we describe a protocol for our 4C method, which produces a high-resolution interaction map potentially suitable for the analysis of cis-regulatory elements and for comparison with chromatin marks obtained by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip at the sites of interaction. Following optimization of enzyme digestions and amplification conditions, the protocol can be completed in 2-3 weeks.
18729371,22,2008,Org Lett,Catalyst-directed diastereoselectivity in hydrogenative couplings of acetylene to alpha-chiral aldehydes: formal synthesis of all eight L-hexoses.,Hydrogenative coupling of acetylene to alpha-chiral aldehydes 1a-4a using enantiomeric rhodium catalysts ligated by (S)-MeO-BIPHEP and (R)-MeO-BIPHEP delivers the diastereomeric products of carbonyl-(Z)-butadienylation 1b-4b and 1c-4c, respectively, with good to excellent levels of catalyst directed diastereofacial selectivity. Diastereomeric L-glyceraldehyde acetonide adducts 1b and 1c were converted to the four isomeric enoates 6b, 8b, 6c, and 8c, representing a formal synthesis of all eight L-hexoses.
18515826,21,2008,J Exp Bot,Cytokinin deficiency causes distinct changes of sink and source parameters in tobacco shoots and roots.,Cytokinin deficiency causes pleiotropic developmental changes such as reduced shoot and increased root growth. It was investigated whether cytokinin-deficient tobacco plants, which overproduce different cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase enzymes, show changes in different sink and source parameters, which could be causally related to the establishment of the cytokinin deficiency syndrome. Ultrastructural analysis revealed distinct changes in differentiating shoot tissues, including an increased vacuolation and an earlier differentiation of plastids, which showed partially disorganized thylakoid structures later in development. A comparison of the ploidy levels revealed an increased population of cells with a 4C DNA content during early stages of leaf development, indicating an inhibited progression from G2 to mitosis. To compare physiological characteristics of sink leaves, source leaves and roots of wild-type and cytokinin-deficient plants, several photosynthetic parameters, content of soluble sugars, starch and adenylates, as well as activities of enzymes of carbon assimilation and dissimilation were determined. Leaves of cytokinin-deficient plants contained less chlorophyll and non-photochemical quenching of young leaves was increased. However, absorption rate, photosynthetic capacity (F(v)/F(m) and J(CO2 max)) and efficiency (Phi CO(2 app)), as well as the content of soluble sugars, were not strongly altered in source leaves, indicating that chlorophyll is not limiting for photoassimilation and suggesting that source strength did not restrict shoot growth. By contrast, shoot sink tissues showed drastically reduced contents of soluble sugars, decreased activities of vacuolar invertases, and a reduced ATP content. These results strongly support a function of cytokinin in regulating shoot sink strength and its reduction may be a cause of the altered shoot phenotype. Roots of cytokinin-deficient plants contained less sugar compared with wild-type. However, this did not negatively affect glycolysis, ATP content, or root development. It is suggested that cytokinin-mediated regulation of the sink strength differs between roots and shoots.
18637162,19,2008,BMC Immunol,Regional variations in Paneth cell antimicrobial peptide expression along the mouse intestinal tract.,BACKGROUND: Enteric antimicrobial peptides secreted from Paneth cells, including alpha-defensins (in mice named cryptdins), are key effector molecules of innate immunity in the small intestine. The importance of Paneth cells alpha-defensins emerged from studies of enteric bacterial infection in genetically modified mice, as well as from recent studies linking reduced levels of these alpha-defensins to Crohn's disease localized to the ileum. However, analysis of expression of Paneth cell alpha-defensins is incomplete. We therefore performed a comprehensive evaluation of the distribution of antimicrobial molecules along the mouse small intestinal tract to identify potential variations in regional expression.RESULTS: In conventionally reared mice, the repertoire of Paneth cell antimicrobials differs between duodenum and ileum. In contrast to the uniform expression of most Paneth cell antimicrobials, both cryptdin 4 and cryptdin-related sequences (CRS) 4C peptides were expressed at progressively increasing amounts (101- and 104-fold, respectively) comparing duodenum and ileum. In tissues other than the small intestine, expression of CRS peptides was noted in thymus and caecum. Most Paneth cell products were also produced in the small intestine of germ-free mice at levels similar to those in controls, however CRS4C and RegIIIgamma had reduced levels in the former (3- and 8-fold, respectively). No significant changes in expression levels of Paneth cell antimicrobial peptides was observed after oral challenge with either Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes, supporting current notions on the constitutive nature of this defensive system.CONCLUSION: The repertoire of antimicrobial peptides changes along the small intestinal tract, and a subset of these molecules are up-regulated upon colonization, but not in response to enteric bacterial pathogens. The changes detected upon colonization suggest that Paneth cell antimicrobial peptides may play an important role in commensal microbial homeostasis, in addition to their proposed role in protection against infection. In addition, the differential expression of CRS4C along the small intestine suggests mechanisms of regulation that are distinct from other Paneth cell derived antimicrobial peptides.
18985691,18,2008,J Orthop Res,BMP-7 protects against progression of cartilage degeneration after impact injury.,In vivo studies were used to characterize a model of cartilage injury leading to osteoarthritis progression in the medial femorotibial joint of sheep. In three subsequent studies, bilateral impact injuries were created and one joint received intraarticular injections of 340 microg of rhBMP-7 protein in a collagen particle carrier while the contralateral knee received the vehicle alone. Sheep were allocated to three groups that received intraarticular injections on day 0 (group A), 21 (group B), or 90 (group C) after experimental knee injury. In each group the, joints were evaluated for signs of osteoarthritis progression 90 days after the last treatment using India ink stained area, OARSI histological scoring, cartilage sGAG content, immunostaining for apoptosis (TUNEL), caspase-3, collagen degradation (Col 2 3/4C short collagen epitope), and the endogenous (pro-) form of BMP-7 protein. Knee joints that received rhBMP-7 immediately after injury had small focal lesions at the injury site that did not progress into the surrounding cartilage. Joints that received BMP-7 3 weeks after injury were improved and had limited progression compared to controls, but joints that received the protein 12 weeks after injury had no statistically significant improvement. These studies suggest that BMP-7 may be chondroprotective after traumatic injury in patients if it is administered within 3 to 4 weeks of the index injury. The mechanism of protection after sublethal injury appeared to be an increased survival of chondrocytes that are able to participate in the repair process.
18972357,18,2008,J Magn Reson Imaging,Enhanced mass on contrast-enhanced breast MR imaging: Lesion characterization using combination of dynamic contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MR images.,PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a combination of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) in characterization of enhanced mass on breast MR imaging and to find the strongest discriminators between carcinoma and benignancy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed consecutive breast MR images in 270 patients; however, 13 lesions in 93 patients were excluded based on our criteria. We analyzed tumor size, shape, margin, internal mass enhancement, kinetic curve pattern, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. We applied univariate and multivariate analyses to find the strongest indicators of malignancy and calculate a predictive probability for malignancy. We added the corresponding categories to these prediction probabilities for malignancy and calculated diagnostic accuracy when we consider category 4b, 4c, and 5 lesions as malignant and category 4a, 3, and 2 lesions as benign. In a validation study, 75 enhancing lesions in 71 patients were examined consecutively.RESULTS: Irregular margin, heterogeneous internal enhancement, rim enhancement, plateau time-intensity curve (TIC) pattern, and washout TIC pattern were the strongest indicators of malignancy as well as past studies, and ADC values less than 1.1x10(-3) mm2/s were also the strongest indicators of malignancy. In a validation study, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 92% (56/61), 86% (12/14), 97% (56/58), 71% (12/17), and 91% (68/75), respectively.CONCLUSION: The combination of DWI and DCE-MRI could produce high diagnostic accuracy in the characterization of enhanced mass on breast MR imaging.
18468869,16,2008,J Physiol Paris,fMRI evidence for word association and situated simulation in conceptual processing.,The LASS theory proposes that Language and Situated Simulation both play central roles in conceptual processing. Depending on stimuli and task conditions, different mixtures of language and simulation occur. When a word is processed in a conceptual task, it first activates other linguistic forms, such as word associates. More slowly, the word activates a situated simulation to represent its meaning in neural systems for perception, action, and mental states. An fMRI experiment tested the LASS account. In a first scanning session, participants performed the property generation task to provide a measure of conceptual processing. In a second scanning session a week later, participants performed two localizer tasks measuring word association and situated simulation. Conjunction analyses supported predictions of the LASS theory. Activations early in conceptual processing overlapped with activations for word association. Activations late in conceptual processing overlapped with activations for situation generation. These results, along with others in the literature, indicate that conceptual processing uses multiple representations, not one. Furthermore, researchers must be careful drawing conclusions about conceptual processing, given that different paradigms are likely to produce different mixtures of language and simulation. Whereas some paradigms produce high levels of linguistic processing and low levels of simulation, other paradigms produce the opposite pattern.
18751433,14,2008,Anticancer Res,Pregnancy and post-partum breast cancer: a prospective study.,BACKGROUND: The concomitant occurrence of breast cancer and pregnancy remains a challenging clinical situation combining ethical and medical problems. There are few prospective data on pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) whose incidence continuously increases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with PABC were compared with 61 non-pregnant, age-matched patients with infiltrative breast carcinomas (BC) diagnosed and followed since 1982.RESULTS: Although PABC and BC tumor size, grade and type, and lymphovascular and lymphnode invasion were similar, the BC cases showed better overall--(p=0.0001) and disease-free (p-0.015) survival. Moreover, the outcome of pregnant patients was worse than post-partum patients (p=0.017). Importantly, the number of PABC patients receiving hormonotherapy was lower than the BC patients (p&lt;0.0004), due to lower estrogen receptor (ER) (p=0.038) and progesterone receptor (PR) (p=0.008) immunohisto-chemical (IH) levels. Retrospective estrogen-regulated pS2/trefoil factor 1 (pS2/TFF1) immunohistochemitry showed no difference between PABC and BC. All the children delivered were healthy.CONCLUSION: Pregnancy and the post-partum period increase breast cancer aggressiveness, pregnancy being the most detrimental. PABC hormone-dependence is under-estimated using ER and PR, and pS2/TFF1 might help in its determination. Appropriate treatment does not impair child outcome.
18972350,11,2008,J Magn Reson Imaging,Effective motion-sensitizing magnetization preparation for black blood magnetic resonance imaging of the heart.,PURPOSE: To investigate the effectiveness of flow signal suppression of a motion-sensitizing magnetization preparation (MSPREP) sequence and to optimize a 2D MSPREP steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence for black blood imaging of the heart.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a flow phantom, the effect of varying field of speed (FOS), b-value, voxel size, and flow pattern on the flow suppression was investigated. In seven healthy volunteers, black blood images of the heart were obtained at 1.5T with MSPREP-SSFP and double inversion recovery fast spin echo (DIR-FSE) techniques. Myocardium and blood signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and myocardium-to-blood contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured. The optimal FOS that maximized the CNR for MSPREP-SSFP was determined.RESULTS: Phantom data demonstrated that the flow suppression was induced primarily by the velocity encoding effect. In humans, FOS=10-20 cm/s was found to maximize the CNR for short-axis (SA) and four-chamber (4C) views. Compared to DIR-FSE, MSPREP-SSFP provided similar blood SNR efficiency in the SA basal and mid-views and significantly lower blood SNR efficiency in the SA apical (P=0.02) and 4C (P=0.01) views, indicating similar or better blood suppression.CONCLUSION: Velocity encoding is the primary flow suppression mechanism of the MSPREP sequence and 2D MSPREP-SSFP black blood imaging of the heart is feasible in healthy subjects.
18751429,11,2008,Anticancer Res,Predictive markers of radiation pneumonitis.,Radiation pneumonitis is an acute-phase response to radiation therapy and a common complication that affects a patient's quality of life. Under the need to reduce the incidence and severity of radiation-induced pulmonary complications as well as to identify patients at risk, several investigations on potential predictive markers of radiation pneumonitis have been conducted. The present study reviews the currently available knowledge on biomolecules of potential predictive value for radiation pneumonitis.
18258622,11,2008,Am J Clin Nutr,Ability of new octapolar bioimpedance spectroscopy analyzers to predict 4-component-model percentage body fat in Hispanic, black, and white adults.,BACKGROUND: New, vertical, 8-electrode bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) analyzers provide detailed body-composition and nutritional information within 2 min. This is the first report on BIS's accuracy in predicting relative fatness [percentage body fat (%BF)] in a heterogeneous sample according to a multicomponent model criterion.OBJECTIVE: We compared %BF measurements from 2 BIS devices with those from a multicomponent model in a sample of Hispanic, black, and white adults.DESIGN: Equal numbers of apparently healthy men and women (n = 75 of each) from each racial-ethnic group, diverse in body mass index and age, volunteered. Reference %BF (%BF(4C)) was computed by using a 4-component (4C) model with total bone mineral content obtained from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, body density from underwater weighing with measured residual lung volume, and total body water from traditional BIS. Estimations from InBody 720 (%BF(720)) and InBody 320 (%BF(320)) BIS analyzers were validated against %BF(4C).RESULTS: The %BF(720) (r = 0.85, SEE = 5.19%BF) and %BF(320) (r = 0.84, SEE = 5.17%BF) correlations were significant (P &lt; 0.05) in the men; main effects were nonsignificant. Correlations for %BF(720) (r = 0.88, SEE = 4.85%BF) and %BF(320) (r = 0.89, SEE = 4.82%BF) also were significant in the women (P &lt; 0.05); there was a main effect for method but not race-ethnicity. There were no sex-specific overestimations or underestimations at the extremes of the distributions.CONCLUSIONS: BIS estimates of %BF(4C) were well correlated in men and women. There were no significant methodologic differences in the men. The %BF(4C) was significantly underestimated by %BF(720) and %BF(320) in the women.
18751408,10,2008,Anticancer Res,CYP1A2 164 A--&gt;C polymorphism, cigarette smoking, consumption of well-done red meat and risk of developing colorectal adenomas and carcinomas.,BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes may modify the association of environmental exposure on colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma risk.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety-eight CRC cases, 422 adenomas (206 low-risk and 216 high-risk adenomas) and 222 controls were genotyped for the CYP1A2 164 A--&gt;C polymorphism and questionnaires were used to assess environmental exposure.RESULTS: The smoking parameter &quot;current smoking&quot; was significantly associated with CRC risk, and all the smoking parameters related to current smoking, having ever smoked or high numbers of cigarette years were significantly associated with risk of adenomas. No association was detected between red meat consumption or how well red meat was cooked and colorectal carcinogenesis. When stratifying the case groups based on CYP1A2 genotype, all the smoking parameters yielded stronger risk association in carriers of the C allele.CONCLUSION: These findings may indicate that the association between cigarette smoking and colorectal carcinogenesis can be modified by the CYP1A2 genotype.
18414058,10,2008,Cell Cycle,Cyclin B1 is rate limiting but not essential for mitotic entry and progression in mammalian somatic cells.,Cyclin B1 should have some rate limiting function for cell cycle progression. To test this, we measured the effect of siRNA-mediated depletion of cyclin B1 on mitotic entry and timing. We depleted cyclin B1 in HeLa and hTert-RPE1 cells to levels equivalent or below those achieved in the telophase-to-G(1) window. Average cyclin B1/Cdk1 activity was measured in HeLa cells and depleted by approximately 99%. In both cell lines, this caused approximately 20% increase in the G(2) and approximately 20% increase the M traverse time. However, co-depletion of cyclin B1 and B2 induced a profound increase in G(2) cells, a dramatic reduction in mitotic cells, and an increase in a 4C cycling population. We conclude that any residual levels of cyclin B1 were not sufficient to promote stable mitotic entry and transition in absence of normal levels of cyclin B2. Therefore, we conclude that B cyclin is necessary for mitosis but cyclin B1 is not. Nocodazole treated, cyclin B1-depleted HeLa cells arrested but exited that arrest at higher rates than controls, suggesting that the duration of the spindle checkpoint was affected. In B1 depleted cells, population growth was delayed but evidence of cell death was not consistently observed. A strong phenotype of mitotic chromosomal aberration was observed in HeLa cells depleted for either cyclin but not in RPE cells. In B1 or B2 depleted cells, maloriented chromosomes at metaphase were increased 10 fold and one third of affected metaphase cells entered anaphase without congression. Lagging chromosomes at anaphase were dramatically increased. The aggregate evidence from our study and others suggests that the common effect of cyclin B1 depletion is mild cell cycle perturbation. Lack of uniformity in other phenotypes suggest that these are low penetrance effects that are exacerbated or compensated in some systems by other mechanisms.
18212630,9,2008,Transplantation,A new T-cell receptor transgenic model of the CD4+ direct pathway: level of priming determines acute versus chronic rejection.,BACKGROUND: T-cell receptor transgenic (TCR-tg) mouse models with direct CD4 alloreactivity will help elucidate mechanisms of transplant rejection and tolerance in vivo. Although such models exist, they are limited by unusual strain combinations or are based on model antigens.METHODS: A TCR-tg mouse with direct CD4 specificity in the widely used BALB/c donor --&gt; C57BL/6 host strain combination was created. This TCR-tg mouse, named 4C, was selected for reactivity against BALB/c dendritic cells in order to model early priming events after transplantation. The response of 4C T cells to skin and heart transplants were characterized.RESULTS: The alloantigen is restricted by I-A and appears to be widely distributed in mouse tissues. 4C T cells are able to acutely reject skin but not heart allografts. Paradoxically, heart grafts elicited a stronger proliferation and effector function of TCR-tg T cells than skin grafts. 4C T cells caused cardiac allograft vasculopathy in the absence of other T cells and alloantibodies, suggesting a role for the direct pathway in chronic rejection. Augmentation of priming with an infusion of donor-derived dendritic cells resulted in acute heart allograft rejection by 4C T cells, demonstrating that the level of priming can play a role in determining acute versus chronic rejection by the CD4 direct pathway.CONCLUSIONS: Rejection of a graft by the direct CD4 pathway is determined by graft susceptibility to rejection, as well as the degree of T-cell priming caused by the graft. Grafts that are not acutely rejected can develop transplant vasculopathy mediated by the direct CD4 T cells.
18396212,8,2008,Hum Immunol,Association studies of CTLA-4, CD28, and ICOS gene polymorphisms with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the Polish population.,Abnormal expression of the costimulatory molecules cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), CD28, and inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) leads to disturbances of immune response and an increased risk of cancer. An extended study was undertaken to evaluate the association among the polymorphisms CTLA-4c.49A&gt;G, CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T, CTLA-4g.*642AT(8_33), CD28c.17+3T&gt;C, and ICOSc.1554+4GT(8_15) and susceptibility to B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) in the Polish population. The study revealed increased frequency of the CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T [T] allele and the CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T [T] phenotype in B-CLL patients compared with healthy controls (p = 0.003, odds ratio [OR] = 1.73; and p = 0.009, OR = 1.74, respectively). The presence of the CD28c.17+3T&gt;C [C] allele and the CD28c.17+3T&gt;C [C] phenotype increased the OR of B-CLL to 1.59 (p = 0.007) and 1.74 (p = 0.007), respectively. Either CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T or CD28c.17+3T&gt;C was associated with time to Rai stage progression. The distributions of the alleles and genotypes of the ICOS gene significantly differed between patients and controls (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.006, respectively). Individuals possessing short alleles were 2.02 times more prone to B-CLL than others (p = 0.001), whereas carriers of long alleles were protected from B-CLL (p = 0.02, OR = 0.62). The haplotype association study and multivariate analysis confirmed the association of CTLA-4g.319C&gt;T and ICOSc.1554+4GT(8_15) gene polymorphisms with B-CLL. The polymorphic sites CTLA-4c.49A&gt;G and CTLA-4g.*642AT(8_33) did not correlate with B-CLL. Our results are the first in the literature to report that gene polymorphism of the costimulatory molecules CTLA-4, CD28, and ICOS contributes to susceptibility to B-CLL.
18981608,7,2008,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo),Synthesis, structure analysis and cytotoxicity studies of novel unsymmetrically n,n'-substituted ureas from dehydroabietic Acid.,A series of novel unsymmetrically N,N'-substituted ureas were synthesized from dehydroabietic acid and their structures were characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Three six-membered rings of urea 4c exhibited plane, half-chair and chair configurations, respectively. Their cytotoxicity activities against SMMC7721 liver cancer cells were evaluated by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) method. The results showed that the title compounds exhibited highly effective cytotoxicity activities against SMMC7721 cells. Their IC50 values are between 8.8 and 14.2 micromol/l. The change of N' substituted groups resulted little difference to the cytotoxicity activities of ureas, which indicated that the cytotoxicity of this kind of ureas depend strongly on the tricyclic hydrophenanthrene structure.
18751441,7,2008,Anticancer Res,Nutrient patterns and risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus: a factor analysis in uruguay.,BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is a common disease, with an age-standardized incidence rate of 55 cases per 100,000 persons in the northern counties of Uruguay. These rates are comparable to those observed in Iran and China.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to contribute to the clarification of the etiology of this lethal disease, a case-control study which included 234 cases and 936 controls, frequency matched for age, sex and residence, was conducted. Factor analysis (principal components) was conducted on the controls and three factors were retained, high-fat, carbohydrates and antioxidants. These nutrient patterns were submitted to multiple logistic unconditional regression in order to estimate the odds ratios of esophageal cancer.RESULTS: The nutrient patterns (labeled as high-fat, carbohydrates and antioxidants) were significantly associated with the risk of esophageal squamous cell cancer. Whereas the high-fat and carbohydrates patterns were directly associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer, the antioxidants pattern was strongly protective (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23-0.66).CONCLUSION: In squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus an antioxidant dietary pattern is protective, probably due to its action against oxidative stress while high-fat and carbohydrates patterns are associated with an increased risk which may be due to the meat and sodium content, respectively.
18751440,7,2008,Anticancer Res,Expression of NLRP7 (PYPAF3, NALP7) protein in endometrial cancer tissues.,BACKGROUND: Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing family, pyrin domain-containing 7 (NLRP7) (pyrin-containing apoptotic protease activating factor-1-like protein 3; PYPAF3, NACHT domain-, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing 7; NALP7) has been thought to contribute to innate immunity and inflammation. Although expression of NLRP7 in human seminoma tissues and several cancer cell lines has been demonstrated, the pathophysiological and prognostic importance in cancer tissues has not been defined.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A series of 70 endometrial cancer cases that had undergone curative resection was studied to determine the correlation between NLRP7 expression and clinico-pathological characteristics in human endometrial cancer tissue. Tissue specimens were evaluated for NLRP7 by immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: NLRP7 expression was positive in cancer cells in 7 cases (10%). There was a statistical relationship between the depth of tumor invasion and NLRP7 expression (p=0.0326). NLRP7 expression showed a trend for being associated with poor prognosis.CONCLUSION: Tumor-produced NLRP7, associated with myometrial invasion, might provide additional prognostic information in endometrial cancer patients.
18751431,7,2008,Anticancer Res,Influence of valproic acid on outcome of high-grade gliomas in children.,BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy has limited effects in the treatment of high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, may sensitize HGGs to radiochemotherapy. As the drug has been given frequently as an antiepileptic drug, a retrospective analysis was conducted to ensure relevant information was not missed before a prospective study was launched.MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analysis of 66 pediatric patients (range, 1-19 years of age) with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (n=40) or anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) (n=26) was retrospectively conducted for predictors of survival and response and for effects of VPA on outcome or toxicity.RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) was better for AA (p=0.0114) and complete resection (p&lt;0.00005) and event-free survival (EFS) was better for complete resection (p=0.0049). Nine patients received VPA (for seizure) plus further oncological treatment. The most severe adverse effect was a pulmonary embolism (n=1); no other severe side-effects were noted. The response to nonsurgical treatment after 8 weeks was: complete response (CR): 0, partial response (PR): 3, stable disease (SD): 4, progressive disease (PD): 2. Some of the patients with SD responded later resulting in best response: CR:0, PR:5, SD:2, PD:2.CONCLUSION: Treatment with VPA plus radiochemotherapy is well tolerated with an encouraging response rate.
18649323,7,2008,J Med Virol,High prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection and predominance of genotype 4 in rural Gabon.,Hepatitis C (HCV) molecular epidemiology is documented poorly in central African countries. In response to this, a population-based study of 319 consenting adults resident in a remote village of Gabon was undertaken (mean age: 38 years; age range: 13-85+; sex ratio: 0.74). Screening for anti-HCV antibodies was performed using ELISA and recombinant immunoblot assay. Seropositive samples were assessed further with viral load and genotyping techniques. Sixty-six (20.7%) individuals were HCV seropositive. Viral loads ranged from 600 to 24.9 million IU/ml (median: 372,500). Seroprevalence and viral loads increased significantly with age (P &lt; 10(-5) and P &lt; 0.003, respectively). HCV sequences of the 5'UTR genome region were obtained from 60 (90.9%) samples and NS5B region sequences were obtained from 22 (36.6%) samples. All strains belonged to subtypes of genotype 4: 4e (72.7%), 4c (13.6%), 4p (4.5%), 4r (4.5%) and one unclassified genotype 4 strain. Evolutionary analysis of the subtype 4e sequences indicates a period of raised transmission during the early twentieth century.
18632269,7,2008,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Discovery of piperidine-aryl urea-based stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 inhibitors.,A series of structurally novel stearoyl-CoA desaturase1 (SCD1) inhibitors has been identified via molecular scaffold manipulation. Preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies led to the discovery of potent, and orally bioavailable piperidine-aryl urea-based SCD1 inhibitors. 4-(2-Chlorophenoxy)-N-[3-(methyl carbamoyl)phenyl]piperidine-1-carboxamide 4c exhibited robust in vivo activity with dose-dependent desaturation index lowering effects.
18751412,6,2008,Anticancer Res,Complete response after imatinib mesylate administration in a patient with chemoresistant stage IV seminoma.,The case of a young man with stage IV chemoresistant pure seminoma overexpressing KIT, who achieved complete remission (CR) after the administration of imatinib mesylate (400 mg once daily), along with a third-line chemotherapy regimen, consisting of paclitaxel (150 mg/m2), oxaliplatin (100 mg/m2) and gemcitabine (800 mg/m2) every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support is reported. The patient had received first- and second-line regimens consisting of ifosfamide, bleomycin, etoposide cisplatin (5 cycles, every 3 weeks) and methotrexate, vinblastine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin (3 cycles, every 3 weeks) respectively, without having normalized beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-HCG) levels. Following treatment with imatinib plus third-line chemotherapy (paclitaxel, oxaliplatin, gemcitabine), the levels of beta-HCG were reduced to within the normal limits during the first month of treatment. Therefore, the patient underwent surgical resection of the residual disease from the retroperitoneum and liver, which proved to be only necrotic tissue. The patient is under close follow-up, with no evidence of disease, 36 months after the completion of chemotherapy and 32 months post surgery.
18559087,6,2008,BMC Infect Dis,Hepatitis C virus prevalence and genetic diversity among pregnant women in Gabon, central Africa.,BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global public health problem in both developed and developing countries. The prevalence and genetic diversity of HCV in pregnant women in Gabon, central Africa, is not known. We therefore evaluated the prevalence and the circulating genotypes of HCV in a large population cohort of pregnant women.METHODS: Blood samples (947) were collected from pregnant women in the five main cities of the country. The prevalence was evaluated by two ELISA tests, and the circulating genotypes were characterized by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.RESULTS: Twenty pregnant women (2.1%) were infected with HCV. The seroprevalence differed significantly by region (p = 0.004) and increased significantly with age (p = 0.05), being 1.3% at 14-20 years, 1.1% at 21-25 years, 1.9% at 26-30 years, 4.1% at 31-35 years and 6.0% at &gt; 35 years. Sequencing in the 5'-UTR and NS5B regions showed that the circulating strains belonged to genotypes 4 (4e and 4c).CONCLUSION: We found that the HCV seroprevalence in pregnant women in Gabon is almost as high as that in other African countries and increases with age. Furthermore, only genotype 4 (4e and 4c) was found. More extensive studies aiming to evaluate the prevalence and heterogeneity of HCV genotypes circulating in the general population of the country are needed.
18499583,6,2008,Protein Sci,Crystal structures of Melanocarpus albomyces cellobiohydrolase Cel7B in complex with cello-oligomers show high flexibility in the substrate binding.,Cellobiohydrolase from Melanocarpus albomyces (Cel7B) is a thermostable, single-module, cellulose-degrading enzyme. It has relatively low catalytic activity under normal temperatures, which allows structural studies of the binding of unmodified substrates to the native enzyme. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of native Ma Cel7B free and in complex with three different cello-oligomers: cellobiose (Glc(2)), cellotriose (Glc(3)), and cellotetraose (Glc(4)), at high resolution (1.6-2.1 A). In each case, four molecules were found in the asymmetric unit, which provided 12 different complex structures. The overall fold of the enzyme is characteristic of a glycoside hydrolase family 7 cellobiohydrolase, where the loops extending from the core beta-sandwich structure form a long tunnel composed of multiple subsites for the binding of the glycosyl units of a cellulose chain. The catalytic residues at the reducing end of the tunnel are conserved, and the mechanism is expected to be retaining similarly to the other family 7 members. The oligosaccharides in different complex structures occupied different subsite sets, which partly overlapped and ranged from -5 to +2. In four cellotriose and one cellotetraose complex structures, the cello-oligosaccharide also spanned over the cleavage site (-1/+1). There were surprisingly large variations in the amino acid side chain conformations and in the positions of glycosyl units in the different cello-oligomer complexes, particularly at subsites near the catalytic site. However, in each complex structure, all glycosyl residues were in the chair (4C(1)) conformation. Implications in relation to the complex structures with respect to the reaction mechanism are discussed.
18436277,6,2008,Hum Pathol,Biopsy histomorphometry predicts uterine myoinvasion by endometrial carcinoma: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.,A barrier to nonsurgical management of premalignant endometrial disease is the need to perform hysterectomy to exclude concurrent myoinvasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Occult adenocarcinoma rates for premalignant disease diagnosed by biopsy or curettage are approximately 40%. We applied the histomorphometric 4-class rule (&quot;4C,&quot; which measures epithelial abundance, thickness, and nuclear variation) to diagnostic biopsies to predict myoinvasive cancer outcomes at hysterectomy. Women with endometrial biopsies or curettages having a community diagnosis of atypical endometrial hyperplasia were enrolled in a clinical trial in which subsequent hysterectomy was scored for endometrial adenocarcinoma, and 4C rule ability to predict cancer outcomes was measured. Qualifying biopsies were stratified into high- and low-risk histomorphometric subgroups. Two-hundred thirty-three women had biopsies suited to morphometry and scorable hysterectomy outcomes, of which 46% contained adenocarcinoma. Assignment to a high-risk category by the 4C rule was highly sensitive in predicting any (71%) or deeply (92%) myoinvasive adenocarcinoma at hysterectomy, and assignment to a low-risk group had a high negative predictive value for absence of any (90%) or deeply (99%) myoinvasive disease. Volume percentage epithelium was associated with myoinvasive cancer outcomes above a threshold of 50% (P &lt; .001), and a measure of nuclear pleomorphism was significantly increased (P = .004) in deeply myoinvasive cancers. Formal histomorphometry of endometrial biopsies using the 4C rule has been validated as a means to identify a subset of women with premalignant disease who are unlikely to have concurrent myoinvasive adenocarcinoma and who may qualify for alternative nonsurgical therapies.
19041296,5,2008,Chem Biol Interact,Inactivation by omeprazole of the carnitine transporter (OCTN2) reconstituted in liposomes.,The effect of omeprazole on the carnitine (OCTN2) transporter reconstituted in liposomes has been studied. Omeprazole externally added to the proteoliposomes, inhibited the carnitine/carnitine antiport catalysed by the reconstituted transporter. The inhibition was partially reversed by DTE indicating that it was caused by the covalent reaction of omeprazole with Cys residue(s) of the transporter. Similar results were found with intact brush border vesicles. The residual inhibition of the transport in the presence of DTE, indicated the occurrence of an alternative inhibition mechanism of non-covalent nature. The IC(50) of the two inhibition modes derived from dose-response curves, were 5.7 microM and 20.4 microM, respectively. Kinetic studies of the inhibition showed that in the absence of DTE omeprazole behaved as non-competitive inhibitor. On the contrary, in the presence of DTE competitive inhibition was found. The K(i) of the transporter for the inhibitor was 5.2 microM or 14.6 microM in the absence or presence of DTE, i.e., under condition of covalent (non-competitive) or non-covalent (competitive) interaction of the inhibitor with the transporter. The presence of the substrate during the incubation of the omeprazole (in the absence of DTE) with the proteoliposomes facilitated the covalent reaction of the pharmacological compound with the transporter. Omeprazole did not inhibit when present in the internal proteoliposomal compartment, indicating that the inhibition was specifically due to interaction with external site(s) of the protein. The pharmacological compound was not transported by the reconstituted transporter. The possible in vivo implications of the interaction of omeprazole with the transporter are discussed.
19028313,5,2008,Food Microbiol,Molecular characteristics and virulence potential of Listeria monocytogenes isolates from Chinese food systems.,In this study, we examined Listeria monocytogenes isolates from Chinese food sources in an attempt to gain further insights on the molecular characteristics and virulence potential of this important foodborne pathogen. Of the 88 L. monocytogenes food isolates recovered, 42 (47.7%) were of serovars 1/2a or 3a; 23 (26.1%) of serovars 1/2b or 3b; 15 (17.0%) of 1/2c or 3c; 6 (6.8%) of serovars 4b, 4d or 4e; and 2 (2.2%) of serovars 4a or 4c. In contrast to inlAB locus conserved in all serovars, internalin cluster between ascB and dapE varies with different serovars, with inlC2DE, inlGC2DE and inlGHE predominantly in serovars 1/2b or 4b, serovar 1/2a and serovar 1/2c. While inlF existed in all the inlGHE- and inlGC2DE-containing isolates but 17.4% of those having inlC2DE, lmo2026 existed in all the inlGHE-containing isolates but 20.0% of those bearing inlGC2DE, suggesting that inlF might have co-evolved with inlGC2DE and inlGHE while lmo2026 with inlGHE only. With the exception of serovar 4a isolate, most serovar isolates demonstrated remarkable ability to form plaques on L929 cells and produced significant mouse mortality irrespective of the internalin gene organization and whether an intact actA gene is present or not. These results indicate that majority of these food isolates may have the potential to cause human diseases if ingested via contaminated foods. Given that serovar 4b accounts for nearly half of human clinical listeriosis cases documented, the relative low proportion of serovar 4b food isolates suggests that this serovar is probably more tolerant of the adverse conditions in the host's stomach and/or more efficient in entering host cells than serovars 1/2a, 1/2b and 1/2c.
18958919,5,2008,J Perinat Med,Premature labor: a state of platelet activation?,OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine whether premature labor is associated with changes in the maternal plasma concentration of soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), a marker of platelet activation.METHODS: A cross-sectional study included patients in the following groups: 1) non-pregnant (n=21); 2) normal pregnancy (n=71); 3) normal pregnancy at term with (n=67) and without labor (n=88); 4) preterm labor (PTL) with intact membranes (n=136) that was divided into the following sub-groups: 4a) PTL who delivered at term (n=49); 4b) PTL without intra-amniotic infection and/or inflammation (IAI) who delivered preterm (n=54); and 4c) PTL with IAI who delivered preterm (n=33). sCD40L concentrations were measured by ELISA.RESULTS: The median maternal plasma sCD40L concentration was higher in pregnant than non-pregnant women (P=0.017). Patients with PTL had a higher median maternal plasma sCD40L concentration than women with normal pregnancies, regardless of the presence or absence of IAI and gestational age at delivery (P&lt;0.001 for all comparisons). IAI was not associated with a higher median maternal plasma concentration of sCD40L.CONCLUSIONS: Normal pregnancy is a state in which there is a physiologic increase of sCD40L. PTL was associated with an increased median maternal plasma sCD40L concentration that could not be accounted for by IAI. Thus, our findings suggest that platelet activation occurs during an episode of preterm labor.
18936958,5,2008,Eur J Appl Physiol,Estimating body fat in NCAA Division I female athletes: a five-compartment model validation of laboratory methods.,The purpose of the present study was to determine the validity of various laboratory methods for estimating percent body fat (%fat) in NCAA Division I college female athletes (n = 29; 20 +/- 1 year). Body composition was assessed via hydrostatic weighing (HW), air displacement plethysmography (ADP), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and estimates of %fat derived using 4-compartment (C), 3C, and 2C models were compared to a criterion 5C model that included bone mineral content, body volume (BV), total body water, and soft tissue mineral. The Wang-4C and the Siri-3C models produced nearly identical values compared to the 5C model (r &gt; 0.99, total error (TE) &lt; 0.40%fat). For the remaining laboratory methods, constant error values (CE) ranged from -0.04%fat (HW-Siri) to -3.71%fat (DXA); r values ranged from 0.89 (ADP-Siri, ADP-Brozek) to 0.93 (DXA); standard error of estimate values ranged from 1.78%fat (DXA) to 2.19%fat (ADP-Siri, ADP-Brozek); and TE values ranged from 2.22%fat (HW-Brozek) to 4.90%fat (DXA). The limits of agreement for DXA (-10.10 to 2.68%fat) were the largest with a significant trend of -0.43 (P &lt; 0.05). With the exception of DXA, all of the equations resulted in acceptable TE values (&lt;3.08%fat). However, the results for individual estimates of %fat using the Brozek equation indicated that the 2C models that derived BV from ADP and HW overestimated (5.38, 3.65%) and underestimated (5.19, 4.88%) %fat, respectively. The acceptable TE values for both HW and ADP suggest that these methods are valid for estimating %fat in college female athletes; however, the Wang-4C and Siri-3C models should be used to identify individual estimates of %fat in this population.
18751435,5,2008,Anticancer Res,Cetuximab with hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases.,BACKGROUND: Both hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of chemotherapy and cetuximab (CET) have interesting activity for the treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRC-LM).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Intravenous CET with HAI oxaliplatin (OXA) or i.v. Irinotecan (IRI) followed by HAI of infusion of folic acid modulated 5-fluorouracil 5-FU/l-FA was administered to patients (pts) with CRC-LM who had failed at least one line of prior chemotherapy.RESULTS: Eight pts received i.v. CET with HAI-OXA (5 pts) and i.v.-IRI (3 pts) and HAI-5-FU/l-FA. Adverse events: repeated grade 3 skin toxicity (1 pt), abdominal pain with elevated liver enzymes and asthenia (2 pts), duodenal ulcer (2 pts) with catheter migration and intestinal bleeding (1 pt), reversible interstitial pneumonitis (1 pt), and cystic bile duct dilatation (2 pts) with arteriobiliary fistulisation (1 pt). A partial response was documented in 5 pts (62%). The median time to progression was 8.7 months (95% confidence interval 8-14 months).CONCLUSION: Intravenous administration of CET with HAI of chemotherapy is feasible and has promising activity but is associated with specific toxicity.
18751411,5,2008,Anticancer Res,Huge primary retroperitoneal mucinous cystadenoma of borderline malignancy mimicking an ovarian mass: case report and review.,BACKGROUND: Primary retroperitoneal mucinous cystadenoma is a rare tumor only 48 cases have been reported in international literature. Patients affected by primary retroperitoneal mucinous cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma ranged in age from 17 to 86 years (median, 42.3 years) and the size of the cystis ranged from 5 to 35 cm (median, 16.1 cm). There is no unanimous opinion on the genesis of these tumors and, due to their extreme rarity, its histogenesis, biological behavior and the optimal management strategy remain at a speculative level.CASE REPORT: We report the case of a huge borderline primary retroperitoneal mucinous cystadenoma (24 x 25 cm) in a 35-year-old woman and the strategies adopted for the diagnosis and surgical management.CONCLUSION: Primary mucinous cystic tumor of the retroperitoneum was correctly diagnosed only at the time of surgery. As well as in the majority of cases reported in the literature, preoperative investigations were not able to give information about the tumor site. In spite of the short follow-up (two years), the patient's favorable course supports the hypothesis that primary retroperitoneal mucinous cystadenoma may be treated in the same manner as a primary ovarian tumor of the same grade and comparable stage.
18626432,5,2008,Ann Hepatol,Genotyping of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in infected patients from Northeast Mexico.,Information about HCV genotypes in infected patients from different regions of Mexico is limited.</AbstractText>: Information about HCV genotypes in infected patients from different regions of Mexico is limited.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of HCV genotypes in a group of HCV infected patients who attended a third level Hospital in Northeast of Mexico.METHODS: Genotyping analysis was performed using the InnoLiPA-HCV genotype assay in 147 patients (65 males and 82 females, mean age 44 +/- 12 years) with positive anti-HCV antibodies and detectable HCV-RNA levels.RESULTS: Infected individuals were more likely to be female (56%). Histological data showed that 63% of the patients had chronic hepatitis, while the remainder presented cirrhosis (37%). The most frequent HCV genotype was 1 (73%). We found the following distribution: genotype 1 (2.7%), 1a (28.6%), 1b (37.4%), 1a/1b (4.1%), 2a (1.4%), 2b (8.8%), 2c (0.7%), 2a/2c (2.7%), 3 (2%), 3a (10.2%), 4 (0.7%) and 4c (0.7%). The most frequent associated risk factor was blood transfusion (72.5%).CONCLUSION: Prevalence of HCV genotypes in the Northeast of Mexico is similar to those reported previously in other Mexican regions and the most frequent risk factor continues being blood transfusion.
18455272,5,2008,Eur J Med Chem,Regioselective synthesis of dispiro[1H-indene-2,3'-pyrrolidine-2',3''-[3H]indole]-1,2''(1''H)-diones of potential anti-tumor properties.,1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition reaction of 2-(arylmethylene)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ones 1a-g with non-stabilized azomethine ylides, generated in situ via decarboxylative condensation of isatins 2a,b and sarcosine (3) afforded dispiro[1H-indene-2,3'-pyrrolidine-2',3''-[3H]indole]-1,2''(1''H)-diones 4a-n and not the isomeric forms dispiro[1H-indene-2,4'-pyrrolidine-2',3''-[3H]indole]-1,2''(1''H)-diones 5 in a highly regioselective manner. Anti-tumor activity screening for the synthesized compounds (4c,d,i-l) at a dose of 10 microM utilizing 56 different human tumor cell lines representing, leukemia, melanoma and cancers of the lung, colon, brain, ovary, breast, prostate and kidney was carried out. All the tested compounds exhibit promising anti-tumor activity against SK-MEL-2 (melanoma) cell line. Anti-inflammatory activity of the prepared compounds was determined in vivo by the acute carrageenan-induced paw oedema in rats. Many of the prepared compounds exhibit considerable anti-inflammatory properties &quot;at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight&quot;, especially 4a and 4m which reveal remarkable activities relative to indomethacin which was used as a reference standard in this study.
18452908,5,2008,Chem Biol Interact,Interaction of beta-lactam antibiotics with the mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter.,The interaction of beta-lactams with the purified mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter reconstituted in liposomes has been studied. Cefonicid, cefazolin, cephalothin, ampicillin, piperacillin externally added to the proteoliposomes, inhibited the carnitine/carnitine antiport catalysed by the reconstituted transporter. The most effective inhibitors were cefonicid and ampicillin with IC50 of 6.8 and 7.6mM, respectively. The other inhibitors exhibited IC50 values above 36 mM. Kinetic analysis performed with cefonicid and ampicillin revealed that the inhibition is completely competitive, i.e., the inhibitors interact with the substrate binding site. The Ki of the transporter is 4.9 mM for cefonicid and 9.9 mM for ampicillin. Cefonicid inhibited the transporter also on its internal side. The IC50 was 12.9 mM indicating that the inhibition was less pronounced than on the external side. Ampicillin and the other inhibitors were much less effective on the internal side. The beta-lactams were not transported by the carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter. Cephalosporins, and at much lower extent penicillins, caused irreversible inhibition of the transporter after prolonged time of incubation. The most effective among the tested antibiotics was cefonicid with IC50 of 0.12 mM after 60 h of incubation. The possible in vivo implications of the interaction of the beta-lactam antibiotics with the transporter are discussed.
18946631,4,2008,Arch Virol,Hepatitis C virus genotypes in two different patient cohorts in Johannesburg, South Africa.,Previous studies in South African patients have shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence is low (2.6%) and genotype 5 is the dominant genotype. This is the first sequence-based genotype study from this country on two different patient groups (haemophiliacs (H) and liver disease (LD) patients) over two time periods (2000-2002 and 2007). Genotype 5 was found to be the dominant genotype in the LD groups, but genotype 1 dominated in the H group. Genotype 2, and a higher prevalence of genotype 3a, was present in the H group when compared to previous South African studies. Genotypes 3 and 4 have been described here in the LD groups for the first time in South Africa, with subtypes 4c and 4g being identified. A separate cluster of genotype 5 sequences were found to have only one adenine at nucleotide position 107 of the 5'UTR, as previously reported. Subtyping in the less conserved NS5B region was used to further characterize the 2000-2002 isolates and validate 5'UTR typing. The study shows that by using reliable methods of genotyping, the prevalence and frequencies of HCV genotypes can be monitored in South Africa for better diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
18596433,4,2008,Neurosurgery,The Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion and comparisons with its predecessors.,OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to introduce a new radiosurgical device, the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion (Elekta Instruments AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Design and performance characteristics are compared with previous models of the gamma knife in a clinical setting.METHODS: Performance-related features in the design of the new radiosurgical system are described, and the ability to create complex shapes of isodose volumes even with a single isocenter is demonstrated. The concept of &quot;dynamic shaping&quot; of dose distribution is introduced as a means of decreasing the exposure to structures outside the target. Dose plans for the Leksell Gamma Knife Models B, 4C, and Perfexion have been created for target pathologies to illustrate how the software and hardware of the new radiosurgical system can increase treatment quality, decrease treatment time, and increase patient comfort. Radiation doses to critical organs in the rest of the human body are compared.RESULTS: The automated collimator arrangement in the Perfexion makes it possible to produce more complex treatment volumes than with previous models of the gamma knife. This results from the enhanced ability to shape isodose volumes, even for single isocenters. The collimator arrangement and the patient positioning system also allow shorter patient transit times, reducing unwanted radiation exposure during movement between isocenters.CONCLUSION: The Perfexion exceeds the capabilities of previous gamma knife models in terms of treatment efficiency, conformity, and radiation protection. These qualities enable treatment of larger target volumes, especially close to eloquent areas. Pathologies previously inaccessible in the head and neck are now treatable due to the increased volume of the radiation cavity.
18751432,4,2008,Anticancer Res,Value of procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide in patients with renal cell carcinoma.,BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate whether the bone turnover marker procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) could be useful for the early detection of bone metastases in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and if chemotherapy influences P1NP concentrations in patients with bone metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples of 36 patients were analyzed using a specific immunoassay. The patients were divided into three groups: 24 patients without metastatic spread, 6 patients with untreated bone metastases and 6 patients who had received sorafenib.RESULTS: The P1NP concentration was significantly higher (p&lt; or =0.001) in the patients with bone metastases (median: 396.10 ng/ml) than in those without bone involvement (median: 35.53 ng/ml). The patients treated with sorafenib showed levels within the normal range (median: 28.96 ng/ml).CONCLUSION: P1NP is a significant diagnostic marker for the development of bone metastases in patients with RCC and could help to evaluate the progress of chemotherapy.
18751419,4,2008,Anticancer Res,A complete remission of sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma with multiple lung and bone metastases treated with multi-agent chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT): a case report.,A case of sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in a young adult with multiple lung and skip bone metastases is reported. Complete remission was achieved with this patient by treatment with multi-agent chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) based on the pathological diagnosis of RMS using a specimen obtained during an open biopsy at the first consultation. He is still alive and has been continuously disease free for 12 years after surgery. This is a very rare case with successful treatment using PBSCT for a sclerosing RMS that presented with multiple distant metastases at the first consultation.
18751407,4,2008,Anticancer Res,Comparison of the prognostic value of a panel of tissue tumor markers and established clinicopathological factors in patients with gastric cancer.,AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess if the addition of a panel of tumor markers to established clinicopathological factors could improve the accuracy of 5-year outcome prediction in gastric cancer. The studied markers were chosen to represent different aspects of tumor biology.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of syndecan-1, tenascin-C, tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor (TATI), p53, p21 and bcl-2 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry informalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from 337 patients with gastric cancer. In addition, the DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) were assessed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: The loss of epithelial syndecan-1, strong stromal syndecan-1, the loss of stromal tenascin-C, the loss of tumor tissue TATI, high p53 and high p21 expression, aneuploidy and high (&gt; or =7.6%) SPF were all associated with an unfavorable prognosis in univariate survival analysis. In multivariate survival analysis, p53 (hazard ratio (HR) 1.58; confidence interval (CI) 95% 1.16-2.16), p21 (HR 1.67; CI 95% 1.09-2.56) and DNA ploidy (HR 1.50; CI 95% 1.10-2.05) were independent prognostic factors, in addition to penetration depth (pT), lymph node status (pN), age at diagnosis and estimated radicality of surgery. The difference in prognostic accuracy between a base model with pT, pN, age and radicality of surgery (area under the curve (AUC) 0.898; CI 95% 0.86-0.94) and an extended model including p53, p21 and DNA ploidy (AUC 0.900; CI 95% 0.86-0.94) was not statistically significant (p=0.85).CONCLUSION: In gastric cancer, p53 and p21 expression, as well as DNA ploidy, are independent prognostic factors in addition to standard clinicopathological factors. However, the established indicators of the extent of disease show an impressively high accuracy in 5-year outcome prediction and adding the examined tumor markers to the base model does not significantly improve the prognostic accuracy.
18287432,4,2008,AJR Am J Roentgenol,Papillary lesions of the breast diagnosed at percutaneous sonographically guided biopsy: comparison of sonographic features and biopsy methods.,OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to retrospectively assess the potential role of sonographic features and biopsy in the management of patients with papillary lesions diagnosed at percutaneous sonographically guided biopsy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical or sonographic follow-up (&gt; or = 2 years) was available in 123 women (age range, 21-75 years; mean age, 47 years) with 124 papillary lesions diagnosed at sonographically guided core needle or vacuum-assisted biopsy during a 7-year period. Surgical excision results or follow-up sonograms with no change at the 2-year follow-up served as the reference standard. We reviewed the sonographic features, biopsy results, and surgical or sonographic follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher's exact test for the difference of sonographic features.RESULTS: Cancer incidence per BI-RADS category was as follows: category 3, zero (0%) of 21; category 4a, 14 (17%) of 85; category 4b, four (36%) of 11; category 4c, one (20%) of five; and category 5, one (50%) of two. On sonography, two features distinguishing benign from malignant papillary lesions were echo pattern and margins of masses. Core needle biopsy gave a sensitivity of 28% and specificity of 100%, whereas both sensitivity and specificity were 100% with vacuum-assisted biopsy. Of 117 lesions with benign biopsy results, upgrade to malignancy or high-risk lesion was found in 17% of benign papillomas, 24% of atypical papillomas, and 0% of multiple papillomas.CONCLUSION: Vacuum-assisted biopsy was more accurate than core needle biopsy in diagnosing papillary lesions, and both sonographic features and core needle biopsy were not sufficiently accurate. Therefore, surgical excision should be performed for the accurate diagnosis of papillary lesions.
18266049,4,2008,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,Role of histone methylation in zygotic genome activation in the preimplantation mouse embryo.,Numerous previous studies demonstrated that gene expression was influenced by histone modifications. However, little information is available about the relation of histone methylation with embryonic gene expression. Here, we examine the significance of histone H3 dimethyl-lysine 4 (H3K4me2) during mouse zygotic genome activation (ZGA) by inhibiting demethylation with the specific histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase inhibitor bisguanidine 1c (1c). A 1c treatment of one-cell embryos did not significantly affect the level of eIF-4C transcripts but did affect Oct4 levels by the two-cell stage. Furthermore, 1c treatment significantly inhibited cleavage of the embryos to the four-cell stage (from 82.7% to 18.2%), and the inhibitory effect was identified to be irreversible. These results suggest that histone methylation may be closely correlated with the formation of a transcriptionally repressive state during ZGA and that the repressive state actually dictates the appropriate pattern of gene expression required for further development.
18244943,4,2008,Tree Physiol,Actual and potential transpiration and carbon assimilation in an irrigated poplar plantation.,We examined the tradeoffs between stand-level water use and carbon uptake that result when biomass production of trees in plantations is maximized by removing nutrient and water limitations. A Populus trichocarpa Torr. x P. deltoides Bartr. &amp; Marsh. plantation was irrigated and received frequent additions of nutrients to optimize biomass production. Sap flux density was measured continuously over four of the six growing-season months, supplemented with periodic measurements of leaf gas exchange and water potential. Measurements of tree diameter and height were used to estimate leaf area and biomass production based on allometric relationships. Sap flux was converted to canopy conductance and analyzed with an empirical model to isolate the effects of water limitation. Actual and soil-water-unlimited potential CO(2) uptakes were estimated with a canopy conductance constrained carbon assimilation (4C-A) scheme, which couples actual or potential canopy conductance with vertical gradients of light distribution, leaf-level conductance, maximum Rubisco capacity and maximum electron transport. Net primary production (NPP) was about 43% of gross primary production (GPP); when estimated for individual trees, this ratio was independent of tree size. Based on the NPP/GPP ratio, we found that current irrigation reduced growth by about 18% compared with growth with no water limitation. To achieve maximum growth, however, would require 70% more water for transpiration, and would reduce water-use efficiency by 27%, from 1.57 to 1.15 g stem wood C kg(-1) water. Given the economic and social values of water, plantation managers appear to have optimized water use.

One of the unique dimethyl-formamide solvent mol-ecules is disordered over two sites with occupancies of 0.715 (6) and 0.285 (6). The crystal structure is stabilized by inter-molecular N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds.
19032641,3,2008,Aust Endod J,Time-dependence of coronal seal of temporary materials used in endodontics.,The aim of this in vitro study was to compare parametrically the coronal seal ability over different periods of times of four restorative materials used to seal the pulpal access cavity after endodontic treatment. One hundred and thirty-five mandibular premolars were divided randomly into three time groups (1, 2 and 4 weeks), each of which was in turn divided into four subgroups. Each subgroup was restored using one of four restorative materials: Coltosol, glass ionomer cement (GIC), zinc phosphate (ZP) cement, or intermediate restorative material (IRM) cement. The root canals were prepared using the crown-down technique, and obturated using lateral condensation. Following placement of the restorative material, the samples were incubated in distilled water at 37 degrees C and were subjected to 50 thermocycles (0 +/- 4, 56 +/- 4C). After immersing in (2%) methylene blue dye for 24 h, teeth were longitudinally sectioned and examined under a stereomicroscope. The results showed that Coltosol and GIC cement were significantly superior in sealing ability to ZP and IRM cements (P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between GIC cement and Coltosol. Both Coltosol and GIC after 1 week were significantly better than 4 weeks. There was no significant difference in the seal ability at different time periods when ZP and IRM cements were used.
18834111,3,2008,J Med Chem,Novel D3 selective dopaminergics incorporating enyne units as nonaromatic catechol bioisosteres: synthesis, bioactivity, and mutagenesis studies.,Enynes of type 4 and 5 as long chain derivatives of the nonaromatic dopamine D 3 receptor agonist 3 (FAUC 73) were prepared by exploiting chemoselective functionalization of the azido-substituted vinyl triflate 9. Radioligand binding studies indicated excellent D 3 affinity and selectivity over related GPCRs for the terminal alkynes 4c (FAUC 460) and 5c. Biphasic displacement curves gave picomolar K i values for the high affinity binding site of D 3. According to mitogenesis experiments and bioluminescence based cAMP assays, the biphenylcarboxamide 4c and its click chemistry derived triazole analogue 5c behaved as strong partial agonists but relative ligand efficacy significantly depended on the type of functional assay. Site directed mutagenesis involving the mutants D 3 D3.32E, and D 3 F6.51W implied that ligand interactions with D3.32 and F6.51 are highly crucial, giving rise to analogous binding modes for dopamine, classical and enyne type agonists.
18751428,3,2008,Anticancer Res,Arrest of cell proliferation in budding tumor cells ahead of the invading edge of colonic carcinomas. A preliminary report.,BACKGROUND: Single or small groups of dedifferentiated tumor cells, referred to as tumor budding, may be found ahead of the defined invasive edge of colorectal carcinomas. Tumor budding is claimed to correlate with lymph node metastasis and local recurrence.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sections from six surgically removed invasive colonic carcinomas were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E), MNF 116 (an epithelial marker) and for Ki-67 (a proliferation marker) and four specimens also for laminin-5 (a cell-locomotion marker).RESULTS: In comparative fields, a mean of 86.2 tumor buds (range 60-132) were detected with MNF 116 immunostain, 5.8 tumor buds (mean, range 5-9) with H&amp;E stain, 9.7 tumor buds (range 7-18) with Ki-67 immunostain and 9.3 tumor buds (range 8-12) with laminin-5.CONCLUSION: The majority of the MNF 116-positive budding tumor cells ahead of the invading tumor front were not detected with H&amp;E, or for Ki-67 or laminin-5. Host invasion by budding tumor cells might be activated only after the cell cycle has been switched off (G0).
18718763,3,2008,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis of new sulfonyl pyrrolidine derivatives as matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors.,A series of new sulfonyl pyrrolidine derivatives was designed, synthesized, and assayed for their inhibitory activities on matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and aminopeptidase N (AP-N). The results showed that these pyrrolidine derivatives exhibited highly selective inhibition against MMP-2 as compared with AP-N. The compounds 4c, 4j, 5a, and 5b were equally or more potent MMP-2 inhibitors than the positive control LY52. The FlexX docking was done to explain the reason for the different potency between MMP-2 and AP-N. Structure-activity relationships were also briefly discussed.
18698374,3,2008,PLoS One,Systemic therapy for cervical cancer with potentially regulatable oncolytic adenoviruses.,Clinical trials have confirmed the safety of selectively oncolytic adenoviruses for treatment of advanced cancers. However, increasingly effective viruses could result in more toxicity and therefore it would be useful if replication could be abrogated if necessary. We analyzed viruses containing the cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter for controlling replication. Anti-inflammatory agents can lower Cox-2 protein levels and therefore we hypothesized that also the promoter might be affected. As Cox-2 modulates expression of VEGF, also the VEGF promoter might be controllable. First, we evaluated the effect of anti-inflammatory agents on promoter activity or adenovirus infectivity in vitro. Further, we analyzed the oncolytic potency of the viruses in vitro and in vivo with and without the reagents. Moreover, the effect of on virus replication was analyzed. We found that RGD-4C or Ad5/3 modified fibers improved the oncolytic potency of the viruses in vitro and in vivo. We found that both promoters could be downregulated with dexamethasone, sodium salicylate, or salicylic acid. Oncolytic efficacy correlated with the promoter activity and in vitro virus production could be abrogated with the substances. In vivo, we saw good therapeutic efficacy of the viruses in a model of intravenous therapy of metastatic cervical cancer, but the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was not strong enough to provide significant differences in a complex in vivo environment. Our results suggest that anti-inflammatory drugs may affect the replication of adenovirus, which might be relevant in case of replication associated side effects.
18632268,3,2008,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Discovery and optimization of pyridazinone non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.,A series of benzyl pyridazinones were evaluated as HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Several members of this series showed good activity against the wild-type virus and NNRTI-resistant viruses. The binding of inhibitor 5a to HIV-RT was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Pharmacokinetic studies of 5a in rat and dog demonstrated that this compound has good oral bioavailability in animal species. The crystal structure of a complex between HIV-RT and inhibitor 4c is also described.
18430848,3,2008,AJR Am J Roentgenol,Cost-effectiveness and patient tolerance of low-attenuation oral contrast material: milk versus VoLumen.,OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to prospectively compare the cost, effectiveness, and patient tolerance of milk and VoLumen, a 0.1% barium suspension, in patients undergoing abdominal and pelvic CT with oral and i.v. contrast media.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred fifteen consecutive outpatients were randomly assigned to receive either whole milk (n = 115) or VoLumen (n = 100). Results were independently reviewed by two radiologists who were blinded to the oral contrast agent used. Degree of bowel distention was qualitatively scored on a 4-point scale, and bowel wall visibility was graded qualitatively on a yes-or-no basis. A questionnaire regarding oral contrast tolerability was provided to each patient. Cost comparison of the two agents was performed.RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were seen between whole milk and VoLumen with respect to degree of bowel distention and mural visualization for all segments of bowel studied (p &gt; 0.05 for both reviewers). Significantly more patients ranked milk as pleasant in taste compared with VoLumen (p &lt; 0.0001). More patients preferred milk compared with VoLumen (p &lt; 0.0001). Milk was better tolerated than VoLumen, with fewer abdominal side effects, including abdominal discomfort (p = 0.019), cramping (p = 0.019), nausea (p = 0.016), and diarrhea (p = 0.0002). The cost per patient for VoLumen is $18 compared with $1.48 for milk.CONCLUSION: Whole milk is comparable to VoLumen with respect to bowel distention and bowel wall visualization and has a lower cost, better patient acceptance, and fewer adverse symptoms. Milk is a cost-effective alternative to VoLumen as a low-attenuation oral contrast agent.
18270832,3,2008,Dig Dis Sci,The effects of nebulized albuterol on esophageal function in asthmatic patients.,PURPOSE: Albuterol reduces lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure in normal volunteers, although the effects of albuterol on esophageal function in asthmatic patients are not known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nebulized albuterol on lower esophageal function in asthmatic patients. Symptoms and a methacholine challenge test were used to identify asthmatic patients who were then enrolled in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial. Changes in esophageal function in response to nebulized albuterol or placebo were evaluated over two sessions spaced 1 week apart.RESULTS: Albuterol induced a dose-dependent drop in lower esophageal sphincter basal pressure with a threshold dose as low as 2.5 mg. Albuterol did not affect the amplitude of esophageal contractions.CONCLUSIONS: Nebulized albuterol induces a dose-dependent reduction in LES basal pressure in asthmatic patients. These effects raise the possibility that gastroesophageal reflux may occur after bronchodilator therapy.
18212800,3,2008,Clin Pharmacol Ther,The CYP2A6*4 allele is determinant of S-1 pharmacokinetics in Japanese patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.,S-1 is an oral fluorouracil anticancer drug that contains the 5-FU prodrug tegafur. Tegafur has been shown to be converted enzymatically to 5-FU to exert its antitumor effect, and this conversion is principally catalyzed by CYP2A6. Forty-six non-small-cell lung cancer patients were enrolled. The frequencies of the CYP2A6*4C, CYP2A6*7, and CYP2A6*9 alleles were 17.4, 19.6, and 15.2%, respectively. In the S-1 pharmacokinetic analysis, the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 10 h (AUC(0-10)) ratios of 5-FU/tegafur showed large interindividual variabilities, ranging from 5.14 to 112.6. The AUC(0-10) for tegafur was 1.5-fold higher in patients with the CYP2A6*4C allele than in patients without the CYP2A6*4C allele P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, patients with the CYP2A6*4C allele had a significantly lower maximum plasma concentration (102.6 +/- 32.9 ng/ml) for 5-FU than patients without the CYP2A6*4C allele (157.0 +/- 65.5 ng/ml, P &lt; 0.05). Genotyping of CYP2A6 polymorphisms may provide vital information for effective cancer therapy using S-1.
18193258,3,2008,Chromosoma,Arabidopsis sister chromatids often show complete alignment or separation along a 1.2-Mb euchromatic region but no cohesion &quot;hot spots&quot;.,Sister chromatid cohesion is a prerequisite for correct segregation and possibly other functions of replicated chromosomes. Except for yeast, no details are known about arrangement of cohesion sites along interphase chromosomes. Within nuclei of several higher plants, sister chromatids are frequently not aligned at various positions along chromosome arms. Therefore, we tested whether preferential alignment positions (&quot;cohesion hot spots&quot;) and constant extension of and distances between aligned sites occur in plants. Along a approximately 1.2-Mb contig from the bottom arm of chromosome 1, the sister chromatid positions of 13 individual BAC inserts were found to be aligned for approximately 67-77% of homologues in 4C Arabidopsis thaliana nuclei. The differences between the 13 BAC positions were not significant at the P &lt; 0.01 level. This suggests variability of alignment positions between cells and indicates the absence of cohesion &quot;hot spots&quot;. Similar as for single BACs, FISH with the entire contig indicated complete alignment for approximately 69% and complete separation of sister chromatids for approximately 31% of homologues in 4C nuclei. Partial alignment or separation was barely detectable. When three BAC inserts from a 760-kb region were tested simultaneously, alignment or separation of only the central BAC occurred in 3.3% and 3.5% of replicated chromosomes, respectively. Thus, we assume that sister chromatids can be separated or aligned within a Mb range in differentiated cells. However, the minimum extension of aligned sites or distances between them may (in rare cases) fall below ~500 kb.

The Zn(II) atoms of the octa-nuclear complex have two different five-coordinate environments, viz. ZnN(2)O(3) and ZnO(5). All eight Zn(II) centers adopt a distorted square-pyramidal coordination; four Zn(II) ions have the N(2)O(2) tetra-dentate Schiff base ligand bound in a basal plane and the coordinated water mol-ecule occupying the apical site, while the remaing four Zn(II) ions are bound by five O atoms from three Schiff base ligands. In the crystal structure, Zn(II) complex mol-ecules, coordinated and uncoord-inated water mol-ecules and dimethyl sulfoxide mol-ecules are linked via O-H⋯O and C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds and C-H⋯π inter-actions, forming a three-dimensional framework.
19082995,2,2008,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,CYP2A6 genotypes and coumarin-oxidation phenotypes in a Thai population and their relationship to tobacco smoking.,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between polymorphisms in the human CYP2A6 gene, CYP2A6 enzyme activity and the influence of cigarette smoking in a Thai population.METHODS: Coumarin (5 mg capsule) was administered to 194 healthy Thai subjects. Genetic variation of the CYP2A6 gene was identified using PCR methods. The excreted dose of 7-hydroxycoumarin (as a percentage of the urine concentration) 2 h after administration was calculated as an index of coumarin metabolism.RESULTS: The frequencies of CYP2A6 alleles *1A, *1B, *4C, *7, *8, *9 and *10 were 34.0, 35.3, 9.3, 6.4, 0.5, 12.1 and 2.4%, respectively. Of the 194 subjects tested, the number (percentages) of Thai participants classified as ultra-rapid, extensive, intermediate and poor metabolizers were 8 (4.1%), 159 (82.0%) 22 (11.3%) and five (2.6%), respectively.CONCLUSION: A relationship between the interindividual differences in coumarin metabolism and genetic polymorphisms of the CYP2A6 gene was observed.
19035679,2,2008,Inorg Chem,Synthesis and coordination properties of chelating dithiophenolate ligands.,Chelating 3,3'-R(1)-5,5'-R(2)-2,2'-dithiobiphenyl ligands (R(1) = R(2) = Cl, 4a; R(1) = R(2) = (t)Bu, 4b; R(1) = allyl, R(2) = H, 4c) and the 2,2'-methylenedibenzenethiol ligand (4d) were synthesized from the corresponding diols (1a-1d) via a three-step procedure involving a Miyazaki-Newman-Kwart rearrangement. Zinc complexes and a tin complex (for 4c) have been prepared to explore their coordination potential, and the substitution pattern, as well as the chelate ring size, is shown to severely effect their ligating properties. Four of the complexes have been characterized crystallographically in the solid state, and the nuclearity of the zinc complexes in solution has been studied by diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy. Depending on the ligand, zinc complexes [(4)Zn(4,4'-(t)Bu-bipyridine)](n) (5a-d) are monomeric (n = 1; 4b, 4c), monomeric in solution and dimeric in the solid state (n = 1, 2; 4a), or dimeric overall (n = 2; 4d). The tin complex (4c)SnPh(2) (6c) was additionally synthesized to prove the coordinating abilities of the allyl substituted ligand 4c.
19003309,2,2008,Cytotechnology,Microsupport with two-dimensional geometry (2D-MS) 4. Temperature-induced detachment of anchorage-dependent CHO-K1 cells from cryoresponsive MicroHex((R)) (CryoHex).,Tissue culture flasks were activated by electron beam irradiation and subsequently treated with N-isopropylacrylamide to make them cryoresponsive. Leaving such 'cryoflasks' unattended for 10 minutes at room temperature sufficed to almost completely detach the anchorage-dependent cells. MicroHex((R)), a polystyrene-based tissue culture microsupport with two-dimensional geometry, was handled in the same way to obtain CryoHex, i.e. a cryoresponsive MicroHex from which anchorage-dependent cells could be detached by exposure to low temperature (4-20 degrees C). Experimental conditions were determined allowing one to detach the cells from small and large microsupport culture volumes. Cells detached from CryoHex by exposure to low temperature displayed a high cell viability and, upon subcultivation on MicroHex((R)), did not show any alteration of their growth kinetics.
19002914,2,2008,Cytotechnology,Microsupport with two-dimensional geometry (2D-MS). In situ determination of the growth kinetics of anchorage-dependent cells by Laser Diffraction Particle Sizing (LDPS).,The procedure used to establish in situ (without cell trypsinization) the growth kinetics characteristics of anchorage-dependent cells propagated on microcarriers by Aperture Impedance Pulse Spectroscopy can be replaced by a novel method based on the time-dependent shifts of the size distribution histograms of cell-laden microcarriers. This we have named Laser Diffraction Particle Sizing.
18981126,2,2008,J Immunol,Processing of an antigenic sequence from IgG constant domains for presentation by MHC class II.,Targeting of T cell epitopes to APC enhances T cell responses. We used an APC-specific Ab (anti-IgD) and substituted either of 18 loops connecting beta strands in human IgG constant H (C(H)) domains with a characterized T cell peptide epitope. All Ab-epitope fusion molecules were secreted from producing cells except IgG-loop 2(BC)C(H)1, and comparing levels, a hierarchy appeared with fusions involving C(H)2 &gt; or = C(H)1 &gt; C(H)3. Within each domain, fusion at loop 6(FG) showed best secretion, while low secretion correlated with the substitution of native loops that contain conserved amino acids buried within the folded molecule. Comparing the APC-specific rAb molecules for their ability to induce T cell activation in vitro, the six mutants with epitope in C(H)2 were the most effective, with loop 4C(H)2 ranking on top. The C(H)1 mutants were more resistant to processing, and the loop 6C(H)1 mutant only induced detectable activation. The efficiency of the C(H)3 mutants varied, with loop 6C(H)3 being the least effective and equal to loop 6 C(H)1. Considering both rAb secretion level and T cell activation efficiency, a total of eight loops may carry T cell epitopes to APC for processing and presentation to T cells, namely, all in C(H)2 in addition to loop 6 in C(H)1 and C(H)3. Comparing loop 4C(H)2 with loop 6C(H)1 mutants after injection of Ab in BALB/c mice, the former was by far the most efficient and induced specific T cell activation at concentrations at least 100-fold lower than loop 6C(H)1.
18947995,2,2008,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Non-nucleoside inhibitors of the hepatitis C virus NS5B RNA-dependant RNA polymerase: 2-aryl-3-heteroaryl-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives.,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA polymerase is crucial for replicating the HCV RNA genome and is an attractive target for developing anti-HCV drugs. A novel series of 2,3-diaryl-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives were evaluated for their ability to inhibit HCV NS5B. Of this series, compounds 4c, 5b, 5c and 6 emerged as more potent, displaying over 95% inhibition of NS5B RNA polymerase activity in vitro. The two most active compounds 4c and 5c exhibited an IC(50) of 31.9 microM and 32.2 microM, respectively, against HCV NS5B.
18835121,2,2008,Syst Appl Microbiol,Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of Listeria monocytogenes isolates from different sources and geographical origins and representative of the twelve serovars.,Multiplex-PCR (MPCR) serogrouping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping analysis are currently used by several public and private laboratories for the characterization of Listeria monocytogenes. In this study a set of 80 L. monocytogenes isolates belonging to the twelve serovars was used to investigate (i) the typeability of the rare serovars, (ii) the ability of PFGE analysis with ApaI and AscI to differentiate serovars within MPCR serogroups and (iii) the association of molecular types with the specific source or geographical origin of the isolates. With the exception of three isolates (rare serovars 4a and 4c) that were not amenable to restriction with ApaI, all the other analyzed isolates were subtyped by both enzymes. PFGE discriminated the 80 isolates into 62 combined ApaI and AscI PFGE patterns (pulsotypes), but could not differentiate serovars within MPCR serogroups, in which isolates from different serovars displaying the same pulsotype were found. Clustering analysis suggests that for some pulsotypes grouping according to Portuguese origin or source can be suggested. On the other hand, some L. monocytogenes clones are widely distributed. Two pulsotypes from Portuguese human isolates were identical to the ones displayed by human outbreak clones in the UK and in the USA and Switzerland, respectively, although they were not temporally matched. Computer-assisted data analysis of large and diverse PFGE type databases will improve the correct interpretation of subtyping data in epidemiological studies and in tracing routes and sources of contamination in the food industry.
18829282,2,2008,J Nutr Biochem,Differential incorporation of dietary conjugated linolenic and linoleic acids into milk lipids and liver phospholipids in lactating and suckling rats.,Interest in health benefits of conjugated fatty acids is growing. The present study compared the incorporation pattern of dietary conjugated linolenic acids (CLnA) into milk with that of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). Lactating Sprague-Dawley rats (Day 1) were divided into five groups fed the control diet (n=4) or one of four experimental diets supplemented with 1-2% CLA or CLnA mixture (n=8 each). Supplementation of 1% and 2% CLA led to enrichment of 4.17% and 8.57% CLA, respectively, while supplementation of 1% and 2% CLnA resulted in enrichment of only 0.98% and 1.71% CLnA in the milk lipids, demonstrating the transfer of CLnA from maternal diet to milk was discriminated. When the lactating rats were given a diet containing a CLnA mixture of 9t,11t,13t-, 9c,11t,13t- and 9c,11t,13c-CLnA isomers, two CLA isomers, namely, 9t,11t (0.59-0.90%) and 9c,11t (1.21-1.96%), were found in the milk, suggesting that three CLnA isomers were Delta-13 saturated. Dietary CLnA at 1-2% had no effect on liver phospholipid (PL) fatty acid composition of both maternal and suckling rats, whereas dietary CLA increased docosahexaenoic acid (4c,7c,10c,13c,16c,19c-22:6) and palmitic acid (16:0) proportionally in the PL of maternal rats, but it suppressed 16:0 in the PL of suckling rats. It is concluded that maternal rats incorporate CLnA isomers into milk differently from that of CLA isomers. Most interesting is that maternal rats can metabolically convert CLnA to CLA.
18823115,2,2008,Inorg Chem,Persistent radicals of trivalent tin and lead.,In this report we present synthetic, crystallographic, and new electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic work that shows that the synthetic route leading to the recently reported, first persistent plumbyl radical *PbEbt3 (Ebt = ethylbis(trimethylsilyl)silyl), that is, the oxidation of the related PbEbt3-anion, was easily extended to the synthesis of other persistent molecular mononuclear radicals of lead and tin. At first, various novel solvates of homoleptic potassium metallates KSnHyp3 (4a), KPbHyp3 (3a), KSnEbt3 (4b), KPbIbt3 (3c), and KSnIbt3 (4c) (Hyp = tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl, Ibt = isopropylbis(trimethylsilyl)silyl), as well as some heteroleptic metallates, such as [Li(OEt2)2][Sn(n)BuHyp2] (3d), [Li(OEt2)2][Pb(n)BuHyp2] (4d), [Li(thf)4][PbPhHyp2] (3e), and [K(thf)7][PbHyp2{N(SiMe3)2}] (3f), were synthesized and crystallographically characterized. Through oxidation by tin(II) and lead(II) bis(trimethylsilyl)amides or the related 2,6-di-tert-butylphenoxides, they had been oxidized to yield in most cases the corresponding radicals. Five novel persistent homoleptically substituted radicals, that is, *SnHyp3 (2a), *PbHyp3 (1a), *SnEbt3 (2b), *SnIbt3 (2c), and *PbIbt3 (1c), had been characterized by EPR spectroscopy. The stannyl radicals 2a and 2c as well as the plumbyl radical 1c were isolated as intensely colored crystalline compounds and had been characterized by X-ray diffraction. Persistent heteroleptically substituted radicals such as *PbHyp2Ph (1e) or *PbHyp2Et (1g) had also been generated, and some selected EPR data are given for comparison. The plumbyl radicals *PbR3 exhibit a clean monomolecular decay leading to the release of a temperature-dependent stationary concentration of branched silyl radicals. They may thus serve as tunable sources of these reactive species that may be utilized as reagents for mild radical silylations and/or as initiators for radical polymerizations. We present EPR-spectroscopic investigations for the new tin- and lead-containing compounds giving detailed insights into their electronic and geometric structure in solution, as well as structural studies on the crystalline state of the radicals, some of their anionic precursors, and some side-products.

18751443,2,2008,Anticancer Res,Adjuvant treatment for elderly patients with colon cancer. An observational study.,BACKGROUND: Adjuvant 5-fluoruracil-based chemotherapy significantly reduces mortality in patients with stage II-III colon cancer, but is less prescribed with rising age. In this study we were interested in the pattern of adjuvant treatment and possible effects on survival among elderly patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January to December 2004, 63 questionnaires on the management of stage II-III resected colon cancer patients aged over 70 years, collected from 10 Italian Centres, were retrospectively examined. Determinants of receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy and their relation to survival were considered.RESULTS: The proportion of elderly patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was 79.4%, distinct of age, gender, educational level and comorbidities. Grade 3-4 toxicities were the following: haematological in 4 (8.5.%) patients, mucositis in 4 (8.5%), diarrhoea in 2 (4.2%) and nausea in 1 (2.1%). The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at two years were 79.9% and 95.6%, respectively. Due to the paucity of events, the impact of prognostic factors (patient's age and comorbidity, tumour stage and grade) on DFS and OS could not be assessed.CONCLUSION: An increasing proportion of elderly patients with colon cancer may be treated with a tolerability and OS similar to those observed in the younger population. Development of age-based guidelines and increased awareness of both physicians and patients through education is important to prevent undertreatment of those elderly patients who are eligible for chemotherapy.
18751439,2,2008,Anticancer Res,Development of a nomogram for predicting high-grade prostate cancer on biopsy: the significance of serum testosterone levels.,BACKGROUND: A screening method that focuses on the early detection of high-grade prostate cancer is required. In this study, two sets of nomograms were developed, one to predict the presence of prostate cancer, and the other to predict the presence of high-grade prostate cancer (defined as Gleason Score &gt; or =7).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prostate biopsies were obtained from 396 men with an abnormal serum level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Using factors including age, PSA, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), serum teststerone level and prostate volume of the transitional zone (TZ), nomograms were created that incorporated these factors. External validations were performed involving 174 males, including 103 normal and 71 prostate cancer cases from our institution.RESULTS: Out of the 396 patients referred for prostate biopsy, 146 were found to have prostate cancer. On logistic regression analysis, age, PSA, prostate volume of the TZ and FSH were significant predictors of prostate cancer, while serum PSA, and testosterone levels were significant predictors of high-grade prostate cancer. The pretreatment testosterone level was found to be a significant biomarker for predicting the pathological features.CONCLUSION: The testosterone level might be a useful biomarker to be included in conventional PSA screening programs to further improve the efficacy of detecting potentially lethal carcinomas.
18751425,2,2008,Anticancer Res,Staging procedures in primary breast cancer.,BACKGROUND: In consideration of increasing incidence by introduction of screening mammography, the prevalence of distant metastases and necessity of staging procedures in early breast cancer should be proved.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 466 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer in the period from 2003 to 2006.RESULTS: Distant metastases were found in 22 (4.8%) patients at the time of primary diagnosis of breast cancer. None of these patients had a tumour &lt; or =1 cm and the percentage of metastatic disease increased with local extension (pT1 1.4%; pT2 7.9%; pT3 14.3%; pT4 23.1%; p&lt;0.001) and nodal status (pN0 1.7%; pN1 3.8%; pN2 21.7%; pN3 17.6%; p&lt;0.001)CONCLUSION: Indication for bone scan, liver ultrasound and chest x-ray should be limited to patients with tumours &gt;2 cm, or tumours &gt;1 cm with lymph node involvement (N1-3).
18751421,2,2008,Anticancer Res,Phase 2 trial of oral S-1 combined with low-dose cisplatin for unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer.,OBJECTIVES: A phase 2 trial of S-1 combined with cisplatin was conducted for unresectable pancreatic cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: S-1 was administered for 28 days followed by a rest of 14 days. Cisplatin was infused on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19 and 22-26 of the first course. After the second course, S-1 was administered as maintenance chemotherapy.RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled and the responses observed were 0 complete response, 5 partial response, 22 stable disease and 3 progressive disease, with an overall response rate of 17% (95% confidence internal (CI), 6-35%). Toxicity was tolerable, with grade 3 toxicities observed for leukocytopenia (10%), neutropenia (7%), anemia (3%), thrombocytopenia (3%), anorexia (13%), and nausea and vomiting (7%). The median survival time (MST) and the 1-year survival rate were 9.0 months (95% CI, 6.0-14.5 months) and 35.7% (95% CI, 19-55%), respectively.CONCLUSION: S-1 with low-dose cisplatin is well tolerated and effective for advanced pancreatic cancer.
18751415,2,2008,Anticancer Res,How the measurements of a few serum markers can be combined to enhance their clinical values in the management of cancer.,The number of potential molecular markers is constantly increasing. However, for most malignancies there is no simple test to detect early-stage tumours that is useful for screening purposes because most biomarkers have poor sensitivity or specificity, or other clinical value. One approach to increase their value is to measure several biomarkers at a time. The additional information should always yield a test more able to distinguish between patients and healthy individuals, and ideally between different kinds of tumour. Our work in colorectal, lung, and head and neck cancer, illustrates the evolution of this idea. A test in which ELISAs for key serum markers are arrayed based on immunoblot technology or flow cytometric beads is suggested because these techniques are more transferable to practical application in clinical decision making. Moreover, the multivariate data obtained from such a test can easily be managed with statistical methods already developed in the fields of genomics and proteomics.
18751410,2,2008,Anticancer Res,PET-CT in recurrent ovarian cancer: impact on treatment planning.,BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is currently not established in the management of recurrent ovarian cancer. Here, its value in diagnosis and therapy planning was evaluated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy patients received PET-CT for suspicion of recurrent ovarian cancer. PET-CT and surgery were reviewed to analyze the accuracy in the diagnosis of recurrence and prediction of full resectability.RESULTS: PET-CT showed disease relapse in 63 of 70 patients, with full sensitivity and specificity. Thirty cases were operated on. PET-CT indicated full resectability in 24, but in fact only incomplete resection was possible in three cases. Thus sensitivity and specificity for the identification of full resectability were 100% and 66%, respectively. Seven negative results in PET-CT were confirmed by a relapse-free follow-up of 1 year.CONCLUSION: PET-CT offers reliable detection of recurrent ovarian cancer. Although diagnostic accuracy in the prediction of full resectability is limited, surgical planning is improved by identifying sites of intraperitoneal involvement.
18572012,2,2008,Biochim Biophys Acta,Reconstitution into liposomes of the B degrees -like glutamine-neutral amino acid transporter from renal cell plasma membrane.,Na+ dependent [3H]glutamine uptake was found in liposomes reconstituted with solubilized rat kidney brush border in the presence of intraliposomal K+. The reconstituted system was optimised with respect to the critical parameters of the cyclic detergent removal procedure, i.e., the detergent used for the solubilization, the protein concentration, the detergent/phospholipid ratio and the number of passages through a single Amberlite column. Time dependent [3H]glutamine accumulation in proteoliposomes occurred only in the presence of external Na+ and internal K+. The transporter showed low if there is any tolerance towards the substitution of Na+ or K+ for other cations. Valinomycin strongly stimulated the transport indicating that it is electrogenic. Intraliposomal glutamine had no effect. From the dependence of the transport rate on the Na+ concentration cooperativity index close to 1 was derived, indicating that 1 Na+ should be involved in the cotransport with glutamine. The electrogenicity of the transport originated from the Na+ transport. Optimal rate of 0.1 mM [3H]glutamine uptake was found in the presence of 50 mM intraliposomal K-gluconate. At higher K-gluconate concentrations the transport rate decreased. The activity of the reconstituted transporter was pH dependent with optimal function in the range pH 6.5-7.0. [3H]glutamine (and [3H]leucine) uptake was inhibited by all the neutral but not by the positively or negatively charged amino acids. The sulfhydryl reagents HgCl2, mersalyl, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and the substrate analogue 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylate strongly inhibited the transporter, whereas the amino acid analogue alpha-(methylamino)isobutyrate had no effect. The inhibition by mersalyl was protected by the presence of the substrate. On the basis of the Na+ dependence, the electrogenic transport mode and the specificity towards the amino acids, the reconstituted transporter was classified as B degrees-like.
18524583,2,2008,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and in vitro anti-hepatitis B virus activities of 4-aryl-6-chloro-quinolin-2-one and 5-aryl-7-chloro-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives.,A series of 4-aryl-6-chloro-quinolin-2-ones and 5-aryl-7-chloro-1,4-benzodiazepine were synthesized and assayed for their in vitro anti-hepatitis B virus activities and cytotoxicities for the first time. Some of the tested compounds were active against HBsAg and HBeAg secretion in Hep G2.2.15 cells. Compound 5c showed IC(50) of 0.074 and 0.449 mM on HBsAg and HBeAg secretions, respectively, which were 10 times higher than that of its analog 4c and led to better selective index (SI) values (SI=23.2 and 3.4, respectively).
18378445,2,2008,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis of new benzimidazole linked pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine conjugates with efficient DNA-binding affinity and potent cytotoxicity.,The synthesis of new benzimidazole linked pyrrolobenzodiazepine conjugates is described. Some of these conjugates show significant DNA-binding affinity and, a representative compound 4c shows promising in vitro cytotoxicity against a number of human cancer cell lines.
18355967,2,2008,Neuroscience,Inhibiting activator protein-1 activity alters cocaine-induced gene expression and potentiates sensitization.,We have expressed A-FOS, an inhibitor of activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding, in adult mouse striatal neurons. We observed normal behavior including locomotion and exploratory activities. Following a single injection of cocaine, locomotion increased similarly in both the A-FOS expressing and littermate controls. However, following repeated injections of cocaine, the A-FOS expressing mice showed increased locomotion relative to littermate controls, an increase that persisted following a week of withdrawal and subsequent cocaine administration. These results indicate that AP-1 suppresses this behavioral response to cocaine. We analyzed mRNA from the striatum before and 4 and 24 h after a single cocaine injection in both A-FOS and control striata using Affymetrix microarrays (430 2.0 Array) to identify genes mis-regulated by A-FOS that may mediate the increased locomotor sensitization to cocaine. A-FOS expression did not change gene expression in the basal state or 4 h following cocaine treatment relative to controls. However, 24 h after an acute cocaine treatment, 84 genes were identified that were differentially expressed between the A-FOS and control mice. Fifty-six genes are down-regulated while 28 genes are up-regulated including previously identified candidates for addiction including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and period homolog 1. Using a random sample of identified genes, quantitative PCR was used to verify the microarray studies. The chromosomal location of these 84 genes was compared with human genome scans of addiction to identify potential genes in humans that are involved in addiction.
18273902,2,2008,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Interaction of mildronate with the mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine transport protein.,The interaction of mildronate [3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazine) propionate] with the purified mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter reconstituted in liposomes has been studied. Mildronate, externally added to the proteoliposomes, strongly inhibited the carnitine/carnitine antiport catalyzed by the reconstituted transporter with an IC(50) of 560 muM. A kinetic analysis revealed that the inhibition is completely competitive, that is, mildronate interacts with the substrate-binding site. The half-saturation constant of the transporter for external mildronate (K(i)) is 530 muM. Carnitine/mildronate antiport has been measured as [(3)H]carnitine uptake into proteoliposomes containing internal mildronate or as [(3)H]carnitine efflux from proteoliposomes in the presence of external mildronate, indicating that mildronate is transported by the carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter and that the inhibition observed was due to the transport of mildronate in the place of carnitine. The intraliposomal half-saturation constant for mildronate transport (K(m)) has been determined. Its value, 18 mM, is much higher than the external half-saturation constant (K(i)) in agreement with the asymmetric properties of the transporter. In vivo, the antiport reaction between cytosolic (administered) mildronate and matrix carnitine may cause intramitochondrial carnitine depletion. This effect, together with the inhibition of the physiological transport, will lead to impairment of fatty acid utilization.
21202840,2,2008,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,Benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid-1,2-bis-(1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)ethane-water (4/1/2).,The title compound, 4C(9)H(6)O(6)·C(6)H(8)N(6)·2H(2)O, crystallizes in a layer structure where each sheet is composed of anellated hydrogen-bonded rings of six distinct sizes: R(2) (2)(16), R(3) (3)(18), R(4) (4)(12), R(4) (4)(18), R(4) (4)(22) and R(4) (4)(25). The two largest rings, viz. R(4) (4)(22) and R(4) (4)(25), are associated with O-H⋯N bonds from the carboxyl groups to the triazole rings. The typical head-to-tail carbox-yl-carboxyl R(2) (2)(8) motif is not observed.
19103578,1,2008,Acta Pharm,Synthesis, anticonvulsant and toxicity evaluation of 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)acetyl-N-(substituted phenyl)hydrazine carbothioamides and their related heterocyclic derivatives.,A series of new 5-(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl-4-(substituted aryl)-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiones (4a-g), 5-(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl-N-(substituted aryl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-amines (5a-g) and 5-(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl-N-(substituted aryl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amines (6a-g) were prepared by treating 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)acetyl-N-(substituted phenyl) hydrazine carbothioamides (3a-g) with suitable reagents. All the newly synthesized compounds were screened for their anticonvulsant activity in the MES model and were compared with the standard drugs phenytoin sodium and carbamazepine. Out of the twenty-one compounds studied, 4b, 4e, 4f, 5b, 5d, 5g, 6b, 6d and 6e showed comparable MES activity to phenytoin and carbamazepine after 0.5 h. Compound 5b showed to be more potent than carbamazepine after 4 h. Compounds 4a, 4c, 4d, 5a, 5c, 5e, 5f, 6f and 6g showed lower neurotoxicity than phenytoin.
19070975,1,2008,Anim Reprod Sci,Identification of various testicular cell populations in pubertal and adult cockerels.,Precise identification of the male germinal stem cell population is important for their practical use in programs dedicated to the integration of exogenous genetic material in testicular tissues. In the present study, our aim was to identify germinal cell populations in the testes of pubertal and adult cockerels based on the detection of the nuclear DNA content by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and on the expression of the Dazl and Stra8 genes in single-cell suspensions of testicular tissues. Cells with a tetraploid DNA content (4c) represent a small and equal fraction of the total germinal cell population in both pubertal and adult males. In contrast, the diploid (2c) and haploid (c) subpopulations differ significantly between ages as a consequence of different degrees of sexual maturation. A specific subpopulation of testicular cells, the side-scatter subpopulation of cells, or side population (SP), was identified at the junction between the haploid and diploid cell populations. The percentage of this cell subpopulation differs significantly in pubertal and adult cockerels, accounting for 4.1% and 1.3% of the total cell population, respectively. These four testicular cell populations were also tested for the expression of Dazl and Stra8 genes known to be expressed in premeiotic cells including stem spermatogonia. Both genes were expressed in SP, whereas the expression of either Dazl or Stra8 genes was detected only in the 4c and in the 2c testicular cell subpopulations, respectively. The correlation between the cell ploidy and Dazl/Stra8 expression was the same at both male ages. We conclude that SP cells might represent a subpopulation of germinal cells enriched in stem spermatogonia, which can be of great importance for transgenesis in chicken.
19053551,1,2008,J Phys Chem A,Effect of chlorin structure on theoretical electronic absorption spectra and on the energy released by porphyrin-based photosensitizers.,In this work eight porphyrins (p) and eight chlorins (c) are theoretically characterized [BLYP/6-31G(d)] in their singlet and triplet states. Nine of them (1p, 1c, 2p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 6c, 7c, and 8c) have already been synthesized and are in trial use in photodynamic therapy (PDT). The seven remaining were built up as chlorins analogous to porphyrins 2p-5p and porphyrins analogous to chlorins 6c-8c. The aim is to investigate the effect of the chlorin structure on the Q-band of electronic spectra at BLYP/6-31G(d) (gas phase, methanol solution) and at BHANDHLYP/6-31+G(d) (methanol solution), and on the triplet --&gt; singlet energy emission, as these two factors determine the quality of a good photosensitizer. It is found that meso substituents lead to greater geometry distortions than beta-substituents in both porphyrins and chlorins and in both singlet and triplet states. In methanol solution, chlorin-like structures with beta substitution present significantly red-shifted Q-bands in comparison with their porphyrin analogues, so they would be better photosensitizers than porphyrins. Concerning to the triplet --&gt; singlet energy emission calculated in methanol solution, three porphyrins (4p, 6p, and 8p) and all the studied substituted chlorins could be useful to generate active (1)O2. 4c would be the best photosensitizer, as it absorbs the largest wavelength in the therapeutic window (approximately 690 nm) and releases the amount of energy closest to the required one (1.22 eV).
18972523,1,2008,Chem Biodivers,Oxidation of diiron and triiron sulfurdithiolato complexes: mimics for the active site of [FeFe]-hydrogenase.,The oxidation of the hexacarbonyl(1,3-dithiolato-S,S')diiron complexes 4a-4c with varying amounts of dimethyldioxirane (DMD) was systematically studied. The chemoselectivity of the oxidation products depended upon the substituent R (R=H, Me, 1/2 (CH2)(5)). For R=H, four oxidation products, 6a-6d, have been obtained. In the case of R=Me, three products, 7a-7c, were formed, and for R=1/2 (CH2)(5), only complex 8 was observed. These observations are due to steric and electronic effects caused by the substituent R. Additionally, oxidation of the triiron complex 5 with DMD was performed to yield the products 9a and 9b. X-Ray diffraction analyses were performed for 6a-6d, 7a, and 7c, as well as for 9a and 9b. The electronic properties were determined by density-functional theory (DFT) calculations.
18947978,1,2008,Nutrition,Four-compartment model and validation of deuterium dilution technique to estimate fat-free mass in Mexican youth.,OBJECTIVE: To validate the measurement of fat-free mass (FFM) with the deuterium oxide (D(2)O) dilution technique (2C) against the four-compartment (4C) model in Mexican children.METHODS: This was designed as a cross-sectional, non-probabilistic study. Sixty subjects (30 male and 30 female) 6-14 y of age were recruited and completed the study during 5 mo. Total body water was measured using the D(2)O dilution technique and FFM was calculated using Fomon's (6-10 y) and Lohman's (11-14 y) hydration constants. Body composition using the 4C model was calculated with Lohman's equation.RESULTS: Group mean accuracy showed no differences in FFM determined by D(2)O dilution and the 4C model (1.24 kg, P &gt; 0.4), by gender (2.1 kg, P &gt; 0.2), or by method-by-gender interaction (P &gt; 0.7). FFMs were 26.9 and 25.7 kg by the 4C and 2C models, respectively. The test for coincidence of slopes and intercepts between the 2C and 4C models and the line of identity were not different (P &gt; 0.05). Precision by R(2) explained 98% of the variance (standard error of the estimate 1.2 kg). Bias for the difference in FFM was not significant (-1.27, 95% confidence interval -1.5 to -0.9) and no association between the mean of the differences and the magnitude of the measurements was found (P &gt; 0.05). Mean bias was -1.27 kg for FFM (P &gt; 0.05), and limits of agreement were -3.1 to 0.8 kg.CONCLUSION: The D(2)O dilution technique used with these hydration constants was accurate, precise, and free of bias in Mexican children and adolescents compared with the 4C model.
18938077,1,2008,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis of 3,6-diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes as novel ligands for neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.,Alpha series of novel 3,6-diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane derivatives 4a-f was synthesized and their affinity and selectivity towards alpha4beta2 and alpha7 nAChR subtypes were evaluated. The results of the current study revealed a number of compounds (4a, 4b and 4c) having a very high affinity for alpha4beta2 (K(i) at alpha4beta2 ranging from 0.023 to 0.056 nM) versus alpha7 nAChR subtypes; among these compounds, the 3-(6-bromopyridin-3-yl)-3,6-diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane 4c was found to be the most alpha7alpha4beta2 selective term in receptor binding assays (alpha7alpha4beta2=1295). Moreover, compound 4d also had high affinity for the alpha4beta2 nAChR subtype (K(i)=1.2 nM) with considerably high selectivity (alpha7/alpha4beta2=23300).
18754583,1,2008,Inorg Chem,The boron connection: a parallel description of aromatic, bonding, and structural characteristics of hydrogenated silicon-carbon clusters and isovalent carboranes.,The aromatic, bonding, and structural characteristics of the Si 4C 2H 2-C 2B 4H 6, Si 2C 4H 4-C 4B 2H 6, and other Si n C 2H 2-C 2B n H n+2 ( n = 1, 2, 3, 5) isovalent pairs are studied using density functional theory (DFT) and coupled cluster methods to fully illustrate the homology of the two species. This homology, which is based on the replacement of the carborane B-H units by isovalent Si atoms, is extended to all three characteristics (structural, electronic, and aromatic) and includes all three lowest-energy structures of the isovalent pairs. This type of &quot;boron connection&quot;, which has been tested for silicon clusters recently, seems to be a valid and extremely useful concept. For the aromatic properties of the Si n C 2H 2-C 2B n H n+2 species, expressed through the nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS), a strange odd-even effect with respect to the number of Si atoms is observed which seems rather difficult to explain. To help possible future identification and characterization of the Si n C 2H 2 clusters, their infrared, Raman, and optical excitation spectra are calculated within the framework of DFT, using the 6-311+G(2d, p) basis set. It is expected that the present results would facilitate the exploitation of the well-known carborane and metallacarborane chemical properties and applications for the design and development of novel silicon-carbon-based composite materials.
18751442,1,2008,Anticancer Res,Micronuclei and broken eggs in human liver carcinogenesis.,BACKGROUND: Micronuclei (MNi) and broken eggs (BE) are both considered sensitive markers of genotoxic damage and chromosomal instability. In humans, a high frequency of MNi is reported in both cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, but no information is available on MNi/BE expression in dysplastic nodules. MNi/BE formation may result in activation of the p53-mediated cell cycle checkpoint.MATERIALS AND METHODS: MNi, BE (Feulgen staining) and immunohistochemical expression of p53 and Mib1 were assessed in 95 liver lesions representing the whole spectrum of liver carcinogenesis. Seven normal liver tissue samples served as controls. MNi and BE were assessed by video-assisted microscopy and expressed as a crude number per 1,000 hepatocytes.RESULTS: MNi and BE were significantly more frequent in all the pathological samples than in the controls (p&lt;0.001). A progressively increasing number of MNi/BEs was documented from cirrhotic nodules (CN) to large regenerative nodules (LRN), to dysplastic nodules (DN) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (test for trend; p&lt;0.001). MNi were significantly more frequent in DN than in CN or LRN (p=0.011; p=0.020, respectively). Proliferative activity (Mib1) and p53 expression were significantly associated with MNi presence (p&lt;0.001 and p=0.031, respectively).CONCLUSION: Chromosomal instability significantly increases throughout the multistep course of hepatocarcinogenesis. The similar prevalence of MNi and BEs in DN and HCC supports their strict biological similarity. A high prevalence of MNi/BE may identify a subset of (genetically unstable) cancer-prone cirrhosis cases.
18751438,1,2008,Anticancer Res,Microvessel density (MVD) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/ beta-catenin interaction are associated with relapse in patients with transitional carcinoma receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel/carboplatin: a hellenic cooperative oncology group (HECOG) study.,BACKGROUND: Cycloxygenase (COX)-2 has been associated with proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis in urothelial cancer. The prognostic significance of COX-2 in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy for urothelial cancer was examined.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression of COX-2, p53, ki67, beta-catenin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density (MVD) were studied retrospectively in 59 patients with urothelial cancer (pT3, pT4, N+) who had undergone surgery. The patients had subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy.RESULTS: Thirty-eight out of 59 cases (64%) were positive for COX-2. COX-2 was not associated either with progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). MVD levels &gt; or =47 were associated with longer median PFS compared with lower levels (not reached vs. 13 months [95% CI: 8-18], p=0.048). The median PFS for patients with beta-catenin nuclear accumulation and COX-2 expression was 6 months (95% CI: 4-7) compared with 19 months (95% CI: 14-23) for neither or only one of these factors (p=0.018).CONCLUSION: MVD may be a useful indicator of relapse in high-risk urothelial cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.
18751437,1,2008,Anticancer Res,Phase I study of biweekly docetaxel and S-1 combination chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer.,BACKGROUND: Docetaxel and S-1 are novel antitumour chemotherapeutic agents with distinct toxicities. Here a phase I study of combined docetaxel and S-1 therapy for advanced gastric cancer is reported.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 21 patients who received at least two courses of treatment. Intravenous docetaxel was administered with dose escalation from 20-45 mg/m2 depending on the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) on days 1 and 15, and oral S-1 (BSA &lt; 1.25 m2, 80 mg/day; 1.25 &lt; or = BSA &lt; 1.50 m2, 100 mg/day; 1.50 m2 &lt; or = BSA, 120 mg/day) was administered on days 1-7 and 15-21.RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel was 45 mg/m2 and the DLT was defined as neutropenia. The recommended docetaxel dose was identified as 40 mg/m2. The response rate (including partial responses) was 57.1%. Five cases showed no change and four showed progressive disease after two courses of treatment. The mean survival rate was 15 months.CONCLUSION: A phase II clinical trial is required to confirm these results.
18751427,1,2008,Anticancer Res,Erlotinib monotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer: an effective approach with low toxicity.,BACKGROUND: Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and particularly erlotinib (Tarceva) has been a field of intense research. This retrospective study was conducted to assess the efficacy of erlotinib and its impact on survival.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB or IV, advanced or recurrent metastatic NSCLC were included in the study and were administered erlotinib 150 mg daily, at different lines of treatment.RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were included in the study: 29 (81%) male, 7 (19%) female. At the time of analysis, all patients had progressed and died. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4 months +/- 2.43 months (range 0-8 months), whereas median overall survival (OS) was 7 months +/- 2.65 months (range 3-15 months). Patients with ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 had better OS and significantly higher PFS rates. Overall response rate was 16.7%, while the disease control rate was 81%.CONCLUSION: Erlotinib is effective and well tolerated in pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC and a good performance status.
18751426,1,2008,Anticancer Res,Regulatory T-cells are possible effect prediction markers of immunotherapy for cancer patients.,We previously showed that a combination therapy with tumor cell-pulsed monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and activated lymphocytes was well tolerated in patients with disseminated carcinomas. Recently, accumulating evidence has indicated that regulatory T-cells (Tregs), a unique population of CD4+ T-cells, are increased in patients with several advanced malignancies and prevent cell-mediated immune responses against tumors. However, reports analyzing the relationship between the Tregs population and the effects of immunotherapy are extremely rare. In the present study, 22 patients received an intravenous injection of DC-activated lymphocytes (DAK) and/or a subcutaneous injection of tumor-pulsed DCs (DC vaccine) every 2 to 4 weeks. The Tregs were defined based on their expression of CD4, CD25 and FOXP3, a transcription factor. Most CD4+CD25high T-cells expressed FOXP3. Therefore, CD4+CD25high T-cells were evaluated as Tregs in the present study. As reported previously, the percentage of Tregs (% Tregs) among total CD4+ T-cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly higher for advanced cancer patients than for healthy volunteers. When the patients were divided into three groups according to their survival time, i.e. 12 short-survival patients, 4 medium-survival patients and 6 long-survival patients, the % Tregs of the long-survival patients before the therapy was significantly lower than that of the short-survival patients (p=0.026). The % Tregs decreased after the therapy, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. When the patients were divided into a high group (&gt;4.99%: 7 patients) and a low group (&lt;4.99%: 15 patients) according to their % Tregs before the therapy, the survival times of the two groups differed significantly (p=0.0034). These data suggest that the % Tregs among the PBMCs might be used as an effect prediction factor of immunotherapy for patients with advanced cancer.
18751423,1,2008,Anticancer Res,Feasibility study of docetaxel and nedaplatin for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.,BACKGROUND: To determine a new taxane plus platinum treatment regimen for squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (CSCC), a phase I feasibility study of docetaxel (DTX) plus nedaplatin (CDGP) combination therapy was conducted.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients were enrolled into the study. The starting dose of DTX/CDGP was 60 mg/m2 / 80 mg/m2, every 4 weeks for at least three courses and the dose was escalated to 70 mg/m2 / 100 mg/m2. DTX 60 mg/m2 / CDGP 100 mg/m2 was also evaluated as an extra dose level.RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicity was granulocytopenia and the maximum tolerated dose was determined as 70 mg/m2 / 100 mg/m2. All 20 patients had measurable disease and a partial response was achieved in 8 (40.0%) patients.CONCLUSION: DTX/CDGP therapy appears to be a tolerable regimen for cervical squamous cell carcinoma, even in patients previously treated by cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The recommended doses of DTX and CDGP were determined to be 60 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2, respectively.
18751422,1,2008,Anticancer Res,The significance of gastrectomy in advanced gastric cancer patients with non-curative factors.,BACKGROUND: The role of gastrectomy in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer patients with non-curative factors remains controversial. We investigated prognostic factors and evaluated the role of gastrectomy in such patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight advanced gastric cancer patients with non-curative factors were prospectively studied. The patients were categorized into the following two groups: Group A: 52 patients who underwent gastrectomy and subsequently received chemotherapy, Group B: 36 patients who received chemotherapy alone.RESULTS: The median survival times of group A and B patients were 351 and 182 days, respectively (p=0.008). Multivariate analysis showed that gastrectomy was the only positive independent prognostic factor, with no effect on the results of chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in the duration of hospital stay between patients of the two groups, while significantly longer maintenance of oral intake was observed for group A.CONCLUSION: In advanced gastric cancer patients with non-curative factors, gastrectomy was beneficial for survival with longer maintenance of oral intake.
18751418,1,2008,Anticancer Res,The impact of surgical treatment and poor prognostic factors for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: retrospective analysis of 60 patients.,BACKGROUND: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a primary adenocarcinoma of the liver arising from the intrahepatic bile duct. Hepatectomy with extensive lymph node dissection is the standard treatment for ICC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with ICC who underwent hepatectomy in our institution between 1986 and 2005 were investigated to determine prognostic factors and to evaluate the impact of surgical treatment for ICC using univariate and multivariate analyses.RESULTS: The overall survival rate of the R0 resection group (n=43) was significantly higher than that of the R1/2 group (n=17). However, in patients with lymph node metastasis (n=24), R0 resection had no survival impact. According to multivariate analysis, the independent factors of poor prognosis were: the presence of lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, poor differentiation and R1/2 resection.CONCLUSION: R0 resection can provide prolonged survival for patients with ICC. Patients with lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, or poorly differentiated ICC have poor prognosis after operation and additional treatment, such as adjuvant chemotherapy, is recommended.
18751413,1,2008,Anticancer Res,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (FAP) for advanced esophageal cancer.,This study was performed to assess the usefulness and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy utilizing the FAP regimen consisting of 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin and adriamycin for the treatment of highly advanced esophageal cancer. Twenty-seven patients with Stage III or more advanced esophageal cancer were enrolled in the study. The patients generally received two cycles of FAP. The response rate was as high as 55.6% and the resectability rate as high as 85.2%. All adverse events reported were mild in intensity. The histological effect was assessed as follows: Grade 1 in 18 patients, Grade 2 in 3 patients and Grade 3 (a pathological complete response) in 2 patients. All patients with nonresectable tumors died within 6 months, whereas of the 5 patients who responded with Grade 2 or better histological effects, all survived without recurrence for a follow-up period up to 60 months. The results of this study therefore showed the usefulness and safety of FAP therapy, which is considered to be a treatment method worth aggressively trying for highly advanced esophageal cancer in which a curative resection can hardly be expected.
18751409,1,2008,Anticancer Res,Value of serum S-100B for prediction of distant relapse and survival in stage III B/C melanoma.,BACKGROUND: The biochemical marker serum S-100B has been proven to reflect the stage of melanoma and to be useful for disease monitoring and prediction of survival, mainly in stage IV disease. For stage III melanoma, limited data are available and its predictive value for relapse is unknown. Serum S-100B was evaluated prospectively for monitoring response and its predictive value for relapse and overall survival in stage IIIB/C melanoma patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment consisted of one cycle of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemo(immuno)therapy, around surgery. S-100B was measured at enrollment and prior to and following surgery. The levels of S-100B in serum were compared to the pattern and intensity of the expression of S-100B in the melanoma tissue.RESULTS: Some patients with normal initial S-100B values (n=18) showed responses (3 complete remission and 2 partial remission), in contrast to patients with elevated S-100B values. Distant relapse within one year was found in 11/23 (48%) patients with increased S-100B versus 2/18 (11%) patients with a normal value (p=0.01). Overall survival was decreased in patients with increased S-100B compared to those with normal S-100B (p=0.02). Correlations between the pattern and intensity of S-100B expression in the tumor specimen and the value of serum the S-100B did not reach statistical significance.CONCLUSION: Serum S-100B is a valuable biomarker for the evaluation of response to treatment and prediction of early distant relapse and survival in stage IIIB/C melanoma. The marginal correlation between serum S-100B values and expression of S-100B in the tumor specimens needs further study.
18702679,1,2008,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Variations in the promoter of CYP21A2 gene identified in a Chinese patient with simple virilizing form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency.,OBJECTIVE: The variations in the transcriptional regulatory regions of CYP21A2 were rarely investigated in patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). The present study aims to verify that the variations in the promoter of CYP21A2 relate to the classical form of 21OHD.PATIENTS AND METHODS: CYP21A2 was screened for mutations in 20 patients with the simple virilizing form of 21OHD, including the promoter region. The transcriptional activities of the variants in the promoter were investigated using a dual-reporter luciferase assay system and electromobility gel shift assays.RESULTS: The heterozygous variants -447 A &gt; G, -443InsA, -306G &gt; C, -295T &gt; C, -294 A &gt; C, -283 A &gt; G, -281T &gt; G, -210T &gt; C, -199C &gt; T, -196 A &gt; T, -126C &gt; T, -113G &gt; A, -110T &gt; C, -103 A &gt; G and -4C &gt; T in the promoter of CYP21A2 gene were identified in a patient with simple virilizing form of 21OHD. The transcriptional activities of the promoter with the variants were reduced to 50% of the wild type.CONCLUSION: We speculated that the 15 variants in the promoter of CYP21A2 combined with a compound heterozygous mutation Q318X lead to a simple virilizing form of 21OHD.
18700762,1,2008,J Am Chem Soc,A Soret marker band for four-coordinate ferric heme proteins from absorption spectra of isolated Fe(III)-Heme+ and Fe(III)-Heme+(His) ions in vacuo.,In this work, we report the absorption spectra in the Soret band region of isolated Fe(III)-heme+ and Fe(III)-heme+(His) ions in vacuo from action spectroscopy. Fe(III)-heme+ refers to iron(III) coordinated by the dianion of protoporphyrin IX. We find that the absorption of the five-coordinate complex is similar to that of pentacoordinate metmyoglobin variants with hydrophobic binding pockets except for an overall blueshift of about 16 nm. In the case of four-coordinate iron(III), the Soret band is similar to that of five-coordinate iron(III) but much narrower. These spectra serve as a benchmark for theoretical modeling and also serve to identify the coordination state of ferric heme proteins. To our knowledge this is the first unequivocal spectroscopic characterization of isolated 4c ferric heme in the gas phase.
18652449,1,2008,Inorg Chem,New water soluble and luminescent platinum(II) compounds, vapochromic behavior of [K(H2O)][Pt(bzq)(CN)2], new examples of the influence of the counterion on the photophysical properties of d8 square-planar complexes.,This work describes the synthesis of compounds [Pt(C=N)(NCMe) 2]ClO 4 (C=N = 7,8-benzoquinolinato (bzq), 2-phenylpyridinato (ppy)) and their use as precursors for the preparation of the cyanido complexes [Pt(C=N)(CN) 2] (-), which were isolated as the potassium, [K(H 2O)][Pt(C=N)(CN) 2] [C=N = bzq ( 3a), ppy ( 4a)], and the tetrabutylammonium, NBu 4[Pt(C=N)(CN) 2] [C=N = bzq ( 5), ppy ( 6)], salts. The difference in the cation has an influence on the solubility, color, and emission properties of these compounds. Compounds 5 and 6 are yellow and soluble in organic solvents, while the potassium salts are also soluble in water and exhibit two forms: the water-containing [K(H 2O)][Pt(C=N)(CN) 2] [C=N = bzq ( 3a), ppy ( 4a)] complexes and the anhydrous ones K[Pt(C=N)(CN) 2] [C=N = bzq ( 3b), ppy ( 4b)], the former being strongly colored [red ( 3a) or purple ( 4a)] and the latter being yellow. Compounds 3a and 4a transform reversibly into the yellow, 3b and 4b, compounds upon desorption/ reabsorption of water molecules from the environment. The red solid, 3a, also exhibits vapochromic behavior when it is exposed to volatile organic compounds, the shortest response times being those observed for methanol and ethanol. UV-vis and emission spectra of all compounds were recorded both in solution and in the solid state. In methanol solution, the difference in the cation causes no differences in the absorption nor in the emission spectra, which is as expected for the monomer species. However, in the solid state, the differences are notable. For both the red ( 3a) and purple ( 4a) compounds, a prominent absorption, which has maxima at about 550 nm and is responsible for their intense colors, as well as a structureless emission at lambda &gt; 700 nm that suffers a significant red-shift upon cooling, are due to (1,3)MMLCT (= metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer) [dsigma*(Pt) --&gt; pi*(C=N)] transitions characteristic of linear-chain platinum complexes with short Pt...Pt contacts. Time-dependent density-functional theory calculations on complex 5 and the X-ray diffraction study on compound [K(OCMe 2) 2][Pt(ppy)(CN) 2] ( 4c) are also included.
18618323,1,2008,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Synthesis, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antioxidant activities of some tetrasubstituted thiophenes.,Sets of tetrasubstituted thiophene esters 4a-4g, 5a-5f and 6a-6e were synthesized by reaction of 1-(alpha-Carbomethoxy-beta-aminothiocrotonoyl)-aryl/aroyl amines (3) with 3-(bromoacetyl)coumarin, 1,4-dibromodiacetyl and chloroacetone respectively. The compound 3 were synthesized by nucleophilic addition of aryl/aroylisothiocyanate and enamine (2). The synthesized targeted compounds (4a-4g, 5a-5f and 6a-6e) were evaluated for their in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenin-induced rat hind paw oedema model at three graded doses employed at 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg body weight using mefanamic acid, ibuprofen and in vivo analgesic activity in acetic acid induced writhing response model at 10 mg/kg dose using ibuprofen as standard drug. The compounds 4a-4f, 5c, 5f, 6c and 6e were evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant nitric oxide radical scavenging assay at the concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 microg/mL using ascorbic acid as standard drug. Among all the targeted compounds 4c showed maximum anti-inflammatory activity of 71% protection at 10 mg/kg and 77% protection at 20 mg/kg to inflamed paw and analgesic activity of 56% inhibition and also maximum in vitro nitric oxide radical scavenging activity having IC(50) value 31.59 microg/mL.
18585438,1,2008,Biochim Biophys Acta,In silico description of differential enantioselectivity in methoxychlor O-demethylation by CYP2C enzymes.,Methoxychlor undergoes metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes forming a chiral mono-phenolic derivative (Mono-OH-M) as main metabolite. In the current study, members of the CYP2C family were examined for their chiral preference in Mono-OH-M formation. CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 possessed high enantioselectivity favoring the formation of S-Mono-OH-M; CYP2C3 showed no enantioselectivity, whereas CYP2C5 slightly favored the formation of R-Mono-OH-M. Molecular modeling calculations were utilized in order to explain the observed differences in chiral preference of CYP2C enzymes. Molecular docking calculations could describe neither the existence of chiral preference in metabolism, nor the enantiomer which is preferentially formed. Molecular dynamic calculations were also carried out and were found to be useful for accurate description of chiral preference in biotransformation of methoxychlor by CYP2C enzymes. An in silico model capable of predicting chiral preference in cytochrome P450 enzymes in general can be developed based on the analysis of the stability and rigidity parameters of interacting partners during molecular dynamic simulation.
18581824,1,2008,Health Care Manag Sci,Optimal inventory policy within hospital space constraints.,The materials management group at any hospital is responsible for ensuring that their inventory policies provide a good service in delivering products. The group also needs to be aware of their own costs for distribution, in terms of the frequency of delivery. With future changes to the hospital's infrastructure, function and size, the group require that these policies are reviewed and prepared for the changes taking place. For this, inventory policy models need to be built and used to anticipate the effect of these changes. Due to the importance of many products, high service levels are essential, yet there are often space and delivery constraints, limiting the amount of stock which can be held and delivered at each location. We present in this paper a new constraint-based model for determining optimal stock levels for all products at a storage location, with restrictions on space, delivery and criticality of items taken into account. We validate this model on sterile and bulk items in a real-life setting of an intensive care unit within Cork University Hospital, Ireland.
18574851,1,2008,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Facile one-pot synthesis and antimycobacterial evaluation of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines.,The present article describes a facile one-pot synthesis of a series of eight pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines 4a-h which were evaluated for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the Alamar-Blue susceptibility test and the activity expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in mg/mL. The compounds 4b, 4c, 4d, and 4g exhibited the best results (1.2 microg/mL) when compared with first-line drugs such as isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIP). Therefore, this class of compounds could be a good starting point to develop new lead compounds in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
18539029,1,2008,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Protein subtype-targeting through ligand epimerization: talose-selectivity of galectin-4 and galectin-8.,A series of O2 and O3-derivatized methyl beta-d-talopyranosides were synthesized and evaluated in vitro as inhibitors of the galactose-binding galectin-1, -2, -3, -4 (N- and C-terminal domains), 8 (N-terminal domain), and 9 (N-terminal domain). Galectin-4C and 8N were found to prefer the d-talopyranose configuration to the natural ligand d-galactopyranose configuration. Derivatization at talose O2 and/or O3 provided selective submillimolar inhibitors for these two galectins.
18496704,1,2008,Radiat Environ Biophys,Skin dose from neutron-activated soil for early entrants following the A-bomb detonation in Hiroshima: contribution from beta and gamma rays.,Epilation was reported among atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, including &quot;early entrance survivors&quot; who entered the cities after the bombings. The absorbed dose to the skin by neutron-activated soil via beta and gamma rays has been estimated in a preliminary fashion, for these survivors in Hiroshima. Estimation was done for external exposures from activated soil on the ground as well as skin and hair contamination from activated soil particles, using the Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNP-4C. Assuming 26 mum thickness of activated soil on the skin as an example, the skin dose was estimated to be about 0.8 Gy, for an exposure scenario that includes the first 7 days after the bombing at 1 m above the ground at the hypocenter. In this case, 99% of the total skin dose came from activated radionuclides in the soil, i.e., 0.19 and 0.63 Gy due to beta and gamma rays, respectively. In contrast, contribution to skin dose due to skin contamination with soil particles was found to be about 1%. To make it comparable to the exposure by neutron-activated soil on the ground, a soil thickness on the skin of about 1 mm would be required, which seems to be difficult to keep for a long time. Fifty-five percent of the 7-day skin dose was delivered during the first hour after the bombing. Our estimates of the skin dose are lower than the conventionally reported threshold of 2 Gy for epilation. It should be noted, however, that the possibility of more extreme exposure scenarios for example for entrants who received much heavier soil contamination on their skin cannot be excluded.
18491522,1,2008,Med Phys,Monte Carlo calculations and experimental measurements of dosimetric parameters of the IRA-103Pd brachytherapy source.,This article presents a brachytherapy source having 103Pd adsorbed onto a cylindrical silver rod that has been developed by the Agricultural, Medical, and Industrial Research School for permanent implant applications. Dosimetric characteristics (radial dose function, anisotropy function, and anisotropy factor) of this source were experimentally and theoretically determined in terms of the updated AAPM Task group 43 (TG-43U1) recommendations. Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate the dose rate constant. Measurements were performed using TLD-GR200A circular chip dosimeters using standard methods employing thermoluminescent dosimeters in a Perspex phantom. Precision machined bores in the phantom located the dosimeters and the source in a reproducible fixed geometry, providing for transverse-axis and angular dose profiles over a range of distances from 0.5 to 5 cm. The Monte Carlo N-particle (MCNP) code, version 4C simulation techniques have been used to evaluate the dose-rate distributions around this model 103Pd source in water and Perspex phantoms. The Monte Carlo calculated dose rate constant of the IRA-103Pd source in water was found to be 0.678 cGy h(-1) U(-1) with an approximate uncertainty of +/-0.1%. The anisotropy function, F(r, theta), and the radial dose function, g(r), of the IRA- 103Pd source were also measured in a Perspex phantom and calculated in both Perspex and liquid water phantoms.
18432667,1,2008,Curr Protoc Immunol,Monoclonal antibodies to rat leukocyte surface antigens, MHC antigens, and immunoglobulins.,The CD nomenclature used for human-leukocyte surface antigens is now being widely applied to naming their homologs in other species. This appendix catalogs those CD antigens that have been clearly defined in the rat. There are also many other antigens defined in the rat, but only those for which good biochemical data are available, such as amino acid sequences, are given here. The most commonly used antibodies are summarized.
18410089,1,2008,Inorg Chem,From large 12-membered macrometallacycles to ionic (NHC)2M+Cl- type complexes of gold and silver by modulation of the N-substituent of amido-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands.,A series of structurally diverse gold and silver complexes extending from ionic (NHC) 2M(+)Cl(-) (M=Au, Ag) type complexes to large 12-membered macrometallacycles have been prepared by the appropriate modification of the N-substituent of amido-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbenes. Specifically, the ionic, [1-(R)-3-{ N-(t-butylacetamido)imidazol-2-ylidene}]2M(+)Cl(-), (R=t-Bu, i-Pr; M=Au, Ag; 1b, 1c, 2b, 2c) complexes, were obtained in case of the N- t-butyl substituent of the amido-functionalized sidearm while 12-membered macrometallacycles, [1-(R)-3-{N-(2,6-di i-propylphenylacetamido)imidazol-2-ylidene}]2M2, (R=t-Bu, i-Pr; M=Au, Ag; 3b, 3c, 4b, 4c) were obtained in case of the 2,6-di i-propylphenyl N-substituent. These structurally diverse complexes of gold and silver were, however, prepared employing a common synthetic pathway involving the reactions of the imidazolium chloride salts (1a, 2a, 3a, 4a) with Ag2O to give the silver complexes (1b, 2b, 3b, 4b) and which, when treated with (SMe2)AuCl, gave the gold complexes (1c, 2c, 3c, 4c). Detailed density functional theory studies of 1b, 1c, 2b, 2c, 3b, 3c, 4b, and 4c were carried out to gain insight about the structure, bonding, and the electronic properties of these complexes. The NHC-metal interaction in the ionic 1b, 1c, 2b, and 2c complexes is primarily composed of the interaction of the carbene lone pair with the empty p orbital of the metal (5p for Ag and 6p for Au) while the same in the macrometallacyclic 3b, 3c, 4b, and 4c complexes consisted of the interaction of the carbene lone pair with the empty s orbital of the metal (5s for Ag and 6s for Au). The observation of a low energy emission in about the 580-650 nm region has been tentatively assigned to originate from the presence of weak metallophilic interaction in these macrometallacyclic 3b, 3c, 4b, and 4c complexes.
18375604,1,2008,J Exp Bot,Difference in light-induced increase in ploidy level and cell size between adaxial and abaxial epidermal pavement cells of Phaseolus vulgaris primary leaves.,Changes in nuclear DNA content and cell size of adaxial and abaxial epidermal pavement cells were investigated using bright light-induced leaf expansion of Phaseolus vulgaris plants. In primary leaves of bean plants grown under high (sunlight) or moderate (ML; photon flux density, 163 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) light, most adaxial epidermal pavement cells had a nucleus with the 4C amount of DNA, whereas most abaxial pavement cells had a 2C nucleus. In contrast, plants grown under low intensity white light (LL; 15 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) for 13 d, when cell proliferation of epidermal pavement cells had already finished, had a 2C nuclear DNA content in most adaxial pavement cells. When these LL-grown plants were transferred to ML, the increase in irradiance raised the frequency of 4C nuclei in adaxial but not in abaxial pavement cells within 4 d. On the other hand, the size of abaxial pavement cells increased by 53% within 4 d of transfer to ML and remained unchanged thereafter, whereas adaxial pavement cells continuously enlarged for 12 d. This suggests that the increase in adaxial cell size after 4 d is supported by the nuclear DNA doubling. The different responses between adaxial and abaxial epidermal cells were not induced by the different light intensity at both surfaces. It was shown that adaxial epidermal cells have a different property than abaxial ones.
18366178,1,2008,J Med Chem,Isoindolo[2,1-a]quinoxaline derivatives, novel potent antitumor agents with dual inhibition of tubulin polymerization and topoisomerase I.,Isoindoloquinoxalines 4 and 5 were obtained by refluxing 2-(2'-aminoaryl)-1-cyanoisoindoles 3a- e in acetic or formic acid. All derivatives were screened by the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD) for the in vitro one dose primary anticancer assay against a 3-cell line panel. Compounds 4a- e, screened against a panel of about 60 human tumor cell lines, showed remarkable antineoplastic activity; they had GI 50 values in the low micromolar or submicromolar range and reached, in the case of 4c, nanomolar concentrations on 88% of the 59 tested cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle after treatment with 4c demonstrated an arrest of the cell cycle in G2/M phase. This effect was accompanied with apoptosis of the cells, mitochondrial depolarization, generation of reactive oxygen species, and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Moreover, 4c induced a clear increase in the mitotic index, inhibited microtubule assembly in vitro, and interestingly also acted as a topoisomerase I inhibitor.
18366010,1,2008,Histol Histopathol,Cisplatin treatment of NIH/3T3 cultures induces a form of autophagic death in polyploid cells.,The effects induced by different concentrations (50, 75, 100 microM) of the cytostatic drug cisplatin (cDDP) in NIH/3T3 cells were analyzed. Sub-confluent cultures of this mouse fibroblast line, obtained after serum deprivation, showed the presence of aneuploid/polyploid cells with ploidy values ranging from 4c to 24c. DNA content cytofluorometry demonstrated that 50 and 75 microM cDDP induced a cytostatic effect; 100 microM concentration showed lower antiproliferative action. All treatments caused a partial cell detachment and apoptosis, the incidence of which appeared to be cDDP concentration-dependent. Ultrastructural and fluorescence microscopy integrated analyses of the still adherent cells demonstrated the presence of alternative degeneration patterns, especially in polyploid cells, with extensive modifications at both nuclear and cytoplasmic levels. There were events of micronucleation and phenomena of multilobulation and furrows of the nucleus that preceded the formation of heterogeneous fragments. These events were correlated, at cytoplasmic level, with actin reorganization and the appearance of autophagocytotic processes. In our cell model, the same pharmacological treatment was able to induce different cell death phenomena relating to cell dimension and ploidy. More actively proliferating cells (2c-4c DNA content) die throughout canonical apoptosis, while polyploid cells prevailingly degenerate by mechanisms partly referable to autophagic cell death.
18347800,1,2008,Plant Cell Rep,Chromosomal DNA content of sweet pepper determined by association of cytogenetic and cytometric tools.,The nuclear DNA content of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L. var. annuum, 2n = 24) has been measured by flow and image cytometries but the DNA content of each chromosome of this species has not yet been regarded. DNA content of individual chromosomes has been quantified by the flow karyotyping technique, which requires a great quantity of intact metaphasic chromosomes and methods that allow the characterization of individual chromosomes; however, the obtainment of adequate number of metaphases can be difficult in some species like C. annuum. In order to estimate the DNA content of each C. annuum var. annuum cv. &quot;New Mexican&quot; chromosome, flow and image cytometries were associated with the cytogenetic methodology. First, the DNA amount (2C = 6.90 pg) was established by flow cytometry. Integrated optical density (IOD) values were calculated by image cytometry for each Feulgen stained metaphasic chromosome. Then, by distributing the correspondent metaphasic value (4C = 13.80 pg) proportionally to average IOD values, the following chromosomal DNA contents were obtained in pg: 0.74 (chromosome 1), 0.67 (2), 0.61 (3, 4), 0.60 (5), 0.59 (6, 7), 0.58 (8), 0.57 (9), 0.56 (10) and 0.39 (11, 12). This study reports an alternative and reproducible technique that makes quantifying the chromosomal DNA content possible.
18301971,1,2008,J Bone Miner Metab,Expression profiles of phosphodiesterase 4D splicing variants in osteoblastic cells.,The promotion of osteoblastic differentiation by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) is accelerated by chemical compounds that increase the intracellular concentration of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP is synthesized from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by adenyl cyclase and degraded by phosphodiesterase (PDE) family enzymes. Inhibition of PDEs leads to prolonged accumulation of cAMP within cells and Camp-mediated reactions. Rolipram, a specific inhibitor of PDE4, is a compound effective in inducing osteoblastic differentiation. Four PDE4 family members are transcribed from four distinct genes (4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D). Expression of PDE4A and PDE4D has been observed in osteoblastic cells. We identified PDE4D splicing variants that expressed in ST2 or primary calvarial osteoblasts by rapid amplification of the 5'-ends of cDNA when they were cultured with BMP. PDE4D9 mRNA was identified from ST2, and PDE4D1 and -4D2 mRNAs were identified from primary calvarial osteoblasts. Expression of these three variants of PDE4D mRNA was found in ST2, MC3T3-E1, C3H10T1/2, C2C12, and primary calvarial osteoblasts by RT-PCR, but not PDE4D1 or -4D2 in ST2 or PDE4D2 in MC3T3-E1. Expression of these three variants was detectable in brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, placenta, and femur, and was thus ubiquitous. Purified recombinant PDE4D9 protein exhibited phosphodiesterase activity, which degraded cAMP to AMP, and this activity was inhibited by rolipram. These findings suggest that PDE4D1, -2, and -9 play some roles in bone formation.

18267947,1,2008,J Exp Bot,Regulation of cell cycle activity in the embryo of barley seeds during germination as related to grain hydration.,Various studies indicate that cell division is a post-germination phenomenon, with radicle protrusion occurring by cell elongation, while others demonstrate that induction of the cell cycle occurs in osmo-conditioned seeds prior to radicle growth. The aim of the present work was to investigate the occurrence of the cell cycle during germination as related to grain hydration, using: (i) a flow cytometry technique to estimate the percentage of cell nuclei in G(1) and G(2) phases of the cell cycle; and (ii) reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) in order to characterize the expression of the genes encoding cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKA1, CDKB1, and CDKD1) and cyclins (CYCA3, CYCB1, and CYCD4), the main genes involved in the cell cycle and its regulation. Radicle tips of embryos were isolated from seeds placed for various times on water at 30 degrees C and from grains partially hydrated at moisture contents ranging from 11% to 51% fresh weight (FW), which prevent radicle elongation. Abscisic acid (ABA) contents of the embryos during seed germination at 30 degrees C and after 48 h of partial hydration were also measured. In dry embryos, cells are mostly arrested in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle (82%), the remaining cells being in the G(2) phase, and the ABA content of the embryo was 432.7 ng g(-1) dry weight (DW). Seed imbibition was associated with a sharp decrease in ABA content as early as 5 h, while the cell cycle reactivation was a late process taking place approximately 4-6 h prior to radicle protrusion. Hydration of seeds resulted in a decrease in embryo ABA content, but it remained at a high level (207-273 ng g(-1) DW) even after 48 h at 0.41-0.51 g H2O g(-1) FW. The cell population of the radicle tips in the G(2) phase of the cell cycle, i.e. 4C nuclei, increased from 9% up to 34% at a moisture content of 51% FW. In dry seeds, CDKA1 and CDKD1 mRNAs were present at low levels, but transcripts of CDKB1, CYCA3, CYCB1, and CYCD4 were not detected. Radicle protrusion was associated with a higher expression of CDKA1, CDKB1, CYCA3, and CYCB1. Blockage of germination of partially hydrated grains resulted in a reduction in the expression of CDKA1 and CDKB1, and of CYCA3 and CYCB1, and in a reinforcement of that of CDKD1 and CYCD4. Patterns of gene expression show differential sensitivity of the genes studied to hydration of the grain. They will be discussed with regard to embryo ABA content and embryo sensitivity to ABA.
18182079,1,2008,Eur J Haematol,Haplotype analysis of the H63D, IVS2+4t/c, and C282Y polymorphisms of the HFE gene reveals rare events of intragenic recombination.,OBJECTIVE: Two missense mutations of the HFE gene, one (C282Y) being a major gene for hereditary hemochromatosis and the other (H63D) playing a minor role in this disease, are carried by different haplotypes. Among other sequence variants of HFE, IVS2+4t/c polymorphism has been reported as a possible splicing mutation or risk modifier. Our aims were to identify sequence variants possibly associated with iron overload in our population, to study the intragenic haplotypes of the HFE gene, and to evaluate the role of IVS2+4t/c in hyperferritinemia.METHODS: We screened by direct sequencing the coding sequence and intron-exon boundaries of HFE in 265 patients with hyperferritinemia and 185 subjects from the general population.RESULTS: Linkage disequilibrium between the three pairs of polymorphic sites was complete between H63D and C282Y, whereas all four gametic types were present for both the H63D-IVS2+4t/c and the IVS2+4t/c-C282Y site pairs. The data supported a model in which the IVS2+4t/c polymorphism was ancestral, the D(63) mutation occurred on the t chromosome, and the Y(282) mutation occurred on the c chromosome; after the population spread of both mutations, intragenic recombination occurred on both sides of the t/c polymorphism, generating the rare haplotypes D(63)-c(IVS2+4)-C(282) and H(63)-t(IVS2+4)-Y(282).CONCLUSIONS: The IVS2+4c/t is a neutral polymorphism with regard to risk of iron overload. The presence of recombinant haplotypes on both its sides suggests a considerable evolutionary age of the two main risk alleles.
18164720,1,2008,J Insect Physiol,Effects of high temperature on the hemocyte cell cycle in silkworm larvae.,To understand the inhibitory effects of high temperature on insect growth at the cellular level, we investigated the influence of high temperature on the proliferation and division of larval hemocytes in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Although the total number of hemocytes in the larval body increased enormously over time at 26 degrees C, no increase was observed at 38 degrees C. The number of mitotic hemocytes in circulation increased between days 1 and 2 of the fourth larval stage at 26 degrees C, whereas fewer hemocytes were observed at 38 degrees C. Laser scanning cytometry revealed that the DNA content of hemocytes collected from the fourth-stadium larvae was predominantly 2C, 4C, and 8C, and the proportion of each type of hemocyte changed dynamically with development during the fourth instar. Specifically, the proportion of hemocytes with a higher DNA content increased gradually during the feeding phase then decreased during the molting phase at 26 degrees C; in contrast, no decrease was observed at 38 degrees C. The heat-induced accumulation of 8C hemocytes was mainly detected in granulocytes and plasmatocytes. These data suggest that high temperatures induce a G(2) arrest in larval hemocytes.

The cation is linked by N-H⋯N hydrogen bonds to adjacent 4,4'-bipyridine mol-ecules, which in turn inter-act via O-H⋯N hydrogen bonds with 4-amino-benzoic acid mol-ecules, forming chains running parallel to [30]. The chains are further connected into a three-dimensional network by N-H⋯O and O-H⋯O hydrogen-bonding inter-actions involving the perchlorate anion, the water mol-ecules and the 4-amino-benzoic acid mol-ecules. In addition, π-π stacking inter-actions with centroid-centroid distances ranging from 3.663 (6) to 3.695 (6) Å are present. The O atoms of the perchlorate anion are disordered over two sets of positions, with refined site occupancies of 0.724 (9) and 0.276 (9).

The structure consists of infinite (Nb(2)AsO(14))(n) chains parallel to the b axis and cross-linked by corner sharing via pairs of edge-sharing octa-hedra. Each pair links together four infinite chains to form a three-dimensional framework. The K(+) and Ag(+) ions partially occupy several independent close positions in the inter-connected cavities delimited by the framework. K(0.8)Ag(0.2)Nb(4)O(9)AsO(4) is likely to exhibit fast alkali-ion mobility and ion-exchange properties. The Wyckoff symbols of special positions are as follows: one Nb 8e, one Nb 8g, As 4c, two K 8f, one Ag 8f, one Ag 4c, one O 8g, one O 4c.

The compounds possessing potent anti-inflammatory activity were further tested for their analgesic and ulcerogenic activities. Compounds 3-amino-6-(4-aryl)-9-(4-arylmethylene)-cyclopenta[5,6]pyrido[2,3-d][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrimidin-5(H)-one (4c), 1-amino-2-methyl-6-(4-aryl)-9-(4-aryl-methylene)-cyclopenta[5,6]pyrido[2,3-d]imidazolo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-5(H)-one (6a), 2-amino-5-(4-aryl)-8-(4-arylmethylene)-cyclopenta[5,6]pyrido-[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4(H)-one (9), 2-(3-amino-5-hydroxypyrazol- 1-yl)-5-(4-aryl)-8-(4-arylmethylene)-cyclopenta[5,6]-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(H)-one (10a) and 3-thioxo-6-(4-aryl)-9-(4-arylmethylene)-cyclopenta[5,6]pyrido[2,3-d]-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrimidin-5(H)-one (13) showed significant analgesic effects. Compound 2-(3-amino-5-hydroxypyrazol-1-yl)-5-(4-aryl)-8-(4-arylmethylene)-cyclopenta [5,6]pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(H)-one (10a) was evaluated as the lead compound having higher anti-inflammatory activity (82.8%) than ibuprofen (79.5%) and lower ulcerogenic effect.

19049026,0,2008,J Nanosci Nanotechnol,An atomic force microscopy study of the interactions between indolicidin and supported planar bilayers.,Indolicidin, a tryptophane-rich antimicrobial peptide, was used to investigate the interactions with a zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine as a model membrane system. In situ atomic force microscopy in liquid medium and phosphatidylcholine supported planar bilayers enabled the study of the interactions between indolicidin and the lipid membrane in real time. It was evident that indolicidin induced a continuous shrinking and thinning of the supported planar bilayers. The effect of indolicidin was dependent upon the composition and physical properties of the membrane bilayer. The interaction of indolicidine with the membrane could be best and most pronounced seen and studied at the boundary of the gel-fluid-domains. Dye leakage experiments with phosphatidylcholine vesicles encapsulated with calcein revealed that indolicidin induced fluidisation of the lipid membrane leading to dye release. The present study indicates that the mode of action for indolicidin can be best described by a stepwise interaction of the peptide with the membrane. Formation of pores however can not be supported on the basis of our experiments.
19041242,0,2008,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Design and synthesis of 4-aryl-4-oxobutanoic acid amides as calpain inhibitors.,The involvement of mu-calpain in neurological disorders, such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease has attracted considerable interest in the use of calpain inhibitors as therapeutic agents. 4-Aryl-4-oxobutanoic acid amide derivatives 4 were designed as acyclic variants of mu-calpain inhibitory chromone and quinolinone derivatives. Of the compounds synthesized, 4c-2, which possesses a 2-methoxymethoxy group at the phenyl ring and a primary amide at the warhead region most potently inhibited mu-calpain (IC(50)=0.34 microM). Our findings suggest that the 4-aryl-4-oxobutanoic acid amide derivatives should be considered as a new family of mu-calpain inhibitors.
19040116,0,2008,Z Naturforsch C,Genetic stability of micropropagated ginger derived from axillary bud through cytophotometric and RAPD analysis.,A protocol was developed for the in vitro propagation of ginger (Zingiber officinale) cv. Suprava using dormant axillary buds from unsprouted rhizomes. The dormant axillary buds embedded in the rhizome nodes were induced to sprout when cultured on MS medium supplemented with 6-benzyladenine (BA) alone (1-6 mg/1) or with a combination of BA (1-6 mg/1) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (0.5, 1 mg/l). In vitro sprouted buds were transferred to the multiplication medium containing various combinations of auxins and cytokinins. MS basal medium supplemented with BA (1 mg/l), IAA (1 mg/l) and adenine sulfate (100 mg/l) was found optimum for the in vitro multiplication of shoots producing (8.2 +/- 0.2) shoots from a single explant within 30 days of culture. The multiplication rate remained unchanged in subsequent subcultures. Rooting of shoots occurred in the same multiplication media. Upon transfer of the in vitro culture to ex vitro in pots, 96% of plants survived and established successfully under natural conditions. Tissue culture-raised plantlets of ginger could be conserved in vitro through subculturing at an interval of 4 months. The genetic stability of micropropagated clones was evaluated at regular intervals of 6 months up to 24 months in culture using cytophotometric estimation of 4C nuclear DNA content and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Cytophotometric analysis revealed a unimodal distribution of the DNA content with a peak corresponding to the 4C value (23.1 pg), and RAPD analysis revealed monomorphic bands showing the absence of polymorphism in all fifty regenerants analyzed, thus confirming the genetic uniformity among in vitro grown somaclones of Z. officinale. This study is of commercial significance as axillary bud explants are available throughout the year for initiating a fresh culture of the elite ginger cv. Suprava to be used as a source of true-to-type disease-free planting material thereby minimizing the adverse effect of repeated subculturing from the same explant source.
19003376,0,2008,Cytotechnology,Induction of Malathion resistance in CCE/CC128 cell line of Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata (Wied.)) (Diptera: Tephritidae).,The CCE/CC128 cell line, derived from fertilized eggs of theMediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), was used toinvestigate whether insect cells in culture could developresistance to Malathion. After 20 cycles of pulse-chasetreatment (28 h exposure to 90 mug/ml of Malathion and 48 hrecovery in normal medium), a Mal 90 selected population wasobtained. DNA content analysis showed that the values were distributed between levels 2C and 4C and no accumulation ofcells in a specific phase of the cell cycle was observed.Furthermore, preliminary molecular analysis showed noamplification of the esterase gene in resistant cells.Cross-resistance of Mal 90 cells towards other insecticides wasassayed and found to be absent. Our data support the idea thatthe medfly cell line and, more generally, insect cell cultures,could represent a promising system to investigate insecticideresistance mechanisms.
18986764,0,2008,J Hazard Mater,Thermophilic degradation of phenolic compounds in lab scale hybrid up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors.,This Study describes the feasibility of anaerobic degradation of United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) listed 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol (4C-2-NP), 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol (2C-4-NP), 2-chloro-5-methylphenol (2C-5-MP) from a simulated wastewater using four identical 7L bench scale hybrid up flow anaerobic sludge blankets (HUASBs) at five different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) under thermophilic condition (55+/-3 degrees C). The substrate to co-substrate ratios were maintained between 1:33.3 and 1:166.6. Continuous monitoring of parameters like pH, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation, oxidation reduction potential, chemical oxygen demand (COD), alkalinity, gas productions, methane percentages were carried out along with compound reduction to asses the efficiency of biodegradation. The compound reduction was estimated by using spectrophotometric methods and further validated with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Optimum HRT values were observed at 24h. Optimum ratio of substrate (phenolic compounds) to co-substrate (glucose) was 1:100. Scanning electron micrographs show that the granules were composed of thermophilic Methanobrevibacter and thermophilic Methanothrix like bacteria.
18953678,0,2008,Mol Biotechnol,RGD-IL-24, a novel tumor-targeted fusion cytokine: expression, purification and functional evaluation.,Targeting drugs to tumor cells is a central challenge for improving existing cancer therapies. ACDCRGDCFCG peptide (RGD-4C) binds to alphavbeta3 integrin, which is selectively expressed in tumor blood vessels and on the surface of some tumor cells. Interleukin 24 (IL-24) is a novel cancer growth-suppressing and apoptosis-inducing cytokine. To enhance the antitumor effect, we coupled RGD-4C to the N-terminus of IL-24 and expressed RGD-IL-24 in Escherichia coli. Cell proliferation and adhesion experiments revealed that RGD-IL-24 specifically binds to MCF-7 cancer cells, and induces apoptosis of MCF-7 cancer cells. These studies support the use of the RGD-IL-24 protein in tumor-targeting therapy.

18925732,0,2008,J Phys Chem A,Lithium salt electride with an excess electron pair--a class of nonlinear optical molecules for extraordinary first hyperpolarizability.,A new lithium salt electride with an excess electron pair is designed, for the first time, by means of doping two sodium atoms into the lithium salt of pyridazine. For this series of electride molecules, the structures with all real frequencies and the static first hyperpolarizability (beta 0) are obtained at the second-order Møller-Plesset theory (MP2). Pyridazine H 4C 4N 2 becomes the lithium salt of pyridazine Li-H 3C 4N 2 as one H atom is substituted by Li. The lithium salt effect on hyperpolarizability is observed as the beta 0 value is increased by about 170 times from 5 to 859 au. For the electride effect, an electride H 4C 4N 2...Na 2 formed by doping two Na atoms into pyridazine, the beta 0 value is increased by about 3000 times from 5 to 1.5 x 10 (4) au. Furthermore, combining these two effects, that is, lithium salt effect and electride effect, more significant increase in beta 0 is expected. A new lithium salt electride Li-H 3C 4N 2...Na 2 is thus designed by doping two Na atoms into Li-H 3C 4N 2. It is found that the new lithium salt electride, Li-H 3C 4N 2...Na 2, has a very large beta 0 value (1.412 x 10 (6) au). The beta 0 value is 2.8 x 10 (5) times larger than that of H 4C 4N 2, 1644 times larger than that of Li-H 3C 4N 2, and still 93 times larger than that of the electride H 4C 4N 2...Na 2. This extraordinary beta 0 value is a new record and comes from its small transition energy and large difference in the dipole moments between the ground state and the excited state. The frequency-dependent beta is also obtained, and it shows almost the same trends as H 4C 4N 2 &lt; Li-H 3C 4N 2 &lt; H 4C 4N 2...Na 2 &lt; Li-H 3C 4N 2...Na 2. This work proposes a new idea to design potential candidate molecules with high-performance NLO properties.

18844341,0,2008,Inorg Chem,Experimental and theoretical investigations of the redox behavior of the heterodichalcogenido ligands [(EP(i)Pr2)(TeP(i)Pr2)N](-) (E = S, Se): cyclic cations and acyclic dichalcogenide dimers.,The two-electron oxidation of the lithium salts of the heterodichalcogenidoimidodiphosphinate anions [(EP (i)Pr 2)(TeP (i)Pr 2)N] (-) ( 1a, E = S; 1b, E = Se) with iodine yields cyclic cations [(EP (i)Pr 2)(TeP (i)Pr 2)N] (+) as their iodide salts [(SP (i)Pr 2)(TeP (i)Pr 2)N]I ( 2a) and [(SeP (i)Pr 2)(TeP (i)Pr 2)N]I ( 2b). The five-membered rings in 2a and 2b both display an elongated E-Te bond as a consequence of an interaction between tellurium and the iodide anion. One-electron reduction of 2a and 2b with cobaltocene produces the neutral dimers (EP (i)Pr 2NP (i)Pr 2Te-) 2 ( 3a, E = S; 3b, E = Se), which are connected exclusively through a Te-Te bond. Two-electron reduction of 2a and 2b with 2 equiv of cobaltocene regenerates the corresponding dichalcogenidoimidodiphosphinate anions as ion-separated cobaltocenium salts Cp 2Co[(EP (i)Pr 2)(TeP (i)Pr 2)N] ( 4a, E = S; 4b, E = Se). The ditellurido analogue Cp 2Co[(TeP (i)Pr 2) 2N] ( 4c) has been prepared in the same manner for comparison. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the preferential interaction of the iodide anion with tellurium is determined by the polarization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital [sigma*(E-Te)] of the cations in 2a and 2b toward tellurium and that the formation of the dimers 3a and 3b with a central Te-Te linkage is energetically more favorable than the structural isomers with either E-Te or E-E bonds. Compounds 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, and 4c have been characterized in solution by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by X-ray crystallography.
18796168,0,2008,Epidemiol Infect,A survey of laboratory-confirmed isolates of invasive listeriosis in Israel, 1997-2007.,During the 11-year period from 1997 to 2007, 321 isolates of Listeria monocytogenes from sporadic cases of invasive listeriosis were reported to the national reference laboratory in Israel. Of these isolates, 113 (35%) were identified from perinatal cases, and 208 (65%) from non-perinatal cases. The prevalent serovars were 4b, 1/2b, 1/2a and 4c. Serovar 4b was identified in 80.5% of the perinatal isolates (P=0.0162), while the number of 1/2b and 1/2a strains increased in the &gt; or = 60 years old group (P=0.0285). Resistance to tetracycline was found in eight 4b isolates. The seasonal distribution showed that 206 isolates (64.2%) were submitted during the hot season (May-October). The estimated morbidity for the study period was 4.4 per million. The incidence of invasive listeriosis was higher in the perinatal group (5.6/100 000), than in individuals aged &gt; or = 60 years (1.5/100 000).
18787787,0,2008,Arch Pharm Res,Synthesis and cytotoxic activities of 2-alkyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-2,6,9-triazacyclopenta[b]anthracene-5,10-diones.,A series of 2-alkyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-2,6,9-triazacyclopenta[b]anthracene-5,10-diones (4a-f) were synthesized and their in vitro cytotoxic activities were evaluated against six human cancer cell lines (HCT15, SK-OV-3, A549, SNB19, MCF7 and MCF7/ADR). A number of compounds including 4c and 4d showed 2-180 times more potent cytotoxic activity than doxorubicin against all human cancer cell lines tested. Furthermore, these compounds retained considerable cytotoxic activity against the doxorubicin-resistant cell line MCF7/ADR, implying their therapeutic potential to treat doxorubicin-resistant tumors.

The standard molar enthalpies of formation of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (2HBA), 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (4HBA), 2'-hydroxyacetophenone (2HAP), 2-hydroxybenzamide (2HBM), and 4-hydroxybenzamide (4HBM), at 298.15 K, were determined by micro- or macrocombustion calorimetry. The corresponding enthalpies of vaporization or sublimation were also measured by Calvet drop-calorimetry and Knudsen effusion measurements. The combination of the obtained experimental data led to Delta f H m (o)(2HBA, g) = -238.3 +/- 2.5 kJ.mol (-1), DeltafHm(o)(4HBA, g) = -220.3 +/- 2.0 kJ.mol(-1), Delta f H m (o)(2HAP, g) = -291.8 +/- 2.1 kJ.mol(-1), DeltafHm(o)(2HBM, g) = -304.8 +/- 1.5 kJ.mol (-1), and DeltafHm(o) (4HBM, g) = -278.4 +/- 2.4 kJ.mol (-1). These values, were used to assess the predictions of the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p), B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ, B3P86/6-31G(d,p), B3P86/6-311+G(d,p), B3P86/aug-cc-pVDZ, and CBS-QB3 methods, for the enthalpies of a series of isodesmic gas phase reactions. In general, the CBS-QB3 method was able to reproduce the experimental enthalpies of reaction within their uncertainties. The B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) method, with a slightly poorer accuracy than the CBS-QB3 approach, achieved the best performance of the tested DFT models. It was further used to analyze the trends of the intramolecular O...H hydrogen bond in 2-HOC 6H 4C(O)Y evaluated by the ortho-para method and to compare the energetics of the phenolic O-H bond in 2- and 4-HOC 6H 4C(O)Y compounds. It was concluded that the O-H bond &quot;strength&quot; is systematically larger for 2-hydroxybenzoyl than for the corresponding 4-hydroxybenzoyl isomers mainly due to the presence of the intramolecular O...H hydrogen bond in the 2-isomers. The observed differences are, however, significantly dependent on the nature of the substituent Y, in particular, when an intramolecular H-bond can be present in the radical obtained upon cleavage of the O-H bond.

The compounds exhibit moderate antibacterial properties against gram-positive bacteria (MIC 6-100 microg ml(-1)) such as several bacilli, staphylococci and streptococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, while no inhibition of gram-negative Escherichia coli is detected up to the concentration of 100 microg ml(-1). Synergistic inhibitory activity occurs when sulfanilamides 4a and 4c are tested in combination with trimethoprim against S. aureus. Concerning antifungal properties, only compound 4c is able to inhibit the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cryptococcus neoformans yeasts and several dermatophytes. Structure-activity relationships are discussed.
18766222,0,2008,Dalton Trans,Unprecedented long-range 1,7-bromination in gold complexes of N-(aryl)imino functionalized N-heterocyclic carbenes.,An unique long-range 1,7-bromination reaction is observed in gold(III) complexes of N-(aryl)imino functionalized N-heterocyclic carbene with the bromination occurring at two different carbon (sp2 and sp3) centers spatially separated by ca. 6.4 A but existing in extended conjugation to each other. In particular, the unusual distant 1,7-brominated gold(III) complexes [1-R-3-{N-(p-bromo-2,6-di-i-propylphenylimino)-2-phenyl-1-bromoethyl}imidazol-2-ylidene]AuBr3 [R = Me (1d), i-Pr (2d), t-Bu (3d), -CH2Ph (4d)] were synthesized cleanly at room temperature under ambient conditions from the reactions of molecular bromine with the gold(I) complexes [1-R-3-{N-(2,6-di-i-propylphenylimino)-2-phenylethyl}imidazol-2-ylidene]AuCl [R = Me (1c), i-Pr (2c), t-Bu (3c), -CH2Ph (4c)]. All of the 1,7-bromination products (1d, 2d, 3d and 4d) have been structurally verified by X-ray diffraction studies.
18751444,0,2008,Anticancer Res,Paclitaxel and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in recurrent head and neck cancer: clinical and unexpected pharmacokinetic interactions.,BACKGROUND: The combination of paclitaxel (PTX) with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is an interesting treatment for recurrent head and neck cancer. The pharmacokinetic behavior may depend on the interval between the intravenous administration of the two drugs. This study evaluates the clinical efficacy, toxicity and any possible interval-dependent pharmacokinetic interactions.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients were randomized to receive 80 mg/m2 PTX weekly and 12.5 mg/m2 PLD every two weeks at administration intervals of 0, 1, 3, 12 or 24 hours. Blood sampling was performed at day 1 and 15 and pharmacokinetics of PTX, PLD and Cremophor EL were evaluated by non-compartmental analysis.RESULTS: Neutropenia was the most frequent side-effect (100% of patients; 30% grade 3-4). Hand-foot syndrome was severe in only 3% of patients. Overall response rate was 30%, with 3% complete responses and 27% partial responses. Stable disease and progression were 43% and 27%, respectively. Median response duration and overall median survival were 5.5 and 10 months respectively. Co-administration of PLD markedly reduced Cmax and the area under the curve (AUC), and increased PTX clearance. The differences in the PTX AUC and clearance between the 0 h and the 24 h experimental arms were statistically significant.CONCLUSION: The PTX/PLD combination plays a palliative role (clinical benefit in 73% of patients) and has good tolerability. The PTX pharmacokinetic profile was unexpectedly affected by different administration time intervals; in the 0 h arm the AUC was reduced to one fourth, therefore a schedule with PTX on day one, PLD on day two may be preferred.
18751436,0,2008,Anticancer Res,Squamous-cell carcinoma of the anus with high intratumoral lymphocytosis and its clinical implications.,BACKGROUND: It has been claimed that patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC) showing intraepithelial lymphocytes have a poor prognosis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The histological sections from 277 consecutive SCCAC were reviewed. Cases having a priori a high number of tumoral-intraepithelial lymphocytes (HTIL) were selected. The remaining cases showed only a few to none tumoral-intraepithelial lymphocytes.RESULTS: Eight patients (all females) representing 3% of the 277 SCCAC had HTIL. All these 8 patients with SCCAC/HTIL had clinical stage II and III while these stages comprised 83% of the remaining SCCAC cases.CONCLUSION: Despite the 8 SCCAC/HTIL patients having a more advanced clinical stage than the remaining 269 SCCAC patients, these 8 patients had longer survival. Between 5 and 15 years follow-up, all SCCAC/HTIL patients had survived, whereas during the same time interval 28 (10.4%) of the SCCAC patients without HTIL had died of their tumor.
18751434,0,2008,Anticancer Res,Preoperative transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) in the description of pelvic tumor spread in endometrial cancer: results of a prospective study.,BACKGROUND: Various diagnostic methods are applied preoperatively in patients with suspected and histologically proven endometrial cancer, but no standard diagnostic tool exists for the accurate preoperative evaluation of tumor spread and staging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of transvaginal sonography (TVS) as a staging tool, by determining tumor size and infiltration of the adjacent organs and correlating sonographic results to the respective intraoperative findings.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, thirty patients with endometrial cancer were included in the study prospectively. Systematic staging regarding tumor size (T), infiltration of the cervix (Cx) and ovaries (OV), peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), bladder invasion (BI), intestinal invasion (II) and ascites (A) was assessed using TVS. Findings of B-mode ultrasound imaging were compared to intraoperative findings and histopathological results.RESULTS: Preoperative diagnosis was correctly made by TVS in 93.4% of the patients [95% confidence interval (CI): 84%-100%]. Preoperative staging was correctly achieved by TVS for T in 73.3% [95% CI: 58%-89%], for Cx in 16.7% [95% CI: 13%-46%], for OV in 100%, for BI in 97% [95% CI: 90%-100%], for II in 97% [95% CI: 90%-100%], for PC in 90% [95% CI: 79%-100%] and for A in 100%.CONCLUSION: TVS is a sensitive and non-invasive method for preoperative diagnosis of suspected endometrial cancer. Of the tumors, 73% were correctly classified regarding size, whereas the detection rate of tumor spread in the ovaries and of ascites were high. Accuracy and sensitivity for the description of the infiltration of other adjacent organs, such as the bladder, intestine and peritoneal layers, were low. Further studies on the value of the combination of TVS and magnetic resonance imaging in the preoperative setting of patients with endometrial cancer are warranted.
18751430,0,2008,Anticancer Res,Clonazepam for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).,BACKGROUND: A 51-year-old woman experienced refractory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in spite of extensive antiemetic therapy, including 5-HT3 antagonists, corticosteroids, dopamine antagonists and antihistamines.CASE REPORT: We administered the patient clonazepam. After taking clonazepam, the patient fully recovered from the nausea and vomiting and never experienced them again.CONCLUSION: Clonazepam may be useful in the control of CINV. We believe that clonazepam contributed to the favorable outcome by expressing an anxiolytic and an anticonvulsant effect on myoclonus. The efficacy of clonazepam in this indication of prevention of CINV warrants further investigation.
18751424,0,2008,Anticancer Res,Urinary neopterin, hemoglobin and peripheral blood cell counts in breast carcinoma patients treated with dose-dense chemotherapy.,BACKGROUND: Among other actions, chemotherapy may induce an activation of systemic inflammatory and immune response.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Urinary neopterin was evaluated, using high-performance liquid chromatography, before and during dose-dense combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and sequential paclitaxel (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) in 194 patients with breast carcinoma. Hemoglobin, peripheral blood cell count and, in a subgroup of patients, iron metabolism were also evaluated.RESULTS: Urinary neopterin increased significantly during the chemotherapy. The increase in urinary neopterin was accompanied by a gradual decrease of hemoglobin. A marked increase in serum ferritin concentration was observed during the chemotherapy, along with fluctuations of iron concentrations. Among 161 patients treated with primary chemotherapy, the pathological response was evaluable in 150. Pathological complete response was observed in 37 cases (25%). In patients with pathological complete response, significantly lower serum ferritin concentrations were observed.CONCLUSION: Present data demonstrate the presence of systemic immune activation, reflected in increased urinary neopterin concentrations, in breast carcinoma patients treated with dose-dense chemotherapy. Lower ferritin concentrations were predictive of pathological complete response.
18751420,0,2008,Anticancer Res,Comparison of hyper-fractionated accelerated and standard fractionated radiotherapy with concomitant low-dose gemcitabine for unresectable pancreatic cancer.,BACKGROUND: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine improves median survival for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Recently, hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) has been used to treat these patients; however, the safety and efficacy are not well defined.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The standard-fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT) group (n=17) received 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of 1.8 Gy/day. The HART group (n=18) received 50 Gy in 40 fractions of 1.25 Gy twice/day. Concurrent gemcitabine was administered to both groups.RESULTS: Median survival times were 11.3 months (SFRT) and 12.9 months (HART). One- and two-year survival rates were 37.5% and 18.8% (SFRT) and 47.1% and 17.6% (HART), respectively. The response rates did not differ significantly. The HART regimen required significantly fewer treatment days (35.5) than did the SFRT regimen (41.3). The toxicity profiles were similar.CONCLUSION: The HART/gemcitabine regimen has equivalent efficacy and a shorter treatment time as compared with the SFRT/gemcitabine regimen for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.
18751417,0,2008,Anticancer Res,Craniofacial reconstructions with bone-anchored epithesis in head and neck cancer patients--a valid way back to self-perception and social reintegration.,BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced head and neck cancer often require radical and mutilating surgery resulting in severe impairment of their aesthetic self-perception and social life. Cosmetically satisfying results associated with high aesthetic self-perception and social reintegration are possible with bone-anchored epithesis representing a serious alternative to craniofacial reconstructive techniques using regional and free tissue transfer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five head and neck cancer patients treated in our Ear, Nose and Throat Department in the years 2003-2004 were evaluated after epithesial reconstruction.RESULTS: Three out of the five patients scored self-perception after epithesial reconstruction as &quot;very good&quot;, while social integration was scored as &quot;very good&quot; by three and as &quot;satisfactory&quot; by two patients. Daily getting along was scored as &quot;very good&quot; by four and as satisfactory by one patient. One patient had a very good acceptance of the epithesis as a part of the body and for four patients it was satisfactory.CONCLUSION: For the first time, the high degree of satisfaction in head and neck cancer patients receiving epithesial reconstruction in the maxillofacial region is demonstrated.
18751416,0,2008,Anticancer Res,Clinical significance and pathogenic function of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) in osteolytic mandibular squamous cell carcinoma.,BACKGROUND: Mandibular bone destruction is a frequent occurrence in oral squamous cell carcinoma. However, the relationship between the bone destruction and associated factors is unclear. Here, the role and diagnostic utility of connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) in bone destruction of the mandible was investigated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The production of CCN2 was explored by using immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissues from 20 cases of mandibular squamous cell carcinoma. The effect of CCN2 on osteoclastogenesis was examined in vitro by using total bone marrow cell populations from male mice.RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CCN2-positive signals were closely associated with destructive invasion of the mandible by oral squamous cell carcinomas. Consistent with these results, recombinant human CCN2 (rCCN2) stimulated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclast-like cell formation in vitro.CONCLUSION: CCN2 can be considered a diagnostic marker and target for treatment in oral osteolytic mandibular squamous cell carcinoma.
18751414,0,2008,Anticancer Res,Weekly irinotecan plus protracted venous fluorouracil infusion (WI-FI) in advanced colorectal cancer: a phase II study.,BACKGROUND: Irinotecan (IRI) is a topoisomerase I inhibitor active as first- or second-line chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer (ACRC). Its combination with fluorouracil (FU) increases the response rate and prolongs survival. In order to identify a new effective and less toxic schedule of administration, we planned this phase II study with weekly IRI and protracted venous infusion of FU (WI-FI regimen). The primary endpoint was the objective response rate. Secondary aims were to detect toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients (pts).MATERIALS AND METHODS: On May 2000, a monoinstitutional study commenced with the following schedule of administration: IRI 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 plus a 28-day protracted venous infusion of FU 200 mg/m2/day. The treatment was repeated every 35 days. Cycles were administered until a maximum of 6 courses, disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.RESULTS: By March 2005, 52 patients (30 males and 22 females) had entered the study. Their median age was 61.5 years and the median ECOG PS was 1. In total, 223 courses were administered (median 5 cycles/patient). Toxicity was low: neutropenia G3 and asthenia G3 were the most observed toxicities (5 pts each). No other grade 3-4 toxic side-effects were seen. Weekly IRI was interrupted in 11 pts, mostly related to problems with the central venous catheter. Following RECIST criteria, we observed 5 complete responses, 15 partial responses, 17 pts had stable disease, while in 15 disease progressed. The overall response rate was 38.5% and the disease control rate was 71.2%. Thirteen pts underwent surgical resection of their relapsing disease. The median PFS was 8.2 months and the median OS was 16.3 months.CONCLUSION: The WI-FI regimen is an active treatment with a good safety profile in patients with CRC. The low incidence of grade 3-4 toxicities justifies further evaluation of this combination.
18722768,0,2008,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Hexahydro-pyrrolo- and hexahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-b]pyridazin-2-ones as potent inhibitors of HCV NS5B polymerase.,Hexahydro-pyrrolo- and hexahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-b]pyridazin-2-one analogs were discovered as a novel class of inhibitors of genotype 1 HCV NS5B polymerase. Among these, compound 4c displayed potent inhibitory activities in biochemical and replicon assays (IC(50) (1b) &lt;10 nM; EC(50) (1b)=34 nM) as well as good stability towards human liver microsomes (HLM t(1/2) =59 min).
18688406,0,2008,Dalton Trans,Synthesis of palladium(II) complexes containing a new alpha-D-xylofuranose-modified diphosphine and their application as catalyst precursors in the co- and terpolymerization of CO-ethene and propene.,The diphosphine 3,5-dideoxy-1,2-O-isopropylidene-3,5-bis(di(2-methoxyphenyl)phosphanyl)-alpha-D-xylofuranose (o-MeO-xylophos), which differs from the known 3,5-dideoxy-1,2-O-isopropylidene-3,5-bis(diphenylphosphanyl)-alpha-D-xylofuranose (xylophos) by the presence of 2-methoxy substituents on the P-aryl rings, has been synthesized and characterized. These two ligands have been employed to stabilize the Pd(II) complexes [PdCl2(o-MeO-xylophos)] (1a), [PdCl2(xylophos)] (2a), [PdClMe(o-MeO-xylophos)] (1b), [PdClMe(xylophos)] (2b), [Pd(OTs)(H2O)(o-MeO-xylophos)](OTs) (1c) and [Pd(OTs)(H2O)(xylophos)](OTs) (2c). All complexes have been characterized by multinuclear-NMR spectroscopy. The solid-state structure of 1a has been determined by a single crystal X-ray analysis. The Pd-aqua complexes 1c and 2c have been employed to catalyse the CO-ethene and CO-propene copolymerization as well as the CO-ethene-propene terpolymerization reaction in MeOH. The catalytic activity and the molecular weight of the polyketones have been compared to those of the products obtained with analogous catalysts, [Pd(H2O)2(o-MeO-dppp)](OTs)2 (3c) and [Pd(H2O)(OTs)(dppp)](OTs) (4c), bearing the classical 1,3-bis(diphenylphoshino)propane ligand (dppp). Under comparable catalytic conditions, all catalysts produce structurally similar polymeric materials, with 1c yielding the largest propene incorporation as well as the highest productivity of low-molecular-weight terpolymers.
18608741,0,2008,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Design, synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel tetrasubstituted thiophene analogues as anti-inflammatory agents.,A new series of tetrasubstituted thiophene analogues (4a-4f, 5a-5f and 8a-8i) were designed incorporating the pharmacophoric features of COX-1 (as in fenamates), 5-LOX and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitors. The designed series was synthesized by nucleophilic addition of aryl/aroylisothiocyanate and enamine (2) yielding the addition product l-(alpha-Carbomethoxy-beta-aminothiocrotonoyl)-aryl/aroyl amines (3/7); which on reaction with substituted phenacyl bromides gave the targeted tetrasubstituted thiophene esters (4a-4f / 8a-8i). The tetrasubstituted thiophenes esters (4a-4f ) on hydrolysis with one equivalent of potassium hydroxide solution in methanol at room temperature gave corresponding acids (5a-5f ). All the targeted compounds were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenin-induced rat hind paw oedema model at the doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg body weight using standard drugs mefanamic acid and ibuprofen. The compounds (4c, 4e, 4f, 5f, 8a- 8i) which gave reasonable protection to the inflamed paw, eliciting good or moderate comparable anti-inflammatory activity were selected for investigating their analgesic activity using acetic acid induced writhing response test in albino mice at 10 mg/kg dose using standard drug ibuprofen and in order to arrive at possible mechanism of their anti-inflammatory activity, in vitro antioxidant nitric oxide radical scavenging assay at the concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 microg/mL were performed using standard drug ascorbic acid.
18537226,0,2008,J Phys Chem A,Reactivity of niobium-carbon cluster ions with hydrogen molecules in relation to formation mechanism of Met-Car cluster ions.,It is known that a niobium-carbon Met-Car cluster ion (Nb 8C 12 (+)) and its intermediates (Nb 4C 4 (+), Nb 6C 7 (+), etc.) are selectively formed by the aggregation of the Nb atoms in the presence of hydrocarbons. To elucidate the formation mechanism, we prepared Nb n C m (+) with every combination of n and m in the gas phase by the laser vaporization technique. The reactivity of Nb n C m (+) with H 2 was examined under the multiple collision condition, finding that Nb n C m (+) between Nb 2C 3 (+) and Nb 8C 12 (+) are not reactive with H 2. On the basis of the H 2 affinity of Nb n C m (+) experimentally obtained, we propose a dehydrogenation-controlled formation mechanism of niobium-carbon Met-Car cluster ions.
18524320,0,2008,Arch Latinoam Nutr,[Validity of an equation based on anthropometry to estimate body fat in older adults].,A prediction equation to estimate body fat mass from skinfold thickness for healthy elderly was developed using a four compartmental (4C) model as criterion method. This study included 202 subjects = 60 y old. The measurements of total body water, bone mineral content and body density were included in the 4C model equation. Total sample was randomly partitioned. Sub-sample one was used to design the equations, which were applied in sub-sample two. Its accuracy and precision was evaluated by lineal regression analysis and the bias by Bland and Altman analysis and simple lineal regression. The best model included body mass, sex and the calf and triceps skinfolds thicknesses, with an R2, standard error of the estimate and Cp of 0.85, 3.2 and 3.2, respectively. When the equation was applied in sub-sample two, it was accurate and precise, it showed no significant deviation from the line of identity (the intercept was no significantly different from zero, P&gt;0.05), and slope was different from cero (or similar to 1) (P&lt;0.05). Fat mass by the equation accounted for 86% of the variability of the mean fat mass estimated by the 4C model, having a low standard error of the estimate (3.2 kg) and low pure error (3.1 kg). The new equation was accurate and precise as well as free of significant bias in men and women together and for separately. This equation can be a good option to estimate fat mass in elderly men and women with similar physical characteristics to subjects of this study, and it can be used in clinical and epidemiological studies in this growing group.
18494451,0,2008,J Phys Chem A,Electronic structures and spin topologies of gamma-picoliniumyl radicals. A study of the homolysis of N-methyl-gamma-picolinium and of benzo-, dibenzo-, and naphthoannulated analogs.,Radicals resulting from one-electron reduction of (N-methylpyridinium-4-yl) methyl esters have been reported to yield (N-methylpyridinium-4-yl) methyl radical, or N-methyl-gamma-picoliniumyl for short, by heterolytic cleavage of carboxylate. This new reaction could provide the foundation for a new structural class of bioreductively activated, hypoxia-selective antitumor agents. N-methyl-gamma-picoliniumyl radicals are likely to damage DNA by way of H-abstraction and it is of paramount significance to assess their H-abstraction capabilities. In this context, the benzylic C-H homolyses were studied of toluene (T), gamma-picoline (P, 4-methylpyridine), and N-methyl-gamma-picolinium (1c, 1,4-dimethylpyridinium). With a view to providing capacity for DNA intercalation the properties also were examined of the annulated derivatives 2c (1,4-dimethylquinolinium), 3c (9,10-dimethylacridinium), and 4c (1,4-dimethylbenzo[g]quinolinium). The benzylic C-H homolyses were studied with density functional theory (DFT), perturbation theory (up to MP4SDTQ), and configuration interaction methods (QCISD(T), CCSD(T)). Although there are many similarities between the results obtained here with DFT and CI theory, a number of significant differences occur and these are shown to be caused by methodological differences in the spin density distributions of the radicals. The quality of the wave functions is established by demonstration of internal consistencies and with reference to a number of observable quantities. The analysis of spin polarization emphasizes the need for a clear distinction between &quot;electron delocalization&quot; and &quot;spin delocalization&quot; in annulated radicals. Aside from their relevance for the rational design of new antitumor drugs, the conceptional insights presented here also will inform the understanding of ferromagnetic materials, of spin-based signaling processes, and of spin topologies in metalloenzymes.
18469585,0,2008,Health Phys,Modification to the Monte Carlo N-particle code for simulating direct, in vivo measurement of stable lead in bone.,Monte Carlo N-Particle version 4C (MCNP4C) was used to simulate photon interactions associated with in vivo x-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement of stable lead in bone. Experimental measurements, performed using a cylindrical anthropometric phantom (i.e., surrogate) of the human leg made from tissue substitutes for muscle and bone, revealed a significant difference between the intensity of the observed and predicted coherent backscatter peak. The observed difference was due to the failure of MCNP4C to simulate photon scatter associated with greater than six inverse angstroms of momentum transfer. The MCNP4C source code, photon directory, and photon library were modified to incorporate atomic form factors up to 7.1 inverse angstroms for the high Z elements defined in the K XRF simulation. The intensity of the predicted coherent photon backscatter peak at 88 keV using the modified code increased from 3.50 x 10(-9) to 8.59 x 10(-7) (roughly two orders of magnitude) and compares favorably with the experimental measurements.
18444561,0,2008,Mikrobiyol Bul,[Investigation of Listeria monocytogenes serotype O antibodies in maternal and cord sera and the evaluation of risk factors for listeriosis in pregnant women].,Listeria monocytogenes may lead to intrauterine infections which can be treated if diagnosed promptly. However, there is not a rapid routine screening test with high specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of listeriosis during pregnancy. We investigated the presence of different L. monocytogenes O antibodies for diagnosis of listeriosis in 275 paired maternal-cord sera using the agglutination test, and aimed to evaluate the correlation between poor pregnancy outcomes, level of L. monocytogenes serotype O antibodies and risk factors for listeriosis. Maternal-cord bloods were collected from a total of 275 pregnant women (age range 16-38 years) between April-August 2002 from a State Hospital in Ankara. A total of 550 sera were tested against antigens with the O formulation of serotypes 1/2c, 3b, 4ab, 4c, 4d by tube agglutination method and titers &gt; or = 1/320 were considered as positive. Sixtynine patients with the history of poor pregnancy outcomes were in group I, while 206 patients with no obstetric pathology in previous pregnancies were in group II. L. monocytogenes antibodies to one or more serotypes were detected in 21.5% (59/275) of the patients, the rate being 20.3% in group I and 21.8% in group II. No statistically significant difference was detected between the two study groups (p &gt; 0.05), indicating that this test was not an appropriate marker for the diagnosis of listeriosis during pregnancy. The total rate of positive results in cord sera was 0.7% (2/275) and the positive two sera were from samples in group II. The follow-up of the newborns, including the two cord blood positive ones, revealed no fetomaternal infection. The most frequently detected serotypes were 4ab (40%) and 1/2c (37%). Risk factors such as non-specific febrile illness during pregnancy (p &lt; 0.001), consumption of ready-made food (p = 0.008), consumption of raw milk and milk products (p &lt; 0.001) were found to be related to the presence of &gt; or = 1/320 titers of L. monocytogenes antibodies. The major limiting factor in this study was the inability to obtain second serum samples from the mothers and newborns following delivery, to confirm the diagnosis by seroconversion. These results emphasize the need for the development of rapid, simple and reliable tests, alternative to culture methods, for the early and proper diagnosis of Listeria infections during pregnancy.

18387806,0,2008,Appl Radiat Isot,Experimental measurements and Monte Carlo calculations of dosimetric parameters of the IRA1-103Pd brachytherapy source.,This work presents a brachytherapy source having (103)Pd adsorbed onto a cylindrical silver rod that has been developed by Agricultural, Medical and Industrial Research School for permanent implant applications. Dosimetric characteristics (dose-rate constant, radial dose function, anisotropy function and anisotropy factor) of this source were experimentally and theoretically determined in terms of the updated AAPM Task Group 43 (TG-43U1) recommendations. Measurements were performed using TLD-GR200A circular chip dosimeters using standard methods employing thermoluminescent dosimeters in a Perspex phantom. Precision machined bores in the phantom located dosimeters and source in a reproducible fixed geometry providing for transverse-axis and angular dose profiles over a range of distances from 0.5 to 5 cm. The Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code, version 4C was used to evaluate the dose-rate distributions around this model (103)Pd source in water and Perspex phantoms. The Monte Carlo calculated dose-rate constant of the IRA1-(103)Pd source in water was found equal to Lambda=0.669 cGy/h/U with approximate uncertainties of +/-0.1%. The anisotropy function, F(r, theta), and the radial dose function, g(L)(r), of the IRA1-(103)Pd source were also measured in Perspex phantom and calculated in both Perspex and liquid water phantom.

Complex 3 {[Au2L(1-Ph)Cl2], where L(1-Ph) is bis(phenylthio)methane}and complexes 4a and 4b consist of nearly identical 1D supramolecular polymers formed through Au-Au interactions. The third polymorph, 4c, is a molecular complex, as it does not have metal-metal interactions. Complex 5 {[Au2L(4-Ph)Cl2], where L(4-Ph) is 1,4-bis(phenylthio)butane} is also molecular. UV-vis spectra showed that the absorption bands of these complexes are allowed ligand-centered transitions between 230 and 260 nm. Complexes 1, 2, and 6 {[AuL(3-Me)Cl], where L(3-Me) is 1,3-bis(methylthio)propane} exhibited solid-state luminescence at 5 K with vibronic progressions and band maxima at approximately 570 nm. It is suggested that complex 6 contains [Au-Au-](infinity) chains.
18327506,0,2008,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,Individual serological follow-up of patients with suspected or confirmed abdominal angiostrongyliasis.,Abdominal angiostrongyliasis (AA) is a zoonotic nematode infection caused by Angiostrongylus costaricensis, with widespread occurrence in the Americas. Although the human infection may be highly prevalent, morbidity is low in Southern Brazil. Confirmed diagnosis is based on finding parasitic structures in pathological examination of biopsies or surgical resections. Serology stands as an important diagnostic tool in the less severe courses of the infection. Our objective is to describe the follow up of humoral reactivity every 2-4 weeks up to one year, in six individuals with confirmed (C) and ten suspected (S) AA. Antibody (IgG) detection was performed by ELISA and resulted in gradually declining curves of reactivity in nine subjects (56%) (4C + 5S), that were consistently negative in only three of them (2C + 1S) after 221, 121 and 298 days. Three individuals (2C + 1S) presented with low persistent reacitivity, other two (1C + 1S) were serologically negative from the beginning, but also presenting a declining tendency. The study shows indications that abdominal angiostrongyliasis is usually not a persistent infection: although serological negativation may take many months, IgG reactivity is usually declining along time and serum samples pairing may add valuable information to the diagnostic workout.
18316139,0,2008,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis of 1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-3-methylene-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one derivatives and in vitro anticancer evaluation against SW620 colon cancer cell line.,A small library of 2-indolinone derivatives with the 2,6-dichlorophenyl ring at the N(1) position and with varying substitutions including aryl groups at the 3-position were synthesized, and their structures were confirmed by spectral analysis. All molecules were screened for their in vitro cytotoxic activity on SW620 colon cancer cell lines. Among the designed series compounds 4c, 4f and 4j were found to be active at concentrations of 2-15 microg/ml. Some 3D-QSAR models were also built to understand the structure-activity relationship.
18268376,0,2008,J Radiol Prot,Improving the safety of a body composition analyser based on the PGNAA method.,The 252Cf radioisotope and 241Am-Be are intense neutron emitters that are readily encapsulated in compact, portable and sealed sources. Some features such as high flux of neutron emission and reliable neutron spectrum of these sources make them suitable for the prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) method. The PGNAA method can be used in medicine for neutron radiography and body chemical composition analysis. 252Cf and 241Am-Be sources generate not only neutrons but also are intense gamma emitters. Furthermore, the sample in medical treatments is a human body, so it may be exposed to the bombardments of these gamma-rays. Moreover, accumulations of these high-rate gamma-rays in the detector volume cause simultaneous pulses that can be piled up and distort the spectra in the region of interest (ROI). In order to remove these disadvantages in a practical way without being concerned about losing the thermal neutron flux, a gamma-ray filter made of Pb must be employed. The paper suggests a relatively safe body chemical composition analyser (BCCA) machine that uses a spherical Pb shield, enclosing the neutron source. Gamma-ray shielding effects and the optimum radius of the spherical Pb shield have been investigated, using the MCNP-4C code, and compared with the unfiltered case, the bare source. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that an optimised gamma-ray shield for the neutron source in a BCCA can reduce effectively the risk of exposure to the 252Cf and 241Am-Be sources.
18237021,0,2008,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Synthesis, antifungal and antioxidant screening of some novel benzimidazole derivatives.,Some novel benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized and their in vitro effects on rat liver microsomal NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation (LP) level, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and antifungal activities were determined. A significant decrease in male rat liver microsomal LP level was noted by compounds 4c (52%), 4e (58%) and 4h (43%) at 10(-3) M concentration. Compounds 4c (100.0%), 4h (100.0%), 5c (98.0%) and 5h (100.0%) inhibited the microsomal ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) enzyme activity better than that of the specific inhibitor caffeine (85%). Among these compounds, only compounds 4b and 4h exhibited moderate activity against C. albicans whereas the others had weak effects.
18189408,0,2008,Org Lett,Synthesis and characterization of cyclic alkyl tetraynes.,Cyclic (4a-e) and linear (10) tetraynes have been studied. Macrocycles 4a-e are unstable to isolation as neat compounds, but 4b-e have been characterized in solution. 13C NMR spectroscopy shows a consistent downfield shift of the acetylenic resonances of 4c-e as ring strain increases. UV-vis spectroscopy demonstrates that ring strain has little effect on the HOMO-LUMO gap. X-ray crystallography of tetrabromoolefin 6b confirms the monomeric constitution of the precursors.
18179202,0,2008,Inorg Chem,Synthesis, structures, and kinetics of mixed-donor amido-amino-siloxo ligands from symmetrical diamidosilyl ether ligands via a retro-brook rearrangement.,Deprotonation of the new (R = propyl, 3,5-Me(2)Ph) and previously prepared (R = 2,4,6-Me(3)Ph, 2,6-(i)Pr(2)Ph, 3,5-(CF(3))(2)Ph) symmetrical diamidosilyl ether ligand precursors {[RNHSiMe(2)](2)O} with 2 equiv of nBuLi in THF resulted in a new class of mixed-donor amido-amino-siloxo ligands of the form {RNLiSiMe(2)N(R)SiMe(2)OLi} (R= propyl (1c), 3,5-Me(2)Ph (2c), 2,4,6-Me(3)Ph (3c), 2,6-(i)Pr(2)Ph (4c), 3,5-(CF(3))(2)Ph (5c)) in one-step and high yield via a retro-Brook-type rearrangement mechanism. Ligands 1c, 3c, and 4c have been structurally characterized in the presence and absence of THF/ether donor solvents and exhibited a range of aggregated structures with ring-laddering, ring-stacking, and cubane motifs; higher-nuclearity clusters for base-free systems were observed for 1c and 4c. 1H, (7)Li, and selected (13)C{(1)H} NMR spectra in THF-d(8) and toluene-d(8) are described; the (7)Li data are indicative of intramolecular fluxional behavior as a function of temperature but do not shed light on the nuclearity of the salts in solution. Reaction kinetics were investigated by variable-temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy and showed that the rate of rearrangement reactions increases with decreasing steric hindrance and with increasing electron-donating ability of the R substituents, with tau(1/2) values ranging from 5.7 x 10(1) to 1.5 x 10(8) s for 2c and 5c, respectively.
23074512,0,2008,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,Limbal stem cell transplantation: an evidence-based analysis.,OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis is to systematically review limbal stem cell transplantation (LSCT) for the treatment of patients with limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). This evidence-based analysis reviews LSCT as a primary treatment for nonpterygium LSCD conditions, and LSCT as an adjuvant therapy to excision for the treatment of pterygium.CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION The outer surface of the eye is covered by 2 distinct cell layers: the corneal epithelial layer that overlies the cornea, and the conjunctival epithelial layer that overlies the sclera. These cell types are separated by a transitional zone known as the limbus. The corneal epithelial cells are renewed every 3 to 10 days by a population of stem cells located in the limbus. NONPTERYGIUM LIMBAL STEM CELL DEFICIENCY: When the limbal stem cells are depleted or destroyed, LSCD develops. In LSCD, the conjunctival epithelium migrates onto the cornea (a process called conjunctivalization), resulting in a thickened, irregular, unstable corneal surface that is prone to defects, ulceration, corneal scarring, vascularization, and opacity. Patients experience symptoms including severe irritation, discomfort, photophobia, tearing, blepharospasm, chronic inflammation and redness, and severely decreased vision. Depending on the degree of limbal stem cell loss, LSCD may be total (diffuse) or partial (local). In total LSCD, the limbal stem cell population is completed destroyed and conjunctival epithelium covers the entire cornea. In partial LSCD, some areas of the limbus are unharmed, and the corresponding areas on the cornea maintain phenotypically normal corneal epithelium. Confirmation of the presence of conjunctivalization is necessary for LSCD diagnosis as the other characteristics and symptoms are nonspecific and indicate a variety of diseases. The definitive test for LSCD is impression cytology, which detects the presence of conjunctival epithelium and its goblet cells on the cornea. However, in the opinion of a corneal expert, diagnosis is often based on clinical assessment, and in the expert's opinion, it is unclear whether impression cytology is more accurate and reliable than clinical assessment, especially for patients with severe LSCD. The incidence of LSCD is not well understood. A variety of underlying disorders are associated with LSCD including chemical or thermal injuries, ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, multiple surgeries or cryotherapies, contact lens wear, extensive microbial infection, advanced ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, and aniridia. In addition, some LSCD cases are idiopathic. These conditions are uncommon (e.g., the prevalence of aniridia ranges from 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 100,000 people). PTERYGIUM: Pterygium is a wing-shaped fibrovascular tissue growth from the conjunctiva onto the cornea. Pterygium is the result of partial LSCD caused by localized ultraviolet damage to limbal stem cells. As the pterygium invades the cornea, it may cause irregular astigmatism, loss of visual acuity, chronic irritation, recurrent inflammation, double vision, and impaired ocular motility. Pterygium occurs worldwide. Incidence and prevalence rates are highest in the &quot;pterygium belt,&quot; which ranges from 30 degrees north to 30 degrees south of the equator, and lower prevalence rates are found at latitudes greater than 40 degrees. The prevalence of pterygium for Caucasians residing in urban, temperate climates is estimated at 1.2%. EXISTING TREATMENTS OTHER THAN TECHNOLOGY BEING REVIEWED: NONPTERYGIUM LIMBAL STEM CELL DEFICIENCY: In total LSCD, a patient's limbal stem cells are completely depleted, so any successful treatment must include new stem cells. Autologous oral mucosal epithelium transplantation has been proposed as an alternative to LSCT. However, this procedure is investigational, and there is very limited level 4c evidence() to support this technique (fewer than 20 eyes examined in 4 case series and 1 case report). For patients with partial LSCD, treatment may not be necessary if their visual axis is not affected. However, if the visual axis is conjunctivalized, several disease management options exist including repeated mechanical debridement of the abnormal epithelium; intensive, nonpreserved lubrication; bandage contact lenses; autologous serum eye drops; other investigational medical treatments; and transplantation of an amniotic membrane inlay. However, these are all disease management treatments; LSCT is the only curative option. PTERYGIUM: The primary treatment for pterygium is surgical excision. However, recurrence is a common problem after excision using the bare sclera technique: reported recurrence rates range from 24% to 89%. Thus, a variety of adjuvant therapies have been used to reduce the risk of pterygium recurrence including LSCT, amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT), conjunctival autologous (CAU) transplantation, and mitomycin C (MMC, an antimetabolite drug). NEW TECHNOLOGY BEING REVIEWED: To successfully treat LSCD, the limbal stem cell population must be repopulated. To achieve this, 4 LSCT procedures have been developed: conjunctival-limbal autologous (CLAU) transplantation; living-related conjunctival-limbal allogeneic (lr-CLAL) transplantation; keratolimbal allogeneic (KLAL) transplantation; and ex vivo expansion of limbal stem cells transplantation. Since the ex vivo expansion of limbal stem cells transplantation procedure is considered experimental, it has been excluded from the systematic review. These procedures vary by the source of donor cells and the amount of limbal tissue used. For CLAU transplants, limbal stem cells are obtained from the patient's healthy eye. For lr-CLAL and KLAL transplants, stem cells are obtained from living-related and cadaveric donor eyes, respectively. In CLAU and lr-CLAL transplants, 2 to 4 limbal grafts are removed from the superior and inferior limbus of the donor eye. In KLAL transplants, the entire limbus from the donor eye is used. The recipient eye is prepared by removing the abnormal conjunctival and scar tissue. An incision is made into the conjunctival tissue into which the graft is placed, and the graft is then secured to the neighbouring limbal and scleral tissue with sutures. Some LSCT protocols include concurrent transplantation of an amniotic membrane onto the cornea.REGULATORY STATUS: Health Canada does not require premarket licensure for stem cells. However, they are subject to Health Canada's clinical trial regulations until the procedure is considered accepted transplantation practice, at which time it will be covered by the Safety of Human Cells, Tissues and Organs for Transplantation Regulations (CTO Regulations).REVIEW STRATEGY: The Medical Advisory Secretariat systematically reviewed the literature to assess the effectiveness and safety of LSCT for the treatment of patients with nonpterygium LSCD and pterygium. A comprehensive search method was used to retrieve English-language journal articles from selected databases. The GRADE approach was used to systematically and explicitly evaluate the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: NONPTERYGIUM LIMBAL STEM CELL DEFICIENCY: The search identified 873 citations published between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2008. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, and 1 additional citation was identified through a bibliography review. The review included 10 case series (3 prospective and 7 retrospective). Patients who received autologous transplants (i.e., CLAU) achieved significantly better long-term corneal surface results compared with patients who received allogeneic transplants (lr-CLAL, P&lt; .001; KLAL, P&lt; .001). There was no significant difference in corneal surface outcomes between the allogeneic transplant options, lr-CLAL and KLAL (P = .328). However, human leukocyte antigen matching and systemic immunosuppression may improve the outcome of lr-CLAL compared with KLAL. Regardless of graft type, patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome had poorer long-term corneal surface outcomes. Concurrent AMT was associated with poorer long-term corneal surface improvements. When the effect of the AMT was removed, the difference between autologous and allogeneic transplants was much smaller. Patients who received CLAU transplants had a significantly higher rate of visual acuity improvements compared with those who received lr-CLAL transplants (P = .002). However, to achieve adequate improvements in vision, patients with deep corneal scarring will require a corneal transplant several months after the LSCT. No donor eye complications were observed. Epithelial rejection and microbial keratitis were the most common long-term complications associated with LSCT (complications occurred in 6%-15% of transplantations). These complications can result in graft failure, so patients should be monitored regularly following LSCT. PTERYGIUM: The search yielded 152 citations published between January 1, 2000 and May 16, 2008. Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated LSCT as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of pterygium met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Limbal stem cell transplantation was compared with CAU, AMT, and MMC. The results showed that CLAU significantly reduced the risk of pterygium recurrence compared with CAU (relative risk [RR], 0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.69; P = .02). CLAU reduced the risk of pterygium recurrence for primary pterygium compared with MMC, but this comparison did not reach statistical significance (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.21-1.10; P = .08). Both AMT and CLAU had similar low rates of recurrence (2 recurrences in 43 patients and 4 in 46, respectively), and the RR was not significant (RR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.37-9.5; P = .45).

17971780,107,2007,Nat Methods,An evaluation of 3C-based methods to capture DNA interactions.,The shape of the genome is thought to play an important part in the coordination of transcription and other DNA-metabolic processes. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology allows us to analyze the folding of chromatin in the native cellular state at a resolution beyond that provided by current microscopy techniques. It has been used, for example, to demonstrate that regulatory DNA elements communicate with distant target genes through direct physical interactions that loop out the intervening chromatin fiber. Here we discuss the intricacies of 3C and new 3C-based methods including the 4C, 5C and ChIP-loop assay.
17512929,94,2007,Exp Cell Res,Novel functions of vimentin in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling.,Vimentin is the major intermediate filament (IF) protein of mesenchymal cells. It shows dynamically altered expression patterns during different developmental stages and high sequence homology throughout all vertebrates, suggesting that the protein is physiologically important. Still, until recently, the real tasks of vimentin have been elusive, primarily because the vimentin-deficient mice were originally characterized as having a very mild phenotype. Recent studies have revealed several key functions for vimentin that were not obvious at first sight. Vimentin emerges as an organizer of a number of critical proteins involved in attachment, migration, and cell signaling. The highly dynamic and complex phosphorylation of vimentin seems to be a likely regulator mechanism for these functions. The implicated novel vimentin functions have broad ramifications into many different aspects of cell physiology, cellular interactions, and organ homeostasis.
18031686,80,2007,Neuron,Gain modulation by nicotine in macaque v1.,Acetylcholine is a ubiquitous cortical neuromodulator implicated in cognition. In order to understand the potential for acetylcholine to play a role in visual attention, we studied nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) localization and function in area V1 of the macaque. We found nAChRs presynaptically at thalamic synapses onto excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons in the primary thalamorecipient layer 4c. Furthermore, consistent with the release enhancement suggested by this localization, we discovered that nicotine increases responsiveness and lowers contrast threshold in layer 4c neurons. We also found that nAChRs are expressed by GABAergic interneurons in V1 but rarely by pyramidal neurons, and that nicotine suppresses visual responses outside layer 4c. All sensory systems incorporate gain control mechanisms, or processes which dynamically alter input/output relationships. We demonstrate that at the site of thalamic input to visual cortex, the effect of this nAChR-mediated gain is an enhancement of the detection of visual stimuli.
17914062,62,2007,Neurology,Randomized controlled trial of an oral CGRP receptor antagonist, MK-0974, in acute treatment of migraine.,OBJECTIVE: To determine an effective and tolerable dose of a novel oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, MK-0974, for the acute treatment of migraine.METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical trial with a two-stage, adaptive, dose-ranging design. Patients were allocated to treat a moderate or severe migraine attack with MK-0974 (25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, or 600 mg), rizatriptan 10 mg, or placebo taken orally. The primary endpoint was pain relief (reduction to mild or none) 2 hours after dosing. Secondary endpoints included pain freedom at 2 hours and sustained pain relief at 24 hours. A prespecified, blinded, automated interim analysis was used to discontinue randomization to less effective doses.RESULTS: Per the adaptive study design, the four lowest MK-0974 groups (25, 50, 100, 200 mg) were discontinued due to insufficient efficacy. For the remaining treatment groups, the estimated pain relief proportions at 2 hours were 300 mg (n = 38) 68.1%, 400 mg (n = 45) 48.2%, 600 mg (n = 40) 67.5%, rizatriptan 10 mg (n = 34) 69.5%, and placebo (n = 115) 46.3%. The prespecified primary efficacy hypothesis test, which compared the average 2-hour pain relief response proportion of the combined 300, 400, and 600 mg MK-0974 groups to placebo, was significant (P = 0.015). A generally similar efficacy pattern was seen for other endpoints. MK-0974 was generally well tolerated and there did not appear to be an increase in adverse events with increasing dose.CONCLUSIONS: The novel, orally administered calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, MK-0974, was effective and generally well tolerated for the acute treatment of migraine.
17412895,39,2007,Stem Cells,Targeted delivery of CX3CL1 to multiple lung tumors by mesenchymal stem cells.,MSCs are nonhematopoietic stem cells capable of differentiating into various mesoderm-type cells. MSCs have been considered to be a potential vehicle for cell-based gene therapy because MSCs are relatively easily expanded in vitro and have the propensity to migrate to and proliferate in the tumor tissue after systemic administration. Here, we demonstrated the tropism of mouse MSCs to tumor cells in vitro and multiple tumor tissues in the lung after i.v. injection of green fluorescent protein-positive MSCs in vivo. We transduced CX3CL1 (fractalkine), an immunostimulatory chemokine, to the mouse MSCs ex vivo using an adenoviral vector with the Arg-Gly-Asp-4C peptide in the fiber knob. Intravenous injection of CX3CL1-expressing MSCs to the mice bearing lung metastases of C26 and B16F10 cells strongly inhibited the development of lung metastases and thus prolonged the survival of these tumor-bearing mice. This antitumor effect depended on both innate and adaptive immunity. These results suggest that MSCs can be used as a vehicle for introducing biological agents into multiple lung tumor tissues. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.
17898211,34,2007,J Neurosci,Complete pattern of ocular dominance columns in human primary visual cortex.,The occipital lobes were obtained after death from six adult subjects with monocular visual loss. Flat-mounts were processed for cytochrome oxidase (CO) to reveal metabolic activity in the primary (V1) and secondary (V2) visual cortices. Mean V1 surface area was 2643 mm2 (range, 1986-3477 mm2). Ocular dominance columns were present in all cases, having a mean width of 863 microm. There were 78-126 column pairs along the V1 perimeter. Human column patterns were highly variable, but in at least one person they resembled a scaled-up version of macaque columns. CO patches in the upper layers were centered on ocular dominance columns in layer 4C, with one exception. In this individual, the columns in a local area resembled those present in the squirrel monkey, and no evidence was found for column/patch alignment. In every subject, the blind spot of the contralateral eye was conspicuous as an oval region without ocular dominance columns. It provided a precise landmark for delineating the central 15 degrees of the visual field. A mean of 53.1% of striate cortex was devoted to the representation of the central 15 degrees. This fraction was less than the proportion of striate cortex allocated to the representation of the central 15 degrees in the macaque. Within the central 15 degrees, each eye occupied an equal territory. Beyond this eccentricity, the contralateral eye predominated, occupying 63% of the cortex. In one subject, monocular visual loss began at age 4 months, causing shrinkage of ocular dominance columns. In V2, which had a larger surface area than V1, CO stripes were present but could not be classified as thick or thin.

However, the relative contributions of thermal and cavitational effects are poorly defined. We characterized the ultrasound parameters within which tissue ablation occurs by cavitational mechanisms without significant thermal effect.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro porcine kidneys were submerged in degassed water. Tissue ablation was performed by delivering ultrasound (750 kHz and 20 microsecond pulses) of constant spatial peak energy dose (100 J/cm(2)) to adjacent foci in a 3 x 3 grid configuration. For each ablation different intensity (0.11 to 211 kW/cm(2)) and duty cycle (0.04% to 100%) parameters were selected. A thermocouple co-localized with the center of each grid continuously measured temperature. Following ablation each kidney was examined grossly and histologically.RESULTS: Ablated tissue lesions were classified into 4 discrete morphological categories, including blanched--firm, pale, desiccated tissue, disrupted--a cavity containing thin, isochromatic liquid, mixed--a cavity containing pale, thick liquid with minimal blanching and no grossly visible effect. Morphologically similar lesions clustered at separable regions of the ultrasound parameter space. The maximal temperature attained in disrupted lesions was similar to that attained when there was no effect (44.2C and 47.2C, respectively, p = 0.31), although it was significantly lower than the maximal temperatures for desiccated or mixed lesions (67.5C and 59.4C, each p &lt;0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: In an in vitro model we defined the ultrasound parameter region within which purely cavitational ablation of tissue is possible with a negligible thermal component. Additional research is needed to optimize the parameters for in vivo cavitational tissue ablation, incorporating the influence of tissue perfusion.
18082199,29,2007,J Urol,Selective prostate cancer thermal ablation with laser activated gold nanoshells.,PURPOSE: Laser activated gold nanoshell thermal ablation represents a new, minimally invasive technology that offers benign tissue sparing thermal ablation of malignant tumors. We evaluated the efficacy of this technology for eradicating prostate cancer in a subcutaneous tumor model.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 110 nm gold nanoshells with a 10 nm gold shell are designed to act as intense near infrared absorbers. PC-3 cells were injected on the dorsum of nude mice in 3 groups, including 1-gold nanoshell plus near infrared laser, 2-saline alone and 3-near infrared laser alone. Animals received 7.0 ml/gm body weight (low dose) or 8.5 ml/gm body weight (high dose) nanoshells via tail vein injection. Control animals received saline. A 810 nm near infrared laser with a 200 mu laser fiber and an energy setting of 4 W/cm(2) was aimed at the tumor bed for 3 minutes. Tumors were measured at days 0, 7, 14 and 21. Tissue temperature was monitored during laser activation. Tumors were harvested at day 21 and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide diaphorase activity.RESULTS: We observed 93% tumor necrosis and regression in the high dose treated group. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide staining corroborated this finding. The ablation zone was sharply limited to the laser spot size. There was no difference in the size or tumor histology in control groups, indicating a benign course for near infrared laser treatment alone. Temperatures up to 65.4C were attained in the treated group.CONCLUSIONS: Laser activated gold nanoshell ablation is an effective and selective technique for prostate cancer ablation in an ectopic murine tumor model.
17958892,23,2007,Arthritis Res Ther,Cartilage markers and their association with cartilage loss on magnetic resonance imaging in knee osteoarthritis: the Boston Osteoarthritis Knee Study.,We used data from a longitudinal observation study to determine whether markers of cartilage turnover could serve as predictors of cartilage loss on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We conducted a study of data from the Boston Osteoarthritis of the Knee Study (BOKS), a completed natural history study of knee osteoarthritis (OA). All subjects in the study met American College of Rheumatology criteria for knee OA. Baseline and follow-up knee magnetic resonance images were scored for cartilage loss by means of the WORMS (Whole Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score) semiquantitative grading scheme. Within the BOKS population, 80 subjects who experienced cartilage loss and 80 subjects who did not were selected for the purposes of this nested case control study. We assessed the baseline levels of cartilage degradation and synthesis products by means of assays for type I and II cleavage by collagenases (Col2:3/4C(short) or C1,2C), type II cleavage only with Col2:3/4C(longmono) (C2C), type II synthesis (C-propeptide), the C-telopeptide of type II (Col2CTx), aggrecan 846 epitope, and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). We performed a logistic regression to examine the relation of levels of each biomarker to the risk of cartilage loss in any knee. All analyses were adjusted for gender, age, and body mass index (BMI); results stratified by gender gave similar results. One hundred thirty-seven patients with symptomatic knee OA were assessed. At baseline, the mean (standard deviation) age was 67 (9) years and 54% were male. Seventy-six percent of the subjects had radiographic tibiofemoral OA (Kellgren &amp; Lawrence grade of greater than or equal to 2) and the remainder had patellofemoral OA. With the exception of COMP, none of the other biomarkers was a statistically significant predictor of cartilage loss. For a 1-unit increase in COMP, the odds of cartilage loss increased 6.09 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34 to 27.67). After the analysis of COMP was adjusted for age, gender, and BMI, the risk for cartilage loss was 6.35 (95% CI 1.36 to 29.65). Among subjects with symptomatic knee OA, a single measurement of increased COMP predicted subsequent cartilage loss on MRI. The other biochemical markers of cartilage synthesis and degradation do not facilitate prediction of cartilage loss. With the exception of COMP, if changes in cartilage turnover in patients with symptomatic knee OA are associated with cartilage loss, they do not appear to affect systemic biomarker levels.
17686908,22,2007,J Neurophysiol,Response facilitation from the &quot;suppressive&quot; receptive field surround of macaque V1 neurons.,In primary visual cortex (V1), neuronal responses to optimally oriented stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are usually suppressed by iso-oriented stimuli in the RF surround. The mechanisms and pathways giving rise to surround modulation, a possible neural correlate of perceptual figure-ground segregation, are not yet identified. We previously proposed that highly divergent and fast-conducting top-down feedback connections are the substrate for fast modulation arising from the more distant regions of the surround. We have recently implemented this idea into a recurrent network model (Schwabe et al. 2006). The purpose of this study was to test a crucial prediction of this feedback model, namely that the suppressive &quot;far&quot; surround of V1 neurons can be facilitatory under conditions that weakly activate neurons in the RF center. Using single-unit recordings in macaque V1, we found iso-orientation far-surround facilitation when the RF center was driven by a low-contrast stimulus and the far surround by a small annular stimulus. Suppression occurred when the center stimulus contrast or the size of the surround stimulus was increased. This suggests that center-surround interactions result from excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms of similar spatial extent, and that changes in the balance of local excitation and inhibition, induced by surround stimulation, determine whether facilitation or suppression occurs. In layer 4C, the main target of geniculocortical afferents, lacking long-range intra-cortical connections, far-surround facilitation was rare and large surround fields were absent. This strongly suggests that feedforward connections do not contribute to far-surround modulation and that the latter is generated by intra-cortical mechanisms, likely involving top-down feedback.
17884460,18,2007,Curr Opin Genet Dev,Inter-chromosomal gene regulation in the mammalian cell nucleus.,Cellular phenotypes can critically rely on mono-allelic gene expression. Recent studies suggest that in mammalian cells inter-chromosomal DNA interactions may mediate the decision which allele to activate and which to silence. Here, these findings are discussed in the context of knowledge on gene competition, chromatin dynamics, and nuclear organization. We argue that data obtained by 4C technology strongly support the idea that chromatin folds according to self-organizing principles. In this concept, the nuclear positioning of a given locus is probabilistic as it also depends on the properties of neighbouring DNA segments and, by extrapolation, the whole chromosome. The linear distribution of repetitive DNA sequences and of active and inactive DNA regions is important for the folding and relative positioning of chromosomes. This stochastic concept of nuclear organization predicts that tissue-specific interactions between two selected loci present on different chromosomes will be rare.
17804740,16,2007,Cancer Res,ICOVIR-5 shows E2F1 addiction and potent antiglioma effect in vivo.,During 2007, approximately 200,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with brain tumors. Gliomas account for 77% of primary malignant brain tumors, and the prognosis has hardly changed in the past 20 years, with only 30% of patients with malignant glioma surviving 5 years after diagnosis. Oncolytic adenoviruses are promising therapies for the treatment of gliomas. Here, report the antiglioma activity of the tumor-selective ICOVIR-5 adenovirus, which encompasses an early 1A adenoviral (E1A) deletion in the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein-binding region, substitution of the E1A promoter for E2F-responsive elements, and an RGD-4C peptide motif inserted into the adenoviral fiber to enhance adenoviral tropism. Mechanistic studies showed a dramatic addiction of ICOVIR-5 to the E2F1 oncogene in vitro and in vivo. This addiction was mediated by the occupancy of the ectopic adenoviral E2F1-responsive elements by the endogenous E2F1 protein resulting in high level of E1A expression in cancer cells and potent antiglioma effect. Importantly, we showed for the first time the ability of oncolytic adenoviruses to enhance E2F transcriptional activity in vivo, and we provided direct evidence of the interaction of the E2F1 protein with native and ectopic adenovirus promoters. Restoration of Rb function led to the association of Rb/E2F1 repressor complexes with ICOVIR-5 ectopic E2F1 promoter and subsequent down-modulation of E1A, dramatically impairing adenoviral replication. In xenografted mice, intratumoral injection of ICOVIR-5 resulted in a significant improvement of the median survival (P &lt; 0.0001), and furthermore, led to 37% of long-term survivors free of disease. The antitumor activity of ICOVIR-5 suggests that it has the potential to be an effective agent in the treatment of gliomas.
17531417,16,2007,Eur J Radiol,Observer variability of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) for breast ultrasound.,PURPOSE: To evaluate inter- and intra-observer variabilities in breast sonographic feature analysis and management, using the fourth edition of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 136 patients with 150 breast lesions who underwent breast ultrasound (US) and ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy. A pathological diagnosis was available for all 150 lesions: 77 (51%) malignant and 73 (49%) benign. Four radiologists retrospectively reviewed sonographic images of lesions twice within an 8-week interval. The observers described each lesion, using BI-RADS descriptors and final assessment. Inter- and intra-observer variabilities were assessed with Cohen's kappa statistic. Positive predictive value and negative predictive value (NPV) for final assessment were also calculated.RESULTS: For inter-observer agreements for sonographic descriptors, substantial agreement for lesion calcification and final assessment (kappa=0.61 for both), moderate agreement for lesion shape, orientation, boundary, and posterior acoustic features (kappa=0.49, 0.56, 0.59, and 0.49, respectively), and fair agreement for lesion margin and echo pattern (kappa=0.33 and 0.37, respectively) were obtained. For intra-observer agreement, substantial to perfect agreement was found for almost all lesion descriptors and final assessments. NPV for final assessment category 3 was 95%. Positive predictive value (PPV) for final assessment categorized as 4 or 5 were as follows: category 4a, 26%; category 4b, 89%; category 4c, 90%; and category 5, 97%.CONCLUSION: Because inter- and intra-observer agreement with the BI-RADS lexicon for US is good, the use of BI-RADS lexicon can provide accurate and consistent description and assessment for breast US.
17627557,15,2007,Curr Top Med Chem,An update in the development of HIV entry inhibitors.,HIV entry and fusion are two steps in the viral life cycle that can be targeted by several classes of antiviral drugs. The discovery of chemokines focused the attention on cellular coreceptors used by the virus for entering within cells, and to the various steps of such processes which are subject to interactions with small molecules. Intense research led to a wide range of effective compounds that are able to inhibit these initial steps of viral replication. All steps in the process of HIV entry into the cell may be targeted by specific compounds that may be developed as novel types of antiretrovirals. Thus, several inhibitors of the gp120-CD4 interaction have been detected so far (zintevir, FP-21399 and BMS-378806 in clinical trials). Small molecule chemokine receptor antagonists acting as HIV entry inhibitors also were described in the last period, which interact both with the CXCR4 coreceptor (such as AMD3100; AMD3465; ALX40-4C; T22, T134 and T140), or which are antagonist of the CCR5 coreceptor (TAK-779, TAK-220, SCH-C, SCH-D, E913, AK-602 and NSC 651016 in clinical trials), together with new types of fusion inhibitors possessing the same mechanism of action as enfuvirtide (such as T1249). Recently, a third family of antivirals started to be used clinically (in addition to the reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors), with the advent of enfuvirtide (T20), the first fusion inhibitor to be approved as an anti-HIV agent. Some of these compounds demonstrated in vitro synergism with other classes of antivirals, offering thus the rationale for their combination in therapies for HIV-infected individuals. Many HIV entry and fusion inhibitors are currently investigated in controlled clinical trials, and there are a number of them that is bioavailable as oral formulations. This is an essential feature for an extended use of these compounds with the purpose of ameliorating adherence of patients to these medications and preventing the development of drug resistance.
17588938,15,2007,J Biol Chem,Voltage-independent sodium-binding events reported by the 4B-4C loop in the human glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter 3.,Glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporter (EAATs)) are critical for normal excitatory signaling and maintaining subtoxic glutamate concentrations in mammalian central nervous system. Recently, a crystal structure for a homologous transporter in bacteria was reported. Still, little is understood regarding the mechanism of substrate uptake. In transmembrane domain 4, the mammalian EAATs contain a stretch of over 50 amino acids (4B-4C loop) that are absent in the bacterial protein. These residues have been suggested to be located in the large extracellular vestibule seen in the crystal structure. State-dependent trypsin-cleavage sites have been reported in this region, suggesting that the 4B-4C loop undergoes significant conformational changes. Here we employed substituted cysteine accessibility, voltage clamp fluorometry, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer on oocytes expressing mutant EAAT3 transporters to determine the location and functionality of the 4B-4C loop. We find that this loop extends from near the center of the protein and that the majority of the residues are positioned on the outer perimeter of the protein, rather than inside the vestibule. Our fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements demonstrated that these residues do not undergo large scale motions during glutamate uptake. However, our voltage clamp fluorometry studies indicate that these residues report on Na(+) and glutamate binding-induced conformational changes, including a previously un-described voltage-independent component of Na(+) binding to the transporter. The finding that residues far from the glutamate-binding site report on several different types of binding events suggests that the series of small conformational changes that accomplish glutamate uptake extend throughout the transporter structure.
17467258,15,2007,Curr Opin Cell Biol,Long-range DNA contacts: romance in the nucleus?,Recent studies show that genes far apart on the same chromosome or even on different chromosomes can come together in the nuclear space. It has been hypothesized that functionally related genes 'kiss' at transcription factories to coordinate their expression. Novel high-throughput methods, such as 4C technology, that study DNA interactions in an unbiased manner should uncover the generality of this romantic concept of nuclear architecture.
17554007,13,2007,J Neurosci,Plexin-B2, but not Plexin-B1, critically modulates neuronal migration and patterning of the developing nervous system in vivo.,Semaphorins and their receptors, plexins, have emerged as important cellular cues regulating key developmental processes. B-type plexins directly regulate the actin cytoskeleton in a variety of cell types. Recently, B-type plexins have been shown to be expressed in striking patterns in the nervous system over critical developmental windows. However, in contrast to the well characterized plexin-A family, the functional role of plexin-B proteins in neural development and organogenesis in vertebrates in vivo is not known. Here, we have elucidated the functional contribution of the two neuronally expressed plexin-B proteins, Plexin-B1 or Plexin-B2, toward the development of the peripheral nervous system and the CNS by generating and analyzing constitutive knock-out mice. The development of the nervous system was found to be normal in mice lacking Plexin-B1, whereas mice lacking Plexin-B2 demonstrated defects in closure of the neural tube and a conspicuous disorganization of the embryonic brain. After analyzing mutant mice, which bypassed neural tube defects, we observed a key requirement for Plexin-B2 in proliferation and migration of granule cell precursors in the developing dentate gyrus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. Furthermore, we identified semaphorin 4C as a high-affinity ligand for Plexin-B2 in binding and functional assays. Semaphorin 4C stimulated activation of ErbB-2 and RhoA via Plexin-B2 and enhanced proliferation and migration of granule cell precursors. Semaphorin 4C-induced proliferation of ventricular zone neuroblasts was abrogated in mice lacking Plexin-B2. These genetic and functional analyses reveal a key requirement for Plexin-B2, but not Plexin-B1, in patterning of the vertebrate nervous system in vivo.
17695486,12,2007,Anticancer Res,Preoperative serum C-reactive protein level in non-small cell lung cancer.,We evaluated the significance of the preoperative serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level as a prognostic indicator in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</AbstractText>: We evaluated the significance of the preoperative serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level as a prognostic indicator in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and three patients who had undergone a curative resection of NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: The proportion of the tumor size over 3 cm per patient in the CRP-positive group (&gt; or =0.5 mg/dL: n=38) was significantly higher than that in the CRP-negative group (&lt;0.5 mg/dL: n = 165). The proportion of the adenocarcinoma in CRP-positive group was significantly lower than that in CRP-negative group. The overall and disease specific survival rates in the CRP-positive group were significantly lower than the rates in the CRP-negative group. Based on a multivariate analysis, the preoperative serum CRP level was selected as one of the unfavorable indicators regarding survival.CONCLUSION: The preoperative serum CRP level is an independent and significant indicator predictive of a poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC.
17522315,12,2007,J Neurosci,A dynamic nonlinearity and spatial phase specificity in macaque V1 neurons.,While studying the visual response dynamics of neurons in the macaque primary visual cortex (V1), we found a nonlinearity of temporal response that influences the visual functions of V1 neurons. Simple cells were recorded in all layers of V1; the nonlinearity was strongest in neurons located in layer 2/3. We recorded the spike responses to optimal sinusoidal gratings that were displayed for 100 ms, a temporal step response. The step responses were measured at many spatial phases of the grating stimulus. To judge whether simple cell behavior was consistent with linear temporal integration, the decay of the 100 ms step response at the preferred spatial phase was used to predict the step response at the opposite spatial phase. Responses in layers 4B and 4C were mostly consistent with a linear-plus-static-nonlinearity cascade model. However, this was not true in layer 2/3 where most cells had little or no step responses at the opposite spatial phase. Many layer 2/3 cells had transient preferred-phase responses but did not respond at the offset of the opposite-phase stimuli, indicating a dynamic nonlinearity. A different stimulus sequence, rapidly presented random sinusoids, also produced the same effect, with layer 2/3 simple cells exhibiting elevated spike rates in response to stimuli at one spatial phase but not 180 degrees away. The presence of a dynamic nonlinearity in the responses of V1 simple cells indicates that first-order analyses often capture only a fraction of neuronal behavior. The visual implication of our results is that simple cells in layer 2/3 are spatial phase-sensitive detectors that respond to contrast boundaries of one sign but not the opposite.
17448449,12,2007,Biol Psychiatry,5HT2A receptor binding is increased in borderline personality disorder.,BACKGROUND: Postmortem studies in suicide victims demonstrate an increase in the number of post-synaptic 5-HT(2A) receptor binding sites in ventral lateral and orbital frontal cortex. Diminished metabolic responses to serotonergic activation are noted in these areas in impulsive subjects with borderline personality disorder (BPD), a group at high risk for suicidal behaviors. We examined 5HT(2A) receptor binding potential (BP) in impulsive subjects with BPD, with positron emission tomography neuroimaging with [(18)F] altanserin.METHODS: Fourteen female subjects with BPD were assessed for Axis I comorbidity, depressed mood, impulsivity, aggression, suicidality, childhood abuse, and compared with 11 healthy female control subjects. The 5HT(2A) receptor binding was evaluated in prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, hippocampus, temporal lobe, occipital cortex, and thalamus. Data were analyzed with Logan graphical analysis and a four-compartment (4C) model.RESULTS: Hippocampal 5HT(2A) receptor binding was significantly increased in BPD subjects compared with control subjects in both Logan and 4C analyses, covarying for age. Hippocampal BP values were related to comorbid major depressive episode, with highest values found in non-depressed BPD subjects and lowest in healthy control subjects. The BP values were not related to depressed mood, impulsivity, aggression, suicidality, or childhood abuse.CONCLUSIONS: 5HT(2A) receptor binding is increased in the hippocampus of BPD subjects independent of depressed mood, impulsivity, aggression, suicidality, or childhood abuse. Dysregulation of serotonergic function in hippocampus might contribute to affective and behavioral symptoms in BPD.
17695462,11,2007,Anticancer Res,Brain metastases in patients with advanced breast cancer.,BACKGROUND: The incidence of brain metastases (BM) is apparently rising in patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC). We performed a case control study to define current features of breast cancer related to central nervous system (CNS) metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 1999 to May 2006, we identified 72 patients with symptomatic BM of breast cancer. A comparison group was randomly selected assigning to each case two patients with primary breast cancer and no BM, matched for year of diagnosis, age and tumour stage (pT status and nodal status).RESULTS: Cases had a significantly higher rate of negative estrogen receptors (ERs) (60% in cases vs. 29% in controls), negative progesterone receptors (PgRs) (79% vs. 43%), HER2/neu over expression (44% vs. 13%) and immunostaining for Ki-67 &gt; or =20% (84% vs. 55%), with p-value &lt;0.001 for all four parameters in univariate analyses. On multivariate analysis, HER2/neu over expression and Ki-67 -20% were independent predictive factors of brain relapse (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.55, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.10-5.94 and OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.01-8.73, respectively). Endocrine unresponsive tumours (both ER and PgR &lt;10%) showed an increased risk of relapse with BM of borderline significance (OR 1.91, 95% CI 0.87-4.12).CONCLUSION: Patients with ER and PgR negative tumours either with or without HER-2/neu over expression should be considered at higher risk of BM.

17695471,10,2007,Anticancer Res,Occurence of stromal myofibroblasts in the invasive ductal breast cancer tissue is an unfavourable prognostic factor.,BACKGROUND: Numerous experimental studies have described the capacity of myofibroblasts to stimulate mammary cancer cells in a paracrine manner. Until now, the prognostic significance of myofibroblasts present in breast cancer has not been examined.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In paraffin sections, originating from 45 patients with primary invasive breast cancer, immunohistochemical reactions were performed using antibodies directed against smooth muscle actin, Ki-67, VEGF, bFGF and UPA.RESULTS: The cases with higher content of myofibroblasts in the tumour tissue manifested higher grade, more pronounced expression of Ki-67, VEGF and bFGF and shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival.CONCLUSION: The present study for the first time documents the unfavourable prognostic significance of myofibroblasts in tissues of invasive ductal mammary carcinomas.
17695451,10,2007,Anticancer Res,Survivin expression predicts early recurrence in early-stage breast cancer.,BACKGROUND: The apoptosis inhibitor survivin is one of the most specific proteins in breast cancer patients. The role of this protein in predicting prognosis is still controversial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Survivin mRNA was measured using quantitative TaqMan reverse transcription-PCR in 76 samples, including 48 early-stage breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues, from patients with operable tumors, and was tested for correlation with established clinicopathological factors, or disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: Comparing the survivin expression in 78 breast cancer patients with the clinicopathological factors (age, menopausal status, nodal category, tumor histology, tumor size, histological grade, ER and PgR status, and type of operation), T factor (T1-T4) was significantly associated with a high survivin mRNA ratio (p=0.0104). The proportion of tumors with a high survivin mRNA ratio was greater in node-positive than in node-negative tumors (p=0.0001), and in grade III tumors compared to grade I or grade II tumors (p =0.0001). Patients with low survivin expression showed significantly better disease-free survival than patients with high survivin expression in stage I and II breast cancer (p&lt;0.0001, log-rank). Survivin expression alone is a powerful prognostic factor for disease-free survival of breast cancer patients without nodal involvement (HR: 0.024, 95% CI: 0.001-0.446, p=0.0123) using Cox multivariate regression analysis.CONCLUSION: Survivin is an indicator of the recurrence of early-stage breast cancer. Survivin might be used as a new marker to stratify early-stage breast cancer patients for more optimal treatment modalities, or it could be a promising target for therapy.
17695440,10,2007,Anticancer Res,Quantification of circulating plasma DNA fragments as tumor markers in patients with esophageal cancer.,The quantity and quality of circulating DNA fragments was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) in plasma from patients with esophageal carcinomas, in order to assess their diagnostic value.</AbstractText>: The quantity and quality of circulating DNA fragments was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) in plasma from patients with esophageal carcinomas, in order to assess their diagnostic value.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma was collected preoperatively from 24 patients with esophageal cancer and 21 healthy controls. qPCR was performed using two primer sets for the beta-actin gene, amplifying short and long segments.RESULTS: The DNA concentrations in both the short and long assays of esophageal cancer patients were significantly higher than the controls (p&lt;0.001). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.83 (short) and 0.91 (long) for esophageal cancer patients versus the controls. There was also a significant difference in DNA integrity (short/long) between esophageal cancer patients and the control group (p= 0.001).CONCLUSION: qPCR assays for plasma DNA concentrations and their integrity can serve as new diagnostic markers for screening and monitoring patients with esophageal cancer.
17466501,10,2007,Curr Opin Cell Biol,The 4C technique: the 'Rosetta stone' for genome biology in 3D?,Despite considerable efforts, the spatial link between the nuclear architecture and the genome remains enigmatic. The 4C method, independently innovated in four different laboratories, might in combination with other methods change that. As this method is based on the unbiased identification of sequences interacting with specific baits, there are unique opportunities for unravelling the secrets of how the genome functions in 3D.
17956250,9,2007,Biochem Soc Trans,cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase-4D5 (PDE4D5) provides a paradigm for understanding the unique non-redundant roles that PDE4 isoforms play in shaping compartmentalized cAMP cell signalling.,The PDE4 (phosphodiesterase-4) enzyme family consists of a distinct array of N-terminal splice variant isoforms arising from four subfamily genes (4A, 4B, 4C and 4D). These all hydrolyse specifically the intracellular second messenger cAMP. Although identical in catalytic function, each isoform appears to serve a non-superfluous regulatory role. For example, a beta-arrestin-sequestered subpopulation of the PDE4D5 isoform specifically regulates the phosphorylation of the beta(2)-AR (beta(2)-adrenergic receptor) by PKA (protein kinase A; also called cAMP-dependent protein kinase). This was elucidated by the use of novel technologies, including dominant-negative approaches, siRNA (small interfering RNA) knockdown and spot-immobilized peptide array analyses. Functional phenotypes uncovered using these methodologies have shown that beta-arrestin-sequestered PDE4D5 shapes the spatial cAMP gradient around the membrane-bound beta(2)-AR, regulating its phosphorylation by PKA and its ability to activate ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) through G(i) in cardiomyocytes and HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney)-B2 cells. This approach has provided the very first identification of a non-redundant and specific role for a PDE isoform. The fact that phenotypes can be uncovered by displacing PDE4 isoforms from specific anchor sites using dominant-negative constructs and cell-permeable peptides points to novel means for developing therapeutics aimed at disrupting specifically sequestered PDE isoforms and even specifically sequestered subpopulations of individual isoforms.
17695473,9,2007,Anticancer Res,Association between allelic polymorphisms of metabolizing enzymes (CYP 1A1, CYP 1A2, CYP 2E1, mEH) and occurrence of colorectal cancer in Hungary.,BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms of metabolizing enzymes may affect the risk of cancer formation in humans. Since the diet can contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic amines (HAs), the relationship between polymorphisms of enzymes involved in PAH and HA metabolism and the occurrence of sporadic colorectal cancer was studied.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred colorectal cancer patients and 500 controls were genotyped for cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) 1A1 Ile/Val, CYP 1A2*1F, CYP 2E1 c1/c2, microsomal epoxy hydrolase (mEH) exon 3 Tyr113His and exon 4 His139Arg polymorphisms by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).RESULTS: The presence of CYP 1A1 Val, CYP 2E1 c2 and mEH exon 3 His alleles was statistically significantly associated with the occurrence of colorectal cancer (OR: 1.44 95% CI: 1.04-2.00; OR: 1.74 95% CI: 1.15-2.65; OR: 1.79 95% CI: 1.10-2.92, respectively).CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that allelic polymorphism of metabolizing enzymes play an important role in human colorectal carcinogenesis by affecting the metabolism of dietary carcinogens.
17695442,9,2007,Anticancer Res,Quantification of plasma cell-free DNA in patients with gastric cancer.,BACKGROUND: The circulating DNA concentration and integrity was examined by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in the plasma from patients with gastric cancer and their diagnostic value for the detection of gastric cancer assessed.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma samples were collected preoperatively from 53 patients with gastric cancer and 21 healthy controls. qPCR was performed using two different primer sets for the beta-actin gene, amplifying short and long segments. DNA integrity was calculated as the ratio of concentrations in both assays.RESULTS: The DNA concentrations in the short and long assays of the gastric cancer patients were significantly higher (p=0.03 and p&lt;0.0001, respectively) than those of the control group. The DNA integrity was also higher in cancer patients than that of the controls, however the difference was not significant (p=0.07).CONCLUSION: The plasma DNA concentration assay may serve as a new diagnostic marker for the screening and monitoring of patients with gastric cancer.
17695436,9,2007,Anticancer Res,Palliative chemotherapy for recurrent and metastatic esophageal cancer.,More than two-thirds of patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer will have unresectable disease. The objective of this article is to review the clinical trials utilizing cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with recurrent and metastatic esophageal cancer. A computerized (MEDLINE) search was performed to identify papers published on this topic between 1966 and 2007. A total of 96 trials were subsequently identified. Two randomized trials compared palliative chemotherapy with best supportive care in 180 patients with advanced esophageal cancer. Effectiveness and side-effects were evaluated in 49 phase II studies and 3 randomized phase III trials. Combination chemotherapy as compared to monochemotherapy is associated with significantly higher response rates but nevertheless results in similar survival. CF (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) currently represents one of the most effective regimens for advanced esophageal cancer, while among the newer combinations, irinotecan or taxane-based regimens have also given promising results. Prognosis for the majority of patients, however, remains poor as increases in survival were moderate at best.
17695423,9,2007,Anticancer Res,Prognostic significance of TGFbeta-1 and pSmad2/3 in breast cancer patients with T1-2,N0 tumours.,BACKGROUND: The transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling pathway has been shown to exert divergent effects and to cross-talk with estrogen pathways in mammary gland tumorigenesis. TGF signaling in early stage breast cancer was investigated by examining the expression of TGFbeta-1 and the signaling mediators pSmad2/3 and Smad4. Their association with oestrogen and progesterone receptors, as well as with clinical and pathological features was also analyzed.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one tumor specimens from surgically treated patients with primary T12,N0 breast cancer were examined. The expression of TGFbeta-1, pSmad2 and Smad4 was assessed implementing immunohistochemical assays.RESULTS: TGFbeta-I, pSmad2/3 and Smad4 were expressed in 50.9%, 74.0% and 61.0% of specimens, respectively. The degree of expression of the three molecules was significantly associated with each other. Loss of pSmad2/3 expression indicated a shorter disease-free survival in all patients, including those with oestrogen receptor-positive tumors. Patients not expressing TGFbeta-1 were 4.6 times more likely to experience distant recurrence.CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that pSmad2/3 and TGFP-1 may be promising novel prognostic markers for T1.2,N0 breast carcinomas.
17409378,9,2007,J Histochem Cytochem,Effects of detergents on the redistribution of gangliosides and GPI-anchored proteins in brain tissue sections.,Gangliosides and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins contain lipid tails that tether them to the outer side of the cell membrane. This mode of association with the cell membrane enables them to take part in the organization of lipid rafts, but it also permits gangliosides and GPI-anchored proteins to be actively released from one cell and inserted into the membrane of another cell. Recently, we reported that under conditions of lipid raft isolation, Triton X-100 causes significant redistribution of both gangliosides and GPI-anchored proteins. Aiming to find a less disruptive detergent, we evaluated the effects of CHAPS, Saponin, deoxycholic acid, Trappsol, Tween 20, Triton X-100, Brij 96V, Brij 98, and SDS on brain tissue sections. At room temperature, all detergents (1% concentration) extracted significant amounts of both gangliosides and Thy-1. At 4C, the extraction was weaker, but Triton X-100, CHAPS, and deoxycholic acid caused significant redistribution of GD1a and Thy-1 from gray matter into the white matter. Both redistribution and extraction were significantly augmented when sections were incubated with detergents in the presence of primary antibodies. Of the nine tested detergents, none is the ideal choice. However, Brij 96V appears to be able to sufficiently reveal myelin epitopes while causing the least amount of artifacts.

17360385,9,2007,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Nature of hydrogen interactions with Ni(II) complexes containing cyclic phosphine ligands with pendant nitrogen bases.,Studies of the role of proton relays in molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic production and oxidation of H(2) have been carried out. The electrochemical production of hydrogen from protonated DMF solutions catalyzed by [Ni(P(2)(Ph)N(2)(Ph))(2)(CH(3)CN)](BF(4))(2), 3a (where P(2)(Ph)N(2)(Ph) is 1,3,5,7-tetraphenyl-1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctane), permits a limiting value of the H(2) production rate to be determined. The turnover frequency of 350 s(-1) establishes that the rate of H(2) production for the mononuclear nickel catalyst 3a is comparable to those observed for Ni-Fe hydrogenase enzymes. In the electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen catalyzed by [Ni(P(2)(Cy)N(2)(Bz))(2)](BF(4))(2), 3b (where Cy is cyclohexyl and Bz is benzyl), the initial step is the reversible addition of hydrogen to 3b (K(eq) = 190 atm(-1) at 25 degrees C). The hydrogen addition product exists as three nearly isoenergetic isomers 4A-4C, which have been identified by a combination of one- and two-dimensional (1)H, (31)P, and (15)N NMR spectroscopies as Ni(0) complexes with a protonated amine in each cyclic ligand. The nature of the isomers, together with calculations, suggests a mode of hydrogen activation that involves a symmetrical interaction of a nickel dihydrogen ligand with two amine bases in the diphosphine ligands. Single deprotonation of 4 by an external base results in a rearrangement to [HNi(P(2)(Cy)N(2)(Bz))(2)](BF(4)), 5, and this reaction is reversed by the addition of a proton to the nickel hydride complex. The small energy differences associated with significantly different distributions in electron density and protons within these molecules may contribute to their high catalytic activity.
18076083,8,2007,J Comp Neurol,Anatomical and physiological definition of the motor cortex of the marmoset monkey.,We used a combination of anatomical and physiological techniques to define the primary motor cortex (M1) of the marmoset monkey and its relationship to adjacent cortical fields. Area M1, defined as a region containing a representation of the entire body and showing the highest excitability to intracortical microstimulation, is architecturally heterogeneous: it encompasses both the caudal part of the densely myelinated &quot;gigantopyramidal&quot; cortex (field 4) and a lateral region, corresponding to the face representation, which is less myelinated and has smaller layer 5 pyramidal cells (field 4c). Rostral to M1 is a field that is strongly reminiscent of field 4 in terms of cyto- and myeloarchitecture but that in the marmoset is poorly responsive to microstimulation. Anatomical tracing experiments revealed that this rostral field is interconnected with visual areas of the posterior parietal cortex, whereas M1 itself has no such connections. For these reasons, we considered this field to be best described as part of the dorsal premotor cortex and adopted the designation 6Dc. Histological criteria were used to define other fields adjacent to M1, including medial and ventral subdivisions of the premotor cortex (fields 6M and 6V) and the rostral somatosensory field (area 3a), as well as a rostral subdivision of the dorsal premotor area (field 6Dr). These results suggest a basic plan underlying the histological organization of the caudal frontal cortex in different simian species, which has been elaborated during the evolution of larger species of primate by creation of further morphological and functional subdivisions.
17962332,8,2007,J Physiol,Direction selectivity in V1 of alert monkeys: evidence for parallel pathways for motion processing.,In primary visual cortex (V1) of macaque monkeys, motion selective cells form three parallel pathways. Two sets of direction selective cells, one in layer 4B, and the other in layer 6, send parallel direct outputs to area MT in the dorsal cortical stream. We show that these two outputs carry different types of spatial information. Direction selective cells in layer 4B have smaller receptive fields than those in layer 6, and layer 4B cells are more selective for orientation. We present evidence for a third direction selective pathway that flows through V1 layers 4Cm (the middle tier of layer 4C) to layer 3. Cells in layer 3 are very selective for orientation, have the smallest receptive fields in V1, and send direct outputs to area V2. Layer 3 neurons are well suited to contribute to detection and recognition of small objects by the ventral cortical stream, as well as to sense subtle motions within objects, such as changes in facial expressions.
17695443,8,2007,Anticancer Res,Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 (MMP-9) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) in differential diagnosis between low malignant potential (LMP) and malignant ovarian tumours.,BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) (gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) have the ability to degrade several extracellular matrix components. This study aimed to evaluate whether matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-2-TIMP-2 complex) or their tissue inhibitors (TIMP-1, TIMP-2) could be used as preoperative serum markers in differentiating between low malignant potential (LMP) and malignant ovarian tumours.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 61 patients with ovarian neoplasms (28 benign, 11 LMP and 22 malignant). MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-2-TIMP-2 complex, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were analysed from serum samples using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA).RESULTS: Serum TIMP-1 values significantly increased from benign (median 250 microg/l, range 137-616 microg/l) to LMP (median 357 microg/l, range 63-587 microg/l) and further to malignant (median 443 microg/l, range 199-983 microg/l) ovarian neoplasms (p&lt;0.001). There was a significant difference in the ratios of TIMP-1 to MMP-2 and TIMP-1 to MMP-2-TIMP-2 complex between the patients with benign vs. malignant and an LMP vs. malignant tumour.CONCLUSION: The value of circulating TIMP-1 and the ratios of TIMP-1 to MMP-2 and TIMP-1 to MMP-2-TIMP-2 complex may be valuable for differentiating between LMP and malignant ovarian tumours.
17695437,8,2007,Anticancer Res,Microsatellite instability and sensitivitiy to FOLFOX treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer.,BACKGROUND: Microsatelite instability (MSI) is the consequence of the inactivation of a mismatch repair gene and is observed in approximately 15% of colon cancer cases. Patients with MSI colon cancer do not benefit from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy. A current treatment of reference for colon cancer is a combination of 5-FU and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX). The aim of this study was to determine the efficiency of the FOLFOX treatment in patients with metastatic MSI colon cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumour specimens were collected from patients with metastatic colon cancer treated with FOLFOX 4 modified or FOLFOX 6; these two regimens are based on 85 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 oxaliplatin, respectively. The MSI status was assessed by measuring the length of five monomorphic mononucleotide markers. The FOLFOX regimen was evaluated as a first-line treatment according to WHO criteria.RESULTS: Forty patients (22 men, 18 women), median age 63.5 years (27-83 years) were treated with FOLFOX 4 or 6. Nine patients had tumours exhibiting high MSI (MSI group) and 31 patients had tumours exhibiting microsatellite stability (MSS group). In the MSS group, 11 partial responses (36%) were observed, while there were only two in the MSI group (22%) (no significant difference). The two patients who were responders in the MSI group were treated with FOLFOX 6. The overall survival was not significantly different for MSI and MSS patients.CONCLUSION: No significant differences in the overall response rate or overall survival between the two groups of patients were observed. However, these results suggest that patients with MSI colon cancer are more sensitive to a higher dose of FOLFOX.
17998570,7,2007,J Histochem Cytochem,Immunohistochemical markers for quantitative studies of neurons and glia in human neocortex.,Reproducible visualization of neurons and glia in human brain is essential for quantitative studies of the cellular changes in neurological disease. However, immunohistochemistry in human brain specimens is often compromised because of prolonged fixation. To select cell lineage-specific antibodies for quantitative studies of neurons and the major types of glia, we used 29 different antibodies, different epitope retrieval methods, and different detection systems to stain tissue arrays of formalin-fixed human brain. The screening pointed at CD45/leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CD68(KP1), 2',3' cyclic nucleotide phosphatase (CNPase), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), HLA-DR, Ki67, neuronal nuclei (NeuN), p25alpha-antigen, and S100beta as candidates for future cell counting purposes, because these markers visualized specific neuronal and glial cell bodies. However, significant negative correlation between staining result and formalin fixation was observed by blinded scoring of staining for CD45/LCA, CNPase, GFAP, and NeuN in brain specimens fixed by immersion and stored up to 10 years in 4% formalin solution at room temperature, independent of donor sex and postmortem interval. In contrast, improved preservation of NeuN and CNPase staining, and full preservation of GFAP and CD45/LCA staining in tissue fixed by perfusion and stored for up to 3 years in 0.1% paraformaldehyde solution at 4C, indicated that immunohistochemistry can be performed in well-preserved biobank material.
17876243,7,2007,Neurosurgery,The Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion and comparisons with its predecessors.,OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to introduce a new radiosurgical device, the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion (Elekta Instruments AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Design and performance characteristics are compared with previous models of the gamma knife in a clinical setting.METHODS: Performance-related features in the design of the new radiosurgical system are described, and the ability to create complex shapes of isodose volumes even with a single isocenter is demonstrated. The concept of &quot;dynamic shaping&quot; of dose distribution is introduced as a means of decreasing the exposure to structures outside the target. Dose plans for the Leksell Gamma Knife Models B, 4C, and Perfexion have been created for target pathologies to illustrate how the software and hardware of the new radiosurgical system can increase treatment quality, decrease treatment time, and increase patient comfort. Radiation doses to critical organs in the rest of the human body are compared.RESULTS: The automated collimator arrangement in the Perfexion makes it possible to produce more complex treatment volumes than with previous models of the gamma knife. This results from the enhanced ability to shape isodose volumes, even for single isocenters. The collimator arrangement and the patient positioning system also allow shorter patient transit times, reducing unwanted radiation exposure during movement between isocenters.CONCLUSION: The Perfexion exceeds the capabilities of previous gamma knife models in terms of treatment efficiency, conformity, and radiation protection. These qualities enable treatment of larger target volumes, especially close to eloquent areas. Pathologies previously inaccessible in the head and neck are now treatable due to the increased volume of the radiation cavity.
17695467,7,2007,Anticancer Res,Association of XPD polymorphisms with prostate cancer in Taiwanese patients.,BACKGROUND: The DNA repair gene XPD, an important caretaker of the overall genome stability, is thought to play a major role in the development of human malignancy. Polymorphic variants of XPD, at codon 312, 751, and other sites, have been associated with cancer susceptibility, but few studies have investigated their effect on prostate cancer risk.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this hospital-based case-control study, the association of XPD codon 312, 751 and promoter-114 polymorphisms with prostate cancer risk in a Taiwanese population were investigated. In total, 123 patients with prostate cancer and 479 healthy controls recruited from the China Medical Hospital in Central Taiwan were genotyped.RESULTS: We found a significant difference in the frequency of the XPD codon 312 genotype, but not the XPD codon 751 or promoter-114 genotypes, between the prostate cancer and control groups. Those who had GIA or A/A at XPD codon 312 showed a 1.81-fold (95% confidence interval=1.21-2.69) increased risk of prostate cancer compared to those with GIG. As for XPD codon 312 or promoter-114, there was no difference in distribution between the prostate cancer and control groups.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the heterozygous and homozygous A allele of the XPD codon 312 may be associated with the development of prostate cancer and may be a useful marker for primary prevention and anticancer intervention.
17695454,7,2007,Anticancer Res,Developments in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.,Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women in the civilized world. Although there have been major improvements over the recent decades in surgical techniques and the role of chemotherapy-radiotherapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the long-term outlook for these patients has not changed significantly. The median survival for patients with advanced-stage NSCLC treated with platinum-based chemotherapy is a disappointing 8-10 months. In current clinical practice, chemotherapy is used as a combined modality with radiotherapy as an adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Moreover, combination chemotherapy is regarded as the standard care in the treatment of unresectable locally advanced (stage IIIb), metastatic (stage IV), or recurrent disease. The recent developments in the treatment of NSCLC have been focused on the emerging role of adjuvant therapy in the early stages of NSCLC. The clinical activity of pemetrexed, a multitargeted antifolate anticancer agent, as a second-line chemotherapy agent and the impact of new biological agents, such as bevacizumab and erlotinib, have been investigated in phase III trials in the first- and second-line setting. Even though these options have been available in the last few years, there is a clear need for improvement in the current standard of care. No definite survival benefit has yet been demonstrated. An abundant amount of research is still required in the field of lung cancer therapy with well-designed clinical trials and appropriate patient selection.
17695430,7,2007,Anticancer Res,A phase II study of weekly paclitaxel as second-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric Cancer (CCOG0302 study).,BACKGROUND: Although paclitaxel was given triweekly in phase II trials prior to its approval for gastric cancer in Japan, it is currently more often delivered by a weekly schedule in the second-line setting.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II trial with response rate as the primary end-point was conducted. Patients with metastatic or unresectable gastric adenocarcinoma who had measurable lesions and had disease progression with the front-line chemotherapy were treated by weekly administration of paclitaxel at a dose of 80 mg/m2.RESULTS: Forty-five patients were accrued and 44 were assessable for response. Partial responses were observed in 7 patients (16%). Stable disease was documented in further 14 patients (48%). Median progression-free survival of all patients enrolled was 2.6 months and median overall survival was 7.8 months. Toxicity was mild and manageable, the most frequent &gt; or = grade 3 toxicity being neutropenia occurring in 16% of the patients.CONCLUSION: With modest response rate, favorable toxicity profile, and progression-free or overall survival similar to those of more intense combination regimens, weekly paclitaxel remains a rational therapeutic option for gastric cancer refractory to the first-line chemotherapy.
17607776,7,2007,J Med Virol,Prevalence and common genotypes of HCV infection in Sudanese patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis.,A cross-sectional hospital based study was carried out at the National Center for Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease in Khartoum, Sudan to determine the prevalence, common genotypes and risk factors for hepatitis C virus infection in Sudanese patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. A total of 176 patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis were tested for HCV antibodies and 4.5% of the samples were reactive. PCR was positive in 2.3% of cases and genotype 4 was the major genotype isolated with subtypes 4, 4e, and 4c/4d. It is concluded that HCV was of low seroprevalence in the study population and that parenteral antischistosomal therapy was not a significant risk factor in transmission of infection in the Sudan.
17532544,7,2007,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of some thiazolyl and thiadiazolyl derivatives of 1H-pyrazole as anti-inflammatory antimicrobial agents.,Four series of pyrazolyl benzenesulfonamide derivatives have been synthesized. The first series was prepared by cyclization of the intermediate N,N-dimethylaminomethylene-4[3-phenyl-4-(substituted thiosemicarbamoyl hydrazonomethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]benzenesulfonamide 2a-c with ethyl bromoacetate to afford the corresponding thiazolidinyl derivatives 3a-c. The second series was prepared by cyclization of the key intermediates 2a-c with 4-bromophenacyl bromide giving rise to thiazolinyl derivatives 4a-c. Thiadiazolyl derivatives 5a-c were obtained by heating 2a-c with 2M FeCl(3) solution. Refluxing the intermediates 2a-c in acetic anhydride yielded the corresponding thiadiazolinyl derivatives 6a-c. All the target compounds showed anti-inflammatory activity and three of them 3b, 3c and 4c surpassed that of indomethacin both locally and systemically in the cotton pellet granuloma and rat paw edema bioassay. The active compounds showed selective inhibitory activity towards COX-2 enzyme as revealed by the in vitro enzymatic assay. All the tested compounds proved to have superior gastrointestinal (GI) safety profiles as compared to indomethacin, when tested for their ulcerogenic effects. The acute toxicity study of compounds having promising anti-inflammatory activity (3b, 3c and 4c) indicated that they are well tolerated both orally and parenterally. Antimicrobial activity tests expressed as minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), revealed that compounds 3b and 4a showed comparable antibacterial activity to that of ampicillin against Escherichia coli, while compounds 3a, 3c and 4a possessed about half the activity of ampicillin against Staphylococcus aureus. On the other hand, the results showed that all the tested compounds have weak or no antifungal activity against Candida albicans except for compounds 6b and 6c that showed half the activity of the control antifungal drug used (clotrimazole).
17786312,6,2007,Int J Oncol,Experimental treatment of ovarian cancers by adenovirus vectors combining receptor targeting and selective expression of tumor necrosis factor.,Ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women and existing treatment is not routinely curative. One new strategy for cancer therapy is the selective delivery of TNFalpha to tumors via adenovirus vectors. We have tested the combination of two modifications to adenovirus vectors designed to limit delivery to tumors, capsid modification and expression control. To target alpha(v)beta(3/5) integrin receptors that are highly expressed in tumor and sparsely expressed in the epithelial layer of peritoneum, we modified the capsid fiber and penton base to remove native receptor binding and incorporated an RGD-4C motif in the fiber knob (Ad.PB*F*RGD). This vector exhibits effective gene transfer in all of the alpha(v)beta(3/5)-positive ovarian cancer cells tested in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the Ad.PB*F*RGD vector is able to transduce ovarian tumor nodules and avoid infecting the normal mesothelial cells that line the intraperitoneal space following intraperitoneal administration. To further increase selectivity, different promoters were incorporated into the capsid-modified vector to confer the expression of the hTNFalpha therapeutic gene. We analyzed both constitutive (CMV or RSV) and potentially tumor selective promoters (MUC-1, E2F or hTERT) in terms of efficacy, selectivity and safety. TNF-expressing Ad.PB*F*RGD vectors containing the MUC-1 promoter showed anti-tumor activity in two ovarian cancer xenograft models (Caov3 and Igr-ov1) with little evidence of toxicity or systemic TNF. The data indicate that combination of capsid modification and transcriptional regulation of expression is a promising strategy for development of a new ovarian cancer treatment.
17695480,6,2007,Anticancer Res,Dummy run for a phase II multi-institute trial of chemoradiotherapy for unresectable pancreatic cancer: inter-observer variance in contour delineation.,The aim of this study was to examine the interobserver variance in delineating the contour of unresectable pancreatic cancer for chemoradiotherapy.</AbstractText>: The aim of this study was to examine the interobserver variance in delineating the contour of unresectable pancreatic cancer for chemoradiotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: CT images of two cases of unresectable pancreatic tumors (head and body cancer) were sent to eight radiation therapy facilities in a CD-ROM. Gross tumor volume (GTV) and planning target volume (PTV) were delineated using the radiotherapy treatment planning system (RTP) of the respective facilities. The mean and variance of the GTV and PTV of 11 plans by the eight facilities were analyzed.RESULTS: The respective mean volumes of the GTV of pancreatic head and body cancer cases were 34.8 cm3 (SD, 30.4; median, 31.8; range, 13.5-122 cm3) and 73.4 cm3 (SD, 28.1; median, 67.9; range, 46.3-152 cm3). The ratios of the largest to the smallest contoured GTV were 9 and 3, respectively. The corresponding average volumes of PTV were 148 cm3 (SD, 84.3; median, 129; range, 69.6-363 cm3) and 240 cm3 (SD, 79.8; median, 227; range, 148-420 cm3). The ratios of the largest to the smallest contoured volume were 5 and 2.8 for PTV delineation, respectively.CONCLUSION: Dummy run using CD-ROM is possible on a multi-institute scale but also disclosed interobserver variance. Unified protocol interpretation to reduce inter-observer variance is therefore essential for successful multi-institute clinical trials.
17695435,6,2007,Anticancer Res,Human papillomavirus infections in lung cancer. Detection of E6 and E7 transcripts and review of the literature.,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in Western countries. Several factors have been implicated in its aetiology: cigarette smoking, environmental pollution, asbestos and genetic factors. The possible involvement of human papillomavirus (HPV) in bronchial squamous cell lesions was first suggested in 1979 by Syrjänen. Since then, several studies have confirmed the presence of HPV DNA in about 20% of lung cancer cases examined, with HPV16 and 18 as the two most frequently found oncogenic viral types. More recently, these data have been supported by the detection of E6 and E7 transcripts in HPV-positive lung cancer cases, reinforcing the hypothesis that oncogenic HPVs could act as cofactors in bronchial carcinogenesis. This published literature is briefly reviewed and new data of the authors on detection of E6 and E7 transcripts in lung cancer samples are presented.
17695427,6,2007,Anticancer Res,Predictive value of thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase expression in tumor tissue, regarding the efficacy of postoperatively administered UFT (tegafur+uracil) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.,BACKGROUND: UFT (tegafur + uracil) has been reported to be effective as an adjuvant in postoperative chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a randomized prospective study. Thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) expression were investigated in resected tumors and the relationship between their expression and clinical factors in NSCLC patients was examined.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four NSCLC patients had undergone complete surgical resection and lymph node dissection, and had been administered UFT post-surgery. The TS and DPD expression in the tumor tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. The relationship between TS and/or DPD expression and clinicopathological factors was examined.RESULTS: There were 38 TS-negative and 16 TS-positive cases, and 22 DPD-negative and 32 DPD-positive cases. There was no significant difference between the patients with TS or DPD and those without TS or DPD in age, gender, histological type or p-stage. The 5-year survival rates of patients positive and negative for TS were 50.0 and 89.5%, while 10-year survival rates were 23.3 and 79.7%, respectively (p&lt;0.001). The 5-year survival rates of TS-positive and TS-negative patients in p-stage I were 54.6 and 95.5%, while 10-year survival rates were 22.7 and 95.5%, respectively (p&lt;0.001). There was no significant difference between DPD-positive and DPD-negative patients in prognosis.CONCLUSION: The oral administration of UFT after surgery might improve the survival of NSCLC patients when TS levels in tumor tissues are low. Immunohistochemical evaluation of TS and DPD expression may be useful for predicting the efficacy of UFT after complete resection in NSCLC.
17675156,6,2007,Mol Immunol,The lambda gene immunoglobulin repertoire of human neonatal B cells.,The dynamics of immunoglobulin rearrangements and selection, which depend on age, antigen exposure and tolerance functions, are only partly understood. Thus, we analyzed and compared the lambda chain immunoglobulin repertoire of individual IgD+ human neonatal B cells with the adult peripheral B cell VlambdaJlambda repertoire. Some Vlambda genes, 4C, 2A2, 2B2, 5A, 1G and 4B, were overexpressed in the non-productive neonatal repertoire, whereas other Vlambda genes (2E, 2A2, 3H, 2B2, 1C and 1G) were overexpressed in the productive repertoire. The adult B cell repertoire revealed nearly the same predominance of genes in the non-productive and productive repertoire. A comparison of the non-productive and productive repertoire indicated that the genes 3H and 1C were positively selected, whereas the genes 4C, 2A1, 3I, 5A, 9A, 4A and 4B were negatively selected. All four functional Jlambda genes were used in both repertoires. Jlambda2/3 was used mainly. Insertions of non-templated nucleotides at the VlambdaJlambda-junction by the enzyme TdT were less frequent as compared to the adult, but the CDR3 length was the same. Comparison of CD5+IgD+ and CD5-IgD+ B cells revealed no differences between neonatal productive rearrangements. However, the genes 1C and 1G were used more often in the non-productive repertoire of CD5+ B cells, whereas gene 4B was used significantly more frequent in CD5- B cells. These data provide evidence that the primary usage and subsequent selection of Vlambda genes in the neonate are surprisingly comparable with the adult. This suggests that selection into the productive Vlambda repertoire in principal might be driven mainly by autoantigens in the newborn, as well as in adulthood, since newborns have not been exposed to exogenous antigens.
17550934,6,2007,Chest,Proteomic analysis of peripheral T-lymphocytes in patients with asthma.,BACKGROUND: Asthma is chronic airway inflammation that occurs together with reversible airway obstruction. T-lymphocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Proteomic technology has rapidly developed in the postgenomic era, and it is now widely accepted as a complementary technology to genetic profiling. We investigated the changes of proteins in T-lymphocytes of asthma patients by using standard proteome technology: two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), and a database search.METHODS: The proteins of CD3+ T-lymphocytes were isolated from whole blood of six steroid-naive asthmatic patients and of six healthy volunteers. 2D-PAGE was performed and the silver-stained protein spots were comparatively analyzed between the asthma and control groups using an image analyzer. Some differentially expressed spots were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS and database search. The messenger RNA expressions of some identified proteins were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).RESULTS: Thirteen protein spots in the T-lymphocytes of the asthmatic patients were increased and 12 spots were decreased compared to those of the normal subjects. Among the identified proteins, the increased expression of the messenger RNA of phosphodiesterase 4C and thioredoxin-2 and the decreased expression of the messenger RNA of glutathione S-transferase M3 were confirmed by RT-PCR in the asthmatic patients.CONCLUSIONS: Proteomic examination of the peripheral T-lymphocytes revealed some differentially expressed proteins in the asthmatic patients. The possibility of using the differentially expressed proteins as important biomarkers and therapeutic targets in asthma patients warrants further studies.
17418454,6,2007,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis of some novel heterocyclic compounds derived from diflunisal hydrazide as potential anti-infective and anti-inflammatory agents.,Three novel series of 2',4'-difluoro-4-hydroxybiphenyl-3-carboxylic acid derivatives namely 4-substituted-1,2,4-triazoline-3-thiones (4a-g); 2-substituted-1,3,4-thiadiazoles (5a-g) and 2-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles (6a-g) have been synthesized. Twenty-one of the newly synthesized compounds were tested against various bacteria, fungi, yeast species and virus. In addition, we have replaced the carboxylic acid group of diflunisal with heterocycles and the anti-inflammatory activity of heterocycles reported here. Compound (5d) showed activity against Escherichia coli A1 and Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC-176 at a concentration of 31.25 microg/mL, whereas cefepime, the drug used as standard, has been found less active against the bacteria mentioned above. Compound (4b) has exhibited activity against Aspergillus variecolor and Trichophyton rubrum at a concentration of 31.25 and 15.25 microg/mL, whereas Amphotericin B, the drug used as standard, has been found less active against the yeast and fungi. The highest antiviral activity was found in the 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivative (5a) having a methyl group at 2nd position against Sindbis virus at 9.6 microg/mL. Compound (4c) exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory activity (73.03%) whereas diflunisal, the drug used as standard, has been found less active (24.16%). Compound (5f) presented similar antinociceptive activity with the standard drug (paw withdrawal latency was 19.21 s compared to that of diflunisal which was 19.14s, in hot plate test).
17391641,6,2007,Arch Biochem Biophys,Functional and structural characterization of a protein based on analysis of its hydrogen bonding network by hydrogen bonding plot.,Knowledge of the relationship between protein's structure and its dynamic behavior is essential for understanding protein function. In this study, the description of a protein three-dimensional structure as a network of hydrogen bonding interactions (HB plot) is introduced as a tool for exploring protein structure and function. HB plot offers a simple way of analyzing protein secondary and tertiary structure. Moreover, hydrogen bonds stabilizing secondary structural elements and those formed between distant amino residues--defined as tertiary hydrogen bonds--can be easily distinguished in HB plot, thus, amino acid residues involved in stabilizing protein structure and function can be easily identified. By analyzing the network of tertiary interactions the possible spread of information within a protein can be investigated as well. The alteration in tertiary hydrogen bonding network during conformational transitions were investigated through case studies; and showed the applicability of HB plot in exploring mechanistic details in proteins.
18054144,5,2007,Anesthesiol Clin,Adjuvant analgesics.,Adjuvant analgesics represent a diverse group of drugs that were originally developed for a primary indication other than pain. Many of these medications are currently used to enhance analgesia under specific circumstances. The proper use of adjuvant drugs is one of the keys to success in effective pain management. Since adjuvant analgesics are typically administered to patients who take multiple medications, decisions regarding administration and dosage must be made with a clear understanding of the stage of the disease and the goals of care. The article discusses major classes of adjuvant analgesics, with the focus on the mechanism of action, clinical application, and risks and benefits associated with each particular class of adjuvants.
17952574,5,2007,J Clin Immunol,Serum mannose-binding lectin levels are linked with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease.,The innate immune response facilitates the quality of the adaptive immune response and is critical to an individual's susceptibility to infection and disease. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a plasma protein with anti-microbial properties that binds a wide range of pathogens to flag them for immune destruction independent of antibodies. In this study, serum MBL levels were measured in 81 children &lt;5 years old experiencing acute respiratory syncytial virus infection and in 40 control children to determine the association with disease severity. Almost 70% of all RSV-infected children had low to intermediate MBL levels (&lt;500 ng/ml) compared to controls, and most of the &lt;6 months old RSV interned patients had low to intermediate levels. No differences were detected in MBL levels between case and control children &lt;1 month old. Analysis of the T-cell compartment in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from acute RSV-infected and control children showed that the percent CD4+ T cells was statistically lower in RSV-infected children &gt; or =6 months old compared to controls, while the percent CD8+ T cells in RSV-infected and control PBMC was generally similar. These results suggest that low serum MBL levels may be a marker of RSV disease severity in children and that MBL may be important in limiting RSV disease pathogenesis.
17703880,5,2007,J Hazard Mater,Comparison of various advanced oxidation processes for the degradation of 4-chloro-2 nitrophenol.,In the present study an attempt is made efficiently to degrade USEPA listed 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol (4C-2-NP), widely available in bulk drug and pesticide wastes using various advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). A comparative assessment using various AOPs (UV, H(2)O(2,) UV/H(2)O(2), Fenton, UV/Fenton and UV/TiO(2)) was attempted after initial optimization studies, viz., varying pH, peroxide concentration, iron concentration, and TiO(2) loading. The degradation of the study compound was estimated using chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction and compound reduction using spectrophotometric methods and further validated with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The degradation trends followed the order: UV/Fenton &gt; UV/TiO(2) &gt; UV/H(2)O(2) &gt; Fenton &gt; H(2)O(2) &gt; UV(.) It can be inferred from the studies that UV/Fenton was the most effective in partial mineralization of 4C-2-NP. However, lower costs were obtained with H(2)O(2). Kinetic constants were evaluated using first order equations to determine the rate constant K.
17695470,5,2007,Anticancer Res,Complications of percutaneous radiofrequency thermal ablation of primary and secondary lesions of the liver.,Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in the world, with the liver being the second most frequently involved organ in metastatic disease. Although the gold standard treatment for malignant liver disease is surgical resection, only few patients can undergo such an intervention. This explains the current great interest in various loco-regional therapies, of which radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) is the most common. To date, only a few studies have evaluated the complications associated with this treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of complications, divided into major and minor, in patients treated with RFA. A total of 373 hepatic lesions in 250 patients were treated with 292 sessions of percutaneous ultrasound-guided RFA. According to our data, ten patients (4%) had major, complications, twelve patients (4.8%) had minor complications, no deaths occurred. Around 30% of patients had a body temperature increase of up to 38 'C. All complications, except one, were treated with nonsurgical therapies. One patient with massive hemoperitoneum required surgery. In conclusion, percutaneous RFA is a loco-regional therapy associated with a low incidence of side-effects and a negligible risk of death.
17695450,5,2007,Anticancer Res,Evaluation of prognostic value of VEGF-C and VEGF-D in breast cancer--10 years follow-up analysis.,The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and VEGF-D expression in stage II, grade 2 and 3, ductal breast cancer patients.</AbstractText>: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and VEGF-D expression in stage II, grade 2 and 3, ductal breast cancer patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The immunohistochemical staining of 98 tumor samples and 5- and 10-year overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed.RESULTS: A significant relationship between VEGF-C and VEGF-D expression (p=0.000002) was noted. No correlations between protein expression and clinical parameters (tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor status, axillaty lymph node metastases and age) or 5- and 10-year DFS or OS were demonstrated. A close to significant correlation (p=0.084) was observed between high expression of VEGF-C and 5-year OS.CONCLUSION: Our study did not reveal any prognostic value of VEGF-C or VEGF-D. Therefore they are not useful as markers for patients with poor prognosis. Unlike in other studies, our patient group was homogenous which might have contributed to the results obtained.
17695432,5,2007,Anticancer Res,S100A10 expression in thyroid neoplasms originating from the follicular epithelium: contribution to the aggressive characteristic of anaplastic carcinoma.,BACKGROUND: S100A10, a member of the S100 family, forms a heterotetramer with annexin IIH and promotes carcinoma invasion and metastasis by plasminogen activation. In this study, S100A10 and annexin II expression in thyroid neoplasms were demonstrated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression levels of S100A10 and annexin II in 193 thyroid neoplasms were immunohistochemically investigated.RESULTS: S10A10 and annexin II were not expressed in normal follicular cells or any follicular adenomas. Cells stained positively in 14.6% and 20.8% of follicular carcinomas for S100A10 and annexin II, respectively, but their expression levels were always low. S100A10 and annexin II were expressed in all papillary carcinomas, but 88.2% and 82.8% ofpapillary carcinomas were classified in the low group. These expression levels were not linked to any clinicopathological features. S100S10 and annexin II were also expressed in all anaplastic carcinomas, with 83.3% of these lesions were classified in the high group.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that S100A10 and annexin II contribute to the aggressive characteristics of anaplastic carcinoma, while playing a constitutive role in papillary carcinoma.
17455290,5,2007,J Neurosci Res,Electrophysiological characterization of neural stem/progenitor cells during in vitro differentiation: study with an immortalized neuroectodermal cell line.,Despite the accumulating data on the molecular and cell biological characteristics of neural stem/progenitor cells, their electrophysiological properties are not well understood. In the present work, changes in the membrane properties and current profiles were investigated in the course of in vitro-induced neuron formation in NE-4C cells. Induction by retinoic acid resulted in neuronal differentiation of about 50% of cells. Voltage-dependent Na+ currents appeared early in neuronal commitment, often preceding any morphological changes. A-type K+ currents were detected only at the stage of network formation by neuronal processes. Flat, epithelial- like, nestin-expressing progenitors persisted beside differentiated neurons and astrocytes. Stem/progenitor cells were gap junction coupled and displayed large, symmetrical, voltage-independent currents. By the blocking of gap junction communication, voltage-independent conductance was significantly reduced, and delayed-rectifying K+ currents became detectable. Our data indicate that voltage-independent symmetrical currents and gap junction coupling are characteristic physiological features of neural stem and progenitor cells regardless of the developmental state of their cellular environment.
17209570,5,2007,Biochemistry,Isomers of human alpha-synuclein stabilized by disulfide bonds exhibit distinct structural and aggregative properties.,The discovery of three mutants in the -synuclein (alphaSyn) gene and the identification of alphaSyn as the major component of Lewy body have opened a new field for understanding the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). AlphaSyn is a natively unfolded protein with unknown function and unspecified conformational heterogeneity. In this study, we introduce four Ser/Ala --&gt; Cys mutations at positions 9, 42, 69, and 89 in human wild-type alphaSyn (wt-alphaSyn) and two PD-associated alphaSyn mutants, A30P-alphaSyn and A53T-alphaSyn. This allows expression of three alphaSyn mutants, wt-alphaSyn(4C), A30P-alphaSyn(4C), and A53T-Syn(4C). Subsequent oxidative folding enables each alphaSyn(4C) mutant to form three partially stabilized two-disulfide isomers, designated as alphaSyn(2SS), that are amenable to further isolation and characterization. These alphaSyn mutants exhibit the following properties. (a) A30P-alphaSyn(4C) exhibits a lower folding flexibility than wt-alphaSyn(4C) and A53T-alphaSyn(4C). (b) All three alphaSyn(4C) mutants, like wt-alphaSyn, exhibit a predominant structure of random coil. However, wt-alphaSyn(2SS) adopts an alpha-helical conformation, whereas A30P-alphaSyn(2SS) and A53T-alphaSyn(2SS) take on significant beta-sheet structure. (c) A30P-alphaSyn(2SS) shows a stronger tendency to aggregate than A53T-alphaSyn(2SS) and wt-alphaSyn(2SS). (d) Three isolated isomers of wt-alphaSyn(2SS) exhibit a propensity for forming oligomers different yet enhanced versus that for wt-alphaSyn. These data together substantiate the notion that under physiological conditions, human alphaSyn exists as diverse conformational isomers which exhibit distinct propensities for aggregation and fibril formation.
18083166,4,2007,Exp Parasitol,Giardia duodenalis: pathological alterations in gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus, infected with different dosages of trophozoites.,To examine the infection kinetics and development of alterations in the small intestine of gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus), 72 gerbils were divided into six groups (A to F), with A serving as control and the others inoculated with increasing doses of trophozoites from Giardia duodenalis human isolate. The infection kinetics and the development of histopathological alterations were monitored by optical scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A 12-day prepatent period was observed, with intermittent elimination up to day 35 after inoculation. Statistically significant differences were found between the mean number of trophozoites recovered, per group, on the days of sacrifice, and a positive correlation between the inoculum dosage and the number of trophozoites recovered. Morphometrically, the villus:crypt ratio showed a drop in all the groups when compared with the control group. SEM revealed an increase in mucus production in the inoculated animals and the presence of trophozoite clusters at the top and base of the villi. The dosage of trophozoite inoculum does not interfere in the ability for infection to occur or in the development of histopathological alterations generated by intestinal colonization.
17907187,4,2007,Arthritis Rheum,The chemical biomarkers C2C, Coll2-1, and Coll2-1NO2 provide complementary information on type II collagen catabolism in healthy and osteoarthritic mice.,OBJECTIVE: Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, biglycan/fibromodulin double-deficient mice develop severe knee osteoarthritis. We undertook this study to compare type II collagen catabolism in the 2 genotypes and to compare the usefulness of 3 biomarkers of collagen degradation (C2C [also known as Col2-3/4C(long mono)] as well as the peptide Coll2-1 and its nitrated form, Coll2-1NO2) for evaluating collagen catabolism in vivo.METHODS: In 15 WT mice and 15 biglycan/fibromodulin double-deficient mice, we determined serum levels of C2C at ages 66 and 141 days, and we determined serum levels of Coll2-1 and Coll2-1NO2 at ages 49, 81, 95, and 141 days. Expression of the biomarkers in knee sections was examined using immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: The mean concentrations of C2C and Coll2-1 were higher in biglycan/fibromodulin double-deficient mice at all time points. For C2C and Coll2-1, the ratio of the serum concentration in biglycan/fibromodulin double-deficient mice to that in WT mice (the double-deficient:WT ratio) was constant over time and was approximately 1.63 and approximately 1.15, respectively. In contrast, the double-deficient:WT ratio for Coll2-1NO2 varied and, depending on age, was &gt;1 or &lt;1. No significant correlation was found between the expression of the different biomarkers, except for a weak, negative correlation between Coll2-1NO2 and C2C. In both genotypes, antibodies to each biomarker labeled some fibroblasts in the tendons and menisci as well as chondrocytes above the tidemark in articular cartilage. Growth plates were unstained. For each biomarker, extracellular staining was limited to fibrocartilage areas in the tendons and menisci in all mice and was limited to some focal lesions of the cartilage in biglycan/fibromodulin double-deficient mice.CONCLUSION: The different double-deficient:WT ratios observed with C2C, Coll2-1, and Coll2-1NO2 in the absence of any correlation between the expression of the 3 biomarkers indicate that these biomarkers give complementary, rather than redundant, information about in vivo type II collagen catabolism.
17695447,4,2007,Anticancer Res,A methionine-free diet associated with nitrosourea treatment down-regulates methylguanine-DNA methyl transferase activity in patients with metastatic cancer.,BACKGROUND: Methionine (MET) depletion used in association with chemotherapy improves the therapeutic index in animal models. This potentiating effect may be due to tumor cell sensitization to chloroethylnitrosoureas through their MET dependency and the down-regulation of O6- methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Our purpose was to evaluate the impact of the association of a dietary MET restriction with nitrosourea treatment on MGMT activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients with metastatic cancer (melanoma and glioma) received 4 cycles of a MET-free diet with cystemustine (60 mg/m2).RESULTS: MGMT activity in PBMCs decreased by an average of 13% from 553+/-90 fnol/mg before the diet to 413+/-59 fmol/mg after the diet + chemotherapy period (p=0.029). The decrease of MGMT activity was not affected by the duration of the MET-free diet period but seems to be correlated to the plasma MET depletion induced by the MET-free diet.
17695445,4,2007,Anticancer Res,Measurement of estrone sulfate in postmenopausal women: comparison of direct RIA and GC-MS/MS methods for monitoring response to endocrine therapy in women with breast cancer.,BACKGROUND: High concentrations of estrone sulfate (EIS) are present in serum of pre- and postmenopausal women. Most assays for this estrogen conjugate involve enzyme hydrolysis and chromatographic purification prior to RIA. We have compared concentrations of serum EIS in postmenopausal women measured by direct RIA or GC-MS/MS methods.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed serum EIS concentrations using a direct 'ultrasensitive' RIA. Serum EIS concentrations were also measured by GC-MS/MS in which estrone conjugates are isolated using a solid-phase technique after which enzyme hydrolysis is employed to liberate estrone prior to GC-MS/MS analysis.RESULTS: We analysed 32 serum samples collected from 8 postmenopausal women participating in a Phase I trial of the steroid sulfatase inhibitor 667 COUMA TE. Concentrations of E1S were 998+/-86 pmol/l (mean +/- sem) and 912+/-114 pmol/l as measured by direct RIA and GC-MS/MS methods respectively. There was a highly significant correlation (r=0.96, p&lt;0.001) between concentrations of EIS measured by the different methods.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the direct 'ultrasensitive' RIA for the measurement of serum EIS provides a reliable method for assaying serum concentrations of this estrogen conjugate and should be useful in monitoring the response to endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer.
17695425,4,2007,Anticancer Res,Prediction of response to definitive chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer using positron emission tomography.,BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has already proven useful in assessing the extension of esophageal carcinomas, detecting tumor recurrence and monitoring responses to therapy. The current study aims to assess the potential role of FDG-PET in predicting the response of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with thoracic esophageal SCC who received definitive CRT between January 2001 and December 2005 underwent PET before and after CRT. The clinical evaluation of the primary tumor response to treatment was classified as either complete response (CR) or non-CR.RESULTS: All patients had intensive FDG uptake in the primary tumor prior to CRT. The standardized uptake value (SUV) averaged 8.2+/-4.7 before CRT and decreased significantly to 2.8+/-1.8 after CRT (p&lt;0.0001). The SUV before CRT averaged 10.2 in the non-CR group (n=17) and 4.9 in the CR group (n= 10). The SUV after CRT averaged 3.7 in the non-CR group and 1.4 in the CR group. The change in SUV for the CR group was higher than that in the non-CR group (p&lt;0.05). The relationship between clinical features and clinical CR was analyzed using logistic regression analysis which revealed significant correlations between clinical CR and the longitudinal dimension of the tumor (p &lt;0.05), SUV before CRT (p&lt;0.05), SUV after CRT (p&lt;0.01) and tumor classification (p &lt;0.05). If the clinical features before CRT were limited, multivariate analysis revealed that the SUV before CRT was an independent predictor for clinical CR (p&lt;0.05).CONCLUSION: In predicting clinical evaluation of therapy prior to CRT, we suggest that SUV prior to definitive CRT is one of the most reliable predictors of response, along with tumor dimensions and classification.
17695419,4,2007,Anticancer Res,Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 in Merkel cell carcinoma.,BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and to correlate the expression with tumour growth and the development of metastasis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 21 patients treated for MCC at Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland between 1987 and 2003. The VEGFR-2 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry. The correlations between the quantitative expression of VEGFR-2 and tumour size and metastatic dissemination were analyzed statistically.RESULTS: VEGFR-2 was expressed in 91% of the large (&gt; or =2 cm) and 70% of the small (&lt;2 cm) tumours. There was a stronger positive correlation between expression of VEGFR-2 and tumour size than between VEGFR-2 and metastatic potential.CONCLUSION: A correlation between the expression of pro-angiogenic marker and tumour size was established. Our results indicate that inhibiting angiogenesis could be a treatment option for MCC. The role of neovascularization in the metastatic process in MCC remains to be determined.
17562365,4,2007,Bioorg Med Chem,E,E,E-1-(4-Arylamino-4-oxo-2-butenoyl)-3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones: a topographical study of some novel potent cytotoxins.,A series of E,E,E-3,5-bis(arylidene)-1-(4-arylamino-4-oxo-2-butenoyl)-4-piperidones 4 (phenylidene) and 5 (4-nitrophenylidene) were prepared in order to explore the structural features of the N-acyl group which affects the cytotoxic potency. Evaluation toward human Molt 4/C8 and CEM T-lymphocytes revealed that many of the IC(50) figures were submicromolar and lower than melphalan. Marked inhibitory potencies toward murine leukemia L1210 cells were also noted. When evaluated against a panel of human tumor cell lines, three representative compounds in series 4 displayed selective toxicity to leukemia and colon cancer cell lines and were significantly more potent than the reference drug melphalan. Molecular modeling of representative compounds in both series 4 and the analogs, in which the configuration of the olefinic double bond was changed from E to Z (series 3), revealed that the torsion angles of the arylidene aryl rings and locations of the terminal arylaminocarbonyl groups may have contributed to the greater cytotoxic properties displayed in 3. Compounds 4c (3,4-dichlorophenylamino), d (4-methylphenylamino) and 5c (3,4-dichlorophenylamino), d (4-methylphenylamino) inhibited the activity of human N-myristoyltransferase by approximately 50% at concentrations of 50-100 microM. The compounds in series 4 and 5 were well tolerated in a short-term toxicity study in mice.
17555846,4,2007,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and antifungal activity of some new 3-hydroxy-2-(1-phenyl-3-aryl-4-pyrazolyl) chromones.,Seven new 3-hydroxy-2-(1-phenyl-3-aryl-4-pyrazolyl) chromones 4a-g have been synthesized by the oxidation of 2-hydroxychalcone analogues of pyrazole 3a-g with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in KOH-MeOH by Algar Flynn Oymanda (AFO) reaction. The structures of the compounds 4 were established by the combined use of (1)H NMR, IR and mass spectra. All the seven compounds were tested in vitro for their antifungal activity against three phytopathogenic fungi, namely Helminthosporium species, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria alternata. Five compounds 4a, 4b, 4c, 4e and 4f were associated with substantially higher antifungal activity than commercial antifungal compound Actidione (cycloheximide) against all three phytopathogenic fungi.
17371067,4,2007,J Nat Prod,Triterpenoid pyrazines and benzopyrazines with cytotoxic activity.,Twelve lupane, 18alpha-oleanane, and des-E-lupane derivatives (1a-5b) were either extracted from natural sources or synthesized from betulinic acid (1a) and betulin (2). Compounds 1b, 1c, 3b, 3c, 4b, 4c, 5a, and 5b were then used as starting materials for further synthesis of a series of pyrazines and benzopyrazines (6a-18); 20 of them are new (6a-6e, 7a-7d, and 10a-18). Activity of pyrazine 6a against the T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CEM encouraged us to synthesize several new esters (6b-6d) to study structure-activity relationships with respect to substitution of the carboxyl group at position 28. The synthesized compounds were tested for cytotoxicity against a variety of cancer cell lines of different histogenetic origin, and the results were compared with cytotoxicity of the known starting compounds. Significant cytotoxic activity against A 549, K 562, and multidrug-resistant K 562-tax cell lines was found in pyrazines 6a, 6d, and 6e.
17931862,3,2007,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Efficient synthesis and in vitro cytostatic activity of 4-substituted triazolyl-nucleosides.,We report herein an efficient synthesis of 4-substituted triazolyl-nucleosides and their in vitro cytostatic activity. The synthesis is based on a straightforward 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between 1-azido-ribose 2 and terminal alkynes under a cooperative effect of microwave activation and copper (I) catalysis. All cycloadducts were obtained in nearly quantitative yield after a short reaction time (1 to 2min). After removal of acetyl protecting groups, the free nucleosides were evaluated against L1210, Molt4/C8, and CEM tumor cell lines. Structure-activity relationship study shows that the substituent on the triazole ring has a major effect since nucleosides 4c and 4g, containing, respectively, a long alkyl chain and an aryl donor group are the most active compounds in this series.
17695492,3,2007,Anticancer Res,Clinical significance of nm23 gene expression in gastric cancer.,BACKGROUND: The expression of the nm23 gene has been associated with the development of metastasis. Numerous studies have shown down-regulation of nm23 expression in metastatic breast and colon cancer. The expression of the putative metastasis-suppressor gene nm23 in gastric carcinoma is controversial. The aim of this study was the analysis of nm23 expression in a large series of gastric cancer patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective immunohistochemical study specimens obtained from 116 gastric cancer patients (mean age 64 years; range: 33-85) who had undergone gastrectomy with extended lymphadenectomy were analyzed. Nm23 expression in the tumor epithelium was studied by immunohistochemistry followed by a semi-quantitative (score 0-3) evaluation. Statistical analysis including Chi-square test, uni- and multivariate survival analyses were performed.RESULTS: The nm23 staining pattern was positive (score 2-3) in 100 (86.2%) specimens and negative (score 0-1) in 16 (13.8%) samples. Lymph node metastasis was found in 65% of the patients. No significant correlations could be determined between nm23 expression and other variables such as gender, age, tumor differentiation, WHO-, Laurén-, Goseki-, or Ming-classification. The intensity of nm23 staining in the tumor cells was not significantly correlated with depth of tumor infiltration (T-stage), lymph node metastasis (N-stage), distant metastasis (M-stage), UICC-stage, or prognosis.CONCLUSION: Our series did not show a correlation of nm23 expression in terms of lymph node and distant metastasis or prognosis in gastric cancer patients.
17695488,3,2007,Anticancer Res,Capecitabine plus hepatic intra-arterial epirubicin and cisplatin in unresectable biliary cancer: a phase II study.,The aim of the present study was to evaluate the activity of hepatic intra-arterial infusion of epirubicin and cisplatin combined with oral capecitabine, in patients with unresectable biliary carcinomas.</AbstractText>: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the activity of hepatic intra-arterial infusion of epirubicin and cisplatin combined with oral capecitabine, in patients with unresectable biliary carcinomas.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients were treated by bolus infusion of epirubicin 50 mg/m2 and cisplatin 60 mg/m2 in the hepatic artery on day 1, combined with oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid, from day 2 to day 15.RESULTS: Partial responses (PR) were observed in 6 patients (31.5%), stable disease (SD) in 9 (47.5%) and progression (PD) in 4 (21%). The median progression-free and overall survival periods were 11.6 and 18.0 months, respectively, and 1-year survival was 74%. One patient died after the first cycle because of G4 diarrhea. The other patients had good tolerance, with minimal hematological toxicity and only 1 G3 vomiting.CONCLUSION: This combined intra-arterial and oral approach to patients with biliary carcinomas was found to be active and safe and seems to produce an encouraging survival response.
17695484,3,2007,Anticancer Res,Analysis of long-term survivors of glioblastoma multiforme in a single institution with aggressive local retreatment protocol.,Current treatment methods result in survival beyond 2 years in just a minority of adult patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Our institution has used an aggressive policy of local retreatment, including surgery and radiotherapy, at first relapse. Long-term survival (&gt;2 years) after such an approach was evaluated.</AbstractText>: Current treatment methods result in survival beyond 2 years in just a minority of adult patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Our institution has used an aggressive policy of local retreatment, including surgery and radiotherapy, at first relapse. Long-term survival (&gt;2 years) after such an approach was evaluated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out of all patients with confirmed histological diagnosis of GBM at relapse. Patients with oligodendroglial component or progression from low-grade glioma were not included.RESULTS: Out of the 30 patients managed with aggressive local retreatment, 8 survived for more than 2 years, but no 5-year survivors were observed. All were younger than 60 years, had a good performance status, RPA class III or IV and a long interval to relapse. Those with the longest survival times had also received two different chemotherapy regimens. However, two of the patients were never treated with chemotherapy. Survival from retreatment was 5-17 months.CONCLUSION: When selecting patients on the basis of the factors associated with long-term survival, the same sequence of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy that should be considered at first diagnosis might provide a moderate survival extension.
17695479,3,2007,Anticancer Res,Vertical platysma myocutaneous flap reconstruction for T2-staged oral carcinoma.,The surgical resection of tumour-affected oral soft tissue structures often leads to tissue defects. Various techniques can be used for reconstruction. Our experience of using a vertical platysma myocutaneous flap in a group of patients who underwent reconstruction after T2-staged oral cancer surgical resection associated with neck dissection is described. Only one patient required a surgical revision, due to flap detachment, with a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. No other major complications, such as nerve lesions or orocutaneous fistulas, were observed. Satisfactory swallowing function was achieved within two weeks in all cases. A platysma myocutaneous flap is a versatile, easy-to-perform, one-stage procedure, and the outcome is best in adequately selected patients; it should not be adopted in patients who have undergone previous neck surgery or radiotherapy, or if radical neck dissection is planned. Care is required to preserve the external jugular vein and the submental artery, particularly when level I is dissected.
17695477,3,2007,Anticancer Res,Expression of mRNA MMP-7 and mRNA TIMP-1 in non-small cell lung cancer.,BACKGROUND: Destruction of the extracellular matrix is a necessary precondition for metastasis and invasion of tumour cells. Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in this process, matrilysin being one of them (MMP-7). The results of our pilot study with patients operated on for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), with the assessment of MMP-7 and the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP-1), are presented here.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The group consisted of 34 patients who had been operated on in the course of 2005. Messenger RNA MMP- 7 and TIMP-1 were assessed in 20 cases (58%). Tissue samples were frozen to -70 degrees C, total RNA was subsequently isolated and a reverse transcription was performed from it. The quantitative assessment itself was performed using a real-time PCR method. The resulting expression level was determined as the expression ratio of the assessed gene and the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).RESULTS: A higher expression of mRNA MMP-7 was found in the NSCLC tissue than in non-tumourous lung tissue. On the other hand, a higher expression of mRNA TIMP-1 in the non-tumourous surrounding lung tissue was demonstrated. The expression of mRNA MMP-7 and TIMP-1 was higher in adenocarcinoma than in the epidermoid form of NSCLC.CONCLUSION: The value of our results should not be overestimated since we had only a small group of patients and assessed only one of the whole range of metalloproteinases (MMP-7). We consider the assessment and ratio quantification of metallorpoteinases in normal lung and NSCLC to be the first step in a further application of these parameters.
17695469,3,2007,Anticancer Res,Course of mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes in cancer patients treated with Viscum album extracts.,BACKGROUND: In a prospective observational study, the impact of two different dose regimes of a commercially available fermented Viscum album L. extract (VA-E, Iscador) on the function of T lymphocytes from cancer patients was investigated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 cancer patients were enrolled. These patients attended two different sections of a tumor outpatient clinic which are used to apply different VA-E escalation schemes. Our hypothesis was that a rapid dose escalation of subcutaneously applied VA-E may induce strong local reactions at the injection side (&gt;3 cm diameter) and may have an effect on the functional competence of T lymphocytes (mitogen-activated interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain), which was recorded over an observation period of six month.RESULTS: Within this observation period, a decline of stimulated T cell function was observed, particularly in patients with colorectal or prostate cancer; this decline was not seen in patients with breast cancer (who received lower mean concentrations per month) nor in patients with dose adaptation in response to too strong local reactions.CONCLUSION: With respect to T-cell function, our results indicate that in patients without local reactions, a long lasting mistletoe extract application should be withheld periodically to allow T-cell reactivity to recover.
17695458,3,2007,Anticancer Res,A phase II trial of weekly irinotecan in cisplatin-refractory esophageal cancer.,BACKGROUND: This study investigated the efficacy and toxicity of weekly single-agent irinotecan in patients with metastatic disease relapsing after cisplatin-based chemotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients were enrolled. A total number of 29 cycles (one cycle consisted of CPT-11 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, qd 28) were applied. Irinotecan was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Where toxicity was less than WHO grade 3, the dose of irinotecan was escalated in 20 mg steps in subsequent cycles up to a maximum dose of 140 mg/m2. Patients were assessed for response according to WHO criteria every second cycle.RESULTS: Of the 13 evaluable patients, 2 achieved a partial response (PR) and 3 disease stabilisation (NC); progressive disease (PD) was noted in 8 patients. Median time to progression was 2 months (range: 1-8 months) and median survival from start of study treatment was 5 months (range: 2-16 months). Grade 3 toxicity consisted of diarrhea (n=3), fever (n=1) and pain (n=1).CONCLUSION: Single-agent irinotecan has moderate activity in cisplatin-refractory esophageal cancer.
17695457,3,2007,Anticancer Res,Prognostic value of HER2 and progesterone receptor expression in endometrial carcinoma with positive peritoneal washing.,BACKGROUND: Although the majority of endometrial cancer (EC) patients can be cured by surgery, unexpected recurrent disease may also occur in early stage patients. In the present study, whether or not the analysis of multiple biopathological parameters might lead to more accurate predictions of the clinical outcome of EC patients with long-term follow-up (FU) was investigated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PgR) positivity and HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry were evaluated. The peritoneal washings (PWs) were analyzed by cytology and immunocytochemistry employing AR-3 and B72.3 monoclonal antibodies.RESULTS: The patients with positive PW and HER2 positive tumors showed shorter overall survival compared to those bearing HER2 negative tumors (p =0.004). HER2 overexpression also influenced the patient outcome in the group with tumors lacking PgR (p = 0.004). At multivariate analysis PgR and HER2 overexpression emerged as independent prognostic factors.CONCLUSION: The combined analysis of these biopathological markers could provide useful information for the selection of patients to be enrolled in innovative therapeutic strategies.
17695449,3,2007,Anticancer Res,Expression of MMP-10 in lung cancer.,BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated degradation of the extracellular matrix is a key point in tumor development and expansion. MMP-10 is one of the most important and well-characterized members of the MMP family. In the present study, we examined MMP-10 mRNA and protein levels in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three endogenous reference genes including GAPDH, beta-actin and 18S rRNA, and MMP-10 mRNA levels were determined using real-time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical staining was applied to examine MMP-10 protein levels. Both tumor and adjacent normal lung tissues were collected from 32 NSCLC patients. The mRNA levels of GAPDH, beta-actin and 18S rRNA exhibited great differences in tumor tissues and in the adjacent normal tissues. The ratio of mRNA levels in the tumor tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues followed the pattern GAPDH &gt; beta-actin &gt; 18S rRNA. Thereafter, we chose 18S rRNA as the reference gene for MMP-10 mRNA level determinations. MMP-10 mRNA levels in tumor tissues were significantly lower than those in the adjacent normal tissues (p =0.0423). However, the MMP-10 protein levels were higher in the tumor tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues (p=0.0055). The MMP-10 mRNA level was positively-correlated to the MMP-10 protein level in tumor tissues (r=0.4672, p=0.0161), but this correlation was not seen in the adjacent normal tissues (r=-0.0030, p=0.9891).CONCLUSION: There were no statistical differences in MMP-10 mRNA levels and protein levels in relation to patient's gender, age, tumor stages, tumor size, lymph node metastasis or tumor histological type.
17695439,3,2007,Anticancer Res,Combination therapy with thalidomide, temozolomide and tamoxifen improves quality of life in patients with malignant astrocytomas.,BACKGROUND: Patients with malignant astrocytomas (MA) have a poor survival rate despite surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). Patients deteriorate rapidly with decreasing quality of life (QoL). The purpose of the current study was to determine the safety and efficacy, including QoL evaluation, of oral therapy with temozolomide, thalidomide, and tamoxifen (TTT) in patients with MA in an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved, prospective trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients met the eligibility requirements and were enrolled after informed consent was signed. After baseline testing, patients received temozolomide 75 mg/m2 orally (p.o.) for the first 21 days, thalidomide 100 mg p.o. daily, and tamoxifen 100 mg p.o. daily for each 28-day cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression. Primary outcome measurements were survival (Kaplan-Meier analysis), response to treatment, toxicity (National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criterion) and QoL evaluation.RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that survival time from diagnosis was 78.4+/-15 weeks with a median survival of 54.6 weeks and from date of enrollment was 46.1+/-10 weeks with median survival of 33.3 weeks. Toxicity was limited to 5 patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), 2 of whom had pulmonary emboli (PE). All recovered with anticoagulation therapy and none suffered long term sequelae. Several QoL measures, including the global health status scores (p=0.003), were significantly improved after 2 cycles of treatment compared to the baseline assessment.CONCLUSION: The combination of temozolomide, thalidomide and tamoxifen administered as outpatient oral therapy resulted in significantly improved QoL for patients with MA without significant toxicity.
17695416,3,2007,Anticancer Res,Pharmacoanalytical assays of Erwinia asparaginase (erwinase) and pharmacokinetic results in high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR ALL) patients: simulations of erwinase population PK-PD models.,BACKGROUND: Asparaginases are the cornerstone therapy of many successful combination regimens for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common malignancy in children and adolescents. Currently, two asparaginase formulations are available in the US, native Escherichia coli asparaginase (ASNase) and pegaspargase. A third formulation native Erwinia asparaginase (Erwinase, ERW) has recently been made available under a licensing exception for personal use. We report here the development and validation process of ERW pharmacoanalytical assays and the results in a few patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed and systematically validated the ERW enzyme activity and ERW concentration, anti-ERW antibody and related assays. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) studies were performed in a limited number of patients who received 6,000 IU/m2 x 3 per week x 2 courses, and 4 patients who received 25,000 IU/m2 x 3 per week x 2 courses of ERW.RESULTS: The linearity and range of the Erwinase calibration lines for the pharmacoanalytical assays were excellent. The accuracy and precision were better than the FDA limit allows for oncology biological products (&lt;30%) coefficient of variation (%CV) and related parameters in the quantification of ERW concentration. The validation of these parameters was equal to or better than during the assay development. PK-PD analyses of ERW in a few patients yielded an average half-life of elimination of 15.8+/-1.64 hours. There was an excellent PD response post ERW administration resulting in an ERW concentration-dependent asparagine (ASN, &lt;0.5 microM) and glutamine (GLN, &lt;50 microM) deamination. Pharmacodynamic correlations demonstrated that 0.1 to 0.2 IU/ml of ERW in serum were sufficient for 90% GLN and/or ASN deamination for up to 2 weeks. No anti-ERW antibody [Ab(+)] was seen among those few patients. None of the other 5 patients had an adverse event. Based on these post hoc results, simulations on various doses and schedules of this drug have been made.CONCLUSION: The pharmacoanalytical assays were excellent tools to evaluate the PK and PD data of ERW in pediatric patients with HR ALL. However, this initial PK-PD evidence needs further validation in future clinical trials. Insights into the PD contributions of ERW in anti-E. coli ASNase Ab(+) patients will guide us in optimal design and use of ERW as part of combination chemotherapy regimens in future clinical trials.
17501997,3,2007,World J Surg Oncol,Is zero underestimation feasible? Extended Vacuum-Assisted Breast Biopsy in solid lesions - a blind study.,BACKGROUND: Vacuum-Assisted Breast Biopsy (VABB) is effective for the preoperative diagnosis of non-palpable mammographic solid lesions. The main disadvantage is underestimation, which might render the management of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) difficult. This study aims to develop and assess a modified way of performing VABB.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 107 women with non-palpable mammographic breast solid tumors BI-RADS 3 and 4 underwent VABB with 11G, on the stereotactic Fischer's table. 54 women were allocated to the recommended protocol and 24 cores were obtained according to the consensus meeting in Nordesterdt (1 offset-main target in the middle of the lesion and one offset inside). 53 women were randomly allocated to the extended protocol and 96 cores were excised (one offset-main target in the middle of the lesion and 7 peripheral offsets). A preoperative diagnosis was established. Women with a preoperative diagnosis of precursor/preinvasive/invasive lesion underwent open surgery. A second pathologist, blind to the preoperative results and to the protocol made the postoperative diagnosis. The percentage of the surface excised via VABB was retrospectively calculated on the mammogram. The discrepancy between preoperative and postoperative diagnoses along with the protocol adopted and the volume removed were evaluated by Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, respectively.RESULTS: Irrespectively of the protocol adopted, 82.2% of the lesions were benign. 14.0% of the lesions were malignancies (5.1% of BI-RADS 3, 5.3% of BI-RADS 4A, 25% of BI-RADS 4B, and 83.3% of BI-RADS 4C lesions). 3.7% of the biopsies were precursor lesions. There was no evidence of underestimation in either protocols. In the standard protocol, the preoperative/postoperative diagnoses were identical. In the extended protocol, the postoperative diagnosis was less severe than the preoperative in 55.5% of cases (55.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.029), and preoperative ADH was totally removed. The phenomenon of discrepancy between diagnoses was associated with larger volume removed (8.20 +/- 1.10 vs. 3.32 +/- 3.50 cm3, p = 0.037) and higher removed percentage of the lesion (97.83 +/- 4.86% vs. 74.34 +/- 23.43%, p = 0.024)CONCLUSION: The extended protocol seems to totally excise precursor lesions, with minimal underestimation. This might possibly point to a modified management of ADH lesions.
17478552,3,2007,Endocrinology,B-Type natriuretic peptide inhibited angiotensin II-stimulated cholesterol biosynthesis, cholesterol transfer, and steroidogenesis in primary human adrenocortical cells.,In this study, we demonstrate that B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) opposed angiotensin II (Ang II)-stimulated de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, cellular cholesterol uptake, cholesterol transfer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, and steroidogenesis, which are required for biosynthesis of steroid hormones such as aldosterone and cortisol in primary human adrenocortical cells. BNP dose-dependently stimulated intracellular cGMP production with an EC(50) of 11 nm, implying that human adrenocortical cells express the guanylyl cyclase A receptor. cDNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that BNP inhibited Ang II-stimulated genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis (acetoacetyl coenzyme A thiolase, HMG coenzyme A synthase 1, HMG coenzyme A reductase, isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase, lanosterol synthase, sterol-4C-methyl oxidase, and emopamil binding protein/sterol isomerase), cholesterol uptake from circulating lipoproteins (scavenger receptor class B type I and low-density lipoprotein receptor), cholesterol transfer to the inner mitochondrial membrane (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein), and steroidogenesis (ferredoxin 1,3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, glutathione transferase A3, CYP19A1, CYP11B1, and CYP11B2). Consistent with the microarray and real-time PCR results, BNP also blocked Ang II-induced binding of (125)I-labeled low-density lipoprotein and (125)I-labeled high-density lipoprotein to human adrenocortical cells. Furthermore, BNP markedly inhibited Ang II-stimulated release of estradiol, aldosterone, and cortisol from cultured primary human adrenocortical cells. These findings demonstrate that BNP opposes Ang II-induced steroidogenesis via multiple steps from cholesterol supply and transfer to the final formation of steroid hormones. This study provides new insights into the cellular mechanisms by which BNP modulates Ang II-induced steroidogenesis in the adrenal gland.
17336429,3,2007,Eur J Med Chem,Syntheses of new tetrasubstituted thiophenes as novel anti-inflammatory agents.,A series of new tetrasubstituted thiophenes (4a-4i, 5a-5i and 6a-6f) have been synthesized as novel anti-inflammatory agents and were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenin-induced rat hind paw oedema model at the doses of 10, 20 and 40mg/kg body weight. Among ester series, the best compound 4c showed 71% protection at 10mg/kg, 72% at 20mg/kg, and 76% at 40mg/kg to inflamed paw; while in acid series 5a showed 79% protection at 10mg/kg, 80% at 20mg/kg, and 70% at 40mg/kg, and 5c showed 72% protection at 10mg/kg, 75% at 20mg/kg, and 69% at 40mg/kg, to inflamed paw. In case of oxime series 6a-6f, the anti-inflammatory activities of the candidates were found to be poor as compared to acid and ester series. It was found on the basis of SAR studies of target compounds, that the presence of OCH(3) at R(2) position and H, OCH(3) at R(1) are one of the requirements for eliciting comparable anti-inflammatory activity in both tetrasubstituted thiophenes' ester and acid series. Compounds 4a-4i, 5a-5i were investigated for their analgesic activity in acetic acid induced writhing response model at 10mg/kg dose. Among the ester series compound 4e showed maximum protection of 60%, while 4a, 4b, and 4i exhibited 55%, 45%, and 43% protection, respectively. The result showed that presence of H, Cl at R(1) and OCH(3), CH(3) at R(2) in tetrasubstituted thiophene ester series enhances their analgesic activity. The candidates of acid series 5a-5i showed poor analgesic activity as compared to the standard drug ibuprofen. Compounds 4a-4i, 5a-5i were evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant nitric oxide radical scavenging assay. Among the ester series 4a showed maximum in vitro nitric oxide radical scavenging activity having IC(50) value 30.08microg/ml while in acid series 5a has IC(50) value 25.20microg/ml. The results showed that the presence of R(1)=H, R(2)=OCH(3) and R(1)=R(2)=OCH(3) enhances nitric oxide radical scavenging property in tetrasubstituted thiophenes' acid series.
17284369,3,2007,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Bipolar genome reductional division of human near-senescent, polyploid fibroblast cells.,The rise in mitotic polyploid cells in near-senescence (phase III) of human fibroblast cells has been found to contain diplochromosomes (four chromatids). For tetraploid cells, this translates into 46 pairs of sister chromosomes. It has been suggested, from the increase in numbers of such cells, that they might deviate from expected normal, single chromatid segregations in mitosis. In this study, the polyploid cells with diplochromosomes were shown to segregate by bipolar mitosis into genome-reduced cells. Sister pairs separated from each other and moved as a genomic group of two-chromatid chromosomes to the poles. A tetraploid cell thus became reduced to two diploid cells (i.e., G2-4c in G1), which in the next mitosis could either restore the previous diplochromosomal status and ploidy level or cycle as diploid mitotic cells. The polyploid cells that are programmed for genome reductional division become part of the senescent cell population. In such populations, there is depolyploidization into multinucleated cells (MNCs) that can spawn genome-reduced mitotic offspring cells. These facts are relevant to neoplasticity-associated cytopathologies such as 4n cells as intermediates in Barrett's esophagus, MNCs in human papillomavirus infections, and radiation-associated cell changes. On a cell population level, the bipolar genome reductional division is a source for genetic heterogeneity, generating a continued mixture of polyploid and genome-reduced cells. The only other known case is in the mosquito, but the phenomenon is likely more common than has been thought.
17228350,3,2007,Eur J Clin Nutr,Body composition by the four-compartment model: validity of the BOD POD for assessing body fat in Mexican elderly.,OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to validate BOD POD in a wide sample of healthy and independent Mexican elderly men and women subjects using the 4 compartment (4C) model as the reference method, and to evaluate the assumptions of the densitometric two-compartment (2C) model.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study designed to assess body composition and validation of a method based on 2C model (BOD POD).SETTING: Urban and rural regions of Sonora, Mexico.SUBJECTS: Two hundred and two free-living subjects &gt;or=60 years old were completed in this study.METHODS: Body density and body fat were measured by the BOD POD, total body water by deuterium dilution and total body bone ash by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body composition was determined using Baumgartner's equation.RESULTS: Percent body fat by the 4C model was 31.2 and 42.5% in men and women, respectively (P&lt;0.001). Group mean accuracy of body fat by BOD POD against that of the 4C model showed an effect of sex (P&lt;0.001), but not the method (P=0.27). Results of individual accuracy showed no significant difference with the identity line and the slope was significantly different from zero or a slope similar to one. Precision assessed by model R (2) was high for all subjects and for men and women by separate. The standard error of the estimate was low for all and for men and women by separate. Bland and Altman analysis showed no significant bias.CONCLUSION: The BOD POD technique is a valid and reliable method compared to the 4C model and it could be applied in subjects with similar physical and anthropometric characteristics to subjects of this study.
18084645,2,2007,Bioinformation,Computational and molecular characterization of multiple isoforms of lfe-2 gene in nematode C. elegans.,C. elegans C46H11.4 gene encodes a Let-23 fertility effector/regulator protein of the EGF-receptor class of the tyrosine kinase family. Alternative splicing is a major mechanism of generating protein diversity in higher eukaryotes. C. elegans genome sequencing consortium has reported three alternatively spliced transcripts of C46H11.4 gene which encodes for three hypothetical proteins namely, C46H11.4a, C46H11.4b and C46H11.4c. Using a combination of various bioinformatics tools like gene or exon finding programmes, blast searches, alignment tools etc followed by experimental validation, we report the presence of three more alternatively spliced transcripts which encode for novel hypothetical proteins C46H11.4d, C46H11.4e and C46H11.4f. These isoforms arise as a result of alternative splicing in the pre-mRNA encoded by gene C46H11.4. These novel un-reported spliced variants not only point towards the extent of alternative splicing in C. elegans genes but also hint towards the complex nature of alternative splicing.
18070351,2,2007,BMC Med Genet,The intron 4c allele of the NOS3 gene is associated with ischemic stroke in African Americans.,BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in North America and in addition to the generally accepted risk factors, there is increasing evidence for the potential pathophysiological role of genes. One of these genes, the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene (NOS3) has been reported as a genetic risk factor for ischemic stroke. To independently confirm and extend the results of these previous reports, we investigated this gene as a risk factor for stroke in an ethnically diverse study population.METHODS: Using the TOAST classification, we characterized and studied 377 patients with ischemic stroke. We genotyped two common variants in the NOS3 gene, the intron 4 insertion/deletion and an exonic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), G894T, in these patients and compared them with 502 controls. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to examine allele effects on stroke and stroke subtypes. Logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for confounding covariate effects.RESULTS: All genotypes are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium except for intron 4c, which is overrepresented in ischemic stroke patients. In pooled analysis of all patients, intron 4c, but not intron 4a, intron 4b or G894T alleles are associated with stroke (p &lt; 0.01). In subgroup analysis by race, the intron 4c allele is most strongly associated with large artery ischemic stroke in African Americans (p &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: We are unable to confirm previous reports of an association of the intron 4a or the G894T alleles with ischemic stroke. However, although limited by a relatively small sample size, our study suggests a potentially important role of the intron 4c allele as a genetic marker of ischemic stroke in African Americans.
18047345,2,2007,J Am Chem Soc,The dinuclear Zn(II) complex catalyzed cyclization of a series of 2-hydroxypropyl aryl phosphate RNA models: progressive change in mechanism from rate-limiting P-O bond cleavage to substrate binding.,A methoxide-bridged dinuclear Zn(II) complex of 1,3-[N,N'-bis(1,5,9-triazacyclododecane)]propane (1-Zn(II)2:(-OCH3)) was prepared, and its catalysis of the cyclization of a series of 2-hydroxypropyl aryl phosphates (4a-g) was investigated in methanol at pH 9.8, T = 25degreesC by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. An X-ray diffraction structure of the hydroxide analogue of 1-Zn(II)2:(-OCH3), namely 1-Zn(II)2:(-OH), reveals that each of the Zn(II) ions is coordinated by the three N's of the triazacyclododecane units and a bridging hydroxide. The cyclizations of substrates 4a-g reveal a progressive change in the observed kinetics from Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics for the poorer substrates (4-OCH3 (4g); 4-H (4f); 3-OCH3 (4e); 4-Cl (4d); 3-NO2, (4c)) to second-order kinetics (linear in 1-Zn(II)2:(-OCH3)) for the better substrates (4-NO2,3-CH3 (4b); 4-NO2, (4a)). The data are analyzed in terms of a multistep process whereby a first formed complex rearranges to a reactive complex with a doubly activated phosphate coordinated to both metal ions. The kinetic behavior of the series is analyzed in terms of change in rate-limiting step for the catalyzed reaction whereby the rate-limiting step for the poorer substrates (4g-c) is the chemical step of cyclization of the substrate, while for the better substrates (4b,a) the rate-limiting step is binding. The catalysis of the cyclization of these substrates is extremely efficient. The kcat/KM values for the catalyzed reactions range from 2.75 x 10(5) to 2.3 x 10(4) M-1 s-1, providing an acceleration of 1 x 10(8) to 4 x 10(9) relative to the methoxide reaction (k2OCH3, which ranges from 2.6 x 10(-3) to 5.9 x 10(-6) M-1 s-1 for 4a-g). At a pH of 9.8 where the catalyst is maximally active, the acceleration for the substrates ranges from (1 - 4) x 10(12) relative to the background reaction at the same pH. Detailed energetics calculations show that the transition state for the catalyzed reaction comprising 1-Zn(II)2, methoxide, and 4 is stabilized by about -21 to -23 kcal/mol relative to the transition state for the methoxide reaction. The pronounced catalytic activity is attributed to a synergism between a positively charged catalyst that has high affinity for the substrate and for the transition state for cyclization, and a medium effect involving a reduced polarity/dielectric constant that complements a reaction where an oppositely charged reactant and catalyst experience charge dispersal in the transition state.
17998164,2,2007,Bioorg Med Chem,Design and synthesis of eugenol derivatives, as potent 15-lipoxygenase inhibitors.,A group of 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol (eugenol) esters were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as potential inhibitors of soybean 15-lipoxygenase (SLO). Compounds 4c, 4d 4f, 4p, and 4q showed the best IC(50) in SLO inhibition (IC(50)=1.7, 2.3, 2.1, 2.2, and 0.017microM, respectively). All compounds were docked into SLO active site and showed that allyl group of compounds is oriented toward the iron atom in the active site of SLO. It is assumed that lipophilic interaction of ligand-enzyme would be in charge of inhibiting the enzyme activity. The selectivity of eugenol derivatives in inhibiting 15-HLOb was also compared with 15-HLOa by molecular modeling and multiple alignment techniques.
17888666,2,2007,Bioorg Med Chem,Dual-acting agents that possess reversing resistance and anticancer activities: Design, synthesis, MES-SA/Dx5 cell assay, and SAR of Benzyl 1,2,3,5,11,11a-hexahydro-3,3-dimethyl-1-oxo-6H-imidazo[3',4':1,2]pyridin[3,4-b]indol-2-substitutedacetates.,Based on the structural analysis of fumitremorgin C (FTC), imidazoline and beta-carboline amino acid benzylester, 14 novel 2-substitutedtetracyclic derivatives of tetrahydrocarboline 4a-n were prepared. We demonstrated that the exposure of MES-SA/Dx5 cells to some of 4a-n resulted in significant reduction of resistance of the cells against doxorubicin. This reduced resistance was accompanied by lowering of IC(50) value to doxorubicin from 1.55+/-0.26 micromol/L to 0.33+/-0.05 micromol/L for 2-(2-butyl)-derivative 4c, to 1.03+/-0.22 micromol/L for 2-methyl-derivative 4d, to 0.46+/-0.04 micromol/L for 2-benzyl-derivative 4f, to 0.98+/-0.25 micromol/L for 2-indole-3-yl-methyl-derivative 4h, to 0.36+/-0.03 micromol/L for 2-benzyloxycarbonylmethyl-derivative 4i, to 0.77+/-0.08 micromol/L for 2-benzyloxycarbonylethyl-derivative 4j, and to 0.77+/-0.08 micromol/L for 2-benzyloxycarbonylamino-n-butyl-derivative 4l. Proliferation assays of 4a-n indicated 4c,f,i,j were able to inhibit the proliferation of doxorubicin resistant MES-SA/Dx5 cells. The SAR analysis revealed that the benzylester form and the tetracyclic structure of 4a-n were critical for both sensitizing doxorubicin and the cellular anti-proliferative effect.
17722030,2,2007,J Comp Neurol,Developmental changes in cellular prion protein in primate visual cortex.,Cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) is a cell surface glycoprotein highly expressed in neurons, and a protease-resistant conformer of the protein accumulates in the brain parenchyma in prion diseases. In human prion diseases, visual cortex and visual function can be affected. We examined both the levels and the localization of PrP(c) in developing visual cortex of the common marmoset. Western blot analysis showed that PrP(c) increased from the day of birth through adulthood, and this increase correlated with the progression of synapse formation. Immunohistochemistry showed that PrP(c) was present in fiber tracts of the neonate, and this immunoreactivity was lost with maturation. Within the neuropil, the laminar distribution of PrP(c) changed with age. In the neonate, PrP(c) immunoreactivity was strongest in layer 1, where the earliest synapses form. At the end of the first postnatal week, layer 4C, as identified by its strong cytochrome oxidase activity, was noticeably lighter in terms of PrP(c) immunoreactivity than the adjacent layers. The contrast between the strong immunoreactivity in both supragranular and infragranular layers and weak immunoreactivity in layer 4C increased with age. Layers 2/3 and 5 contained more intense PrP(c) immunoreactivity; these layers receive thalamic input from the koniocellular division of the LGN, and these layers of the LGN also had strong PrP(c) immunoreactivity. Together, these results provide evidence for PrP(c) localization in an identified functional pathway and may shed some light on prion disease pathogenesis.
17695489,2,2007,Anticancer Res,Germline NBS1 mutations in families with aggregation of Breast and/or ovarian cancer from north-east Poland.,BACKGROUND: NBS1 gene, which product participates in DNA repair, has been postulated to be a susceptibility factor for a number of types of cancer, including breast cancer. The carrier frequency of the 657del5 and I171V NBS1 gene mutations among Polish patients with familial breast and/or ovarian cancer was compared with that of randomly selected newborns.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using allele-specific amplification-polymerase chain reaction (ASAPCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphismpolymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) techniques, blood samples were analysed from 250 patients with breast or/and ovarian cancer and a total number of 4,000 for 657del5 mutation and 1,300 for I1171V mutation controls.RESULTS: Although an increased frequency of both mutations in cancer cases - 0.8% of 657del5 and 2.4% of I171V, compared to controls - 0.52% and 1.38%, respectively, was found, the differences were not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that NBS1 mutations do not contribute significantly to breast or ovarian cancer development.
17695485,2,2007,Anticancer Res,Effects of intralesional 32-P chromic phosphate in refractory patients with head and neck tumours.,BACKGROUND: The clinical outcome of refractory head and neck (H&amp;N) cancer patients remains poor despite novel treatment strategies. In this pilot study the efficacy of intratumoral injection of 32-P chromic phosphate in 14 patiehts with refractory H&amp;N carcinomas was investigated in terms of response rates and overall survival.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients (median age: 59 years) with either cytostatic drug-resistant tumours or tumours known to be primarily chemotherapy-resistant were entered into the study. After sonographic determination of the tumour volume, 32-P chromic phosphate (74-444 MBq) was injected into the central part of the tumour under sonographic guidance. Follow-up investigations included serial scintigraphy, sonographic examinations and hematological studies.RESULTS: Injection of 32-P chromic phosphate into refractory H&amp;N tumours resulted in remarkable regression. The median survival of all patients was 7.8 months (range: 4-16). Eight patients exhibited a partial response, while 6 patients did not respond to the treatment. In 3 patients thrombocytopenia (grade I/II) was observed, but no other significant side-effects were apparent. Significant pathological and anatomical changes within the tumour tissue were demonstrated. In all cases examined, formation of a cyst within the area of central activity, surrounded by a centrifugal necrotic ring and a marginal fibrotic structure, was found.CONCLUSION: A lack of persistent systematic or local side-effects, as well as noteworthy efficacy, are properties of this novel regional treatment modality with 32-P chromic phosphate. This modality deserves consideration for further clinical trials.
17695472,2,2007,Anticancer Res,Chondrosarcoma of the larynx and review of the literature.,Chondrosarcoma (CS) of the larynx was first described in 1935. Cartilaginous tumours of the larynx are largely rare and there is little literature concerning them. Laryngeal CS manifest with a different pathological behaviour to other malignancies of the larynx and as such the treatment of these neoplasias are different. The purpose of this review is to present a detailed report of the laryngeal CS in recent literature. We present a case of laryngeal CS of the cricoid cartilage and a case of a sarcomatous neoplasm of the vocal cord as a potential differential diagnosis. Although representing a rare malignancy, the last decade has brought new insights in surgical treatment of laryngeal CS and subsequent reduction in recurrence rates, whereas progress in tumour biology and etiological agents is still scarce. We concentrate on new insights in classification, radiologic and pathologic features, and treatment modalities in the last two decades. Based on the literary evidence the authors recommend a conservative laryngeal function-preserving surgery. Total laryngectomy should be reserved to recurrent CS and rare cases of voluminous high-grade CS of the larynx.
17695468,2,2007,Anticancer Res,Value of repeat resection for survival in pulmonary metastases from soft tissue sarcoma.,BACKGROUND: Pulmonary metastasectomy in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) can lead to long-term survival. The aim of our study was to report on prognostic factors and the value of repeat resection in recurrent disease.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight pulmonary metastasectomies were performed on 42 STS patients from 1990 to 2005. Overall survival time and 3-year survival rate were evaluated. Subgroup analysis was performed on age, primary tumor stage, histological type and grade, occurrence and recurrence pattern, systemic treatment and number of resections.RESULTS: The 3-year actuarial survival rate was 31%. Primary tumor grade and repeat resections were shown to be independent prognostic factors for survival.CONCLUSION: Patients with repeat resections due to recurrent metastasis show a significantly better prognosis than those with only one resection. Thus, lacking randomised controlled data of the natural course of patients with unresected lung metastases to compare these results, metastasectomy in STS patients is also recommended in recurrent disease.
17695456,2,2007,Anticancer Res,A population-based study of age-related variation in clinicopathological features, molecular. Markers and outcome from colorectal cancer.,BACKGROUND: To investigate age-related differences in clinicopathological features, molecular alterations and patient survival in a large, population-based series of CRC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 5,971 cases diagnosed between 1993 and 2003 representing over 90% of the CRCs diagnosed in the state of Western Australia.RESULTS: Patients aged &lt; or =30, &lt; or =40, &lt; or =50 and &lt; or =60 years comprised 0.9%, 3.1%, 10.6% and 27.8% of all cases, respectively. The proportion of rectal cancers and tumors with poor differentiation was higher in &lt; or =30-year-old patients and decreased progressively with age. The incidence of tumors with microsatellite instability was significantly higher in patients aged 540 years (18.3%) compared to those aged 41-60 years (6.6%; p&lt;0.0001). TP53 mutations were also more frequent (p=0.002), however K-ras mutations were less common (p =0.0001) when comparing the same age groups.CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence for major age-related differences in the clinical and molecular features of CRC.
17695434,2,2007,Anticancer Res,Exemestane as neoadjuvant hormonotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer: results of a phase II trial.,BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant hormonotherapy has recently been used for downstaging large or locally advanced (LA) breast cancer in postmenopausal women.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II study was conducted in postmenopausal, hormone-receptor (HR) positive, T2-T4 patients, receiving 25 mg/day exemestane for 16 weeks.RESULTS: Among 42 patients, 57.1% underwent conservative surgery. The clinical objective response rate (ORR) was 73.3%, without progression. A pathological partial response was achieved in 16.7% of the patients. Exemestane significantly reduced the expression of Ki-67 and progesterone receptors (PgR) (p&lt;0.001). A significant decrease in PgR was correlated with clinical ORR (p=0.028). The responders presented higher baseline PgR levels (p=0.017). No relationship was found between ORR and mRNA expression of aromatase or oestrogen receptors beta (ER-beta).CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant exemestane provided satisfactory efficacy and safety profiles in LA breast cancer. The main biological effects consisted of a reduction in PgR expression for responders and a decrease in Ki-67 expression.
17695426,2,2007,Anticancer Res,Combined low-dose cytarabine, melphalan and mitoxantrone for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.,BACKGROUND: Low-dose cytarabine (ara-C) has been used to treat older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but has resulted in complete remission for &lt;20% of cases. A pilot study of the efficacy of a combination chemotherapy using low-dose ara-C, melphalan (Mel), and mitoxantrone (Mit) was conducted.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The treatment comprised ara-C (10 mg/m2) twice daily, melphalan (2 mg/body) every other day, and mitoxantrone (3 mg/m2) every 3 days. The treatment was discontinued if the nuclear cell count was &lt;15,000/microl with &lt;20% blast count in the bone marrow. The primary end-points were initial response and tolerability.RESULTS: The study comprised 9 patients with AML or high-risk MDS (median age, 75 years). Complete remission was achieved in 3 patients. All the patients displayed grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. One patient died from sepsis.CONCLUSION: The present regimen was more effective and displayed similar safety, compared with low-dose ara-C alone.
17695422,2,2007,Anticancer Res,Significance of thymidine phosphorylase in metronomic chemotherapy using CPT-11 and doxifluridine for advanced colorectal carcinoma.,BACKGROUND: A phase II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and predictors for response of metronomic chemotherapy using weekly low-dosage CPT-11 and doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) in 45 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty mg/m2 of CPT-11 was administered for 3 consecutive weeks in a 4-week treatment cycle, with 5'-DFUR (800 mg/day) given orally.RESULTS: One or more adverse effects were seen in 42 patients. However, most of these were mild at grade 1 or 2, including only leucopenia in 2, neutropenia in 1, diarrhea in 1 and nausea in 1 as grade 3. The objective response rate was 36% with a median overall survival of 452 days. The response rate in patients with a high expression of thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase) in tumor cells (47%) was higher (p=0.092) than that (19%) in patients with a low expression.CONCLUSION: The efficacy of metronomic chemotherapy using low-dosage weekly CPT-1 and 5'-DFUR is worthy of further clinical study, especially in patients with a high expression of dThdPase in primary tumor cells.
17569008,2,2007,J Mater Sci Mater Med,Preparation and characterization of calcium phosphate biomaterials.,Calcium phosphate cement (CPC) samples have been prepared with a mixture of monocalciumphosphate monohydrate (MCPM) and calcium carbonate (CC) powders, in stechiometric moles ratio 1:2.5 to obtain a Ca/P ratio of about 1.67 typical of hydroxyapatite (HAp), with or without addition of HAp. All specimens are incubated at 30 degrees C in a steam saturated air environment for 3, 6 and 15 days respectively, afterwards dried and stored under nitrogen. The calcium phosphate samples have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Vickers hardness test (HV), diametral compression (d.c.), strength compression, and porosity evaluation. MCPM/CC mixture has a 30% HAp final concentration and is characterized by higher porosity (amount 78%) and mechanical properties useful as filler in bone segments without high mechanical stress.
17566759,2,2007,Cytokine,Association of interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to brucellosis in Iranian patients.,Activation of macrophages and their antimicrobial activities by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) plays a crucial role in controlling Brucella infection. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) antagonizes the macrophage activity effects of IFN-gamma and thus inhibits cell-mediated immune reactions. Given that the production of IFN-gamma and IL-4 are under genetic control, we investigated the relationship between these two cytokine gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to brucellosis. Hundred and ninety-five patients with brucellosis and 91 healthy animal husbandmen who owned infected animals and consumed their contaminated dairy products were selected to participate in this study. All individuals were genotyped for IFN-gamma and IL-4 gene polymorphisms at positions +874 and -590, respectively. Results showed that IFN-gammaAA genotype was significantly more prevalent (P =0.03) and IL-4CC genotype was significantly less frequent (P =0.034) in the patient group compared to the control group. Also, the frequency of IFN-gamma/IL-4 combination of genotype (IFN-gammaTT/IL-4CC) and allele (IFN-gammaT/IL-4C) were significantly higher in the controls than in the patients (P =0.033 and P =0.0035, respectively). Data suggest that individuals who have IFN-gammaAA genotype are more susceptible, and those who carry IL-4CC genotype are more resistant to brucellosis. We also suggest that individuals who carry IFN-gammaT/IL-4C or IFN-gammaTT/IL-4CC can be more resistant to Brucella infection.
17536857,2,2007,J Nat Prod,Merodrimanes and other constituents from Talaromyces thailandiasis.,Chemical study of a previously undescribed fungus, Talaromyces thailandiasis, furnished the two new merodrimanes thailandolides A (1) and B (2), an O-methylated derivative (3) of the aromatic fragment incorporated in thailandolide B, and three known closely related 1(3H)-isobenzofuran derivatives, penisimplicissin (4a), vermistatin (4b), and hydroxydihydrovermistatin (4c). Structures were established by spectroscopic measurements and confirmed by X-ray analyses of compounds 1 and 4b. The unusual peptide analogue N-benzoylphenylalanyl-N-benzoylphenyl alaninate (5) isolated earlier from a higher plant was also found.
17521723,2,2007,Plasmid,Sequence analysis and characterizations of two novel plasmids isolated from Thermus sp. 4C.,Two novel plasmids, named pS4C and pL4C, were isolated from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus sp. 4C. The pS4C with a length of 5015bp and 58.25% of G+C content, contains 9 putative open reading frames (ORFs). The larger plasmid, pL4C, consisting of 21,248bp, has a G+C content of 68.60% and 34 putative ORFs. Both plasmids encode their own replication protein. The ORF 22 of pL4C and the ORF 4 of pS4C encode proteins with high sequence similarities to integrase (97%) and transposase (97%), respectively, which are both involved in DNA rearrangement and exchange. Furthermore, sequence analysis of pL4C also showed that several plasmid-encoded genes may be involved in DNA modification and repair, such as DNA G:T-mismatch repair endonuclease and micrococcal nuclease-like protein. These proteins may be involved in raising the repair efficiency and other minor editing needs. Interestingly, the elimination of plasmids significantly lowered the growth temperature of Thermus sp. 4C. Few reports dealing with the DNA repair enzymes on the plasmid from Thermus strains were published so far.
17508096,2,2007,J Nutr Health Aging,Measurement of body composition changes with weight loss in postmenopausal women: comparison of methods.,BACKGROUND: The accurate measurement of body composition changes is important when evaluating the efficacy of medical nutrition therapy and weight management programs, yet is not well documented in older women.OBJECTIVE: We compared methods of estimating energy-restriction-induced body composition changes in postmenopausal women.DESIGN: 27 women (59 +/- 8 y; BMI 29.0 +/- 2.9 kg/m2; mean +/- SD) completed a 9-wk energy restriction period (5233 kJ/d, (1250 kcal/d)). Changes in % body fat (delta%BF), fat mass (deltaFM), and fatfree mass (deltaFFM) were measured by hydrostatic weighing (HW), air-displacement plethysmography (ADP), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and deuterium oxide dilution (D2O). The Baumgartner et al. (Am J Clin Nutr 53:1345-1353, 1991) four-compartment (4C) model with body volume from HW was the criterion method. The 4C model with body volume from ADP was also compared. Regression equations were developed based on 4CHW (dependent variable) utilizing results of change (POST-PRE) for each method.RESULTS: The women lost 6.8 +/- 3.2 kg; 9% of baseline weight. Based on 4CHW, the body composition changes were -2.4 +/- 4.5 delta%BF, -4.7 +/- 3.3 kg deltaFM, and -2.6 +/- 4.4 kg deltaFFM. No differences were detected by ANOVA for delta%BF, deltaFM, and deltaFFM among 4CHW, HW, ADP, DXA, D2O, and 4CADP. Bland-Altman limits of agreement showed differences between methods that ranged from 14.5 to -14.1 delta%BF, 7.8 to -8.1 kg deltaFM, and 7.5 to -8.4 kg deltaFFM for individuals. A bias was shown with 4CADP overestimating delta%BF (1.4 %) and FM (0.6 kg) and underestimating deltaFFM (-1.2 kg) compared to 4CHW. The regression model was acceptable for %BF (4CADP, 2CHW, and 2CD2O); FM and FFM (4CADP, 3CDXA, 2CHW, and 2CD2O), but not for other estimates of %BF, FM, FFM.CONCLUSIONS: These body composition assessment methods may be used interchangeably to quantify changes in % body fat, fat mass, and fat-free mass with weight loss in groups of postmenopausal women. 4CADP overestimates delta%BF and underestimates deltaFFM. When utilizing one of these comparison methods (4CADP, 3CDXA, 2CHW, 2CD2O) to quantify changes in fat mass and fat-free mass for an individual postmenopausal woman, regression equations may be used to relate the data to 4CHW.
17484212,2,2007,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,[PFGE of Shigella flexneri 4c isolates from food-poisoning outbreaks and sporadic diarrhea patients].,OBJECTIVE: To know the molecular characteristic of Shigella flexneri 4c isolates from patients in two food-poisoning outbreaks and one sporadic diarrhea case in Hangzhou, China.METHODS: S. flexneri isolates from patients in two food-poisoning outbreaks (outbreak 1 and outbreak 2, n = 13 and n = 12, respectively) and one sporadic diarrhea patient (n = 1) in Hangzhou during 2003 and 2005 were serotyped. Antibiotic resistances of these isolates were measured by the Kirby-Bauer method. Invasive plasmid antigen gene ipaH was examined by PCR. Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed for molecular typing.RESULTS: In outbreak 1, all 13 isolates were S. flexneri 4c, of them 6 isolates tested were quite different in PFGE patterns with dice coefficient from 0.78 to 0.92. In outbreak 2, 10 isolates were S. flexneri 4c and 2 isolates were S. flexneri X, however their PFGE patterns were almost identical (dice coefficient &gt; 0.8). Compared to the two outbreaks isolates, the sporadic isolate was demonstrated with a distinct PFGE pattern (dice coefficient &lt; 0.8). The antibiotic resistance patterns with 14 kinds of antibiotics had a little difference among the isolates from outbreak 1, outbreak 2 and sporadic diarrhea patient, but the same pattern was found among 10 isolates of S. flexneri 4c and 2 isolates of S. flexneri X from outbreak 2.CONCLUSIONS: PFGE might distinguish the isolates from these two outbreaks and the sporadic diarrhea patient. Some differences in PFGE patterns, serotypes and antibiotic resistance patterns might occur among S. flexneri 4c isolates during an outbreak.
17452750,2,2007,J Exp Bot,Role of DNA endoreduplication, lipotubuloids, and gibberellic acid in epidermal cell growth during fruit development of Ornithogalum umbellatum.,Cytophotometry of individual nuclei was used to examine the level of endoreduplication in epidermal cells from the upper and lower parts of the ovary during Ornithogalum umbellatum flower and fruit development. An increase in DNA content from 2-4C to 2-8C in both parts of the ovary was observed, while the epidermal cell surface area grew about 6-fold and 15-fold in the lower and upper parts of the ovary, respectively. However, the correlation between mean epidermal cell size and ploidy was distinct during epidermis growth. Lipotubuloids became bigger in the upper than in the lower part during ovary and fruit development. In addition, more dynamic growth of the epidermal cells of the upper than of the lower part of the ovary was connected to the higher content of gibberellic acid. A hypothesis has been put forward that the role of DNA endoreduplication in epidermal cell growth was modulated by the function of lipotubuloids and the gradient of gibberellin.
17376692,2,2007,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and crystallographic analysis of benzophenone derivatives--the potential anti-inflammatory agents.,Fries rearrangement of substituted phenyl benzoates 1a-j to substituted hydroxy benzophenones 2a-j was achieved in excellent yield. Further benzoylation of 2a-j to benzoyloxy benzophenones 4a-n, a benzophenone analogue was achieved in good yield. All the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity and were compared with standard drugs. Out of the compounds studied, the compounds 4c, 4e, 4g, 4h and 4k with chloro and methyl substituents at para position showed more potent activity than the standard drugs at all doses tested.
17352225,2,2007,Anticancer Res,Tumor-specificity and type of cell death induced by trihaloacetylazulenes in human tumor cell lines.,Twenty trihaloacetylazulene derivatives with one atom of fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine was investigated for their tumor-specific cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing activity against three human normal cells (gingival fibroblast, HGF; pulp cell, HPC; periodontal ligament fibroblast, HPLF) and four human tumor cell lines (squamous cell carcinoma, HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4; promyelocytic leukemia, HL-60). There was no apparent difference in the cytotoxic activity between 2-methoxyazulenes [1a-1e, 2a-2e] and 2-ethoxyazulenes [3a-3e, 4a-4e]. Trichloroacetylazulenes [2a-2e, 4a-4e] generally showed higher cytotoxicity and tumor-specificity (expressed as a TS value) as compared with the corresponding trifluoroacetylazulenes [1a-1e, 3a-3e]. Substitution of chloride [1c, 2c, 3c. 4c], bromide [1d, 2d, 3d, 4d] or iodine [1e, 2e, 3e, 4e] at the C-3 position further enhanced cytotoxic activity against four tumor cell lines, especially HL-60 cells. Among twenty trihaloacetylazulene derivatives, two compounds [2d] and [4c] showed the highest tumor specificity (TS = &gt; 3.5 and &gt; 2.5, respectively). Compounds [2d] and [4c] induced apoptotic cell death characterized by caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells. On the other hand, compounds [2d] and [4c] induced autophagic cell death characterized by lower activation of caspases, lack of DNA fragmentation, vacuolization and autophagosome formation detected by acridine orange and LC3-GFP fluorescence, without the decline of the intracellular concentration of three major polyamines in HSC-4 cells. The cytotoxic activity of [4c], but not [2d], was slightly reduced by 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy. These results suggest the diversity of cell death type induced in human tumor cell lines by trihaloacetylazulene derivatives.
17339113,2,2007,Bioorg Med Chem,Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of substituted-N-(thieno[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)-guanidines, N-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)-guanidines, and N-(1H-indol-3-yl)-guanidines.,Sulfonylureas stimulate insulin secretion independent of the blood glucose concentration and therefore cause hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients. Over the last years, a number of aryl-imidazoline derivatives have been identified that stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. In the present study, we have developed three series of substituted N-(thieno[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)-guanidine (2a-l), N-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)-guanidine (3a-l), and N-(1H-indol-3-yl)-guanidine (4a-l) as new class of antidiabetic agents. In vitro glucose-dependent insulinotropic activity of test compounds 2a-l, 3a-l, and 4a-l was evaluated using RIN5F (Rat Insulinoma cell) based assay. All the test compounds showed concentration-dependent insulin secretion, only in presence of glucose load (16.7mmol). Some of the test compounds (2c, 3c, and 4c) from each series were found to be equipotent to BL 11282 (standard aryl-imidazoline), which indicated that the guanidine group acts as a bioisostere of imidazoline ring system.
17309308,2,2007,J Org Chem,Thermal C2-C6 cyclization of enyne-allenes. Experimental evidence for a stepwise mechanism and for an unusual thermal silyl shift.,Enyne-allenes 4a-c bearing various cyclopropyl systems as radical clock reporter groups at the allene terminus have been synthesized and subjected to thermal C2-C6 cyclization. The ratio of ene versus formal Diels-Alder products could be rationalized on the basis of steric effects. Only the thermolysis of 4c, equipped with the fast diphenylcyclopropylcarbinyl radical clock, afforded a 1,3-butadienyl benzofulvene clearly formed via cyclopropyl ring opening. This finding provides unambiguous evidence for a stepwise mechanism of the C2-C6 cyclization making it possible to suggest a lifetime for the intermediate diradical of &gt;1x10(-10) s (at 170 degrees C). An interesting corollary was the isolation of an unexpected silyl shift product in the thermolysis of all three enyne-allenes that allows explanation of the loss of the TIPS group in some of the Diels-Alder products. For a full understanding of the mechanism, silyl and hydrogen shift processes were interrogated using DFT.
17200756,2,2007,Dalton Trans,Synthesis and structures of bimetallic and polymeric zinc coordination compounds supported by salicylaldiminato and anilido-aldimine ligands.,A series of bimetallic zinc complexes bearing salicylaldiminato (1b-3b) or anilido-aldimine (4c-5c) ligand frameworks, in which the metal centres are separated by aliphatic spacer groups containing 3-6 methylene units, were targeted. X-Ray analysis of salicylaldiminato derivative 2b, with a 4 carbon spacer group, revealed a coordination polymer in the solid state where each zinc centre is ligated by two salicylaldiminato ligands. Contrastingly, the structure of the anilido-aldimine complex 4c, with a 3 carbon methylene spacer group, was found to be a discrete bimetallic complex. These differences are attributed to the differing steric protection at the anilido vs phenoxy donors, the latter more readily facilitating bridges between metal centres.
18060798,1,2007,Appl Radiat Isot,On the optimization of the isotopic neutron source method for measuring the thermal neutron absorption cross section: advantages and disadvantages of BF3 and 3He counters.,The effect of the detector characteristics on the performance of an isotopic neutron source device for measuring thermal neutron absorption cross section (Sigma) has been examined by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Three specific experimental arrangements, alternately with BF(3) counters and (3)He counters of the same sizes, have been modelled using the MCNP-4C code. Results of Monte Carlo calculations show that devices with BF(3) counters are more sensitive to Sigma, but high-pressure (3)He counters offer faster assays.
18045747,1,2007,Eur J Med Chem,1,8-Naphthyridines VII. New substituted 5-amino[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,8]naphthyridine-6-carboxamides and their isosteric analogues, exhibiting notable anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic activities, but no acute gastrolesivity.,The [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,8]naphthyridine-6-carboxamide derivatives 5-amino (2) or 5-alkoxy (3) substituted and the 5-amino[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoline-4-carboxamide derivatives (4), designed to obtain new effective analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory agents were synthesized. Ten compounds 2 and 4 showed an interesting analgesic activity: the most potent ones are 2j (36% inhibition, P&lt;0.05) and 4b (77% inhibition, P&lt;0.01) at 6.25 and 25 mg kg(-1) doses, respectively. Compounds 2i-l and 4c showed notable anti-inflammatory properties: the most potent ones are 2i (68% inhibition, P&lt;0.01) and 2l (42% inhibition, P&lt;0.05) at 12.5 and 6.25 mg kg(-1) doses, respectively. The replacement in compounds 2 of the N-substituted 5-amino substituents with similar alkoxy groups usually afforded less active compounds 3.
17995886,1,2007,J Food Sci,Characterization of new hybridoma clones producing monoclonal antibodies reactive against both live and heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes.,The objective of this study is to develop high affinity monoclonal antibody (MAb) probes recognizing all major serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes cells. From 500 candidate hybridoma clones, 2 new monoclonal antibody-producing hybridomas were selected and evaluated. MAbs 22D10 and 24F6 reacted strongly with live cells of most serotypes of L. monocytogenes except 4c and 4e and with some L. innocua strains; MAb 22D10 reacted strongly with both live and heat-killed cells (100 degrees C for 20 min) of Listeria. Both MAbs 22D10 and 24F6 did not show any cross-reactions with the other non-Listeria G(+) bacteria tested in ELISA. The mixture of EM-7G1 and 22D10 or 24F6 reacted with all 13 major serotypes of live L. monocytogenes except serotype 4c, while none of these 3 MAbs when tested alone did so. MAb 22D10 mixed with 7G1 reacted with all heat-killed L. monocytogenes serotypes except 4c and 4e. In Western blots, MAbs 22D10 and 24F6 reacted with 1 major protein band of 66 kDa in extracts from L. monocytogenes, but with 2 major protein bands of 66 kDa and 76 kDa in extracts from L. innocua. These results suggest that MAbs 22D10 and 24F6 have high affinity for 11 of 13 serotypes of L. monocytogenes, both live and heat-killed cells. MAbs 22D10 and 24F6--in combination with species-specific MAb EM-7G1--should be useful candidates for use in an ELISA sandwich assays for detecting L. monocytogenes in RTE meat and poultry products.
17989452,1,2007,Acta Crystallogr C,The complex phosphate K0.92In0.46Nb0.54OPO4: a new representative of the KTiOPO4 family.,Aliovalent K(0.92)In(0.46)Nb(0.54)OPO(4) (KINP, potassium indium niobium oxide phosphate) features a chain structure involving corner-sharing [MO(6)] octahedra (M = In/Nb), which allows this compound to be recognized as a member of the KTiOPO(4) (KTP) family. However, its crystallization in the polar space group P4(1) belonging to the 4/m Laue group generates its own subclass of KTP-related compounds. The unit cell contains 18 symmetry-independent atoms occupying general positions. The cis-cis principle of octahedral arrangement is observed for each of the separate [MO(6)](infinity) chains. The observed variations in the cis-cis linkage are critically important for nonlinear optical properties and distinguish the present compound from other KTP-related structures. The anionic framework adopts one-dimensional tunnels running orthogonal to the ab plane. The K(+) ions are arranged in the [001] direction at a distance of 1/4c. Merohedral twinning was detected during the structure refinement.
17939858,1,2007,Chem Cent J,Interaction of 2-aminopyrimidine with dichloro-[I-alkyl-2-(naphthylazo) imidazole]palladium(II) complexes: kinetic and mechanistic studies.,BACKGROUND: The anticancer properties of cisplatin and palladium(II) complexes stem from the ability of the cis-MCl2 fragment to bind to DNA bases. However, cisplatin also interacts with non-cancer cells, mainly through bonding molecules containing -SH groups, resulting in nephrotoxicity. This has aroused interest in the design of palladium(II) complexes of improved activity and lower toxicity. The reaction of DNA bases with palladium(II) complexes with chelating N,N'donors of the cis-MCl2 configuration constitutes a model system that may help explore the mechanism of cisplatin's anticancer activity. Heterocyclic compounds are found widely in nature and are essential to many biochemical processes. Amongst these naturally occurring compounds, the most thoroughly studied is that of pyrimidine. This was one of the factors that encouraged this study into the kinetics and mechanism of the interaction of 2-aminopyrimidine (2-NH2-Pym) with dichloro-[1-alkyl-2-(alpha-naphthylazo)imidazole]palladium(II) [Pd(alpha-NaiR)Cl2, 1] and dichloro-[1-alkyl-2-(beta-naphthylazo)imidazole]palladium(II) [Pd(beta-NaiR)Cl2, 2] complexes where the alkyl R = Me (a), Et (b), or Bz (c).RESULTS: 2-NH2-Pym reacts with 1a, 1b, and 1c to yield [[1-alkyl-2-(alpha-naphthylazo)imidazole]bis(2-aminopyrimidine)]palladium(II) (3a, 3b, 3c) dichloride and with 2a, 2b, and 2c to yield [[1-alkyl-2-(beta-naphthylazo)imidazole]bis(2-aminopyrimidine)]palladium(II) (4a, 4b, 4c) dichloride in an acetonitrile (MeCN) medium. The products were characterized using spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, UV-Vis, NMR). The ligand substitution reactions follow second order kinetics - first order dependence on the concentration of the Pd(II) complex and 2-NH2-Pym. Addition of LiCl to the reaction does not influence its rate. The thermodynamic parameters (standard enthalpy of activation, Delta(double dagger)H degrees and standard entropy of activation, Delta(double dagger)S degrees) were determined from variable temperature kinetic studies. The magnitude of the second order rate constant, k2, at 298 K, was shown to increase thus: b &lt;a &lt;c as well as 1 &lt;2.CONCLUSION: The kinetics of the reaction between Pd(II) complexes (1 and 2) and 2-NH2-Pym were examined spectrophotometrically at 530 nm in MeCN under pseudo-first-order conditions. The reaction rate is largely influenced by the pi-acidity of the chelating ligand, with substitution in the naphthyl azoimidazole backbone influencing the rate of the substitution process. The activation parameters, Delta(double dagger)H degrees and Delta(double dagger)S degrees, were determined and support the kinetic rate data.
17934923,1,2007,Drug Chem Toxicol,CYP2A6 gene polymorphism and personality traits for NEO-FFI on the smoking behavior of youths.,We performed a survey on the relationship between nicotine dependence and psychological (the personality traits using neuroticism extroversion openess-five factor inventory (NEO-FFI)/nicotine metabolism (the CYP2A6 gene polymorphism) factors among Japanese young students to elucidate the mechanism of the development of nicotine dependence. As a result, the frequency of the CYP2A6*4C gene (enzyme activity deficit) was significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher among nonsmokers than smokers, and the Openness score by NEO-FFI was higher among smokers than nonsmokers. However, there were no significant differences in the Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness scores by NEO-FFI between smokers and nonsmokers. We conclude that the CYP2A6*4C gene and the Openness personality trait may affect the development of the smoking behavior of youth.
17722739,1,2007,Toxicol Ind Health,Toxicity of pharmaceutical wastewater on male reproductive system of Mus musculus.,This study reports on the toxic effects of 35-days intragastric perfusion of pharmaceutical wastewater on the male reproductive system of Mus musculus. Flow cytometric analyses and staining with fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI) were used to assess the toxicity on spermatogenic cells. Significant depletions in the relative percentages of elongated spermatid (HC), diploid spermatogonia (2C), and S-phase cells were observed. These alterations in different germ cell populations were reflected in the various germ cell ratios. The ratios of 1C:4C and HC:2C showed a significant decline after pharmaceutical wastewater treatment, while the 4C:2C and 1C:2C ratios increased significantly. FDA and PI staining displayed reduced viability of spermatogenic cells in wastewater treated group. Statistically significant percentages of sperm abnormalities showed the genotoxic potential of this pharmaceutical wastewater. Testicular histopathological studies of treated animals revealed expansion of interstitial space and reduction in the number and size of Leydig cells. Thus, the present study has established the toxicity of pharmaceutical wastewater on the reproductive biology of male mice.
17695487,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Second-line chemotherapy of platinum compound plus CPT-11 following ADOC chemotherapy in advanced thymic carcinoma: analysis of seven cases.,BACKGROUND: Optimal chemotherapeutic regimen in thymic carcinoma remains uncertain and the efficacy of second line chemotherapy has not been established either.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of an irinotecan plus cisplatin or carboplatin (IP) regimen as a salvage treatment for patients with unresectable thymic carcinoma that progressed after cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide (ADOC) chemotherapy. Seven patients with histologically confirmed thymic carcinoma that was resistant to or who had relapsed after initial chemotherapy with ADOC were treated with IP. The treatment consisted of irinotecan (CPT-11, 60 mg/m2, days 1, 8 and 15) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2, day 1) or carboplatin (AUC 4) intravenously every 4 weeks, for at least 2 cycles.RESULT: Two patients achieved partial responses. Although another two patients showed a significant reduction of the primary thoracic lesion, the appearance of a new lesion was found in one and a metastatic lesion was unchanged in the other. Neutropenia over grade 3 was observed in all patients but none of the patients developed serious infections. There were no severe non-hematological toxicities, including diarrhea.CONCLUSION: We conclude that salvage chemotherapy may be useful in certain patients with thymic carcinoma and irinotecan may be a novel and alternative agent for relapsed thymic carcinoma.
17695483,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Gemcitabine and oral vinorelbine as salvage treatment in patients with advanced anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated breast cancer.,BACKGROUND: Despite progress achieved with new chemotherapeutic and endocrine agents, advanced breast cancer (ABC) remains a disease with poor prognosis. We sought to determine the efficacy of gemcitabine (GC) and oral vinorelbine (VB) in heavily preatreated ABC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in the metastatic setting with progressive disease were eligible. Treatment consisted of VB (60 mg/m2, orally) and GC (1000 mg/m2, intravenous infusion), every two weeks of a 28- day cycle.RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with ABC were enrolled. Toxicity was acceptable, mainly haematological. Three and 8 patients achieved a complete (9.6%) and partial (25.8%) response, respectively; ten patients (32.2%) had stable disease. Median time-to-progression was 5.3 months, while in responders 8.6 months. Median overall survival was 14 months.CONCLUSION: Oral VB and GC is an active and well-tolerated combination in anthracycline/taxane-pretreated ABC, representing an interesting option in this poor prognosis group of patients.
17695482,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Efficacy of IL-2 immunotherapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma in relation to the psychic profile as evaluated using the Rorschach test.,BACKGROUND: Despite the well-documented importance of the psycho-emotional status in modulating the anticancer immunity, at present no study has been performed to analyse the influence of the psychological condition on the efficacy of IL-2 cancer immunotherapy. Previous clinical studies have already suggested that the evidence of anxiety may negatively affect the therapeutic efficacy of IL-2 immunotherapy of cancer. Moreover, previous psycho-oncological investigations showed that the suppression of sexual pleasure and sexual identity would represent one of the most frequent psychological profiles in cancer patients. On this basis, a study was planned in an attempt to evaluate relations existing between psychological status, analysed using the Rorschach test and efficacy of IL-2 immunotherapy in the treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 30 consecutive metastatic RCC patients. IL-2 was injected s.c. at a dose of 3 million IU twice/day 5 days/week for 4 consecutive weeks, corresponding to one complete immunotherapeutic cycle, followed by a second cycle after a 21-day rest period.RESULTS: A complete response (CR) was achieved in only 1/30 (3%) patients; a partial response (PR) was obtained in 6/30 (20%) patients. The tumor response rate (CR +PR) was 7/30 (23%) patients. The performance of a psychological analysis was accepted by 24/30 (80%) patients. A normal sexual identity was present in 7/24 (29%) patients. The tumor response rate achieved in patients with sexual identity was significantly higher compared to these who had no sexual identity or who refused the psychological investigation (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01, respectively). In the same way, the increase in mean lymphocyte number obtained in patients with sexual identity was significantly higher compared to that found in the other two groups of patients.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the psychological status prior to treatment may be associated with the clinical response to IL-2 cancer immunotherapy.
17695465,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Qualitative DNA differences between two structurally different lesions: high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma in situ in colorectal adenomas.,BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that the Vienna classification of neoplasias in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract acknowledged low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and carcinoma in situ (CIS) and that most Western pathologists recognize CIS in many organs, both CIS and HGD are still used synonymously in colorectal adenomas. Differences between CIS and HGD in colorectal adenomas are reported.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five large colorectal adenomas (measuring &gt;20 mm) having areas of both HGD and CIS were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and with Feulgen stains.RESULTS: The HGD areas showed tightly packed, spindle shaped, hyperchromatic cells with slight to moderate pleomorphic nuclei having coarse chromatin. In contrast, the CIS cells displayed marked pleomorphism, large vesicular nuclei and a prominent nucleolus. In H&amp;E stain the hyperchromasia found in HGD nuclei was much less evident in CIS nuclei. The HGD nuclei were intensively stained (+++) with the DNA-specific Feulgen reaction but the CIS nuclei were not.CONCLUSION: It would appear that following the completion of chromosomal mutations in the nuclei of HGD-cells, their DNA, carrying the new genetic information, is transcribed into RNA in the nuclei of CIS. Thus, through messenger-RNA, the production of mutated cytoplasmic proteins, required for the ultimate invasion of the lamina propria mucosa (and beyond), would be triggered.
17695464,1,2007,Anticancer Res,A phase II study of oral UFT and leucovorin concurrently with pelvic irradiation as neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer.,BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation with continuous infusion (CI) of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) is widely used in rectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of oral tegafur-uracil (UFT) and leucovorin (LV) instead of CI 5FU.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients had resectable T3-4 or low T2 rectal adenocarcinoma. Chemoradiation consisted of pelvic irradiation (45 Gy in fractions of 1.8 Gy) and oral UFT (240 mg/m2/day) and LV (30 mg/day) given during the first 28 days of radiotherapy.RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were treated; 81% had T3-4 tumors and 25% had N+ disease. Toxicity, predominantly gastrointestinal, was generally mild. Grade 3 toxicity occurred in only one patient. Pathological down-staging was noted in 13 patients (42%) and pathological complete response in 3 (10%). Sphincter preservation was possible in 71% of patients undergoing surgery.CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation with oral UFT/LV is well-tolerated and active against rectal cancer. Formal comparison with the current standard treatment is warranted.
17695461,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Dynamics of serum levels of tumour markers and prognosis of recurrence and survival after liver surgery for colorectal liver metastases.,BACKGROUND: The authors present a statistical analysis of the dynamics of tumour markers and compare these with single serum levels in patients before and after liver surgery for colorectal liver metastases (CLM).PATIENTS AND METHODS: The serum levels of tumor markers conventionally used in clinical practice (CA19-9, CEA, CA72-4) and markers informing of the proliferation activity of malignancy (TKI TPA, TPS) were statistically analysed. The authors studied 144 patients who underwent liver surgery for colorectal liver metastases between September 1999 and June 2005. Serum levels of tumor markers before surgery (maximally two weeks before the operation), after surgery (maximally one month after the operation - usually on the day of dismission), six months (+/- one month) and twelve months after the surgery (+/- one month) were determined. The Log Rank test and the Wilcoxon test were used for statistical evaluation. The survival rate and disease-free intervals (DFI) were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: The statistical analysis of tumour marker dynamic after liver surgery (speed and power of recurrence) supported the dynamics of CA 19-9 and CEA as excellent prognostic factors of early recurrence of CLM in contrast to proliferative tumor markers.CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggest the importance of tumour markers for the prediction of a short survival rate or DFI. This approach would be very helpful for the planning of palliative oncological treatment for patients with liver malignancies that cannot be treated by surgical therapy. Current patients with a high tendency of recurrence of CLM after liver surgery should be followed up more thoroughly to increase the possibility of successful reoperation.
17695460,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Value of RT-PCR analysis of sentinel nodes in determining the pathological nodal status in colon cancer.,BACKGROUND: Pathological examination of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and non-SLNs in colon cancer is frequently not performed to the same extent. We examined whether non-SLNs were truly negative in tumors with tumor-negative SLNs using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).PATIENTS AND METHODS: RT-PCR with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was performed in hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) and immunohistochemical (IHC) tumor-negative SLNs. In RT-PCR negative SLNs, we also performed RT-PCR on non-SLNs. Statistical analyses indicated the requirement for a minimum of 72 accurate comparisons of non- SLNs and SLNs, which could be fulfilled using tissues from 12 patients.RESULTS: Negative and positive controls were performed. In nine of the 12 colon tumors, H&amp;E and IHC-negative SLNs were also negative with CEA-RT-PCR. A total of 102 lymph nodes, including 99 non-SLNs were retrieved in these nine specimens and none of the non-SLNs were CEA RT-PCR-positive.CONCLUSION: In this study, all CEA RT-PCR tumor-negative SLNs correctly reflect the tumor-negative status of the non-SLN's in primary colon tumors. The reliability of this method in colon cancer seems promising.
17695453,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Serum tPSA, cPSA, related density parameters and chromogranin A as predictors of positive margins after radical prostatectomy.,Serum levels of total prostate specific antigen (t-PSA) and PSA complexed to antichymotrypsin (PSA-ACT), as well as their corresponding density parameters were measured in prostate cancer (PC) candidates for radical prostatectomy. In these patients blood Chromogranin A (CgA) values were also recorded. The PSA-ACT recordings in presurgically characterized organ-confined disease were assumed to predict post-surgical staging better than t-PSA. If this proved correct the novel approach might contribute to the positive predictive value of Partin nomograms. In this prospective study 50 patients with clinically localized PC underwent staging pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy. The numerical values of the tPSA and PSA-ACT parameters were presurgically measured. The PSA and PSA-ACT densities (PSAD and ACTD) of the whole prostate were calculated by using transurethral ultrasound (TRUS) data. These preoperative results together with the CgA values were correlated with post-surgical pathological staging data. The relationships between serum tPSA, PSA-ACT, PSAD, ACTD, CgA and the final stage of prostatectomy specimens derived from the pathological data were analyzed. This preliminary study was performed on a relatively small number of patients who were characterized by a serum PSA &lt;20 and a Gleason score (GS) &lt; or =7. Nevertheless, the application of the logistic regression model showed both t-PSA and PSA-ACT to be superior to their density derivatives in predicting postsurgical pathological stage in PC patients who initially seemed to have localized prostate cancer. An elevation in serum CgA level, although rather infrequent at the early stages of PC is principally found in patients with higher Gleason score PC and was mostly associated with extracapsular tumor spread. Our results do not justify the substitution of PSA-ACT for t-PSA data in the Partin nomogram approach.
17695452,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Risk factors for different patterns of recurrence after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma.,BACKGROUND: Long-term survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy is unsatisfactory because of the high recurrence rate.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 396 patients who underwent curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma, there were 228 patients with clinical recurrence: 85 with solitary intrahepatic recurrence (group A), 109 with two or more intrahepatic recurrences (group B), and 34 who had extrahepatic recurrence (group C). The clinical and pathological factors for each group were investigated for association with long-term survival of each group.RESULTS: The survival rate of group C was significantly lower than that of the other groups. Patients in group C were significantly younger than those in groups A or B, with higher levels of protein induced by absence/antagonism of vitamin K-II, larger tumors, more poorly differentiated tumors, intravascular invasion and a lower incidence of cirrhosis than the other groups. Group A showed a significantly longer period until recurrence and maintained good liver function at recurrence. In group B, the survival rate of Child-Pugh class A patients was significantly higher than that of class B and C patients. Class A patients received significantly more treatments for recurrence than patients in the other classes.CONCLUSION: Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy should be performed as early as possible after hepatectomy if the patient is younger, has a large tumor and/or has a high level of protein induced by absence/antagonism of vitamin K-II. Patients with solitary intrahepatic recurrence and adequate liver function should receive further curative therapy. It is important to maintain the postoperative nutritional status of patients with multiple intrahepatic recurrences in order to allow repeated and aggressive therapy to be performed.
17695448,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Ulex europeus agglutinin-I binding as a potential prognostic marker in ovarian cancer.,BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer represents the malignant tumour of the female genital tract with the worst prognosis, mainly caused by early intraperitoneal spread. Cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions play a functionally important role in this spread and are both mediated by the cell membrane. Changes in the glycosylation of the cell membrane, as detected by lectin histochemistry, are sometimes associated with a poor prognosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of lectin binding of 164 ovarian cancer patients was analysed and the staining results were correlated with the clinical data of the patients.RESULTS: The univariate and multivariate statistical analysis revealed an independent prognostic significance for Ulex europeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I) binding.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that UEA-I binding can serve as a prognostic factor in ovarian cancer.
17695446,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Intraoperative quantitative detection of CEA mRNA in the peritoneal lavage of gastric cancer patients with transcription reverse-transcription concerted (TRC) method. A comparative study with real-time quantitative RT-PCR.,BACKGROUND: Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA in the peritoneal lavage of gastric cancer patients is now recognized as a useful method for the prediction of peritoneal recurrence after curative surgery. One problem with this method is that it is time-consuming and difficult to perform an intraoperative diagnosis, which is essential for intraperitoneal adjuvant chemotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to overcome these problems, we introduced a transcription-reverse transcription concerted reaction (TRC), which is a non-PCR-based, isothermal mRNA amplification method, as an ultrarapid diagnostic method, and compared its diagnostic power with qRT-PCR for peritoneal washes from 112 gastric cancer patients.RESULTS: TRC measurement could be completed within 1.0-1.5 h and showed the same detection sensitivity ranging from 10(2) to 10(6) copies for standard CEA mRNA as qRT-PCR. The CEA mRNA copy number, as determined by TRC, was well correlated with the depth of tumor invasion (pT category), similar to the result obtained using qRT-PCR. With CEA mRNA copy numbers of 100 as a TRC cut-off value, the resultant sensitivity and specificity of TRC (85% and 100%, respectively) were higher than for cytology (62%, 100%) and comparable to qRT-PCR (92%, 100%).CONCLUSION: TRC has a diagnostic power almost equivalent to qRT-PCR but with the advantage of ultra-rapid detection. TRC would therefore be available for intraoperative sensitive diagnosis of occult tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity of gastric cancer patients.
17695444,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Prognosis and treatment of primary deep soft tissue sarcomas.,The objective of this study was to define the prognostic factors for survival of patients with soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremities located below the muscular fascia.</AbstractText>: The objective of this study was to define the prognostic factors for survival of patients with soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremities located below the muscular fascia.PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-seven consecutive patients, resected in our Institution between March 1988 and December 2002, were reviewed.RESULTS: On univariate analysis, the prognostic factors for survival were tumor size, nodal status, adequate surgery, tumor malignancy grade and administered chemotherapy. Additionally, local failure, metastasis after resection and residual tumor after incomplete resection followed by complete resection were adverse prognostic factors for survival. The tumor size, nodal status and metastasis after resection were factors indicating worse survival on multivariate analysis.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that most factors influencing the course of the disease cannot be controlled by the surgeon. Complete resection is imperative for local control and allows the patient the chance of a cure. New treatment procedures should be evaluated in prospective trials to optimize therapy. Surgery without sufficient information on the malignancy or expansion of the tumor might be detrimental for the patient.
17695438,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with irinotecan and mitomycin-C for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.,BACKGROUND: The efficacy and toxicity of combined therapy with irinotecan (CPT-11) and mitomycin-C (MMC) in a neoadjuvant setting were evaluated in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the uterine cervix.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility included patients with previously untreated cervical carcinoma. CPT-11 (100 mg/m2) was administered on days 1, 8 and 15 intravenously (i.v.), while MMC (10 mg/m2 i.v.) was given on day 1. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Among 35 eligible patients, 3 showed a complete response and 27 a partial response, with an overall response rate of 85.7%. No patient showed progressive disease. Thirty-three patients were able to undergo radical surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and only 2 patients (stage IIIb) received radiotherapy without the optimal surgery. The median disease-free survival (DFS) period was 42 months (range 5-73). The median overall survival (OAS) period was 44 months (range 17-74). Two-year DFS and OAS rates were 74.3% and 91.4%, respectively. Of the 58 treatment cycles administered, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 50% and 9% of the treatment cycles, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea was observed in 6%.CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CPT-11 and MMC can be effective and well-tolerated against locally advanced SCC of the uterine cervix.
17695433,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Complete remission of ovarian small cell carcinoma treated with irinotecan and cisplatin: a case report.,BACKGROUND: Small cell carcinoma of the ovary is a rare type of ovarian carcinoma with a very poor prognosis.CASE REPORT: We report here a case of a 55-year-old woman with small cell carcinoma of the left ovary. The patient underwent cytoreductive surgery with residual tumors of 6 cm at the cul-de-sac and was found to have stage IIIc disease. After six courses of irinotecan (CPT-11) and cisplatin (CDDP) combination therapy, secondary cytoreductive surgery was performed. The patient showed no evidence of residual tumors. After an additional three courses of chemotherapy, the patient is still alive and well without evidence of disease.CONCLUSION: CPT-11 and CDDP combination chemotherapy may be effective and safe for patients with small cell carcinoma of the ovary.
17695431,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Phase I/II study of irinotecan and UFT for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.,The aim of this study was to determine the recommended dose of irinotecan in combination with the fixed dose of oral UFT as first-line therapy in patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer, and to evaluate the response rate and overall survival as a phase II study.</AbstractText>: The aim of this study was to determine the recommended dose of irinotecan in combination with the fixed dose of oral UFT as first-line therapy in patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer, and to evaluate the response rate and overall survival as a phase II study.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients were recruited into a phase I trial. Four doses of irinotecan ranging from 60 to 150 mg/m2/day were administered intravenously on day 1 and day 16 in combination with UFT given orally from day 2 to day 15. In a phase II study, 53 patients received at least one cycle of this therapy.RESULTS: The recommended dose of this combination was determined as irinotecan 120 mg/m2/day and UFT 400 mg/m2/day. Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia and prolonged leucopenia. On an intent-to-treat analysis, the response rate in the phase II study was 24.5% (95% confidence interval 13.8% to 38.2%). The median overall survival time was 20.3 months (95% confidence interval, 15.0-22.8 months). Out of 20 patients with stable disease, 17 who received more than 4 cycles of the regimen lived longer than the other 3 patients who received fewer than 3 cycles (p = 0.0353). Hematological adverse events were mainly grade 3/4 neutropenia observed in 6 out of 53 patients. Grade 3 non-hematological toxicities, such as diarrhea, anorexia, nausea/vomiting and alopecia were observed in 6 patients.CONCLUSION: Irinotecan combined with oral UFT was effective and well-tolerated. This regimen may be considered as a first-line therapy for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer and may result in fairly long survival, even for patients with stable disease.
17695421,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Phase I study of docetaxel (TXT) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with concurrent radiotherapy in patients with advanced esophageal cancer.,This phase I study was designed to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of docetaxel (TXT) and toxicities of combining weekly administration of TXT and continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with concomitant radiotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer.</AbstractText>: This phase I study was designed to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of docetaxel (TXT) and toxicities of combining weekly administration of TXT and continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with concomitant radiotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received TXT by i.v. infusion over 1 h on days 1, 8, 22 and 29. They were also given 5-FU 250 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion for 24 h on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40 and 43-45. Fractionated radiotherapy was performed on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40 and 43-45, and a total dose of 60 to 66 Gy was delivered. The starting dose level (Level 1) of TXT was set at 7.5 mg/m2. Dose escalation was conducted in increments of 25 mg/m2, until the dose reached Level 4 (15 mg/m2). At least three patients were enrolled at each level.RESULTS: Seven patients (median age, 64 years) were enrolled. Six patients had stage III (T4NIMO) and one had stage IVb (T4N1M1b) esophageal cancer; six had squamous cell carcinoma and one had carcinosarcoma. No patient had received prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and two patients had undergone esophageal bypass surgery using a whole stomach tube without resection of primary or metastatic lesions. In the 7patients, the regimen was well-tolerated, with esophagitis as the most common toxicity (grade 3: n=1; grade 4: n=3). In general, hematological toxicity was mild. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed at Level 2 (TXT 10 mg/m2) when three patients developed grade 4 esophagitis and this dose was deemed the MTD for this regimen. In the 7 assessable patients, the overall clinical response rate was 85.7%.CONCLUSION: The MTD of TXT in this regimen was 10 mg/m2 and the recommended dose of TXT was 7.5 mg/m2. Although esophagitis was the dose-limiting and the most frequent toxicity, the regimen was safe and well-tolerated, and demonstrated the possibility of good efficacy in patients with advanced esophageal cancer.
17695417,1,2007,Anticancer Res,Fibrosarcoma of the jaws: two cases of primary tumors with intraosseous growth.,Fibrosarcoma (FS) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm of the fibroblasts that rarely affects the oral cavity. Two cases of primary FS of the jaws with intraosseous growth (2 men, aged 53 and 71 years) are described. Microscopically, in one case the tumor showed an intense proliferation of spindle-shaped cells, varying little in size and shape and arranged in parallel bands, partly crossing each other, with significant mitotic activity and nuclear pleomorphism; the second case was characterized by low cellularity comprising spindle-shaped cells, deposited in a variably fibrous and myxoid stroma. On immunohistochemistry, cells in both cases were strongly immunoreactive for MIB-1 and vimentin, focally positive for CD68, and negative for S-100 protein, pancytokeratin, HMB45, CD34, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Based on clinical, histological and immunohistochemical findings, the final diagnosis was FS in the first case, myxofibrosarcoma in the second. Treatment was radical surgery with mandibular reconstruction. After two years, the first patient displayed multiple metastases and died during the third year after the initial diagnosis; the second patient was still alive and doing well five years after treatment. We discuss the differential diagnosis versus other forms of sarcoma, examining the morphological appearance that is frequently very similar, the immunohistochemical expression of MIB-1, vimentin, S-100, CD-34, CD68, EMA, as well as conventional clinicopathological features that may help to distinguish FS from other sarcomas.
17681726,1,2007,J Am Soc Echocardiogr,Left atrial size by planimetry is superior to M-mode diameter: biochemical calibration by atrial and brain natriuretic peptide.,BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) size is routinely assessed by M-mode on echocardiography. Recently, a superiority of apical measures of LA size has been suggested, but no biochemical calibration has been attempted yet. The aim of the current study was to compare echocardiographic parameters of LA size through biochemical calibration with the natriuretic peptides atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).METHODS: A total of 610 middle-aged (50-67 years) subjects from a population-based sample (MONICA Augsburg, Germany) were characterized with respect to LA area and volume from the apical two-chamber (2C) and four-chamber (4C) views in addition to M-mode echocardiography. ANP and BNP concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay.RESULTS: A significant correlation to ANP and BNP was present with all measures on LA size. The univariate correlation was lowest with M-mode diameter (r = 0.11 with ANP; r = 0.09 with BNP, both P &lt; .03), whereas 2C volume displayed the closest correlation (r = 0.20 with ANP and r = 0.28 with BNP, both P &lt; .001) and even slightly exceeded 2C area, 4C volume, and 4C area. 2C volume further displaced LV systolic function, mass index, and heart rate as statistically significant predictors of ANP (P &lt; .001) and BNP (P &lt; .001) on adjusted regression analysis, whereas M-mode diameter was displaced as a significant predictor of ANP and BNP (P = not significant).CONCLUSIONS: The current population-based echocardiographic study allows new insight into the value of different measures of LA size. The closer association between natriuretic peptide concentrations and parameters derived from planimetry and volumetry suggests a superiority of these parameters LA diameter. LA volumetry should be included in routine echocardiography for optimized assessment of LA size.
17640491,1,2007,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Design, synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of 4-[2-alkylthio-5(4)-(4-substitutedphenyl)imidazole-4(5)yl]benzenesulfonamides as selective COX-2 inhibitors.,AIM: To design and synthesize a series of benzenesulfonamide derivatives, 4-[2-alkylthio-5(4)-(4-substitutedphenyl)imidazole-4(5)-yl]benzenesulfonamides (4a-4j), which are intended to act as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors with good COX-2 inhibitor activity, and which will exert anti-inflammatory activities in vivo.METHODS: Benzenesulfonamide derivatives were designed and synthesized through multi-step chemical reactions. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated in an in vitro assay. The active compound 4a-4f was selected for further evaluation in a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model.RESULTS: Docking studies showed that compound 4 bind into the primary binding site of COX-2 with the sulfonamide SO2NH2 moiety interacting with the secondary pocket amino acid residues. In the in vitro assay, compound 4 inhibited COX-2 with an inhibition concentration IC(50) value of 1.23-8 nmol/L, compared to celecoxib with IC(50) value of 1.5 nmol/L. Compound 4b and 4c had good potency and selectivity in comparison to the celecoxib. In the in vivo model, compound 4a-4f exhibited a moderate potency to inhibit 50% carrageenan-induced paw edema with value of 1.58-4.3 mg/kg. In the latter experiment, compound 4c was the most active compound.CONCLUSION: The anti-inflammatory effects obtained for compound 4a-4j could be due to the presence of fluorine or hydrogen substituents in the para position of the phenyl ring of these compounds.
17602796,1,2007,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and adenosine receptor binding studies of some novel triazolothienopyrimidines.,A new series of 5-alkyl/aryl-8,9-dimethyl/8,9,10,11-tetrahydro[1]benzothieno[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-c]pyrimidine-3(2H)-thiones (4a-k) have been synthesized through a facile cyclization reaction of 4-hydrazino-2-alkyl/aryl-5,6-dimethyl/5,6,7,8-tetrahydro[1]benzothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines (3a-k) using carbon disulphide under basic conditions. 4-Hydrazino-2-alkyl/aryl-5,6-dimethyl/5,6,7,8-tetrahydro[1]benzothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines (3a-k) were prepared by replacing the chloro group of 4-chloro-2-substituted-5,6-dimethyl/5,6,7,8-tetrahydro[1]benzothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines (2a-k) with hydrazine hydrate which were obtained by a known one-pot synthesis. The affinities of these compounds for adenosine A(1)/A(2A) receptors were determined at 1 microM concentration. The test compounds which exhibited more than 20% inhibition were selected and further screened at six different concentration levels to estimate their EC(50)/K(i) values. The most potent compounds in the series were 4c and 4d having an ethyl side chain at C(5) position with dimethyl and cyclohexyl substitution at the C(8)-C(9) positions, exhibiting K(i) values of 2.1 and 1.1 microM, respectively, at A(1)ARs. The SAR indicates that by increasing or decreasing the alkyl chain length at C(5) led to reduced affinity. The remaining aryl/arylalkyl derivatives of the series were inactive showing that a simple alkyl side chain at C(5) is necessary for these ligands to bind at A(1)ARs. However, none of the compounds showed inhibition on A(2A) receptors at 1 microM concentration indicating their selectivity. This communication describes the design, synthesis and evaluation of these new molecules.
21636483,1,2007,Am J Bot,Introduction history and population genetics of the invasive grass Bromus tectorum (Poaceae) in Canada.,The invasive annual Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) is distributed in Canada primarily south of 52° N latitude in two diffuse ranges separated by the extensive coniferous forest in western Ontario. The grass was likely introduced independently to eastern and western Canada post-1880. We detected regional variation in the grass's genetic diversity using starch gel electrophoresis to analyze genetic diversity at 25 allozyme loci in 60 populations collected across Canada. The Pgm-1a &amp; Pgm-2a multilocus genotype, which occurs in the grass's native range in Eastern Europe, is prevalent in eastern Canada but occurs at low frequency in western Canada. In contrast, the Got-4c multilocus genotype, found in the native range in Central Europe, is widespread in populations from western Canada. Overall genetic diversity of B. tectorum is much higher in eastern Canada than in the eastern U.S., while the genetic diversity in populations in western North America is similar between Canada and the U.S. The distribution of genetic diversity across Canada strongly suggests multiple introduction events. Heterozygous individuals, which are exceedingly rare in B. tectorum, were detected in three Canadian populations. Formation of novel genotypes through occasional outcrossing events could spark adaptive evolution and further range expansion across Canada of this exceedingly damaging grass.
17597413,1,2007,Dig Dis Sci,Patient knowledge and perspective on irritable bowel syndrome: development of a survey instrument.,PURPOSE: A questionnaire measuring patient knowledge of, and concerns about, irritable bowel syndrome could improve patient care. The aims of this study were to operationalize the constructs used by patients to understand their symptoms and to develop a reliable, validated questionnaire.RESULTS: A total of 153 patients with irritable bowel syndrome completed the questionnaire. 119/153 (77.8%) completed a second identical questionnaire. Questions with high reliability and validity had responses with similar metrics. Reliability was more easily established in questions where the responses had no option for uncertainty. Test-retest reliability had a mean concordance of 0.8. Alternate form reliability had a mean concordance of 0.97. Inter-item reliability had Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.57 to 0.86.CONCLUSION: The survey instrument was found to be reliable, valid and usable. It provides descriptive data on patient knowledge, fears, and concerns surrounding irritable bowel syndrome. This easily administered questionnaire should provide novel information to improve patient care.
17485218,1,2007,Appl Radiat Isot,Evaluation the nonlinear response function of a 3 x 3 in NaI scintillation detector for PGNAA applications.,Response functions of the 3 x 3 in NaI detector, which is mainly used in PGNAA applications, have been calculated by using MCNP-4C code. Calculated results are compared with measured data by using standard gamma-ray sources and prompt gamma-rays from pure element samples to check their accuracy. Prompt gamma-rays from pure element samples were used for this determination in the range from 1.942 to 10.829 MeV by use of (241)Am-Be neutron source and gamma-rays from radioisotope sources were used in the range from 0.081 to 4.438 MeV. Through the precise modeling of the detector structure, the agreement between both results has been improved. A surprising result is that in the PGNAA method the agreement between the MCNP simulation and experiment will be better by using a suitable neutron shield for NaI detector in order to prevent the activation of NaI (Tl) and a proper gamma-shield to attenuate the high-rate 4.438 MeV gamma-ray, (241)Am-Be gamma-ray component.
17469871,1,2007,J Nat Prod,Fungicidal activities of dihydroferulic acid alkyl ester analogues.,The natural product dihydroferulic acid (DFA, 1) and the synthesized DFA methyl (4a), ethyl (4b), propyl (4c), hexyl (4d), octyl (4e), and decyl (4f) esters were examined for antifungal activity. Test fungi included Saccharomyces cerevisiae (wild type, and deletion mutants slt2 Delta and bck1 Delta), Aspergillus fumigatus, and A. flavus. Growth inhibition of S. cerevisiae treated with 5 mM DFA or the corresponding esters was 4a, 4b, and 4c &gt;98%; 4d 18.8%; 1 6.4%; 4e 6.2%; and 4f 2.8%, relative to the control. The 50% minimum inhibitory concentrations for the more active propyl, methyl, and ethyl esters were 1.5, 2.1, and 4.0 mM, respectively. Compound 4c inhibited 100% growth of both aspergilli at 6.4 mM.
17429672,1,2007,Radiat Environ Biophys,Monte Carlo-based calculation of imaging plate response to (90)Sr in teeth: experimental validation of the required correction on sample thickness.,Recently, a numerical method was proposed to correct the imaging plate (IP) response to (90)Sr concentration in tooth samples, depending on the sample thickness. This is important to quantify any (90)Sr concentration in teeth, which in turn is necessary to determine any (90)Sr incorporation of a person retrospectively. Although the final goal will be to evaluate the (inhomogeneous) spatial distribution of (90)Sr inside tooth samples precisely, the present study was restricted -- as a first step -- to the evaluation of (90)Sr in teeth assuming a uniform (90)Sr distribution. A numerical method proposed earlier was validated experimentally in the present study by measuring the IP response to standard sources of various thicknesses and (90)Sr concentrations. For comparison, the energy deposition of the beta-rays emitted by (90)Sr in the IP -- which is considered to be proportional to the IP luminescence signal -- was calculated for the various sample thicknesses involved, by means of the MCNP-4C code. As a result, the measured IP response could be reproduced by the calculations within the uncertainties, depending on the thickness of the standard sources. Thus, the validity of the proposed numerical method to correct the IP response for sample thickness has successfully been demonstrated.
17371044,1,2007,J Agric Food Chem,Design, synthesis, and fungicidal activities of new strobilurin derivatives.,Strobilurins are one of the most important classes of agricultural fungicides. To discover new strobilurin analogues with high activity against resistant pathogens, a series of new strobilurin derivatives bearing structurally diverse heterocycle side chains 3a-m and 4a-g were designed and synthesized via a microwave-assisted procedure. The advantages, such as good to excellent yields, shorter reaction times, mild reaction conditions, and simple purification procedures, distinguish the present synthetic protocol as a highly efficient method for the preparation of strobilurin thioether derivatives. Bioassays indicated that most of the compounds showed broad-spectrum fungicidal activity in vitro. Interestingly, as compared to the control of a commercial strobilurin fungicide, Kresoxim-methyl, compounds 3b, 3g, 4c, and 4d possessed remarkably higher in vitro fungicidal activity against six kinds of tested fungi. Exhilaratingly, compound 3g exhibited higher in vivo activity against Sphaerotheca fuliginea and Pseudoperoniospora cubensis than Kresoxim-methyl, and the in vivo fungicidal activities of compound 4d and Kresoxim-methyl against S. fuliginea and P. cubensis are at the same level. The present work demonstrated that strobilurin analogues containing benzothiazole side chains could be used as a lead structure for further developing novel fungicides.
17370990,1,2007,Acc Chem Res,Four-center carbon-carbon bonding.,The 2.89-A intradimer separation for cofacial [TCNE]2(2-) (TCNE = tetracyanoethylene) dimers is twice that of conventional C-C bonds but approximately 0.6 A shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii. Experimental and computational studies best characterize the intradimer bonding as a 2-electron-4-center (2e(-)-4c) C-C bonding interaction (or bond). This nonconventional bonding exhibits unique spectroscopic properties (new, lower energy electronic absorption, new nuCC and new and shifted nuCN and deltaCCN vibrational absorptions, and characteristic 13C NMR chemical shifts) and is diamagnetic. [TCNE]2(2-) is a prototype of a growing number of organic compounds that are best described by multicenter C-C bonding.
18079825,0,2007,Opt Lett,Propagation of ultrawideband short pulses of terahertz radiation through submillimeter-diameter circular waveguides.,We report experimental investigations in which quasi-optical methods were used to efficiently couple freely propagating, optoelectronically generated, subpicosecond pulses of terahertz (THz) radiation into submillimeter circular metal tubes (waveguides) and, consequently, to measure the transmitted pulses from these waveguides. We observe very dispersive low-loss propagation over the frequency band from 0.65 to 3.5 THz, with frequency-dependent group velocities nu(g) ranging from c/4 to c and phase velocities nu(p) from 4c to c , where nu(g)nu(p)=c(2) . The linearly polarized incoming THz pulses couple significantly only into the TE(11) , TM(11) , and TE(12) modes of the utilized 24- and 4-mm-long stainless-steel tubes, with inside diameters of 240 and 280microm , respectively.
18076109,0,2007,Arch Insect Biochem Physiol,The DNA puff 4C expresses a salivary secretion protein in Trichosia pubescens (Diptera; Sciaridae).,DNA puffs are genomic regions of polytene chromosomes that undergo developmentally controlled DNA amplification and transcription in salivary glands of sciarid flies. Here, we tested the hypothesis that DNA puff genes code for salivary proteins in Trichosia pubescens. To do that, we generated antibodies against saliva and immunoscreened a cDNA library made from salivary glands. We isolated clones corresponding to DNA puff regions, including clone D-50 that contained the entire coding sequence of the previously isolated C4B1 gene from puff 4C. Indeed, we showed that puff 4C is a DNA puff region detecting its local transcription and its extra rounds of DNA incorporation compared to neighboring regions. We further confirmed D-50 clone identity in Western blots reacted with the anti-saliva anitiserum. We detected a recombinant protein expressed by this clone that had the expected size for a full-length product of the gene. We end with a discussion of the relationship between DNA puff genes and their products.
18053717,0,2007,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,2-Substituted 4-, 5-, and 6-[(1E)-3-oxo-3-phenylprop-1-en-1-yl]pyridazin-3(2H)-ones and 2-substituted 4,5-bis[(1E)-3-oxo-3-phenylprop-1-en-1-yl]pyridazin-3(2H)-ones as potent platelet aggregation inhibitors: design, synthesis, and SAR studies.,A set of regioisomeric 2-substituted pyridazin-3(2H)-ones containing a 3-oxo-3-phenylprop-1-en-1-yl fragment at either position 4, 5 or 6 and 2-substituted pyridazin-3(2H)-ones containing the same fragment both at positions 4 and 5 have been synthesized and evaluated as antiplatelet agents. The study allows the identification of a new highly potent platelet aggregation inhibitor (4c).
18045090,0,2007,Curr Drug Discov Technol,Cyclodextrin complexes: chiral recognition and complexation behaviour.,Cyclodextrins are well known in supramolecular chemistry as host molecules capable of engulfing molecules in their hydrophobic cavity via noncovalent interactions. Although cyclodextrins are frequently used for chiral separation of racemates, the mechanism of chiral recognition has not yet been fully characterised. The current investigation was aimed at examining chiral recognition mechanism in order to construct an in silico method for prediction of chiral recognition. Amino acids were selected as model guest, whereas alphaCD was used as model host. The results of molecular docking and molecular dynamic calculations were compared to results of stability constant determination and capillary electrophoresis measurements of enantioseparations. Positive correlation between binding strength and chiral separation ability was found. However, the small energy differences between interaction energy of each enantiomer with alphaCD fell into the range of standard error of molecular docking calculations limiting its applicability for in silico prediction. Examining the stability of complex geometry during molecular dynamics simulation revealed that stable complex geometry is likely to be a prerequisite for chiral recognition. This hypothesis was tested on methylderivatized tryptophan. Indeed, chiral separation of beta-methyl-tryptophans by alphaCD could be successfully predicted by examining the complex geometries during molecular dynamic simulation.
18027966,0,2007,J Org Chem,Chemistry of 4-alkylaryloxenium ion &quot;precursors&quot;: sound and fury signifying something?,Quinol esters 2b, 2c, and 3b and sulfonamide 4c were investigated as possible precursors to 4-alkylaryloxenium ions, reactive intermediates that have not been previously detected. These compounds exhibit a variety of interesting reactions, but with one possible exception, they do not generate oxenium ions. The 4-isopropyl ester 2b predominantly undergoes ordinary acid- and base-catalyzed ester hydrolysis. The 4-tert-butyl ester 2c decomposes under both acidic and neutral conditions to generate tert-butanol and 1-acetyl-1,4-hydroquinone, 8, apparently by an SN1 mechanism. This is also a minor decomposition pathway for 2b, but the mechanism in that case is not likely to be SN1. Decomposition of 2c in the presence of N3- leads to formation of the explosive 2,3,5,6-tetraazido-1,4-benzoquinone, 14, produced by N3--induced hydrolysis of 8, followed by a series of oxidations and nucleophilic additions by N3-. No products suggestive of N3--trapping of an oxenium ion were detected. The 4-isopropyl dichloroacetic acid ester 3b reacts with N3- to generate the two adducts 2-azido-4-isopropylphenol, 5b, and 3-azido-4-isopropylphenol, 11b. Although 5b is the expected product of N3- trapping of the oxenium ion, kinetic analysis shows that it is produced by a kinetically bimolecular reaction of N3- with 3b. No oxenium ion is involved. The sulfonamide 4c predominantly undergoes a rearrangement reaction under acidic and neutral conditions, but a minor component of the reaction yields 4-tert-butylcresol, 17, and 2-azido-4-tert-butylphenol, 5c, in the presence of N3-. These products may indicate that 4c generates the oxenium ion 1c, but they are generated in very low yields (ca. 10%) so it is not possible to definitively conclude that 1c has been produced. If 1c has been generated, the N3--trapping data indicate that it is a very short-lived and reactive species in H2O. Comparisons with similarly reactive nitrenium ions indicate that the lifetime of 1c is ca. 20-200 ps if it is generated, so it must react by a preassociation process. Density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G*//HF/6-31G* level coupled with kinetic correlations also indicate that the aqueous solution lifetimes of 1a-c are in the picosecond range.
17955135,0,2007,Dalton Trans,Cationic rhodium mono-phosphine fragments partnered with carborane monoanions [closo-CB11H6X6]- (X = H, Br). Synthesis, structures and reactivity with alkenes.,Addition of the new phosphonium carborane salts [HPR(3)][closo-CB(11)H(6)X(6)] (R = (i)Pr, Cy, Cyp; X = H 1a-c, X = Br 2a-c; Cy = C(6)H(11), Cyp = C(5)H(9)) to [Rh(nbd)(mu-OMe)](2) under a H(2) atmosphere gives the complexes Rh(PR(3))H(2)(closo-CB(11)H(12)) 3 (R = (i)Pr 3a, Cy 3b, Cyp 3c) and Rh(PR(3))H(2)(closo-CB(11)H(6)Br(6)) 4 (R = (i)Pr 4a, Cy 4b, Cyp 4c). These complexes have been characterised spectroscopically, and for 4b by single crystal X-ray crystallography. These data show that the {Rh(PR(3))H(2)}(+) fragment is interacting with the lower hemisphere of the [closo-CB(11)H(6)X(6)](-) anion on the NMR timescale, through three Rh-H-B or Rh-Br interactions for complexes 3 and 4 respectively. The metal fragment is fluxional over the lower surface of the cage anion, and mechanisms for this process are discussed. Complexes 3a-c are only stable under an atmosphere of H(2). Removing this, or placing under a vacuum, results in H(2) loss and the formation of the dimer species Rh(2)(PR(3))(2)(closo-CB(11)H(12))(2) 5a (R = (i)Pr), 5b (R = Cy), 5c (R = Cyp). These dimers have been characterised spectroscopically and for 5b by X-ray diffraction. The solid state structure shows a dimer with two closely associated carborane monoanions surrounding a [Rh(2)(PCy(3))(2)](2+) core. One carborane interacts with the metal core through three Rh-H-B bonds, while the other interacts through two Rh-H-B bonds and a direct Rh-B link. The electronic structure of this molecule is best described as having a dative Rh(I) --&gt; Rh(III), d(8)--&gt; d(6), interaction and a formal electron count of 16 and 18 electrons for the two rhodium centres respectively. Addition of H(2) to complexes 5a-c regenerate 3a-c. Addition of alkene (ethene or 1-hexene) to 5a-c or 3a-c results in dehydrogenative borylation, with 1, 2, and 3-B-vinyl substituted cages observed by ESI-MS: [closo-(RHC[double bond, length as m-dash]CH)(x)CB(11)H(12-x)](-)x = 1-3, R = H, C(4)H(9). Addition of H(2) to this mixture converts the B-vinyl groups to B-ethyl; while sequential addition of 4 cycles of ethene (excess) and H(2) to CH(2)Cl(2) solutions of 5a-c results in multiple substitution of the cage (as measured by ESI-MS), with an approximately Gaussian distribution between 3 and 9 substitutions. Compositionally pure material was not obtained. Complexes 4a-c do not lose H(2). Addition of tert-butylethene (tbe) to 4a gives the new complex Rh(P(i)Pr(3))(eta(2)-H(2)C=CH(t)Bu)(closo-CB(11)H(6)Br(6)) 6, characterised spectroscopically and by X-ray diffraction, which show coordination of the alkene ligand and bidentate coordination of the [closo-CB(11)H(6)Br(6)](-) anion. By contrast, addition of tbe to 4b or 4c results in transfer dehydrogenation to give the rhodium complexes Rh{PCy(2)(eta(2)-C(6)H(9))}(closo-CB(11)H(6)Br(6)) 7 and Rh{PCyp(2)(eta(2)-C(5)H(7))}(closo-CB(11)H(6)Br(6)) 9, which contain phosphine-alkene ligands. Complex has been characterised crystallographically.
17944179,0,2007,Zhong Yao Cai,[Study on karyotype and giemsa C-banding of Aquilaria sinensis].,OBJECTIVE: To study Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Spreng chromosome karyotype and C-banding.METHOD: Sections for karvotvpe and BSG method for C-banding.RESULTS: The somatic chromosome number was 2n=16, karyotype formula was K(2n) = 2x = 16 = 6m + 6sm + 4st, based on Levan's publication in 1964. According to the method of Kuo, the chromosome based on the relative length was 2n = 16 = 4L + 4M2 + 6M1 + 2S, which belonged to &quot;2B&quot;. 8 pairs chromosomes had 34 C-bands and the C-banding patter was 2n = 2x = 16 = 4C + 2I + 2T + 2CI+ + 2CI+ T + 2CI+ T+ + 2I+ T+.CONCLUSION: The data of karyotype and C-banding indicated A. sinensis chromosome had a relatively high asymmetry and was in the advanced stage of evolution, which offered the evidence for further genetic analysis.
17910428,0,2007,J Med Chem,Synthesis and monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity of new pyridazine-, pyrimidine- and 1,2,4-triazine-containing tricyclic derivatives.,A number of condensed azines, mostly belonging to the families of indeno-fused pyridazines (1), pyrimidines (2, 3), and 1,2,4-triazines (4, 5), were synthesized and evaluated in vitro as monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B inhibitors. Most of them showed higher inhibition potency toward MAO-B, the most effective one being 3-(3-nitrophenyl)-9H-indeno[1,2-e] [1,2,4]triazin-9-one (4c), which displayed an IC50 value of 80 nM and proved to be 10-fold more potent than its [2,1-e] fusion isomer 5. Replacing the 3-phenyl group of the known indeno[1,2-c]pyridazin-5-one MAO-B inhibitors with a flexible phenoxymethyl group enhanced the inhibitory potency. The inhibition data highlighted the importance of the aza-heterocyclic scaffold in affecting the MAO isoform selectivity. The 3-phenyl derivatives with type 1, 4, and 5 scaffolds were inhibitors of MAO-B with little or no MAO-A effect, whereas 2- or 3-phenyl derivatives of type 2 and 3 pyrimidine-containing fusion isomers inhibited both isoenzymes with a structure-dependent preference toward MAO-A.

From the synthesized compounds, the 6-halogeno and 6-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives 4c-d and 5b were the most potent against human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and/or varicella-zoster virus (VZV), whereas several other congeners (i.e., 5e, 5g, 5i, 5l, 5n, 5p, 5q, and 5t), while less potent, were equally or more selective in their inhibitory activity against both VZV and CMV. These compounds showed similar activity against thymidine kinase competent (TK(+)) and deficient (TK(-)) VZV strains, demonstrating a mechanism of action independent of the viral thymidine kinase.
17854438,0,2007,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,Different behaviour of implanted stem cells in intact and lesioned forebrain cortices.,Cell-replacement therapy promises a useful tool to regenerate compromised brain tissue, but the interaction between grafted cells and host tissues is not well understood. In these studies, the fates of neuroectodermal stem cells were compared in 'healthy' or damaged mouse forebrains. One-cell derived, fluorescent GFP-4C neural stem cells were implanted into normal and cold-lesioned mouse cortices. The fates of implanted cells were followed by histological and immunocytochemical assays for a 55-day postimplantation period. Cells were recultivated from lesioned cortices and characterized by cell cycle parameters, chromosome numbers, immunocytochemical markers and in vitro inducibility. Their intracerebral fates were checked upon re-implanting into 'healthy' mouse brain cortices. GFP-4C cells, giving rise to neurones and astrocytes upon in vitro induction, failed to differentiate in either normal or lesioned cortical tissues. The rate of proliferation and the length of the survival, however, depended on the host environment, markedly. In intact cortices, implanted cells formed compact, isolated aggregates and their survival did not exceed 4 weeks. In compromised cortices, GFP-4C cells survived longer than 8 weeks and repopulated the decayed region. The morphology, viability, immunocytochemical properties, in vitro inducibility and chromosome number of cells recultivated from lesioned cortices were identical to those of the master cells. Long-term survival and repopulating capability were due to signals present in the lesioned, but missing from the intact cortical environment. The results underline the importance of host environment in the fate determination of grafted cells and emphasize the need to understand the 'roles' of recipient tissues for potential cell-replacement methodologies.
17850058,0,2007,J Med Chem,Design, synthesis, and preliminary pharmacological evaluation of new quinoline derivatives as nicotinic ligands.,A series of nicotinic ligands, carrying a quinoline nucleus, and characterized by a pharmacophoric distance between the quinoline nitrogen (H-bond acceptor) and the cationic nitrogen atoms higher than that proposed in the classical pharmacophoric models, have been synthesized and tested for their affinity for the central nicotinic receptor. The enantiomers of the nicotine analogue 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl-6-quinoline and of its methiodide display enantioselectivity in binding studies, but not when tested in vivo; on alpha7* nicotinic receptor enantioselectivity is inverted with respect to the alpha4beta2* subtype. N,N,N-Trimethyl-4-(quinolin-6-yl)but-3-yn-1-ammonium iodide (3c) and trans-N,N,N-trimethyl-4-(quinolin-6-yl)but-3-en-1-ammonium iodide (4c), showing pharmacophoric distances in the range 8.5-10.4 A, interact with the alpha4beta2* nicotinic receptor with Ki in the microM range; compound 3c shows preference for the alpha7* subtype.
17695491,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Successful treatment with cyclosporine of thymoma-related aplastic anemia.,Aplastic anemia is a rare immune-mediated complication of thymoma. Thymomas, especially of the cortical type, have the capacity to generate mature T-cells from their immature precursors. Furthermore, mature intratumorous T-cells have an increased autoantigen-specific potential. We present the case of a 75-year-old patient with an inoperable cortical thymoma who developed aplastic anemia 7 years after the initial diagnosis. The infiltration of the bone marrow by these cells was accompanied by the production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the microenvironment of bone marrow and in the serum sample. The patient was successfully treated with oral cyclosporine A for 14 months and when she died due to progression of the thymoma, 9 months after the discontinuation of cyclosporine, the aplastic anemia had not recurred.
17695490,0,2007,Anticancer Res,5-year results of cisplatin-epirubicin-vinorelbine (PEV) combination as primary chemotherapy in T2-3, N0-2 breast cancer patients: a multicentre phase II study.,The aim this study was to assess the efficacy of cisplatin-epirubicin-vinorelbine, as primary chemotherapy, in reducing the tumour burden in T2-3 N0-2 breast carcinomas. Breast conservative surgery (BCS) rate, clinical and pathological complete response (pCR), toxicity and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.</AbstractText>: The aim this study was to assess the efficacy of cisplatin-epirubicin-vinorelbine, as primary chemotherapy, in reducing the tumour burden in T2-3 N0-2 breast carcinomas. Breast conservative surgery (BCS) rate, clinical and pathological complete response (pCR), toxicity and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight women with tumours &gt; or =2.5 cm were treated with cisplatin (P) 50 mg/m2, epirubicin (E) 100 mg/m2 and vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2, every 3 weeks.RESULTS: Fifty-six out of the 88 patients (63.6%) underwent BCS, notably including 12/23 patients with initial tumours &gt;5 cm. The overall clinical response was 72.8% (cCR=11.4%), pCR 20.5% and pTO+pNO 17%. No cardiac toxicity was observed. Grade 3/4 adverse events were leukopenia (9.4%), neutropenia (7.9%), nausea and vomiting (7.3%). After a median follow-up of 5 years, 24 patients (27.3%) had developed local or distant metastases. The mean DFS and OS were 51.7 (SE 2.38) and 57.02 (SE 1.98) months, respectively, and were significantly higher in pCR patients in comparison to the others (63.05 vs. 48.76, p&lt;0.01 and 64.59 vs. 55.04, p&lt;0.05, respectively).CONCLUSION: The PEV regimen was highly effective in reducing the tumour burden, especially for large tumours. The rate of pCR was similar to that obtained by other, including taxane-based regimens, and was well-tolerated. The study demonstrated the feasibility of such a regimen even in small centres, and being of low cost this combination could be of value in the application of primary therapy.
17695481,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Expression of a molecular marker panel as a prognostic tool in gastric cancer patients treated postoperatively with docetaxel and irinotecan. A study of the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group.,INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the prognostic role of vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF), thymidylate synthase (TS), topoisomerase I (Topo-I), topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo-IIalpha) and E-cadherin (E-cadh) tumor expression, in patients with resectable gastric cancer, who were treated postoperatively with the docetaxel/irinotecan combination.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with resectable gastric cancer were treated with 6 cycles of docetaxel 30 mg/m2 and irinotecan 110 m/m2 on day 1 and d8 every 21 days. All specimens were examined by using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the expression of VEGF, TS, Topo-I, Topo-IIalpha and E-cadh.RESULTS: Positivity for TS was significantly correlated with age and for VEGF with diffuse histological type and good PS. No significant correlation was observed among Topo-I, Topo-IIalpha and E-cadh positivity with any of the clinicopathological parameters studied. Median overall survival (OS) was 31.7, and disease-free survival (DFS) 26 months, respectively. None of the above-investigated molecular markers were significantly associated with OS and DFS. Finally, according to the univariate analysis for survival, only advanced stages (III, IV) of the disease implied risk of death, mainly due to lymph node involvement and, to a lesser extent, tumor size. None of the studied molecular markers were found to be independent prognostic markers.CONCLUSION: These results should be interpreted very cautiously, due to the limited number of patients studied, as well as the limitations of the IHC technique.
17695478,0,2007,Anticancer Res,The distribution and pathological staging of colorectal cancers in ethnic groups.,BACKGROUND: There is little data on the distribution and histological staging of colorectal cancer in ethnic groups in the United Kingdom. A study to investigate this was undertaken at a hospital serving a multi-ethnic population.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case analysis from a prospective database of all colorectal cancers between 2000-2004 was performed. Data was recorded on the distribution of cancer, operative procedures and Dukes' staging.RESULTS: A total of 256 patients (118 females) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, of whom 214 (83.6%) underwent resection. There were 39 Afro-Caribbeans 66.2 years +/- 12.6 years; mean [age +/- s.d.], 14 Asians 64 years +/- 12.6 years, 34 Mediterraneans 67.7 years +/- 9.9 years and 176 Caucasian British 74.3 years +/- 11.3 years. Right-sided colonic lesions were more frequent in Afro-Caribbeans, whilst left-sided lesions were more frequent in Mediterraneans. The incidence of Dukes'A cancer was high in Mediterraneans whilst Dukes' C cancer was commoner in Caucasians and Afro-Caribbeans.CONCLUSION: Ethnic patients present with colorectal cancer at significantly younger ages. Afro-Caribbeans have significantly more right-sided and Mediterraneans more left-sided cancer. Afro-Caribbean and Caucasian patients present with more advanced cancer compared to Mediterraneans. This has implications on the investigation, as well as screening in ethnic minority patients.
17695476,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Axillary lymph node metastases detection with 99mTc-sestamibi scintimammography in patients with breast cancer undergoing curative surgery.,BACKGROUND: Axillary lymph node (AN) status is the primary prognostic discriminant in patients with breast cancer (BC). Although axillary dissection represents the method of choice for obtaining such information, less invasive procedures have been suggested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of 99mTc-sestamibi scintimammography (SSM) in detecting AN involvement in patients with confirmed primary BC undergoing surgery.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 159 consecutive women (median age 54 years, range 36-78 years) with confirmed BC undergoing curative surgery were enrolled in the study. Each patient underwent SSM, from 4 to 12 days prior to surgery. According to the tumour staging, modified radical mastectomy was performed in 41 (25.8%) patients, while 118 (74.2%) patients underwent breast conserving surgery with dissection of the axilla. The results of SSM were compared against the final histological evaluation of the axillary nodes.RESULTS: The final pathology showed 33 (20.8%) pT1b, 90 (56.6%) pT1c, and 36 (22.6%) pT2 breast carcinomas. The greatest diameter of the tumour ranged from 8 to 30 mm (median 16 mm). Sixty patients (37.7%) had axillary node metastases (N1), and 99 (60.3%) had negative nodes (NO). The age of the patients significantly correlated with both size of the tumour (R=0.24, p&lt;0.01) and number of positive nodes (R=0.33, p&lt;0.01). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of SSM in detecting AN metastases were 81.4%, 91.0%, 84.2%, 91.0% and 87.4%, respectively. The sensitivity was higher in patients with three or more positive nodes (27 out of 28, 96.4%), while in patients with two (n=25) or one (n=7) positive nodes, the sensitivity decreased to 80% and 28.6%, respectively.CONCLUSION: SSM may be useful in patients undergoing surgery for BC when a preoperative assessment of axillary lymph node status is required. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of SSM in detecting node metestases in patients with BC is low when the number of involved nodes is two or less. This suggests that other imaging techniques should be used is conjunction with SSM, with the aim of increasing both sensitivity and specificity.
17695475,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Performance status (PS): a simple predictor of short-term outcome of cancer patients with solid tumors admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).,BACKGROUND: Admission of cancer patients with serious medical complications to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to examine the 30-day all-cause mortality in cancer patients with solid tumors admitted to the ICU and to identify factors predicting 30-day mortality.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in 69 consecutive cancer patients with solid tumors admitted to the ICU of a 400-bed general hospital in Greece, between October 2001 and October 2005. Demographics, ECOG performance status (PS) prior to hospitalization, stage of cancer, metastases, number of metastatic sites, prior chemotherapy, primary site of tumor, APACHE II score on ICU admission, development of ICU acquired infection, sepsis, multiple organ failure (MOF), need for mechanical ventilation (MV), length of ICU stay, hospital stay and 30-day mortality were examined.RESULTS: The observed 30-day hospital mortality rate was 66.6% (n=46) with most deaths (n=32) occurring in the ICU. Univariate negative predictors of 30-day mortality were PS 3-4 (p=0.03), APACHE II score (p=0.001), MOF (p=0.001) and need for MV (p=0.001). Only PS 3-4 was an independent predictor in multivariate analysis (p=0.02).CONCLUSION: ECOG PS 3-4 prior to hospitalization was found to be a simple negative predictor of short-term outcome of cancer patients with solid tumors admitted to the ICU.
17695474,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Clinical and dermoscopic criteria related to melanoma sentinel lymph node positivity.,BACKGROUND: The early detection of lymph node metastases may have important prognostic and therapeutic implications in melanoma patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether specific clinical and/or dermoscopic features could be &quot;in vivo&quot; predictors of sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity in melanomas &gt;1 mm thick.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five Italian centres (Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI, Rome; Skin Cancer Unit, Oncologia Dermatologica, CPO, Ravenna; Istituto Europeo Oncologico, Milan; Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Aviano; Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Naples) carried out a blind retrospective study on 508 melanomas observed from January 1994 to December 2002. The clinical and dermoscopic features of 78 melanomas &gt;1 mm thick with the SLN biopsied were reviewed.RESULTS: The tumour palpability was the only factor correlated to SLN positivity in melanomas &gt;1 mm thick. Palpability was found in 46.2% of nodal positive melanomas and in 18.5% of nodal negative melanomas (p=0.03). The patients with palpable melanomas showed a higher risk of nodal metastasis (OR=3.8). Dermoscopy failed to recognize predictive criteria for SLN positivity. Some clinical and dermoscopic features, although not statistically significant, showed interesting differences between nodal-negative and nodal-positive melanomas.CONCLUSION: Melanoma palpability may suggest the presence of nodal metastasis in &gt;1 mm thick tumours.
17695466,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Biweekly administration of docetaxel and gemcitabine as adjuvant therapy for stage II and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer: a phase II study.,BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the overall survival, progression-free survival, and toxicity associated with adjuvant administration of docetaxel and gemcitabine for completely resected patients with stage II and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine eligible patients had surgical resection for pathological stage II or IIIA disease and received postoperative gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 followed by docetaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 1 and 14. Cycles were repeated every 28 days.RESULTS: Treatment compliance was acceptable, at 83%. The median duration of follow-up, time to disease progression, and overall survival was 36.7 months, 17 months and 21 months, respectively. Toxicities were acceptable. Treatment failure revealed brain metastasis (15%), intrathoracic recurrence (24%) and systemic metastasis (36%).CONCLUSION: The biweekly administration of docetaxel and gemcitabine is a safe, well-tolerated and convenient chemotherapy regimen in the adjuvant setting of completely resected NSCLC stage II and III, with efficacy similar to that reported in other regimens. Hence, this nonplatinum based regimen appears promising and warrants further evaluation.
17695463,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Mitomycin C plus capecitabine (mixe) in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated metastatic breast cancer. A multicenter phase II study.,BACKGROUND: Capecitabine is considered the treatment of choice for anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated metastatic breast cancer. Mitomycin C seems to improve the activity of capecitabine by up-regulation of thymidine phosphorylase.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five women with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclinetaxane were treated with mitomycin C 10 mg/m2 on day 1 every six weeks and capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 2-15 every three weeks.RESULTS: An overall response rate of 38% was found, consisting of 3 (5%) complete responses (CR) and 18 (33%) partial responses (PR); 8 patients (14%) had a stable disease (SD) for more than 4 months. The combination was well-tolerated, with the main toxicities being neutropenia, diarrhea and fatigue; other toxicities were of mild to moderate intensity without impairment in the quality of life of the patients.CONCLUSION: Capecitabine is confirmed as the drug of choice in the treatment of anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated metastatic breast cancer and its combination with mitomycin appears to improve its efficacy.
17695459,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Primary melanoma of the esophagus with non-metastatic dark lymph nodes in a female breast cancer patient.,BACKGROUND: Primary melanoma of the esophagus is a very rare and aggressive neoplasm; only a small number of patients survive more than 1 year after initial diagnosis.CASE REPORT: We describe a case of primary melanoma of the esophagus in a woman with a history of invasive breast cancer. The patient suffered from dysphagic and dyspeptic disorders. The abdomen ultrasonography and the esophagogastroscopy showed a lesion located at the esophago-gastric junction extending to the gastric fundus. Histological and immunohistochemical studies revealed a primary esophageal infiltrating melanoma. A total gastrectomy and regional lymphadenectomy with a partial resection of the distal esophagus was performed.RESULTS: During laparotomic exploration, numerous dark lymp hnodes were found. On frozen sections, surprisingly neither malignant cells nor melanin were detected in the lymph nodes. Resection margins were not involved with the tumor.CONCLUSION: Patient is still alive with no evidence of recurrence at 24 months after surgical treatment, alone.
17695455,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Prospective malignancy grading of invasive squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Prognostic significance in a long-term follow-up.,A multifactorial grading score (MGS) for invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix has demonstrated its capacity to predict survival in a 5-10 year perspective and metastasis frequencies, and is a valuable tool for treatment schedules. In this study it was shown that the power of prognosis is valid even up to 20 years. In this material from 619 cervical carcinoma patients the MGS scores turned out to remain as strong as earlier proven. Earlier studies have shown that MGS is superior to other mono- and multifactorial grading systems, histological differentiation into cell types, age, clinical stage, irradiation and DNA-analysis. Treatment of cervical squamous cell carcinoma is more specific today to meet the patients' need for instance to preserve fertility or to minimize operation and eventually radiotherapy. The MGS score is a strong prognostic tool in patients with cervical carcinoma.
17695441,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Clinical management and follow-up of squamous intraepithelial cervical lesions during pregnancy and postpartum.,BACKGROUND: The incidence of cervical cancer in pregnancy is estimated to be 1-10/10000 pregnancies. Approximately 3% of cervical cancers are diagnosed during pregnancy. The incidence of abnormal Pap smears has been reported to be 5%-8%. Data on the spontaneous evolution of an intraepithelial neoplasia during pregnancy are quite diverse. Of dysplasia cases diagnosed during pregnancy, 10%-70% regress and sometimes even disappear postpartum, while persistence in the severity of cervical neoplasia is reported in 25%-47% and progression occurs in 3%-30%. However, adequate follow-up and definitive management in the postpartum period is important. The objective of the study was to assess proper management of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) during and after pregnancy, to assess regression, persistence and risk of progression and the predictive role of HPV tests.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one out of 721 pregnant women with a diagnosis of low- and high-grade SIL were observed. All patients were triaged using standard colposcopy. The histological diagnosis was assessed by colposcopic direct biopsies. In patients affected by high-SIL with colposcopic findings of suspected micro-invasive lesions, a loop electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP) was carried out in pregnancy. High risk HPV tests were performed using PCR. The patients were followed up with cytology and colposcopy every 6-8 weeks during gestation and nine weeks postpartum. They were re-evaluated using cytology, colposcopy and histology for a final diagnosis and, when necessary, submitted to treatment. The patients were followed up for a minimum of 5 years. The HPV test was performed once at 6-8 weeks during gestation and annually during the follow-up.RESULTS: Of the 31 patients with abnormal cytology, histological analysis revealed 10 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 5 CIN 2 and 16 CIN 3. The HPV test at diagnosis was positive for HPV 16 type in 22 cases and negative in 9. Five patients with CIN 2 and 11 with CIN 3 were followed up; 5 patients with CIN 3 with colposcopic findings of suspected microinvasive lesions were submitted to an excisional procedure with LEEP before the 16th week of pregnancy.CONCLUSION: Performing high-risk HPV tests may improve the follow-up of patients with SIL in pregnancy and postpartum in addition to cytology and colposcopy to indicate persistence/progression of the lesions. Proper management and adequate follow-up could be proposed in pregnancy and postpartum.
17695429,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Phase I study of combination therapy with S-1 and weekly docetaxel for advanced gastric cancer.,BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the toxicity profile and the recommended dose (RD) for phase II of a combination of S-1 and weekly administration of docetaxel.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with histologically diagnosed recurrent or unresectable locally advanced gastric cancer were enrolled. A fixed oral dose of 80 mg/m2 S-1 was given for 3 weeks. Docetaxel was infused intravenously on day 1, 8 and 15, repeated every 5 weeks. A pharmacokinetic study was also performed.RESULTS: A total of 14 patients were enrolled. One dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) (grade 3 diarrhea with febrile neutropenia) occurred at level 2. DLTs occurred in 3/5 patients at level 3, (grade 3 stomatitis, with febrile neutropenia or continuous grade 4 neutropenia). The pharmacokinetic study suggested no drug interactions. Overall response and disease control rates were 20% and 80%, respectively. The response rate at the RD (level 2) was 50%. Overall survival was 9.4 months.CONCLUSION: RD was level 2 (80 mg/m2 of S-1 for 3 weeks and 20 mg/m2 of docetaxel on day 1, 8 and 15, every 5 weeks). Dose intensities of S-1 and docetaxel were 48 mg/m2/week and 12 mg/m2/week, respectively. This regimen showed promising activity for advanced gastric cancer.
17695428,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Chemosensitivity-related genes of breast cancer detected by DNA microarray.,BACKGROUND: The feasibility of a preoperative docetaxel/5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR) regimen for breast cancer patients was examined and the genes related to the response to it was investigated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with advanced breast cancer were treated with docetaxel (60 mg/m2, day 1) and 5'-DFUR (800 mg/day, on days 1-14) q3 weeks by 4 cycles. Microarray analysis was carried out using preoperative core biopsy samples. Based on the mRNA expression levels, genes related to clinical and pathological responses were selected.RESULTS: The docetaxel/5'-DFUR regimen showed a 86% clinical response rate including 42% complete response, one pathological complete response and one ductal carcinoma in situ component. In microarray analysis, we identified 6 genes, including IGF-1, and derived a predictive formula with 67% accuracy. In addition, x2 analysis revealed a tendency for good response in ER-negative and Her2/neu-positive cases.CONCLUSION: Microarray analysis enabled us to predict the pathological response to docetaxel/5'-DFUR chemotherapy.
17695424,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Quality assurance of radiotherapy in a clinical trial for lymphoma: individual case review.,BACKGROUND: A multi-institutional clinical trial was conducted for localized lymphoma. This study evaluated whether a quality assurance (QA) program could clarify the source of variation in radiotherapy treatment between the institutions.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two- or three-dimensional treatment planning is required to cover the target volumes adequately and to minimize doses to organs at risk. An original QA tool was used to compare pretreatment images with portal images and dose distribution, concurrently.RESULTS: In two of the first 12 cases, there was a deviation in the delineation of planning target volume (PTV). The QA committee clarified that there were ambiguities in the definition of PTV The study office distributed a memorandum outlining the definition of PTV in order to reduce deviations. Thereafter, a minor deviation was identified in one of the latter 11 cases.CONCLUSION: This QA program clarified the source of variation, and adapted the policy to reduce these problems.
17695420,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Urinary cyclic GMP after treatment of gynecological cancer. A prognostic marker of clinical outcome.,BACKGROUND: The search for biological markers to predict malignant disease and its recurrence, or to monitor the effectiveness of treatment is a continuous process in medicine. Several years ago, urinary excretion of cGMP in urine was found to be a sensitive predictor in the follow-up of ovarian cancer and of monitoring treatment of cancer of the uterine cervix.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present study, 27 patients with gynecological cancer, including cancer of the uterine cervix (n=13), cancer of the uterine corpus (n=8) and cancer of the ovaries (n=6), were monitored for 10 years. Blood and urinary samples were taken before primary treatment (baseline sample) and three months thereafter (three-month sample). The serum levels of CEA, CA-125 and PIIINP and urine excretion of cGMP and cAMP were determined. Creatinine levels in serum and urine were employed to determine renal clearance.RESULTS: After 10 years' observation of women with cancer of the uterine cervix, seven patients showed no relapse and cGMP levels in baseline samples and three-month samples were 36.8+/-4.1 and 24.9+/-4.4 nmol cGMP/micromol creatinine (mean+/-SEM, p&lt;0.01), respectively. The levels in patients (n=6) with relapse after 10 years' observation were 32.8+/-4.0 (baseline sample) and 43.5+/-4.2 (three-month sample) nmol cGMP/micromol creatinine (mean+/-SEM, p&lt;0.02). Among the patients treated for cancer of the uterine corpus (n=9), none showed recurrent disease within the observation period of 10 years. The cGMP levels fell from 37.9+/-6.3 (baseline sample) to 22.3+/-2.3 (three-month sample) nmol cGMP/micromol creatinine (p&lt;0.005). In the patients with ovarian cancer (n=6), 4 patients relapsed during the observation period of 10 years. In these women the cGMP levels increased from 34.5+/-2.7 (baseline sample) to 46.3+/-4.7 nmol cGMP/micromol creatinine whilst in both patients without relapse the levels decreased from 31.8 (range: 26.5-37.1) to 27.3 (range: 25.7-28.8) nmol cGMP/micromol creatinine, respectively. The changes in levels of cAMP, CEA, CA-125 and PIINP did not show statistically significant differences. Early changes in cGMP levels appear to predict long-term prognosis in gynecological cancers.
17695418,0,2007,Anticancer Res,Expression of endostatin in merkel cell carcinoma.,BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the expression of endostatin in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and to correlate the expression with tumour growth and the development of metastasis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised 19 patients treated for MCC at the Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland between 1987 and 2003. Endostatin expression was studied by immunohistochemistry. The correlations between the quantitative expression of endostatin and tumour parameters were analysed statistically.RESULTS: The expression of endostatin was documented in only 40% of the samples. Endostatin correlated negatively with tumour size, and was expressed in 30% of the large and 56% of the small tumours. There was no difference in expression between tumours expanding to metastases and tumours with more indolent behaviour. The simultaneous expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and endostatin was distinguished in small-sized tumours.CONCLUSION: This study showed a correlation between endostatin expression and small tumour size in Merkel cell carcinoma. This finding was further confirmed by the finding that tumours positive for VEGFR-2, but not for endostatin, seemed to be larger than tumours that showed simultaneous expression of VEGFR-2 and endostatin.
17675676,0,2007,Acta Crystallogr C,Ca3GeO4Cl2 with a norbergite-like structure.,The title compound, tricalcium monogermanate dichloride, is orthorhombic and consists of one distinct Ge site on special position 4c, site symmetry m, and two different Ca sites, Ca1 and Ca2, one on general position 8d, site symmetry 1, and the other on special position 4c. Two of the O atoms occupy the 4c position (symmetry m); the third O atom is situated on the general 8d position, symmetry 1, as is the one distinct Cl position. By sharing common edges, the distorted Ca1 octahedra form infinite crankshaft-like chains parallel to the b direction. Along a and c, these chains are connected to one another via common corners, thereby forming a three-dimensional framework of edge- and corner-sharing Ca1O(4)Cl(2) octahedra.

17633206,0,2007,Yao Xue Xue Bao,[Synthesis and neuroprotective activity in cell culture of aminoadamantane analogues].,Seven novel derivatives of aminoadamantane with 1-aminosubstituted group were synthesized from amantadine or memantine individually in order to find new neuroprotective agent. Six of them are amides of two precursors, one is a 1-amino derivative of memantine substituted with 2-hydroxy propyl. Their chemical structures were confirmed by 1H NMR and HRMS. The neuroprotective activity in vitro was evaluated primarily with 500 micromol x L(-1) glutamate damaged SY5Y cell by measurement of MTT metabolic rate and LDH leakage rate. Glutamate reduced MTT metabolic rate, but increased LDH leakage rate significantly. The addition of new derivatives elevated the MTT value with their certain concentration, reduced cell death rate. Especially as for 3d and 4c, they fully normalized LDH leakage rate with concentration of 20 micromol x L(-1) during LDH measurement. These data indicated that 3d and 4c have significant protective effect on nerve cell against glutamate injury, deserved to be further tested and maybe helpful for treatment of neurodegenerative disease.
17575299,0,2007,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Calculations of anisotropy factors for radionuclide neutron sources due to scattering from source encapsulation and support structures.,A model has been developed for calculating the angular neutron fluence distributions for radionuclide neutron sources that are heavily encapsulated or surrounded by source support structures as a source holder and a source movement system. These structures may cause an anisotropic neutron fluence distribution. This should be taken into account in the neutron-measuring instruments calibration procedure. The calculations were made for two types of widely used neutron sources, (241)Am-Be and (252)Cf, by combining an in-house code simulating the (9)Be(alpha,n) reactions and the Monte Carlo code MCNP-4C. As a result, anisotropy factors in the direction perpendicular to the source capsule axis for bare neutron sources were evaluated to be 1.012, 1.030 and 1.039 for (252)Cf in a standard Amersham X1 capsule, (241)Am-Be in a X3 capsule and (241)Am-Be in a X4 capsule, respectively. These values are in reasonable agreement with the published data. If the support structures are included in the MCNP simulation, the anisotropy factors for these neutron sources increase by approximately 10%.
17565065,0,2007,J Anim Sci,Energy requirements and cow/calf efficiency of Nellore and Continental and British Bos taurus x Nellore crosses.,The objective of this work was to compare breed types with increasing percentage of Bos taurus on cow/calf energy requirements and preweaning efficiency. Forty mature, lactating, nonpregnant cows [10 Nellore (NL), 10 Canchim x Nellore (CN), 10 Angus x Nellore (AN), and 10 Simmental x Nellore (SN)] were randomized in blocks by calving date. Calves from cross-bred cows were sired by Canchim bulls (5/8 Charolais + 3/8 Zebu), whereas calves from NL cows were sired by Nellore bulls. Cows were individually fed a pelleted diet with 50% hay (alfalfa and coastcross) and 50% concentrate from calving to weaning (20 to 180 d post-partum). Estimated diet ME content was 2.24 Mcal/kg of DM. Individual cow DMI was adjusted every 14 d to keep shrunk BW and BCS constant. Shrunk BW and BCS were 430 +/- 12 kg and 4.7 +/- 0.09 for NL, 449 +/- 10 kg and 4.8 +/- 0.09 for CN, 496 +/- 10 kg and 5.0 +/- 0.09 for AN, and 507 +/- 12 kg and 5.1 +/- 0.09 for SN. At 40 d calves were allowed ad libitum access to the same diet. Milk yield was recorded using a weigh-suckle-weigh technique. Increasing B. taurus percentage had a linear effect (P &lt; 0.01) on ME intake (MEI) of cow/calf pairs: 21.9 +/- 0.38 for Nellore, 23.6 +/- 0.35 for 31.5% B. taurus (CN), and 25.6 +/- 0.27 Mcal/d for 50% B. taurus (AN and SN). Bos taurus percentage was also positively associated with milk production. Nellore calves had lower (P &lt; 0.05) weaning weight (kg) than crossbreds: 167 +/- 12 vs. 206 +/- 10 for 3/4 Canchim 1/4 Nellore (3/4C), 220 +/- 11 for 1/2 Canchim 1/4 Angus 1/4 Nellore (1/4A) and 228 +/- 11 for 1/2 Canchim 1/4 Simmental 1/4 Nellore (1/4S). Calf body composition was estimated at weaning using the 9-10-11th-rib section. Retained energy (Mcal) was greater (P &lt; 0.05) in 1/4A (384 +/- 19.9) than in Nellore (298 +/- 21.6) and 3/4C calves (312 +/- 19.8), and was intermediate in 1/4S calves (333 +/- 21.6). Cow/calf energetic efficiency (kcal deposited/Mcal of MEI by the pair) was greater (P &lt; 0.05) for AN (103 +/- 5.3) than NL (84.9 +/- 5.9), CN (83 +/- 5.3), and SN pairs (83.5 +/- 6.1). Difference (P &lt; 0.05) between Continental and British crosses was shown in linear contrasts; SN pairs had greater MEI and lower retained energy than AN. Increasing the B. taurus percentage increased inputs as well as outputs. However, a relatively greater increase in outputs resulted in significantly greater preweaning efficiency. Purebred Nellore had lower ME requirements; however, in an environment without nutritional constraints, crossbreeding improved preweaning biological efficiency.
17555822,0,2007,J Inorg Biochem,Synthesis and characterization of di-phenyl-tin(IV)-salicyliden-ortho-aminophenols: analysis of in vitro antitumor/antioxidant activities and molecular structures.,The one pot reactions carried among salicylaldehyde 1, ortho-aminophenols 2a-2g, and di-phenyl-tin(IV) oxide 3 led to seven di-phenyl-tin(IV) compounds 4a-4g in good yields (97-83%). All compounds were analyzed by IR, 1H, 13C, 119Sn NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analyses; furthermore, in the case of compounds 4b, 4c, 4e and 4g by X-ray diffraction. Compounds 4a-4g were tested in vitro against six human tumor cell lines U251, PC-3, K-562, HCT-15, MCF-7 and SKLU-1 to assess their in vitro antitumor activity. The results suggest biological specificity towards U251, MCF-7 and SKLU-1 cells at doses below 2.5 microM, which are lower than cis-platin IC50's in the three cell lines. Since the inhibitory concentration values for the series were alike to Ph(2)SnCl(2) is feasible that only the Ph(2)Sn moiety is responsible for those activities, further experiments are under research. Besides, 4a-4g were tested for their antioxidant efficiency in rat brain homogenate showing that 4g is more active (IC50=3.01 microM) than the flavone quercetin (natural antioxidant, IC50=4.11 microM) on inhibition of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The TBARS activity (IC50) correlates with the ortho-aminophenol substitutions and a linear combination among sigma Hammett, one bond tin coupling constants and tin chemical shifts against the measured IC(50-TBARS) was found. This correlation gave basis that the implied molecular variables can become trackers for the calculation of TBARS inhibitory concentrations in similar systems. Moreover, there seemed to be an inverse structure-response behavior among activities, since the 4g derivative is the less active compound for cytotoxic assays meanwhile it is the best in antioxidant tests.
17553096,0,2007,J Forensic Sci,Validation of LAB color mode as a nondestructive method to differentiate black ballpoint pen inks.,Nondestructive digital processing methods such as lab color mode (available in Adobe Photoshop) are emerging as alternative methods for forensic document examiners to use when attempting to differentiate writing instrument inks. Although these techniques appear to be viable, little data currently exists regarding the known or potential error rates associated with these techniques. Without adequate data, the validity and reliability of these techniques, including lab color, can not be established. In an attempt to begin to address these issues, 44 black ballpoint ink pens were obtained and used to create 990 pen-pair samples for analysis using established lab color mode techniques. No erroneous findings of &quot;different&quot; were reported following the examination of the known pen-pair combinations in which the same pen was used to create the samples (n = 44). Of the remaining 946 samples, 737 pen-pair samples were differentiated using the lab color mode method, while 209 samples were unable to be differentiated and were recorded as either being &quot;similar&quot; (n = 153) or &quot;unsure&quot; (n = 56). Comparison of the lab color mode results with the results obtained through additional testing using traditional infrared reflectance and infrared luminescence test methods showed that lab color differentiated 102 pen-pair samples (11%; 102/946) that were not differentiated using a VSC-4C.
19069758,0,2007,Rev Biol Trop,Molecular phylogenetic relationships among four species of the mangrove tree genus Bruguiera (Rhizophoraceae), as revealed by chromosome and RAPD markers.,Analysis of karyotype, nuclear DNA content and RAPD markers were performed in four species of Bruguiera (Rhizophoraceae) of Bhitarkanika mangrove forests, Orissa, India. Detailed karyotype analysis revealing 2n=34 in B. cylindrica and 2n=36 in B. gymnorrhiza was reported for the first time and 2n=34 in B. parviflora and B. sexangula was confirmed. On the basis of the common types of chromosomes present among Bruguiera, two distinct groups were found; one consists of B. cylindrica and B. parviflora and the other of B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula. The symmetrical karyotype with same chromosome types grouped B. cylindrica and B. parviflora together and presence of Type E chromosomes placed B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula in a separate group, suggesting their closer affinity in their respective group. Analysis of chromosome length, volume, INV and 4C DNA content confirmed this division. Nuclear DNA content was two-fold higher (approximately 17.0 pg) in the second group than in the first (approximately 8.0 pg). The amplification products generated through RAPD revealed 1-9 amplicons with size variations from 600 bp to 2 500 bp with 49.31% genetic similarity between B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula and 47.10% in between B. cylindrica and B. parviflora. The high copy number marker band (approximately 1,100 bp) yielded in OPN-15 primer in B. parviflora the characteristic DNA marker, which was cloned and used as probes for assessment of genetic diversity, and demonstrated its close genetic affinity to B. cylindrica. B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula also produced similar marker bands of approximately 600 bp and approximately 2,200 bp in the same primer. All of the cytological, 4C DNA content and RAPD data confirmed the existence of two taxonomically distinct groups of Bruguiera: one consisting of B. cylindrica and B. parviflora and the other of B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula as placed earlier (1862) in the tribe Rhizophoreae by Bentham and Hooker, on the basis of the flowering habits ofBruguiera. Genetically, the B. sexangula and B. gymnorrhiza group was found to be very closely, rather than distantly, related to B. parviflora and B. cylindrica. Our results demonstrate that molecular markers together with cytological evidence provide an effective tool to access the existing interspecific genetic polymorphism in mangrove species, to solve the taxonomic problems and to design their conservation strategy.
17525058,0,2007,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Evaluation of the characteristics of the neutron reference field using D2O-moderated 252Cf source.,The ambient/personal dose equivalent per fluence for D(2)O moderated (252)Cf neutron source was determined by measurement. An appropriate subtraction of the scattered neutrons is required for the accurate measurement of direct neutrons. A cubic shadow object was used for the subtraction of the scattered neutrons from the surroundings. The scattered neutrons to be subtracted vary with the position of the shadow object due to the large volume of the source. Using the Monte Carlo code MCNP-4C, the optimum positions of the shadow object were surveyed for subtracting the scattered neutrons. The energy spectra of direct neutrons were measured in the optimum position. The dosimetric parameters for the D(2)O moderated (252)Cf neutron source were reasonable, taking into account the uncertainties of the parameters.
17459701,0,2007,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Bis[(para-methoxy)benzyl] phosphonate prodrugs with improved stability and enhanced cell penetration.,A series of substituted bis[(para-methoxy)benzyl] (bisPMB) esters of 1-naphthalenemethylphosphonate (NMPA) were synthesized and evaluated as phosphonate prodrugs. BisPMB NMPA esters (4b and 4c) with significantly improved aqueous stability were identified that also resulted in increased intracellular levels of NMPA following prodrug incubation with primary rat hepatocytes.
17391028,0,2007,Inorg Chem,Olefin metathesis as an inorganic synthetic tool: cross and ring closing metathesis reactions of diruthenium-bound omega-alkene-alpha-carboxylates.,Diruthenium compounds containing one omega-alkene-alpha-carboxylate ligand, Ru2Cl(D(3,5-Cl2Ph)F)3(O2C(CH2)nCH=CH2) (n=1 (1a) and 2 (1b)), were prepared from the reaction between Ru2Cl(D(3,5-Cl2Ph)F)3(O2CCH3) (D(3,5-Cl2Ph)F=N,N'-bis(3,5-dicholorophenyl)formamidinate) and the corresponding omega-alkene-alpha-carboxylic acid. Compounds 1a and 1b both underwent olefin cross metathesis reactions catalyzed by (Cy3P)2Cl2Ru(=CHPh) to afford the dimerized compounds [Ru2Cl(D(3,5-Cl2Ph)F)3]2(mu-O2C(CH2)nCH=CH(CH2)nCO2) (n=1 (2a) and 2 (2b)). Similarly, diruthenium compounds containing two omega-alkene-alpha-carboxylate ligands, cis-Ru2Cl(D(3,5-Cl2Ph)F)2(O2C(CH2)nCH=CH2)2 (n=1 (3a), 2 (3b), and 3 (3c)), were prepared by substituting the acetate ligands in cis-Ru2Cl(D(3,5-Cl2Ph)F)2(O2CCH3)2 with the corresponding omega-alkene-alpha-carboxylate ligands. Compounds 3 exhibited different reactivity under olefin metathesis conditions: both 3b and 3c underwent the intramolecular ring closing reaction quantitatively to afford compounds cis-Ru2(D(3,5-Cl2Ph)F)2(mu-O2C(CH2)nCH=CH2(CH2)nCO2)Cl with n=2 (4b) and 3 (4c), respectively, but 3a displayed no metathesis reactivity. Molecular structures of compounds 1a/1b, 2a/2b, 3a/3b, and 4b were established via X-ray diffraction studies, confirming the formation of cross and ring closing metathesis products. Voltammograms of compounds 2 are nearly identical to those of compounds 1, indicating the absence of electronic interactions mediated by the tether derived from olefin metathesis.
17378611,0,2007,J Org Chem,Synthesis and characterization of R2PN=P(iBuNCH2CH2)3N: a new bulky electron-rich phosphine for efficient Pd-assisted Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions.,Pro-azaphosphatrane 1a [P(iBuNCH2CH2)3N] reacts with iodine under mild conditions to give [IP(iBuNCH2CH2)3N]I in excellent yield, which on subsequent reaction with ammonia followed by deprotonation with KOtBu provided HN=P(iBuNCH2CH2)3N (3a) in quantitative yield. Reaction of 3a with R'2PCl afforded sterically bulky electron-rich phosphines of the type R'2PN=P(iBuNCH2CH2)3N (4) [R'=Ph (4a), iPr (4b), tBu (4c)]. The Pd(OAc)2/4c catalyst system was particularly efficient for the coupling of arylboronic acids with aryl bromides as well as aryl chlorides to give biaryls in excellent yields.
17375938,0,2007,Langmuir,Self-assembled nanowire networks of aryloxy zinc phthalocyanines based on Zn-O coordination.,Tetrakis(aryloxy)phthalocyanine (4c) and its Zn congeners (4a and 4b) and Ni congener (4d) were synthesized, and their self-assembling properties in coordinating and non-coordinating solvents were investigated by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Compounds 4a and 4b in non-coordinating solvents exhibit red-shifted and split Q-bands in absorption spectra even at very low concentrations, suggesting J-aggregate formation. The MALDI-TOF MS for the samples of 4a and 4b prepared from chloroform solutions gives the monomer and aggregate signals. The TEM images of such samples display an indefinite two-dimensional network structure. The aggregates break up into monomers when a coordinating solvent is added to the solution. The driving force for the aggregate formation is proposed to be the complementary coordination of the ether oxygen in the aryloxy groups of one molecule to the core Zn of another molecule of phthalocyanine.
17330965,0,2007,Inorg Chem,Coordination studies of a new unsymmetrical kappa4-PNN'N&quot;-tetradentate ligand: stepwise formation and structural characterization.,The two-step synthesis of a new unsymmetrical ligand 2-[Ph2PC6H4C(H)=N]C6H4[N(H)COCH2N(H)CO2Bz], 2.HH, via acid-catalyzed Schiff base condensation of 2-(H2N)C6H4[N(H)COCH2N(H)CO2Bz], 1, with 2-Ph2PC6H4(CHO) in refluxing EtOH is reported. The multidentate ligand 2.HH, isolated in ca. 60% yield, exhibits an array of ligation modes, as exemplified by coordination studies with NiII, PdII, PtII, and AuI mononuclear metal precursors. Hence, reaction of 2.HH with AuCl(tht) (1:1 molar ratio, tht = tetrahydrothiophene) affords AuCl(2.HH), 3, in which the ligand behaves as a classic, neutral two-electron phosphorus donor. In contrast, reaction with MCl2(cod) (M = Pt, Pd; cod = cycloocta-1,5-diene) affords the corresponding dichloro complexes MCl2(2.HH) (4a M = Pt; 4b M = Pd) in which kappa2-P/N-chelation through both P and imino N-donor atoms is observed. Likewise, treatment of Pd(CH3)Cl(cod) with 2.HH gave Pd(CH3)Cl(2.HH), 4c, in which the imino nitrogen is trans to the methyl ligand. Cycloocta-1,5-diene elimination from, and single methyl protonation of, Pt(CH3)2(cod) with 1 equiv of 2.HH in toluene at ambient temperature affords the neutral complex Pt(CH3)(2.H-), 5a, in which 2.H- functions effectively in a kappa3-PNN' coordination mode. The dichloro compounds 4a or 4b undergo smooth N(H) deprotonation with tBuOK to give 6a\6a' and 6b\6b' in which 22- acts as a dianionic kappa4-PNN'N' ' ligand. The corresponding square-planar, diamagnetic, nickel(II) complex 6c\6c' was prepared in excellent yield from NiCl2.6H2O, 2.HH, and tBuOK. Variable-temperature NMR experiments confirm 6a\6a' and 6b\6b' exist, in solution, as a pair of conformational (anti and syn) isomers due to restricted rotation about the N-CO2Bz group. This feature is also borne out by single-crystal X-ray studies of anti-6a.CHCl3, syn-6a'.H2O, anti-6b.CHCl3, and anti-6c.CH2Cl2. To the best of our knowledge, we believe these constitute the first examples of crystallographically characterized conformers of a tetradentate ligand incorporating a P-donor center. All new compounds reported have been fully characterized by a combination of spectroscopic (NMR, FT-IR, ES-MS) and analytical methods. Furthermore, single-crystal X-ray studies have also been undertaken on compounds 2.HH, 3, 4a, and 5a.Et2O.
17286434,0,2007,J Org Chem,Efficient syntheses of a series of trehalose dimycolate (TDM)/trehalose dicorynomycolate (TDCM) analogues and their interleukin-6 level enhancement activity in mice sera.,We found an IL-6 level-enhancing compound during our synthetic study of trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate (1, TDM, formerly called cord factor) analogues. TDM is a glycolipid distributed in the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and shows significant antitumor activity based on an immunoadjuvant activity. However, due to its significant toxicity, TDM is not yet applicable for practical use. In 1993, Datta and Takayama reported the purification of trehalose-6,6'-dicorynomycolate (2c, TDCM) from Corynebacterium spp. We have previously reported the synthesis of four diastereomeric TDCMs and showed that the synthetic (2R,3R,2'R,3'R)-TDCM (2c, hereafter abbreviated RRRR-TDCM-C14) is identical to natural TDCM; we also demonstrated that 2c and SSSS-TDCM-C14 (3c) showed significant antitumor activity as well as inhibitory activity in experimental lung metastasis based on the immunoadjuvant activity. Furthermore, we found that the significant lethal toxicity in mice by TDM (1) was no longer observed with the shorter-chain analogues of TDCMs. Therefore, we have elucidated that the 2,3-antistereochemistry (RR or SS) of the fatty acid residue is promising for biological activities. The chain length of the fatty acid residue should also be important for the biological activity, and thus, we designed a general synthetic procedure for trehalose diesters with 2,3-antistereochemistry and a series of chain lengths by using Noyori's asymmetric reduction of beta,beta-ketoesters followed by antiselective alkylation according to Frater to give beta,beta-hydroxy alcohols as the key steps. Thus, we prepared trehalose diesters (TDCM) 2a-d, 3a-d, and 4a-d as well as monoesters (TMCM) 5a-d and 6a-d. Immunological activities of TDCMs and TMCMs were evaluated by determining IL-6 level enhancement in mouse serum, and we found that RRRR-TDCM-C14 (2c) and RRSS-TDCM-C14 (4c) showed significant IL-6 level enhancement activities.
17280285,0,2007,Phys Rev Lett,Magnetic plasmon propagation along a chain of connected subwavelength resonators at infrared frequencies.,A one-dimensional magnetic plasmon propagating in a linear chain of single split ring resonators is proposed. The subwavelength size resonators interact mainly through exchange of conduction current, resulting in stronger coupling as compared to the corresponding magneto-inductive interaction. Finite-difference time-domain simulations in conjunction with a developed analytical theory show that efficient energy transfer with signal attenuation of less then 0.57 dB/microm and group velocity higher than 1/4c can be achieved. The proposed novel mechanism of energy transport in the nanoscale has potential applications in subwavelength transmission lines for a wide range of integrated optical devices.
17228035,0,2007,Obesity (Silver Spring),Bioelectrical impedance vs. four-compartment model to assess body fat change in overweight adults.,OBJECTIVE: The Tanita TBF-305 body fat analyzer is marketed for home and clinical use and is based on the principles of leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Few studies have investigated the ability of leg-to-leg BIA to detect change in percentage fat mass (%FM) over time. Our objective was to determine the ability of leg-to-leg BIA vs. the four-compartment (4C) model to detect small changes in %FM in overweight adults.RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Thirty-eight overweight adults (BMI, 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2; age, 18 to 44 years; 31 women) participated in a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a nutritional supplement. Body composition was measured at 0 and 6 months using the Tanita TBF-305 body fat analyzer [using equations derived by the manufacturer (%FM(T-Man)) and by Jebb et al. (%FM(T-Jebb))] and the 4C model (%FM(4C)).RESULTS: Subjects in the experimental group lost 0.9%FM(4C) (p = 0.03), a loss that did not reach significance using leg-to-leg BIA (0.6%FM(T-Man), p = 0.151; 0.6%FM(T-Jebb), p = 0.144). We observed large standard deviations (SDs) in the mean difference in %FM between the 4C model and the Tanita(Manufacturer) (2.5%) and Tanita(Jebb) (2.2%). Ten subjects fell outside +/-1 SD of the mean differences at 0 and 6 months; those individuals were younger and shorter than those within +/-1 SD.DISCUSSION: Leg-to-leg BIA performed reasonably well in predicting decreases in %FM in this group of overweight adults but resulted in wide SDs vs. %FM(4C) in individuals. Cross-sectional determinations of %FM of overweight individuals using leg-to-leg BIA should be interpreted with caution.
17207942,0,2007,Anim Reprod Sci,Rat testicular germ cell type(s) targeted by anti-spermatogenic agents in vivo and their recovery on withdrawal of treatment--a flow cytometric study.,Spermatogenesis goes through very critically and precisely balanced ratios of germ cells with diverse DNA ploidies (1C, 2C and 4C). Antispermatogenic agents that reversibly interrupt spermatogenesis may have a contraceptive relevance. With a view to study the precise mechanism of action of antispermatogenic agents and identify the germ cell type(s) targeted by various agents in vivo, spermatogenic cells with diverse DNA ploidies were measured in rat testis during treatment and recovery with compounds CDRI-84/35, gossypol and estradiol, using Flow Cytometry. Rats were treated with either CDRI-84/35 (100mg/(kg day) for 15 days followed by 25mg/(kg day) for 55 days) or gossypol (20mg/(kg day) for 70 days) or estradiol benzoate (2.5microg/(rat day) for 70 days) and 3 rats from each group were sacrificed after 22, 41, 53 and 70 days of treatment to monitor the changes in population of 1C, 2C, S-phase and 4C germ cell types. Treatment with CDRI-84/35 resulted in a significant and rapid drop in 1C population with a concomitant and parallel rise in 2C population. In gossypol-treated animals 1C peak disappeared gradually and the arrest was seen predominantly at 2C stage and partially at 4C stage. At the end of the treatment most of the germ cells were arrested at 2C stage. Estradiol affected spermatogenesis differently with 1C population falling in complement to rise in both 2C and 4C peaks. Germ cells were mainly arrested at the 4C stage after the treatment. The data suggest that germ cells fail to enter meiosis in CDRI-84/35-treated rats. Few cells entering meiosis do not complete the cell division and remain arrested at 4C stage. However in case of estradiol and gossypol the meiotic 4C cells become incapable of further differentiation into haploid cells. After receiving 70 days of treatment a few rats were allowed to recover for 60, 90 and 120 days. The population of various germ cell types in the testis of recovery-group animals indicated that spermatogenesis resumes substantially in case of estradiol treatment and partially in case of treatment with the other two agents.
17198417,0,2007,Inorg Chem,Control of two-electron four-center (2e-/4c) C-C bond formation observed for tetracyanoethenide dimerization, [TCNE]2(2-).,Cu(PPh3)3(TCNE) (TCNE = tetracyanoethylene) and 14 other examples form [TCNE]22- dimers possessing a long 2.89 +/- 0.05 A two-electron four-center (2e-/4c) C-C bond in the solid state. This bond arises from the overlap of the b2g pi* singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) on each [TCNE]*- fragment, forming a filled bonding orbital of b2u symmetry, and the stabilizing effect of the cation...anion interactions in the crystal that exceed the anionic repulsion. In contrast, Mn(C5H5)(CO)2(TCNE) exhibits a related, but different, [TCNE]*-...TCNE]*- motif in the solid state that lacks the 2e-/4c C-C bonding. To better understand the unusual nature of 2e-/4c C-C bonding, the genesis of the differences between their respective pi-[TCNE]*-...TCNE]*- interactions was sought. The lack of 2e-/4c C-C bond formation is attributed to the weaker radical character of the [TCNE]*- ligand, which has a total spin population of only 0.5 electron, half of that required for two S = 1/2 [TCNE]*- moieties to form a [TCNE]22- dimer. Hence, the antiferromagnetic MnII-[TCNE]*- intramolecular interaction (between the formally S = 1/2 Mn-bound [TCNE]*- and the paramagnetic Mn(II)) dominates over the intermolecular pi-[TCNE]*--[TCNE]*- spin coupling (between two S = 1/2 [TCNE]*- needed to form [TCNE]22-). Therefore, by selecting specific metal ions that can interact with sigma-[TCNE]*-, dimerization forming [TCNE]22- can be favored or disfavored.
21200843,0,2007,Acta Crystallogr Sect E Struct Rep Online,C(60) 1,1,2,2-tetra-chloro-ethyl-ene tetra-solvate.,In the title complex, C(60)·4C(2)Cl(4), the C(60) mol-ecule is located on an inversion centre and there are two tetra-chloro-ethyl-ene (TCE) mol-ecules in the asymmetric unit. Both TCE mol-ecules show positional disorder, with occupancy ratios of 0.75:0.25 and 0.56:0.44. Four fullerene C atoms form short contacts [3.208 (17) and 3.223 (17) Å] with the centres of the TCE double bonds, indicating that C(60)-solvent inter-actions are largely π-π in nature.
17033623,269,2006,Nat Genet,Nuclear organization of active and inactive chromatin domains uncovered by chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C).,The spatial organization of DNA in the cell nucleus is an emerging key contributor to genomic function. We developed 4C technology (chromosome conformation capture (3C)-on-chip), which allows for an unbiased genome-wide search for DNA loci that contact a given locus in the nuclear space. We demonstrate here that active and inactive genes are engaged in many long-range intrachromosomal interactions and can also form interchromosomal contacts. The active beta-globin locus in fetal liver preferentially contacts transcribed, but not necessarily tissue-specific, loci elsewhere on chromosome 7, whereas the inactive locus in fetal brain contacts different transcriptionally silent loci. A housekeeping gene in a gene-dense region on chromosome 8 forms long-range contacts predominantly with other active gene clusters, both in cis and in trans, and many of these intra- and interchromosomal interactions are conserved between the tissues analyzed. Our data demonstrate that chromosomes fold into areas of active chromatin and areas of inactive chromatin and establish 4C technology as a powerful tool to study nuclear architecture.
17033624,212,2006,Nat Genet,Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) uncovers extensive networks of epigenetically regulated intra- and interchromosomal interactions.,Accumulating evidence converges on the possibility that chromosomes interact with each other to regulate transcription in trans. To systematically explore the epigenetic dimension of such interactions, we devised a strategy termed circular chromosome conformation capture (4C). This approach involves a circularization step that enables high-throughput screening of physical interactions between chromosomes without a preconceived idea of the interacting partners. Here we identify 114 unique sequences from all autosomes, several of which interact primarily with the maternally inherited H19 imprinting control region. Imprinted domains were strongly overrepresented in the library of 4C sequences, further highlighting the epigenetic nature of these interactions. Moreover, we found that the direct interaction between differentially methylated regions was linked to epigenetic regulation of transcription in trans. Finally, the patterns of interactions specific to the maternal H19 imprinting control region underwent reprogramming during in vitro maturation of embryonic stem cells. These observations shed new light on development, cancer epigenetics and the evolution of imprinting.
16879972,56,2006,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and biological activity of Schiff and Mannich bases bearing 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorophenyl moiety.,A series of 2,4-dichloro-5-fluorophenyl bearing Mannich base (4 and 5) was prepared from triazole Schiff bases (3) by aminomethylation with formaldehyde and secondary/substituted primary amines. All newly synthesized compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activity. Compounds 3c, 4c, 4e and 4f exhibited promising antibacterial and compounds 3c, 5c, 5e and 5f showed good antifungal activity.
17074949,52,2006,Am J Psychiatry,Dysfunctional prefrontal regional specialization and compensation in schizophrenia.,OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that in healthy persons higher-order cognitive processing engaged by incremental working memory load hierarchically employs more dorsal than ventral prefrontal resources in healthy individuals. Given that working memory performance is impaired in schizophrenia, especially at higher executive loads, the authors investigated how this prefrontal functional organization might be altered in disease, independent of performance deficits.METHOD: Using N-back working memory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, the authors studied 15 patients with schizophrenia and 26 healthy comparison subjects. Subgroups based on median performance accuracy at 2-back were analyzed; high performers included eight schizophrenia patients and 14 comparison subjects, and low performers included seven patients and 12 comparison subjects.RESULTS: High-performing but not low-performing comparison subjects responded to incremental working memory executive load with disproportionately greater dorsal but not ventral prefrontal cortex activation, which also predicted performance accuracy. In the high- and low-performing patient groups, incremental working memory load caused a disproportionate increase in ventral but not dorsal prefrontal cortex activation relative to the respective comparison group, which also correlated with accuracy. Functional connectivity between the ventral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex was relatively greater in patients, whereas comparison subjects had greater functional connectivity between the dorsal prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex.CONCLUSIONS: The hierarchical organization of the prefrontal cortex may be compromised in schizophrenia, resulting in loss of functional specialization and integration at the dorsal prefrontal cortex and in compensatory activation from the ventral prefrontal cortex, which may ultimately affect working memory and executive cognition.
16730941,48,2006,Genomics,A systematic analysis of human CHMP protein interactions: additional MIT domain-containing proteins bind to multiple components of the human ESCRT III complex.,In Saccharomyces cerevisiae 6 closely related proteins (Did2p, Vps2p, Vps24p, Vps32p, Vps60p, Vps20p) form part of the extended ESCRT III complex. This complex is required for the formation of multivesicular bodies and the degradation of internalized transmembrane receptor proteins. In contrast the human genome encodes 10 homologous proteins (CHMP1A (approved gene symbol PCOLN3), 1B, 2A, 2B, 3 (approved gene symbol VPS24), 4A, 4B, 4C, 5, and 6). In this study we have performed a series of protein interaction experiments to generate a more comprehensive picture of the human CHMP protein-interaction network. Our results describe novel interactions between known components of the human ESCRT III complex and identify a range of putative binding partners, which may indicate new ways in which the function of human CHMP proteins may be regulated. In particular, we show that two further MIT domain-containing proteins (AMSH/STAMBP and LOC129531) interact with multiple components of the human ESCRT III complex.
16569780,45,2006,Radiology,BI-RADS lexicon for US and mammography: interobserver variability and positive predictive value.,PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate interobserver variability between breast radiologists by using terminology of the fourth edition of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) to categorize lesions on mammograms and sonograms and to retrospectively determine the positive predictive value (PPV) of BI-RADS categories 4a, 4b, and 4c.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained; informed consent was not required. This study was HIPAA compliant. Ninety-four consecutive lesions in 91 women who underwent image-guided biopsy comprised 59 masses, 32 calcifications, and three masses with calcification. Five radiologists retrospectively reviewed these lesions. Each observer described each lesion with BI-RADS terminology and assigned a final BI-RADS category. Interobserver variability was assessed with the Cohen kappa statistic. A pathologic diagnosis was available for all 94 lesions; 30 (32%) were malignant and 64 (68%) were benign. Pathologic analysis of benign lesions was performed on tissue obtained with image-guided core-needle biopsy. In cases referred for excisional biopsy after needle biopsy because of atypia or discordance, final surgical pathologic analysis was used for correlation with imaging findings. PPV for category 4 or 5 lesions was determined for all readers combined.RESULTS: For ultrasonographic (US) descriptors, substantial agreement was obtained for lesion orientation, shape, and boundary (kappa = 0.61, 0.66, and 0.69, respectively). Moderate agreement was obtained for lesion margin and posterior acoustic features (kappa = 0.40 for both). Fair agreement was obtained for lesion echo pattern (kappa = 0.29). For mammographic descriptors, moderate agreement was obtained for mass shape, mass margin, and calcification distribution (kappa = 0.48, 0.48, and 0.50, respectively). Fair agreement was obtained for calcification description (kappa = 0.32). Slight agreement was obtained for mass density (kappa = 0.18). Fair agreement was obtained for final assessment category (kappa = 0.28). PPVs of BI-RADS category 4 and 5 assignments were as follows: category 4a, six (6%) of 102; category 4b, 17 (15%) of 110; category 4c, 48 (53%) of 91; and category 5, 71 (91%) of 78.CONCLUSION: Interobserver agreement with the new BI-RADS terminology is good and validates the US lexicon. Subcategories 4a, 4b, and 4c are useful in predicting the likelihood of malignancy.
17166913,41,2006,J Virol,Vaccinia virus 4c (A26L) protein on intracellular mature virus binds to the extracellular cellular matrix laminin.,Vaccinia virus intracellular mature virus (IMV) binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on cells via three virion proteins, H3L, A27L, and D8L. In this study, we demonstrated that binding of IMV to BSC40 cells was competitively inhibited by soluble laminin but not by fibronectin or collagen V, suggesting that this cell surface extracellular matrix (ECM) protein may play a role in vaccinia virus entry. Moreover, IMV infection of GAG(-) sog9 cells was also inhibited by laminin, demonstrating that virion binding to laminin does not involve a prior interaction with GAGs. Furthermore, comparative envelope protein analyses of wild-type vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve, which binds to laminin, and of a mutant virus, IA27L, which does not, showed that the A26L open reading frame (ORF), encoding an envelope protein, was mutated in IA27L, resulting in A26L being absent from the IMV. Expression of the wild-type A26L ORF in IA27L resulted in laminin binding activity. Moreover, recombinant A26L protein bound to laminin in vitro with a high affinity, providing direct evidence that A26L is the laminin binding protein on IMV. In summary, these results reveal a novel role for the vaccinia viral envelope protein A26L in binding to the ECM protein laminin, an association that is proposed to facilitate IMV entry.
17177411,36,2006,J Am Chem Soc,Targeting of cancer cells with ferrimagnetic ferritin cage nanoparticles.,Protein cage architectures such as virus capsids and ferritins are versatile nanoscale platforms amenable to both genetic and chemical modification. Incorporation of multiple functionalities within these nanometer-sized protein architectures demonstrate their potential to serve as functional nanomaterials with applications in medical imaging and therapy. In the present study, we synthesized an iron oxide (magnetite) nanoparticle within the interior cavity of a genetically engineered human H-chain ferritin (HFn). A cell-specific targeting peptide, RGD-4C which binds alphavbeta3 integrins upregulated on tumor vasculature, was genetically incorporated on the exterior surface of HFn. Both magnetite-containing and fluorescently labeled RGD4C-Fn cages bound C32 melanoma cells in vitro. Together these results demonstrate the capability of a genetically modified protein cage architecture to serve as a multifunctional nanoscale container for simultaneous iron oxide loading and cell-specific targeting.
16619663,28,2006,J Neurosurg,The human survivin promoter: a novel transcriptional targeting strategy for treatment of glioma.,OBJECT: Malignant brain tumors have been proved to be resistant to standard treatments and therefore require new therapeutic strategies. Survivin, a recently described member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, is overexpressed in several human brain tumors, primarily gliomas, but is downregulated in normal tissues. The authors hypothesized that the expression of tumor-specific survivin could be exploited for treatment of gliomas by targeting the tumors with gene therapy vectors.METHODS: Following confirmation of survivin expression in glioma cell lines, an adenoviral vector containing the survivin promoter and the reporter gene luciferase was tested in established and primary glioma cells, normal astrocytic cells, and normal human brain tissues. High levels of reporter gene expression were observed in established tumor and primary tumor cell lines and low levels of expression in astrocytes and normal human brain tissue. To test oncolytic potency, the authors constructed survivin promoter-based conditionally replicative adenoviruses (CRAds), composed of survivin promoter-regulated E1 gene expression and an RGD-4C capsid modification. These CRAds could efficiently replicate within and kill a variety of established glioma tumor cells, but were inactive in a normal human liver organ culture. Finally, survivin promoter-based CRAds significantly inhibited the growth of glioma xenografts in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: Together these data indicate that the survivin promoter is a promising tumor-specific promoter for transcriptional targeting of adenovirus-based vectors and CRAds for malignant gliomas. The strategy of using survivin-CRAds may thus translate into an experimental therapeutic approach that can be used in human clinical trials.

16685045,24,2006,Am J Clin Nutr,Evaluation of Lunar Prodigy dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for assessing body composition in healthy persons and patients by comparison with the criterion 4-component model.,BACKGROUND: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is widely used to assess body composition in research and clinical practice. Several studies have evaluated its accuracy in healthy persons; however, little attention has been directed to the same issue in patients.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the accuracy of the Lunar Prodigy DXA for body-composition analysis with that of the reference 4-component (4C) model in healthy subjects and in patients with 1 of 3 disease states.DESIGN: A total of 215 subjects aged 5.0-21.3 y (n = 122 healthy nonobese subjects, n = 55 obese patients, n = 26 cystic fibrosis patients, and n = 12 patients with glycogen storage disease). Fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and weight were measured by DXA and the 4C model.RESULTS: The accuracy of DXA-measured body-composition outcomes differed significantly between groups. Factors independently predicting bias in weight, FM, FFM, and percentage body fat in multivariate models included age, sex, size, and disease state. Biases in FFM were not mirrored by equivalent opposite biases in FM because of confounding biases in weight.CONCLUSIONS: The bias of DXA varies according to the sex, size, fatness, and disease state of the subjects, which indicates that DXA is unreliable for patient case-control studies and for longitudinal studies of persons who undergo significant changes in nutritional status between measurements. A single correction factor cannot adjust for inconsistent biases.
16505973,24,2006,Cell Mol Life Sci,Anaplerotic roles of pyruvate carboxylase in mammalian tissues.,Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. PC serves an anaplerotic role for the tricarboxylic acid cycle, when intermediates are removed for different biosynthetic purposes. In liver and kidney, PC provides oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis. In adipocytes PC is involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis and glyceroneogenesis, and is regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, suggesting that PC is involved in the metabolic switch controlling fuel partitioning toward lipogenesis. In islets, PC is necessary for glucose-induced insulin secretion by providing oxaloacetate to form malate that participates in the 'pyruvate/malate cycle' to shuttle 3C or 4C between mitochondria and cytoplasm. Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia impair this cycle and affect glucose-stimulated insulin release. In astrocytes, PC is important for de novo synthesis of glutamate, an important excitatory neurotransmitter supplied to neurons. Transcriptional studies of the PC gene pinpoint some transcription factors that determine tissue-specific expression.
16518637,22,2006,Plant Cell Rep,Occurrence of tetraploidy in Nicotiana attenuata plants after Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is genotype specific but independent of polysomaty of explant tissue.,Genotypes of Nicotiana attenuata collected from Utah and Arizona were transformed with 17 different vectors (14 unpublished vectors based on 3 new backbone vectors) using an Agrobacterium-mediated procedure to functionally analyze genes important for plant-insect interactions. None of the 51 T1-T3 transgenic Utah lines analyzed by the flow cytometry were tetraploid, as opposed to 18 of 33 transgenic Arizona lines (55%). Analysis of T0 regenerants transformed with the same vector carrying an inverted repeat (IR) N. attenuata pro-systemin construct confirmed the genotype dependency of tetraploidization: none of the 23 transgenic Utah lines were tetraploid but 31 (72%) of 43 transgenic Arizonas were tetraploid. We tested the hypothesis that the differences in polysomaty of the explant tissues accounted for genotype dependency of tetraploid formation by measuring polysomaty levels in different seedling tissues. Hypocotyls, cotyledons, and roots of Utah and Arizona genotypes contained similar percentages of 4C nuclei (61 and 60; 7 and 5; and 58 and 61%, respectively). Since we used hypocotyls as explant sources and the nonoccurrence of tetraploid Utah transformants does not correspond to the high percentage of 4C nuclei in Utah hypocotyls, we can rule out a direct relationship between tetraploid formation and polysomaty level. We hypothesize that the difference between the Utah and Arizona genotypes results from the failure of polyploid Utah callus to regenerate into fully competent plants. We propose that future work on post-transformation polyploidy concentrate on the processes that occur during callus formation and plant regeneration from callus.
17151282,19,2006,J Neurosci,Multiple circuits relaying primate parallel visual pathways to the middle temporal area.,Parallel pathways in the primate visual system parse the sensory signal into magnocellular (M), parvocellular (P), and koniocellular (K) streams. These pathways remain anatomically separate and distinct from their origination in different retinal ganglion cell types, through distinct layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and into primary visual cortex (V1), with the M pathway terminating primarily in layer 4Calpha, the P pathway in layer 4Cbeta, and the K pathway in the cytochrome oxidase blobs of layer 2/3. Recent studies indicate that outputs from V1 are less compartmental than previously thought, making it difficult to assess the contributions of M and P pathways to areas beyond V1 in the dorsal and ventral streams. Here we use rabies virus as a retrograde transsynaptic tracer to study the contributions of M and P pathways to areas middle temporal (MT), V3, and V2 of macaque monkey. We find that, although disynaptic inputs through layer 4C of V1 to dorsal stream area MT are dominated by the M pathway, within an additional three synapses MT receives a substantial P input. This P input is unlikely to reach MT via V3, which we show also receives disynaptic inputs dominated by the M pathway. We find that disynaptic inputs to V2, however, can be more balanced and may carry convergent M and P input to MT. Our observations provide evidence for multiple pathways from V1 to MT, with varying degrees of M and P convergence. Each pathway likely provides functionally specialized information to MT and dorsal stream visual processing.
16898839,16,2006,Org Lett,Alpha-hydroxy esters via enantioselective hydrogen-mediated C-C coupling: regiocontrolled reactions of silyl-substituted 1,3-diynes.,[reaction: see text] Catalytic hydrogenation of ethyl glyoxalate in the presence of 1,3-diynes 4a-9a using chirally modified rhodium catalysts enables formation of alpha-hydroxy esters 4c-9c in highly optically enriched form. Notably, for such trialkylsilyl-substituted 1,3-diynes, C-C coupling occurs exclusively at the carbon atom bearing silicon. Pi-back-bonding from low valent rhodium as described by the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model appears to direct the regiochemistry of C-C coupling, as corroborated by calculations of the diyne LUMO coefficients.
16757597,16,2006,J Clin Microbiol,Analysis of the 5' noncoding region versus the NS5b region in genotyping hepatitis C virus isolates from blood donors in France.,The 5' noncoding region (5' NCR) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become the standard for genotyping even though several reports show that its use can result in classification errors. The purpose of this study was to perform genotyping based on sequence analysis of the NS5b region in a set of 357 HCV strains isolated from blood donors in France in 2002 and 2003. Results were compared with those previously obtained using 5' NCR analysis, and HCV subtype distribution was reevaluated. Twenty-six of 120 strains (approximately 22%) initially identified as genotype 1b by 5' NCR region sequence analysis were reclassified as genotype 1a by NS5b region sequence analysis. Similarly, 14 of 23 strains (approximately 61%) initially identified as 2a/2c were reclassified as non-2a and non-2c subtypes, and 12 of 22 strains (approximately 45%) initially identified as 4c/4d subtypes were reclassified as non-4c and non-4d subtypes. Sequence analysis of the NS5b region also revealed 5 putative new subtype 2 variants and 2 putative new subtype 4 variants. Although these findings demonstrated full agreement between 5' NCR and NS5b sequence analysis with regard to type classification, genotyping based on phylogenetic analysis of the NS5b region is more accurate for subtype determination than genotyping based on analysis of the 5' NCR. Sequence analysis of the NS5b region is mandatory for epidemiologic studies.
16928793,15,2006,J Neurophysiol,Visual spatial summation in macaque geniculocortical afferents.,The spatial summation properties of visual signals were analyzed for geniculocortical afferents in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized paralyzed macaque monkeys. Afferent input responses were recorded extracellularly during cortical inactivation through superfusion of the cortex with muscimol, allowing investigation of lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) cell properties in the absence of cortical feedback. Responses from afferent inputs were classified as magno-, parvo-, or koniocellular based on anatomical organization within the cortex, established through histological reconstructions, and visual response wavelength sensitivity. More than 80% of afferents showed strong surround suppression [suppression index (SI) &gt;0.5] and 14% showed negligible surround suppression (SI &lt; 0.2). Afferent responses with weak and strong surround suppression were found throughout cortical input layers 4C and 4A. High-contrast estimates of the spatial extent of the classical surround were similar to the nonclassical surround. The classical and nonclassical surrounds were, on average, 1.5-fold larger than the excitatory center. Unlike neurons within V1, the spatial extent of excitatory summation for geniculocortical afferents was contrast invariant. Nonclassical surround suppression showed slight contrast dependency with estimates larger (20%) at lower contrasts and stronger at higher contrasts (13%). Surround suppression is inherent in cortical input responses and likely derives from lateral inhibition in either the LGN or retina. Although surround suppression within afferent responses increases slightly with contrast, the spatial spread of excitation remains fixed with contrast. This argues for distinct mechanisms of action for contrast-dependent modulation in cortical and subcortical responses.
17129641,13,2006,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities of novel 2-(1-adamantyl)-5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles and 2-(1-adamantylamino)-5-substituted-1,3,4-thiadiazoles.,Reaction of 1-adamantanecarbonyl chloride with certain carboxylic acid hydrazides in pyridine yielded the corresponding N-acyl adamantane-1-carbohydrazide derivatives 3a-j, which were cyclized to the corresponding 2-(1-adamantyl)-5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles 4a-j via heating with phosphorus oxychloride. Treatment of 1-adamantylisothiocyanate with some carboxylic acid hydrazides in ethanol yielded the corresponding 1-acyl-4-(1-adamantyl)-3-thiosemicarbazides 7a-g, which were cyclized to the corresponding 2-(1-adamantylamino)-5-substituted-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives 8a-g. Compounds 4a-j, 7a-g, and 8a-g were tested for in vitro activities against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the yeast-like pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. Several derivatives produced good or moderate activities particularly against the tested Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis. Meanwhile, compounds 4i and 8g displayed marked antifungal activity against C. albicans. In addition, the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of the synthesized compounds was determined using the carrageenin-induced paw oedema method in rats. The oxadiazole derivatives 4c, 4g, 4i and 4j produced good dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity.
17005751,13,2006,J Clin Microbiol,Listeria monocytogenes subgroups IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC delineate genetically distinct populations with varied pathogenic potential.,Listeria monocytogenes lineage III strains belonging to subgroups IIIA (n = 8), IIIB (n = 5), and IIIC (n = 6) were examined along with other known serotype strains (n = 11) by PCR and Southern hybridization using several recently described species-, virulence-, and serotype-specific primers and probes. The virulence of seven representative lineage III strains was then evaluated in mice via the intraperitoneal route. The results suggest that subgroup IIIA consists of typical rhamnose-positive avirulent serotype 4a and virulent serotype 4c strains, subgroup IIIC consists of atypical rhamnose-negative virulent serotype 4c strains, and subgroup IIIB consists of atypical rhamnose-negative virulent non-serotype 4a and non-serotype 4c strains, some of which may be related to serotype 7. It is possible that subgroup IIIB (including serotype 7) may represent a novel subspecies within L. monocytogenes.
16689826,13,2006,APMIS,Altered expression of goblet cell- and mucin glycosylation-related genes in the intestinal epithelium during infection with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis in rat.,Intestinal nematode infection induces marked goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus secretion, but the mechanisms of regulation of the changes still remain to be elucidated. In the present study, epithelial cells were isolated from the rat small intestine at various times after Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection, and the levels of expression of goblet cell- and mucin glycosylation-related genes were estimated by semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Among the genes investigated, mucin core peptide (MUC) 2, sialyltransferase (Siat) 4c and trefoil factor family (TFF) 3 were upregulated as early as 2-4 days post-infection, suggesting that they are associated with an early innate protective response. Seven days post-infection and thereafter, when the nematodes reached maturity, significant upregulation of MUC3, MUC4, resistin-like molecule beta (Relmbeta) and 3O-sulfotransferase (3ST)1 was observed, while 3ST2 expression levels increased after the majority of the worms were expelled from the intestine. Similar alterations of glycosylation-related gene expression were also observed in mast-cell-deficient Ws/Ws rats, suggesting that mast cells in the epithelium are not relevant to the upregulation of these genes. The present finding that the expression level of each goblet cell- or glycosylation-related gene was altered differently during the time course of infection indicates the progression of sequential qualitative changes in the mucus layer after infection.
16987497,12,2006,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Profiling human phosphodiesterase genes and splice isoforms.,A mere 21 human phosphodiesterase (PDE) genes are responsible for modulating cellular levels of cAMP and cGMP in response to stimuli. Considering the importance of cAMP and cGMP to disparate physiological functions including visual response, smooth muscle relaxation, platelet aggregation, immune response, and cardiac contractibility, perhaps the 200 or more splice isoforms of PDE genes also play a major functional role. We profiled the human PDEs across 25 tissue samples using splice sensitive oligonucleotide microarrays containing probes for exons and exon-exon junctions. Our results suggest that PDEs exhibit tissue-specific differences in expression, as demonstrated by the high expression of PDE4B in skeletal muscle. At the splice variant level, the majority of PDE genes--notably 1A, 1C, 2A, 4C, 4D, 5A, 7A, 8A, 8B, 9A, 10A, and 11A--exhibited tissue-specific splicing with potential functional implications for PDE biology. This work validates expression of many EST transcripts, and confirms and expands on published findings based on PCR and cloning, illuminating some of the complexity of cAMP and cGMP processing.
16482560,12,2006,J Med Virol,Hepatitis C virus genotype 3 predominates in North and Central India and is associated with significant histopathologic liver disease.,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes help to tailor the treatment response, but their influence on the disease severity and association with hepatic steatosis is not well understood. The prevalence of HCV genotypes and their correlation with the histopathological severity of liver disease and steatosis in Indian patients were studied. HCV-RNA and genotyping was carried out in 398 patients with chronic hepatitis C. Liver biopsy was available in 292 (73.4%) patients. The severity of liver disease was graded on the basis of the histological activity index and the stage of hepatic fibrosis. The patients were categorized as having mild (histological activity index &lt; or =5 and/or fibrosis &lt; or =2) or severe (histological activity index &gt; or =6 and/or fibrosis &gt; or =3) liver disease. Steatosis was graded in 106 patients as 0 (no steatosis), 1 (&lt;33% of hepatocytes affected), 2 (33%-66% of hepatocytes affected), or 3 (&gt;66% of hepatocytes affected). HCV genotype 3 was detected in 80.2% patients (3a:24.4%, 3b:3.3%, 3c:0.5%, 3a/3b:36.7%, and un-subtypable 3:15.3%), genotype 1 in 13.1% (1a:3%, 1b:5.5%, 1a/1b:0.3%, and un-subtypable 1:4.3%), genotype 4 in 3% patients (4a:1.5%, 4b:0.3%, 4a/4c:0.5%, and un-subtypable 4:0.8%), 2 in 2.5% and mixed genotypes (more than one genotype) in 1.3% of patients. The median histological activity index and fibrosis scores were: 5 and 2 in genotype 1; 4 and 2 in genotype 2; 5 and 2 in genotype 3; 7 and 3 in genotype 4; and 5 and 2 in mixed genotypes, respectively. Severe liver disease was present in 17 of 38 (45%) with genotype 1; in 1 of 3 (33%) with genotype 2; in 128 of 236 (54%) with genotype 3; 7 of 10 (70%) with genotype 4; and in 1 of 4 (25%) with mixed genotype. Hepatic steatosis grade &gt; or =2 was found in 28.1% of genotype 3; 23.5% of genotype 1; 20% of genotype 4; and in none of genotype 2 and mixed genotypes. In conclusion, genotype 3 is the most prevalent genotype in patients with chronic hepatitis C in North and Central India and this is associated with significant hepatic steatosis and fibrosis.
16924012,11,2006,Neurology,Spine deformities in Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4C caused by SH3TC2 gene mutations.,BACKGROUND: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a heterogeneous group of inherited peripheral motor and sensory neuropathies with several modes of inheritance: autosomal dominant, X-linked, and autosomal recessive (AR) CMT. A locus responsible for the demyelinating form of ARCMT was assigned to the 5q23-q33 region (CMT4C) by homozygosity mapping. Recently, 11 mutations were identified in the SH3TC2 (KIAA1985) gene in 12 families with demyelinating ARCMT from Turkish, Iranian, Greek, Italian, or German origin.OBJECTIVE: To identify mutations in the SH3TC2 gene.METHODS: The authors searched for SH3TC2 gene mutations in 10 consanguineous CMT families putatively linked to the CMT4C locus on the basis of haplotype segregation and linkage analysis.RESULTS: Ten families had mutations, eight of which were new and one, R954X, recurrent. Six of the 10 mutations were in exon 11. Onset occurred between ages 2 and 10. Scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis and foot deformities were found in almost all patients and were often inaugural. The median motor nerve conduction velocity values (&lt;/=34 m/s) were not correlated with disease duration. The functional disability score was &lt;/=3, indicating that the patients could walk without help. Unexpectedly, typical giant axons were observed on biopsies from a large Algerian family.CONCLUSIONS: Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4C (CMT4C) is less severe than other autosomal recessive (AR) CMT. Intrafamilial variability is important, making phenotype-genotype correlations difficult, but spine deformities are clearly a hallmark of CMT4C. In the presence of scoliosis, a neurologic examination is recommended. Giant axons on biopsies are also suggestive of CMT4C. For genetic analysis, the R954X mutation should be looked for before systematic sequencing of exon 11.

Most previously reported models for establishing doses to small animals have been stylized and mathematically based. This study establishes dose factors for internal sources in realistic models of a typical mouse and a typical rat, based on image data obtained using a dedicated small-animal CT scanner.METHODS: A transgenic mouse (body mass, 27 g) and a Sprague-Dawley rat (body mass, 248 g) were imaged using the dedicated small-animal CT scanner. Identified organs were segmented using computer tools that Vanderbilt University applies to process human images for 3-dimensional dosimetry. Monte Carlo N-particle transport code (MCNP) input files were prepared from the 3-dimensional, voxel-based image data. Using methods established for human studies, radiation transport calculations of absorbed fractions (AFs) were performed using MCNP, version 4C, on the segmented images, and dose conversion factors for several radionuclides were developed.RESULTS: AFs were established at discrete energies for electron and photon sources assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout approximately 10 source and target regions in both models. Electron self-irradiation AFs were significantly less than 1.0 for many organs, at energies above 0.5 MeV, and significant cross irradiation was observed for high-energy electrons, such as those from (90)Y or (188)Re, in many organs. Calculated dose conversion factors reflected these trends and agreed well with the results of other authors who have undertaken similar investigations.CONCLUSION: The AFs calculated in this study will be useful in determining the dose to organs for mice and rats similar in size to those studied here. The segmented, voxel-based models developed here can be used for external dose calculations as well.
16544984,11,2006,Hum Gene Ther,Insertional mutagenesis at positions 520 and 584 of adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) capsid gene and generation of AAV2 vectors with eliminated heparin- binding ability and introduced novel tropism.,Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are promising in the context of gene therapy because of their ability to mediate efficient gene transfer and stable gene expression. AAV2 uses heparin sulfate as its primary receptor, which is widely expressed on the various tissues and organs. This limits the application of AAV2 in targeting specific tissues. To make an AAV2 vector with modified tropism, we constructed various AAV2 capsid mutants by inserting RGD-4C peptide at position 520 and/or at position 584. Eight mutants were generated, identified, and characterized. Heparin-binding ability was completely abrogated in five mutants, and partially reduced in three mutants. Solid-phase ELISA and gene transduction assays confirmed that the novel tropism is determined by the introduced RGD epitope, which binds to cellular integrin receptor. Our observations suggest that simultaneous modification at both sites, tentatively involved in heparin binding, results in altered tropism and improved transduction efficiency in vitro.
16984814,10,2006,Curr Top Dev Biol,Intracellular targeting of phosphodiesterase-4 underpins compartmentalized cAMP signaling.,The phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) enzyme belongs to a family of cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterases that provide the major means of hydrolyzing and, thereby, inactivating the key intracellular second messenger, cAMP. As such, PDE4s are central to the regulation of many diverse signaling processes that allow cells to respond to external stimuli. Four genes (4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D) encode around 20 distinct isoform members of the PDE4 family. Each isoform is characterized by a unique N-terminal region. PDE4s are multidomain metallohydrolases with each domain serving particular roles allowing them to be targeted to varying regions and organelles of intracellular space and regulated in distinct fashions by phosphorylation and protein-protein interaction. Although identical in catalytic function, each isoform locates to distinct regions within the cell so as to create and manage spatially distinct pools of cAMP. The multiplicity of partners associating with members of the four gene PDE4 family places these enzymes in key regulatory positions, permitting them to channel complex biological signals via fundamental signaling cohorts such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), arrestins, A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs), and tyrosyl family kinases. The cAMP cascade has long been linked to cellular growth and embryogenesis and with this comes the implication that PDE4 may play considerable roles in the regulation of progeny development in maturing cells and tissues.
16984394,10,2006,FEBS J,7,8-Diaminoperlargonic acid aminotransferase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potential therapeutic target. Characterization and inhibition studies.,Diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase (DAPA AT), which is involved in biotin biosynthesis, catalyzes the transamination of 8-amino-7-oxononanoic acid (KAPA) using S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) as amino donor. Mycobacterium tuberculosis DAPA AT, a potential therapeutic target, has been overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity using a single efficient step on a nickel-affinity column. The enzyme shows an electronic absorption spectrum typical of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes and behaves as a homotetramer in solution. The pH profile of the activity at saturation shows a single ionization group with a pK(a) of 8.0, which was attributed to the active-site lysine residue. The enzyme shows a Ping Pong Bi Bi kinetic mechanism with strong substrate inhibition with the following parameters: K(mAdoMet) = 0.78 +/- 0.20 mm, K(mKAPA) = 3.8 +/- 1.0 microm, k(cat) = 1.0 +/- 0.2 min(-1), K(iKAPA) = 14 +/- 2 microm. Amiclenomycin and a new analogue, 4-(4c-aminocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1r-yl)propanol (referred to as compound 1), were shown to be suicide substrates of this enzyme, with the following inactivation parameters: K(i) = 12 +/- 2 microm, k(inact) = 0.35 +/- 0.05 min(-1), and K(i) = 20 +/- 2 microm, k(inact) = 0.56 +/- 0.05 min(-1), for amiclenomycin and compound 1, respectively. The inactivation was irreversible, and the partition ratios were 1.0 and 1.1 for amiclenomycin and compound 1, respectively, which make these inactivators particularly efficient. compound 1 (100 microg.mL(-1)) completely inhibited the growth of an E. coli C268bioA mutant strain transformed with a plasmid expressing the M. tuberculosis bioA gene, coding for DAPA AT. Reversal of the antibiotic effect was observed on the addition of biotin or DAPA. Thus, compound 1 specifically targets DAPA AT in vivo.
16426004,10,2006,Clin Vaccine Immunol,Detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies to Neospora caninum in humans: high seropositivity rates in patients who are infected by human immunodeficiency virus or have neurological disorders.,Considering that little is known about the epidemiology of Neospora caninum infection in humans, particularly in populations with high Toxoplasma gondii infection rates, the present study aimed to investigate the presence of antibodies to N. caninum in T. gondii-seropositive and -seronegative individuals. A total of 256 serum samples divided into four groups (61 samples from human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-positive patients, 50 samples from patients with neurological disorders, 91 samples from newborns, and 54 samples from healthy subjects) were assessed for N. caninum and T. gondii serologies by indirect fluorescent-antibody test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunoblotting (IB). Immunoglobulin G antibodies to N. caninum were predominantly detected in HIV-infected patients (38%) and patients with neurological disorders (18%), while newborns and healthy subjects showed lower seropositivity rates (5% and 6%, respectively). Seropositivity to N. caninum was significantly associated with seropositivity to T. gondii in both HIV-infected patients and patients with neurological disorders. Seroreactivity to N. caninum was confirmed by IB, with positive sera predominantly recognizing the 29-kDa antigen of N. caninum. The results of this study indicate the presence of N. caninum infection or exposure in humans, particularly in HIV-infected patients or patients with neurological disorders, who could have opportunistic and concurrent infections with T. gondii. These findings may bring a new concern for the unstable clinical health of HIV-infected patients and the actual role of N. caninum infection in immunocompromised patients.
17049878,9,2006,Protein Expr Purif,Over-expression in Escherichia coli, purification and characterization of isoform 2 of human FAD synthetase.,FAD synthetase (FADS) (EC 2.7.7.2) is a key enzyme in the metabolic pathway that converts riboflavin into the redox cofactor FAD. The human isoform 2 of FADS (hFADS2), which is the product of FLAD1 gene, was over-expressed in Escherichia coli as a T7-tagged protein and identified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Its molecular mass, calculated by SDS-PAGE, was approx. 55 kDa. The expressed protein accounted for more than 40% of the total protein extracted from the cell culture; 10% of it was recovered in a soluble and nearly pure form by Triton X-100 treatment of the insoluble cell fraction. hFADS2 possesses FADS activity and has a strict requirement for MgCl2, as demonstrated in a spectrophotometric assay. The purified recombinant isoform 2 showed a kcat of 3.6 x 10(-3)s(-1) and exhibited a KM value for FMN of about 0.4 microM. The expression of the hFADS2 isoform opens new perspectives in the structural studies of this enzyme and in the design of antibiotics based on the functional differences between the bacterial and the human enzymes.
16998848,9,2006,Mol Reprod Dev,Transcription profile in mouse four-cell, morula, and blastocyst: Genes implicated in compaction and blastocoel formation.,To gain insight into early embryo development, we utilized microarray technology to compare gene expression profiles in four-cell (4C), morula (MO), and blastocyst (BL) stage embryos. Differences in spot intensities were normalized, and grouped by using Avadis Prophetic software platform (version 3.3, Strand Genomics Ltd.) and categories were based on the PANTHER and gene ontology (GO) classification system. This technique identified 622 of 7,927 genes as being more highly expressed in MO when compared to 4C (P &lt; 0.05); similarly, we identified 654 of 9,299 genes as being more highly expressed in BL than in MO (P &lt; 0.05). Upregulation of genes for cytoskeletal, cell adhesion, and cell junction proteins were identified in the MO as compared to the 4C stage embryos, this means they could be involved in the cell compaction necessary for the development to the MO. Genes thought to be involved in ion channels, membrane traffic, transfer/carrier proteins, and lipid metabolism were also identified as being expressed at a higher level in the BL stage embryos than in the MO. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to confirm differential expression of selected genes. The identification of the genes being expressed in here will provide insight into the complex gene regulatory networks effecting compaction and blastocoel formation.
16721786,9,2006,Int J Cancer,Resistance to apoptosis of HCW-2 cells can be overcome by curcumin- or vincristine-induced mitotic catastrophe.,The term mitotic catastrophe has recently become widely used to describe a form of death affecting many cancer cells, which, because of severe DNA or mitotic spindle damage, are not able to bypass mitosis. We show here that cells of the HL-60-derived HCW-2 line highly resistant to apoptosis, upon treatment with curcumin or vincristine, undergo mitotic catastrophe that is finalized by caspase 3 activation and oligonucleosomal DNA degradation. Curcumin is a natural dye, derived from Curcuma longa that has been shown to induce cell death in many cancer cells. Both treatments decrease cell proliferation and cell survival, arrest cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle and induce morphological changes characterized by cell enlargement and micronucleation. &quot;Catastrophic&quot; cells comprise a separate subpopulation with less than 4C DNA, as evidenced by flow and scanning cytometry. This subpopulation is MPM-2 positive. Thymidine block increased the number of cell arrested in the G2/M phase of cell cycle and curcumin effectiveness as an inducer of mitotic catastrophe. Curcumin, but not vincristine, acts on HCW-2 cells by inhibiting the expression of survivin, a modulator of cell division and apoptosis in cancer. Altogether our results show that apoptosis resistance can be overcome by inducing mitotic catastrophe in HCW-2 cells.
17118964,8,2006,J Cell Sci,PDZRN3 (LNX3, SEMCAP3) is required for the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes.,PDZRN3 contains a RING-finger motif in its N-terminal region, two PDZ domains in its central region and a consensus-binding motif for PDZ domains at its C-terminus. It was identified in silico as a homolog of the protein known as LNX1 or SEMCAP1, which possesses ubiquitin ligase activity and binds the membrane protein Semaphorin 4C. However, PDZRN3 itself has not previously been characterized. We have now evaluated the properties and functions of PDZRN3. The PDZRN3 gene was shown to be expressed in various human tissues including the heart, skeletal muscle and liver and its expression in mouse skeletal muscle was developmentally regulated. Both the differentiation of C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblasts into myotubes and injury-induced muscle regeneration in vivo were found to be accompanied by up-regulation of PDZRN3. The differentiation-associated increase in the expression of PDZRN3 in C2C12 cells follows that of myogenin and precedes that of myosin heavy chain. Depletion of PDZRN3 by RNA interference inhibited the formation of myotubes as well as the associated up-regulation of myosin heavy chain in C2C12 cells. Our data suggest that PDZRN3 plays an essential role in the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes by acting either downstream or independently of myogenin.
16713269,8,2006,Bioorg Med Chem,Anticancer activities of some newly synthesized pyridine, pyrane, and pyrimidine derivatives.,A series of pyridine, pyrane, and pyrimidine derivatives (2-11) were newly synthesized using nitrobenzosuberone 1 as a starting material. The antitumor activities of the synthesized compounds were evaluated utilizing 59 different human tumor cell lines, representing leukemia, melanoma, lung, colon, brain, ovary, breast, prostate as well as kidney. Some of the tested compounds especially 2, 3, 4c, 6, 7, 9b, 10a, and 11 exhibited better in vitro antitumor activities at low concentration (log(10) GI(50) = -4.7) against the used human tumor cell lines. Additionally, compounds 3, 4c, 6, 7, and 9b were highly selective to inhibit leukemia cell lines. The detailed synthesis, spectroscopic data and antitumor properties for the synthesized compounds were reported.
16710344,8,2006,Cancer Gene Ther,Oncolytic adenoviral vector carrying the cytosine deaminase gene for melanoma gene therapy.,We constructed an oncolytic adenoviral vector Ad.HE1HCD3, in which the adenoviral E1A promoter was replaced by a human tyrosinase enhancer (HTE)/promoter. The RGD-4C peptide was inserted into the HI loop of the fiber knob domain to increase the transduction efficiency of this vector for tumor cell lines. We also inserted the prodrug activating cytosine deaminase gene driven by the HTE/promoter into the E3 region of the Ad.HE1HCD3 vector. The in vitro cytotoxic effect of the Ad.HE1HCD3 vector with 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) was greater than that of a wild-type adenovirus or that of the Ad.HE1HCD3 vector alone in tyrosinase-positive melanoma cell lines at low multiplicity of infection. Intratumoral injection of low doses of the Ad.HE1HCD3 vector into xenotransplanted human melanoma cell lines followed by the intraperitoneal injection of 5-FC led to a greater degree of tumor regression in vivo than did the intratumoral injection of the same dose of the Ad.HE1HCD3 vector alone. This oncolytic vector with a melanoma-specific prodrug activation therapeutic transcription unit and a RGD targeted fiber protein offers a potent therapeutic combination for the gene therapy of melanoma.
17143339,7,2006,Acta Biochim Pol,Antitumor effect of RGD-4C-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2 peptide in mouse B16(F10) melanoma model.,Vasculature targeting agents have been tested as cancer therapeutics for the past few years. Such therapy could be accomplished using, for example, bifunctional (two-domain) peptides. RGD-4C-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2, a peptide designed by Ellerby and coworkers (1999) (full sequence: ACDCRGDCFCGGKLAKLAKKLAKLAK), binds selectively to alphaVbeta3 integrin receptors expressed in tumor neovasculature and, after internalization, effectively induces apoptosis of endothelial cells. The aim of this study was to examine if RGD-4C-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2 would efficiently target cells, among them B16(F10), that overexpress alphaVbeta3 receptors, and whether it would be suitable for therapeutic treatment of primary B16(F10) murine melanoma tumors. Thus, the peptide would target two distinct tumor compartments: that formed by endothelium of blood vessels and that made up of neoplastic cells. The therapeutic peptide was recognized and did induce apoptosis in B16(F10) cell line. Tumor growth inhibition was observed following direct intratumoral administration. However, cessation of peptide administration led to rapid tumor growth and death of the animals.
17092626,7,2006,Biochimie,RNA editing has been lost in the mitochondrial cox3 and rps13 mRNAs in Asparagales.,RNA editing in plant mitochondria alters the RNA sequence by converting C-to-U or U-to-C at a specific site. We investigated the requirement for RNA editing in the complete genomic sequences of the gene encoding the cytochrome oxidase subunit III (cox3) and the ribosomal protein S13 (rps13) in 59 closely related species within the Asparagales and Liliales (monocots). To obtain a comprehensive picture of the degree of variation in editing we explored the non-synonymous RNA editing sites within the newly sequenced cox3 and rps13 genes by a comparative phylogenetic approach. RNA editing is predicted to occur in all the surveyed species, but to different extents. Zero to one non-synonymous editing site is inferred in the cox3 mRNA in species from Amaryllidaceae and Iridaceae. No RNA editing of rps13 mRNAs is required in Amaryllidaceae, because all respective genomic sequences resemble the edited version of the mRNAs of other analysed land plants. The observed absence of cox3 and rps13 RNA editing in Iridaceae and Amaryllidaceae and the striking RNA editing reduction of ccb2 in the latter family is likely generated by recombination and reverse transcription mediated events involving edited mitochondrial transcripts.
17023084,7,2006,Virus Res,Complete nucleotide sequence of genotype 4 hepatitis C viruses isolated from patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,The hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 is spreading among southern European intravenous drug users, who are frequently co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Response to interferon (IFN) alpha-based therapies in HIV-1 positive patients co-infected with HCV genotype 4 is poor, similar to that obtained for HCV genotype 1 and much lower than for HCV genotypes 2 and 3. The lack of sequence data related to HCV of genotype 4 prompted us to sequence the complete genome of two genotype 4 variants isolated from two HIV-1 co-infected patients (24 and 25). Our aim was to investigate the evolutionary relationships of the former variants with other genotypes and/or genotype 4 subtypes. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis from genomic regions 5'NC, core-E1 and NS5B revealed that the variants isolated from patients 24 and 25 (both subtyped 4c/4d by INNO-LIPA II HCV) belong to subtypes 4d and 4a, respectively. When looking at the complete genome sequence one of the variants showed a new genotype 4 subtype. Interestingly, sequence length differences in the interferon sensitivity determining region coding regions were observed when compared with sequences from other genotypes. Similarly, when the catalytic efficiency of the NS3/4 protease from patients 24 and 25 samples were determined, they displayed 70.6+/-7.7 and 23.5+/-3.4%, respectively, of the activity shown by genotype 1 NS3/4 proteases. Overall, pairwise comparison and phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of the complete genome or the different protein-encoding regions showed that genotype 4 sequences were more closely related to genotype 1 sequences. The description of new HCV genome variants may help our understanding of the HCV biology as well as the role of different genotypes in HCV treatment and therapy response.
16441059,7,2006,J Nat Prod,Isolation and structural modification of 7-deoxynarciclasine and 7-deoxy-trans-dihydronarciclasine.,As an extension of structure-activity relationship studies of pancratistatin (1), various techniques were first evaluated for separating the mixtures of 7-deoxynarciclasine (2b) and 7-deoxy-trans-dihydronarciclasine (3a) isolated from Hymenocallis littoralis. An efficient solution for that otherwise difficult separation then allowed the lactam carbonyl group of protected (4c and 5c) alcohols 2b and 3a to be reduced employing lithium aluminum hydride. Cleavage (TBAF followed by H2SO4) of the silyl ester/acetonide protected 6a gave amine 8. X-ray crystal structure determinations were employed to confirm the structures of 3,4-acetonide-5-aza-6-deoxynarciclasine (6b), 5-aza-6-deoxynarciclasine (8a), and 5-aza-6-deoxy-trans-dihydronarciclasine (9a, 9b). Against the murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia and a panel of human cancer cell lines, the parent natural products, 7-deoxynarciclasine (2b) and 7-deoxy-trans-dihydronarciclasine (3a), were found to generally be more cancer cell growth inhibitory (GI50 0.1 to &lt;0.01 microg/mL) than the compounds with structural modifications such as amine 8 by a factor of 10 or more. The trans ring juncture of isocarbostyril 3a proved to be an important modification of narciclasine (2a) for improving cancer cell growth inhibition in this series.
16388531,7,2006,Arthritis Rheum,Collagen and proteoglycan turnover in focally damaged human ankle cartilage: evidence for a generalized response and active matrix remodeling across the entire joint surface.,OBJECTIVE: Although cartilage lesions occur in the ankles, osteoarthritis rarely develops in the ankles, suggesting that ankle cartilage can up-regulate mechanisms to repair the damaged matrix. To define these processes, we compared cartilage samples obtained from normal tali and from lesional sites of damaged tali.METHODS: Cartilage samples were obtained from the tali of normal ankles and from 3 sites on tali with lesions (the lesion, adjacent to the lesion, and far removed from the lesion). Cartilage was analyzed for type II collagen (CII) messenger RNA, C-terminal type II procollagen propeptide (CPII), the collagenase cleavage neoepitope (Col2-3/4C(short)), and the denaturation epitope (Col2-3/4m). For the assessment of type IX collagen, the COL2 and NC4 domains were evaluated. The cartilage samples were also assayed for glycosaminoglycans, epitope 846 of aggrecan, and DNA.RESULTS: The DNA content, epitope 846, COL2(IX), and the denaturation epitope were significantly increased in lesional cartilage. Although there was a tendency toward an increase in CII content and CPII, the increase did not reach significance. Neither the NC4(IX) domain nor Col2-3/4C was elevated. Surprisingly, changes in cartilage both adjacent to and remote from the lesion were similar to those in the lesion.CONCLUSION: The changes observed in cartilage obtained from the lesion and from sites adjacent to the lesion were not surprising; however, the changes in cartilage obtained from sites remote from the lesion were unexpected. This up-regulation of matrix turnover in ankles with degenerative lesions may indicate a physiologic response of the entire articular surface to repair the damaged matrix, which is not restricted to the lesion site. This suggests that there may be some mechanism of communication across the cartilage. The response by ankle cartilage obtained from a site remote from the lesion has not been observed in the knee.
17016529,6,2006,Can J Ophthalmol,Ocular integration in the human visual cortex.,Human striate cortex contains an orderly map of the contralateral visual field, which is distorted to make a disproportionate amount of tissue available for the representation of the macula. Engrafted on the retinotopic map is a system of alternating inputs known as ocular dominance columns. These columns consist of interleaved bands of geniculocortical afferents in layer 4C serving either the right eye or the left eye. They can be revealed in humans with a history of prior visual loss in one eye by processing striate cortex for cytochrome oxidase at autopsy. Because their geniculate input is segregated, cells within ocular dominance columns in layer 4C respond to stimulation of one eye only. These monocular cells converge onto binocular cells in other layers, integrating signals from the two eyes. The columns in humans appear similar to those found in many primate species, including the macaque. In the squirrel monkey, however, the occurrence of ocular dominance columns is highly variable. Some squirrel monkeys lack columns, yet they seem to have no impairment of visual function. In animals with weakly expressed columns, one can detect a cortical pattern of metabolic activity corresponding to retinal blood vessels. It appears because visual deprivation from shadows cast by blood vessels induces remodeling of geniculocortical afferents, in a manner akin to the shrinkage of ocular dominance columns from congenital cataract. Although the function of ocular dominance columns is unknown, their metabolism is altered in strabismus, suggesting a role in visual suppression.
16948124,6,2006,Cancer,Noninvasive imaging for evaluation of the systemic delivery of capsid-modified adenoviruses in an orthotopic model of advanced lung cancer.,BACKGROUND: Variable expression of the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) has limited gene transfer efficacy to many types of tumors. Consequently, tropism-modified adenoviruses have been developed for enhanced infectivity. To the authors' knowledge, targeting approaches for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not been comprehensively evaluated. The current hypothesis was that modified adenoviruses could be used for increasing gene transfer to and killing of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo.METHODS: Ten NSCLC cell lines were analyzed to represent the different NSCLC histologies. Because clinical tumors may differ from established cell lines, 6 clinical specimens fresh from patients were analyzed. For in vivo studies, a novel orthotopic murine model of advanced lung cancer was developed. Because tumor response is difficult to quantitate in orthotopic models, noninvasive imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was utilized as a surrogate for tumor size measurements.RESULTS: Adenoviruses whose capsids were modified with RGD-4C, the serotype 3 knob, or polylysine displayed increased gene transfer to NSCLC cell lines and clinical samples in comparison to serotype 5 viruses. Conditionally replicating oncolytic adenoviruses (CRAds) with the same modifications showed enhanced therapeutic efficiency in vitro and in vivo. The median survival of mice treated with Ad5.pK7-Delta24 or Ad5-Delta24RGD increased 37% (P&lt;.01). GFP imaging allowed noninvasive individualized detection of response and recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: Targeting of adenovirus to heterologous receptors can improve killing of NSCLC cells. Utilization of clinical samples and an orthotopic model of advanced lung cancer may provide clinically relevant translational data.
16855115,6,2006,J Neurophysiol,Monocular cells without ocular dominance columns.,In many regions of the mammalian cerebral cortex, cells that share a common receptive field property are grouped into columns. Despite intensive study, the function of the cortical column remains unknown. In the squirrel monkey, the expression of ocular dominance columns is variable, with columns present in some animals and not in others. By searching for differences between animals with and without columns, it should be possible to infer how columns contribute to visual processing. Single-cell recordings outside layer 4C were made in nine squirrel monkeys, followed by labeling of ocular dominance columns in layer 4C. In the squirrel monkey, compared with the macaque, cells outside layer 4C were more likely to respond to stimulation of either eye whether ocular dominance columns were present or not. In three animals lacking ocular dominance columns, single cells were recorded from layer 4C. Remarkably, 20% of cells in layer 4C were monocular despite the absence of columns. This observation means that ocular dominance columns are not necessary for monocular cells to occur in striate cortex. In macaques each row of cytochrome oxidase (CO) patches is aligned with an ocular dominance column and receives koniocellular input serving one eye only. In squirrel monkeys this was not true: CO patches and ocular dominance columns had no spatial correlation and the koniocellular input to CO patches was binocular. Thus even when ocular dominance columns occur in the squirrel monkey, they do not transform the functional architecture to resemble that of the macaque.
16697988,6,2006,Carbohydr Res,Synthesis of multivalent lactose derivatives by 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions: selective galectin-1 inhibition.,Acetylene derivatives of phenylalanine, phenethylamine and the multifunctional unnatural amino acids, phenyl-bis-alanine and phenyl-tris-alanine, were synthesized and functionalized with 2-azidoethyl beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1--&gt;4)-beta-D-glucopyranoside via regioselective copper(I)-mediated 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to give a panel of mono-, di- and trivalent lactoside derivatives. Evaluation of the compounds as inhibitors against the tumour- and inflammation-related galectin-1, -3, -4N, -4C, -4, -7, -8N and -9N revealed a divalent compound with a Kd value as low as 3.2 microM for galectin-1, which corresponded to a relative potency of 30 per lactose unit as compared to the natural disaccharide ligand lactose. This divalent compound had at least one order of magnitude higher affinity for galectin-1 than for any of the other galectins investigated.
16510583,6,2006,Cancer Res,Antiangiogenic therapy decreases integrin expression in normalized tumor blood vessels.,Tumor blood vessels normalized by antiangiogenic therapy may provide improved delivery of chemotherapeutic agents during a window of time but it is unknown how protein expression in tumor vascular endothelial cells changes. We evaluated the distribution of RGD-4C phage, which binds alpha(v)beta(3), alpha(v)beta(5), and alpha(5)beta(1) integrins on tumor blood vessels before and after antiangiogenic therapy. Unlike the control phage, fd-tet, RGD-4C phage homed to vascular endothelial cells in spontaneous tumors in RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice in a dose-dependent fashion. The distribution of phage was similar to alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(5)beta(1) integrin expression. Blood vessels that survived treatment with AG-013736, a small molecule inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, had only 4% as much binding of RGD-4C phage compared with vessels in untreated tumors. Cellular distribution of RGD-4C phage in surviving tumor vessels matched the alpha(5)beta(1) integrin expression. The reduction in integrin expression on tumor vessels after antiangiogenic therapy raises the possibility that integrin-targeted delivery of diagnostics or therapeutics may be compromised. Efficacious delivery of drugs may benefit from identification by in vivo phage display of targeting peptides that bind to tumor blood vessels normalized by antiangiogenic agents.
17055964,5,2006,Microbes Infect,An opposite role is exerted by the acarian Myocoptes musculinus in the outcome of Toxoplasma gondii infection according to the route of the protozoa inoculation.,Infection with Toxoplasma gondii leads to a Th1 immune response. Alternatively, the acarian Myocoptes musculinus induces a disease in BALB/c mice that involves Th2 immune mechanisms. In this study, we investigated whether infestation by M. musculinus induces Th2 immune response in C57BL/6 mice and if this response influences the T. gondii-induced Th1 response when mice are inoculated by intraperitoneal or oral route. The animals were infected with M. musculinus and one month later with T. gondii ME-49 strain and the survival and immune response were monitored. The co-infected animals displayed higher mortality rate and the spleen cells showed a decreased IFN-gamma and elevated IL-4 and IL-5 production. These changes were associated with severe pneumonia and wasting condition. On the other hand, when mice were orally infected with 100 T. gondii cysts, co-infection prolonged the survival rates and ameliorated intestinal lesions in association with a significant drop in IFN-gamma levels in sera. These results indicate the interference of Th2 response induced by M. musculinus in a T. gondii-induced Th1 response. Altogether, these data demonstrate the profound interactions between the immune response induced against unrelated organisms T. gondii and M. musculinus, and suggest that this type of interactions may impact clinical disease.
16998884,5,2006,J Med Virol,High prevalence of hepatitis C virus subtypes 4c and 4d in Malaga (Spain): phylogenetic and epidemiological analyses.,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major aetiological agent of chronic hepatitis and it may lead to the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV has been classified into six clades as a result of high genetic variability. A commercial procedure to genotype HCV in 678 patients from Carlos Haya Regional University Hospital, Malaga was used to study the distribution of HCV genotypes in Malaga, southern Spain. A high prevalence of HCV-4 (10.2%) was found. This genotype is found more commonly in Egypt, Central Africa and the Middle East. The distribution of the different subtypes in the 69 patients with HCV-4 was as follows: 4.3% subtype 4e, 7.2% subtype 4a, 11.5% not subtypable, and 76.8% subtype 4c/4d. Of the 53 4c/4d patients, 69% were intravenous drug users and 31% non-intravenous drug users. In order to characterise further the HCV-4c/4d patients, sequences of the non-structural 5B gene (393 bp) were obtained from 36 HCV-4c/4d-infected untreated patients. Phylogenetic tree topologies distinguished clearly the two subtypes: 11 patients were infected by subtype 4c and 25 by 4d. This phylogenetic analysis, reinforced by the epidemiological characteristics, suggests the extension of the HCV-4c and -4d subtypes in the area of Malaga among both intravenous drug users and non-intravenous drug users.
16930510,5,2006,Reprod Fertil Dev,Transcription profile during maternal to zygotic transition in the mouse embryo.,To gain insight into early embryo development, we used microarray technology to compare gene expression profiles in metaphase II oocytes and one- (1C), two- (2C) and four-cell (4C) embryos. Differences in spot intensities were normalised and grouped using Avadis Prophetic software platform (version 3.3; Strand Genomics, Bangalore, India) and categories were based on the PANTHER and Gene Ontology classification systems. We examined 6927 genes and identified those preferentially expressed in 1C or 2C embryos. We found 1261 genes that were more highly expressed (P &lt; 0.05) in 1C compared with 2C embryos and 1480 genes showing enhanced expression in 2C embryos. Similarly, we investigated 6581 genes present in 2C and 4C embryos and identified 841 that are expressed to a greater extent at the 2C stage and 905 that are more highly expressed at the 4C stage. Using PANTHER classification, genes that were upregulated and downregulated in 2C embryos compared with 1C and 4C embryos were grouped according to their protein functions, which included developmental processes, electron transport, lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, protein metabolism and modification, signal transduction and transport, among others. Real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to confirm differential expression of 14 selected genes. The identification of the genes being expressed will provide insight into the complex gene regulatory networks affecting zygotic genome activation and further development.
16909243,5,2006,Pediatr Nephrol,WT1 mutations in nephrotic syndrome revisited. High prevalence in young girls, associations and renal phenotypes.,WT1 mutations have been considered a rare cause of nephrotic syndrome but recent reports challenge this assumption. Exclusion of inherited forms is a basic point in any therapeutic strategy to nephrotic syndrome since they do not respond to drugs. We screened for WT1 mutations in 200 patients with nephrotic syndrome: 114 with steroid resistance (SRNS) and 86 with steroid dependence (SDNS) for whom other inherited forms of nephrotic syndrome (NPHS2, CD2AP) had been previously excluded. Three girls out of 32 of the group with steroid resistance under 18 years presented classical WT1 splice mutations (IVS9+5G&gt;A, IVS9+4C&gt;T) of Frasier syndrome. Another one presented a mutation coding for an amino acid change (D396N) at exon 9 that is typical of Denys-Drash syndrome. All presented resistance to drugs and developed end stage renal failure within 15 years. Two girls of the Frasier group presented a 46 XY karyotype with streak gonads while one was XX and had normal gonad morphology. In the two cases with IVS9+5G&gt;A renal pathology was characterized by capillary wall thickening with deposition of IgG and C3 in one that was interpreted as a membrane pathology. Foam cells were diffuse in tubule-interstitial areas. In conclusion, WT1 splice mutations are not rare in females under 18 years with SRNS. This occurs in absence of a clear renal pathology picture and frequently in absence of phenotype change typical of Frasier syndrome. In adults and children with SDNS, screening analysis is of no clinical value. WT1 hot spot mutation analysis should be routinely done in children with SRNS; if the molecular screening anticipates any further therapeutic approach it may modify the long term therapeutic strategy.
16677001,5,2006,J Comb Chem,Strategy for discovering chemical inhibitors of human cyclophilin a: focused library design, virtual screening, chemical synthesis and bioassay.,The discovery of cyclophilin A (CypA) inhibitor is now of special interest in the treatment of immunological disorders. In this work, using a strategy integrating focused combinatorial library design, virtual screening, chemical synthesis, and bioassay, a series of novel small molecular CypA inhibitors have been discovered. First, using the fragments taken from our previously discovered CypA inhibitors (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006, 14, 2209-2224) as building blocks, we designed a focused combinatorial library containing 255 molecules employing the LD1.0 program (J. Comb. Chem. 2005, 7, 398-406) developed by us. Sixteen compounds (1a-e, 2a-b, 3a-b, and 4a-g) were selected by using virtual screening against the X-ray crystal structure of CypA as well as druglike analysis for further synthesis and bioassay. All these sixteen molecules are CypA binders with binding affinities (K(D) values) ranging from 0.076 to 41.0 microM, and five of them (4a, 4c, and 4e-g) are potent CypA inhibitors with PPIase inhibitory activities (IC(50) values) of 0.25-6.43 microM. The hit rates for binders and inhibitors are as high as 100% and 31.25%, respectively. Remarkably, both the binding affinity and inhibitory activity of the most potent compound increase approximately 10 times than that of the most active compound discovered previously. The high hit rate and the high potency of the new CypA inhibitors demonstrated the efficiency of the strategy for focused library design and screening. In addition, the novel chemical entities reported in this study could be leads for discovering new therapies against the CypA pathway.
17112981,4,2006,J Am Coll Cardiol,In vivo analysis of the anatomical relationship of coronary sinus to mitral annulus and left circumflex coronary artery using cardiac multidetector computed tomography: implications for percutaneous coronary sinus mitral annuloplasty.,OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the in vivo anatomical relationships between mitral annulus (MA) and coronary sinus (CS) as well as CS and left circumflex coronary artery using cardiac computed tomography.BACKGROUND: Percutaneous treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR) by annuloplasty via CS is under development. Success of such treatment depends on the close anatomical proximity of the MA to the CS. The in vivo data regarding this anatomical relationship in humans are scant. We investigated this relationship using contrast multidetector computed tomography.METHODS: We studied 25 normal individuals and 11 patients with severe MR (3 to 4+) due to mitral valve prolapse. Separation between MA and CS was measured in standard planes, in 4-chamber (4C), 2-chamber (2C), and 3-chamber views. Distance from ostium of CS to the intersection with left circumflex (LCX), and anatomical relation of LCX and CS were determined using 3-dimensional mapping (Philips Brilliance, Philips Medical Systems, Amsterdam, the Netherlands).RESULTS: There was significant variance of CS to MA separation at all planes. Separation of CS and MA was increased in lateral location (4C) and decreased in posterior location (2C) in the MR group with increase in MA size. Left circumflex artery crossed between CS and MA in 80% of patients. The LCX crossed CS at a variable distance from the ostium of CS (86.5 +/- 21 mm, range 37 to 123 mm)CONCLUSIONS: There is significant variability in the relation of CS to MA in humans. Coronary sinus to MA distance increases in patients with severe MR and annular dilation, mainly in the posterolateral location. The left circumflex crosses under the CS the majority of times, but with a significant variability in the location where it crosses the CS. These anatomical features should be taken into consideration while selecting percutaneous treatment strategies for mitral valve repair.
17112668,4,2006,Vet Parasitol,Prevalence of Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. in dogs from different living conditions in Uberlândia, Brazil.,Infection rates with Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. were compared among dogs living under different conditions. Stool samples (n = 433) collected from dogs of different ages, gender, living conditions and origin were analyzed using three techniques, i.e., centrifugal flotation in zinc sulfate solution, centrifugal flotation in sucrose solution, and methylene blue gram safranin staining. Eighty-nine of the samples were from stay dogs living in shelters run by animal protection societies, 199 were from kennels and 122 from households. A total of 119 (29.0%) had G. duodenalis cysts and six (1.4%) were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts. Dogs from kennels were most frequently affected by G. duodenalis (49.7%) while those from shelters showed a higher prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. (2.2%). A significant difference (p &lt; or = 0.05) was observed between immature dogs and adults only with respect to Giardia infection. There was no significant difference between the gender with regard to the presence of either protozoan.
16881038,4,2006,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis and in vitro-anticancer and antimicrobial evaluation of some novel quinoxalines derived from 3-phenylquinoxaline-2(1H)-thione.,Two novel series derived from 3-phenylquinoxaline-2(1H)-thione 2 and 2-(hydrazinocarbonylmethylthio)-3-phenylquinoxaline 6 have been synthesized. Eight out of twenty six new compounds were selected at the National Cancer Institute for evaluation of their in vitro-anticancer activity. Among them, compounds 3b, 3c, 4b, and 4c displayed moderate to strong growth inhibition activity against most of the tested sub-panel tumor cell lines with GI(50) 10(-5) to 10(-6 )molar concentrations. Compound 4b exhibited a significant value of percent tumor growth inhibition against breast cancer at concentration &lt; 10(-8) M. Compound 4c showed moderate selectivity towards leukemia cell lines with GI(50) of 1.8 to 3.8 microM (selectivity ratio = 5.7). Preliminary antimicrobial testing revealed that compounds 7a, 7b, 8a, 11a, and 11b were as active as ampicillin against B. subtilis (MIC = 12.5 microg/mL). Compounds 7b and 8a were also nearly as active as ampicillin against E. coli (MIC = 12.5 microg/mL). In addition, compounds 4a, 7b, 10b, and 11a were as active as ampicillin against P. aerugenosa (MIC = 50 microg/mL). However, compounds 7b, 8a, and 10b showed mild activity against C. albicans (MIC = 50 microg/mL). The values of minimum bactericidal concentrations indicated that compounds 4a and 7b were bactericidal against B. subtilis and P. aerugenosa, respectively, while compound 10b was bactericidal against both organisms. However, compound 11a was bactericidal against E. coli, P. aerugenosa, and S. aureus.
16616141,4,2006,FEBS Lett,Evidence that low doses of Taxol enhance the functional transactivatory properties of p53 on p21 waf promoter in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.,In the present study, we evidence how in breast cancer cells low doses of Taxol for 18 h determined the upregulation of p53 and p21 waf expression concomitantly with a decrease of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. P53 and its gene product, the mdm2 protein, in treated cells exhibits a prevalent nuclear compartmentalization, thus potentiating p53 transactivatory properties. Indeed, the most important finding of this study consists with the evidence that Taxol at lower concentrations is able to produce the activation of p21 promoter via p53. Prolonged exposure of MCF-7 cells to Taxol (48 h) resulted in an increased co-association between p21 and PCNA compared to control and this well fits with the simultaneous block of cell cycle into the G2/M phase.
16520877,4,2006,Protoplasma,Colchicine-induced polyploidization depends on tubulin polymerization in c-metaphase cells.,The microtubule cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in the cell cycle and in mitosis. Colchicine is a microtubule-depolymerizing agent that has long been used to induce chromosome individualization in cells arrested at metaphase and also in the induction of polyploid plants. Although attempts have been made to explain the processes and mechanisms underlying polyploidy induction, the role of the cytoskeleton still remains largely unknown. Through immunodetection of alpha-tubulin, different concentrations (0.5 or 5 mM) of colchicine were found to produce opposite effects in the organization of the cytoskeleton in rye (Secale cereale L.). A low concentration (0.5 mM) induced depolymerization of the microtubular cytoskeleton in all phases of the cell cycle. In contrast, a high concentration (5 mM) was found to induce the polymerization of new tubulin-containing structures in c-metaphase cells. Furthermore, both treatments also showed contrasting effects in the induction of polyploid cells. Flow cytometric analysis and quantitative assessments of nucleolus-organizing regions revealed that only the high-concentration colchicine treatment was effective in the formation of polyploid cells. Our studies indicate that spindle disruption alone is insufficient for the induction of polyploid cells. The absence of any tubulin structures in plants treated with colchicine at the low concentration induced cell anomalies, such as the occurrence of nuclei with irregular shape and/or (additional) micronuclei, 12 h after recovery, pointing to a direct effect on cell viability. In contrast, the almost insignificant level of cell anomalies in the high-concentration treatment suggests that the presence of new tubulin-containing structures allows the reconstitution of 4C nuclei and their progression into the cell cycle.
16406612,4,2006,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis, X-ray crystallographic analysis, and antitumor activity of N-(benzothiazole-2-yl)-1-(fluorophenyl)-O,O-dialkyl-alpha-aminophosphonates.,Alpha-aminophosphonates containing benzothiazole and fluorine moiety, 4a-4m, were synthesized by Mannich-type addition in ionic liquid media with high yield and short reaction time. Their structures were established by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, and elemental analysis. The X-ray crystallographic data of compounds 4j and 4m were provided. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anticancer activities against PC3, A431, A375, and Bcap37 cells in vitro by the MTT method. Compound 4c is highly effective against PC3 cells and moderate to A431 cells. Hence, further study is necessary to find out the potential antitumor activities.
17164107,3,2006,Med Clin North Am,Adjuvant analgesics.,Chronic pain, whether arising from viscera, bone, or any other tissue or structure, is, more often than commonly thought, the result of a mixture of pain mechanisms, and therefore there is no simple formula available to manage chronic complex pain states. Box 1 summarizes a pharmacological algorithm for difficult-to-treat chronic pain, which merely introduces the medication aspect of the treatment. In effect, any comprehensive algorithm should call for an interdisciplinary approach that would include rehabilitation, as well as psychosocial, and when indicated, interventional techniques. Box 1 Analgesic algorithm for difficult-to-treat pain syndromes. Pharmacological Interventions. Moderate to severe pain/functional impairment; pain with a score of &gt;4 on the brief pain inventory. 1. Gabapentinoid (gabapentin, pregabalin)+/-Opioid/opioid rotation or 2. Antidepressant (TCA, duloxetine, venlafaxine)+/-Opioid/opioid rotation or 3. Gabapentinoid+antidepressant+Opioid/opioid rotation; in addition, may consider trials of one or more of the following adjuvants when clinically appropriate: Topical therapies for cutaneous allodynia/hyperalgesia. Anti-inflammatory drugs (corticosteroids for acute inflammatory neuropathic pain)IV bisphosphonates for cancer bone pain or CRPS/RSDNon-gabapentinoid AEDs such as carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine or lamotrigine+/-baclofen for intermittent lancinating pain due to cranial neuralgiasNMDA antagonists Mexiletine On a compassionate basis, according to the patient's clinical condition and pain mechanism, the physician may want to consider an empirical trial of one or more of the emergent topical, oral or parenteral/intrathecal therapies as discussed in the text. If SMP, consider topical clonidine and sympatholytic interventions; if clinically feasible, trials of topical therapies, eg, lidocaine 5% patch, may be considered for a variety of pain states and features.The major rationale for introducing adjuvants is to better balance efficacy and adverse effects. The following scenarios should prompt the use of adjuvants in clinical practice: The toxic limit of a primary analgesic has been reached. The therapeutic benefit of a primary analgesic has plateaued, eg, treatment has reached its true efficacy limit or pharmachodynamic tolerance has developed. The primary analgesic is contraindicated, eg, substance abuse, aberrant behavior, organ failure, allergy, and so forth. Subjective and qualitative symptoms demand broader coverage. Patients often convey that different medications will impart distinct analgesic benefits. Presence of disabling nonpainful complaints and need to manage symptoms such as insomnia, depression, anxiety, and fatigue that all cause worsening of the patient's quality of life and function. Physicians have also been drawn to the adjuvants secondary to new realities of clinical practice. Moreover, aversion to addiction and diversion remains a potent force that shapes prescribing profiles.
17163352,3,2006,Horm Metab Res,Alteration of adipocyte metabolism in omega3 fatty acid-depleted rats.,Presently an insufficient supply of long-chain polyunsaturated omega3 fatty acid is prevalent in Western populations leading to potential metabolic consequences. Based on this fact, this study deals mainly with various aspects of lipid metabolism in second generation female omega3-depleted rats. The parametrial fat and body weights were higher in omega3-depleted than control animals. This coincided with liver steatosis but did not alter heart triglyceride/phospholipid ratio. The net uptake of [U-14C] palmitate by adipocytes was also higher in omega3-depleted rats than in control animals. The uptake of D-[U- 4C] glucose or [1,2 (-14)C] acetate by adipocytes was lower, however in omega3-depleted than control animals and was unaffected by insulin in the former as distinct from latter animals. Despite comparable basal lipolysis, the increase in glycerol output from adipocytes provoked by theophylline was higher in omega3-depleted than control rats. The fatty acid pattern of lipids in adipose tissue was characterized in the omega3-depleted rats by a much lower omega3 content, higher apparent Delta 9-saturase and elongase activities, lower efficiency for the conversion of C18:2omega6 to C20:4omega6 and higher efficiency for the conversion of C18:3omega3 to C20:5omega3. These features were compared to those prevailing in liver and plasma lipids. The present study thus extends knowledge on the alteration of lipid metabolism resulting from a deficiency in long-chain polyunsaturated omega3 fatty acids.
17136038,3,2006,Eur J Clin Nutr,Influence of methods used in body composition analysis on the prediction of resting energy expenditure.,OBJECTIVE: There are considerable differences in published prediction algorithms for resting energy expenditure (REE) based on fat-free mass (FFM). The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the methodology of body composition analysis on the prediction of REE from FFM.DESIGN: In a cross-sectional design measurements of REE and body composition were performed.SUBJECTS: The study population consisted of 50 men (age 37.1+/-15.1 years, body mass index (BMI) 25.9+/-4.1 kg/m2) and 54 women (age 35.3+/-15.4 years, BMI 25.5+/-4.4 kg/m2).INTERVENTIONS: REE was measured by indirect calorimetry and predicted by either FFM or body weight. Measurement of FFM was performed by methods based on a 2-compartment (2C)-model: skinfold (SF)-measurement, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and deuterium oxide dilution (D2O). A 4-compartment (4C)-model was used as a reference.RESULTS: When compared with the 4C-model, REE prediction from FFM obtained from the 2C methods were not significantly different. Intercepts of the regression equations of REE prediction by FFM differed from 1231 (FFM(ADP)) to 1645 kJ/24 h (FFM(SF)) and the slopes ranged between 100.3 kJ (FFM(SF)) and 108.1 kJ/FFM (kg) (FFM(ADP)). In a normal range of FFM, REE predicted from FFM by different methods showed only small differences. The variance in REE explained by FFM varied from 69% (FFM(BIA)) to 75% (FFM(DXA)) and was only 46% for body weight.CONCLUSION: Differences in slopes and intercepts of the regression lines between REE and FFM depended on the methods used for body composition analysis. However, the differences in prediction of REE are small and do not explain the large differences in the results obtained from published FFM-based REE prediction equations and therefore imply a population- and/or investigator specificity of algorithms for REE prediction.
17101724,3,2006,J Histochem Cytochem,Embedding of bone samples in methylmethacrylate: a suitable method for tracking LacZ mesenchymal stem cells in skeletal tissues.,Considerable research has been focused on the use of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for the repair of non-unions and bone defects. To date, the question of whether transplanted MSCs survive and engraft within newly formed tissue remains unresolved. The development of an easy and reliable method that would allow cell fate monitoring in transplant recipients is a pressing concern for the field of tissue engineering. To demonstrate the presence of transplanted cells in newly formed bone, we established a xenograft nude rat model allowing the detection of murine LacZ MSCs in vivo. MSCs were isolated from transgenic lacZ mice, seeded onto bioabsorbable collagen sponges, and transplanted to repair a calvarial defect in nude rats. As a preliminary step, the histological procedure was adapted to optimize the detection of LacZ cells in bone tissue embedded in methylmethacrylate (MMA). Four fixatives and four fixation times were evaluated. Among all the fixatives tested, 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde at 4C for 4 days gave the best results for X-gal staining at pH 7.4 on both cell cultures and bone explants. All fixatives were effective for immunodetection of beta-gal. In the chimeric LacZ/nude rat animal model, MSCs were detected in vivo for up to 4 weeks after implantation and contributed to the repair and the neovascularization of the bone defect. LacZ is a suitable phenotypic marker to track MSCs in skeletal tissues embedded in MMA.
16973459,3,2006,Med Teach,Design of integrated practice for learning professional competences.,To acquire professional competences that entail performance of complex skills, an authentic learning environment is required focused on the integration of all aspects of competences. However, most educational programmes offer separate building blocks, such as separate modules for knowledge and skills. Students accumulate what they have learned in these modules as they progress through the curriculum. In this paper the authors advocate the Four-Component Instructional Design model (4C/ID), which offers a whole-task approach to course design for programmes in which students learn complex skills. The four core components of this approach are: learning tasks, supportive information, just-in-time information and part-task practice. A concrete example from medical education will be presented to clarify both the general ideas behind this approach and the differences between the whole-task approach and conventional educational designs.
21727556,3,2006,Nanotechnology,Aqueous nickel-nitrilotriacetate modified Fe(3)O(4)-NH(3)(+) nanoparticles for protein purification and cell targeting.,A comprehensive totally aqueous phase synthesis of nickel-nitrilotriacetate (Ni-NTA) modified superparamagnetic Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles is presented. The Fe(3)O(4)-NTA-Ni nanoparticles are able to perform efficient and specific purification of 6-His tagged proteins from crude cell lysates, as evidenced by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis. The average binding capacity, as demonstrated by streptopain (M(W) 42 kDa), is 0.23 mg/mg (protein/Fe(3)O(4)-NTA-Ni). Considering the high affinity and specificity of the binding between hexahistidine motif and Ni-NTA, Ni-NTA modified nanoparticles could act as a module to carry 6-His tagged proteins on the particle surface with molecular orientation control, since only the 6-His domain could be attached. These modularly designed functional nanoparticles enhance cancer cell targeting, as supported by the in vitro receptor mediated targeting assay using RGD-4C-6-His fusion peptide. The nanoparticles show no significant hemolysis for human blood and could be investigated further for their in vivo functional imaging applications.
16794870,3,2006,J Fluoresc,Quenchers induce wavelength dependence on protein fluorescence lifetimes.,We have analysed the picosecond resolved fluorescence emission decay of horseradish peroxidase A2 and of HEW lysozyme acquired with a streak camera. Analyses of the fluorescence decay data of both proteins revealed that the dynamics of the decay is dependent on the emission wavelength. Our data strongly indicates that resonance energy transfer occurring between aromatic residues and different protein fluorescence quencher groups, and the nature of the quencher groups, are the causes of the observed wavelength dependent mean lifetime distribution. Using the global analysis data to calculate the fluorescence mean lifetime at each wavelength revealed that for lysozyme, the mean fluorescence lifetime increased with observation wavelength, whereas the opposite was the case for peroxidase. Both proteins contain strong fluorescence quencher groups located in close spatial proximity to the protein's aromatic residues. Lysozyme contains disulfide bridges as the main fluorescence quencher whereas peroxidase contains a heme group. Both for lysozyme and horseradish peroxidase there is a clear correlation between the observed fluorescence mean lifetime of the protein at a particular emission wavelength and the respective quencher's extinction coefficient at the respective wavelength. Furthermore, our study also reports a comparison of the analyses of the fluorescence data done with three different methods. Analyses of the fluorescence decay at 10 different fluorescence emission wavelengths revealed significant differences in both fluorescence lifetimes and the pre-exponential factor distributions. Such values differed from the values recovered from the integrated decay curves and from global analyse.
16780544,3,2006,Am J Transplant,Posttransplant recurrence of proteinuria in a case of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis associated with WT1 mutation.,Posttransplant recurrence of inherited focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is still an enigma owing to the evident paradox of the molecular origin of proteinuria. A young girl with FSGS for WT1 mutation (IVS9+4C&gt;T) and Frasier syndrome received a renal transplant at the age of 11 years. After an initial good outcome with recovery of renal function, proteinuria re-appeared after 7 days and steadily increased up to a nephrotic range. Determination of plasma permeability activity showed concomitant high Palb (0.7). At this point, plasmapheresis was started and after nine cycles with 1500 mL exchange and albumin re-infusion, proteinuria decreased to normal range and is still normal after 3 years. This is the first description of posttransplant recurrence of proteinuria in Frasier syndrome that should be included in potential outcome of renal transplant in this category of patients. This observation confirms the concept that recurrence of proteinuria may occur in inherited forms of FSGS so far reported only for patients carrying NPHS2 mutations and reinforces the idea on multifactorial origin of the disease.
16736253,3,2006,Protoplasma,Chromosome endoreduplication as a factor of salt adaptation in Sorghum bicolor.,Nuclear DNA amounts were measured by Feulgen cytophotometry in Sorghum bicolor cv. 610 plants early exposed to 150 mM NaCl, a treatment known to induce an increased tolerance to salinity in plants carrying this genotype. In salt-treated plants, the percentages of 8C, 16C, and 32C nuclei in roots in the primary state of growth were 21.9%, 13.3%, and 4.3%, respectively. By contrast, in nonsalinized plants, only 3.5% of the nuclei had an 8C content and no higher DNA contents were observed. The salt treatment induced chromosome endoreduplication during the differentiation of cells in the root cortex, where 41.2% of the cells displayed a DNA content higher than 4C (versus 1.3% in control plants). No enhancement of endopolyploidy was observed in cells of the root vascular cylinder or the leaves of the salt-treated plants. In another S. bicolor genotype (DK 34-Alabama), noncompetent for salt adaptation, the same NaCl treatment did not induce chromosome endoreduplication in root cortex cells. Endopolyploidy may be considered as a part of the adaptive response of S. bicolor competent genotypes to salinity.
16671802,3,2006,Org Lett,New protocols for the assembly of the tetracyclic framework associated with the aromatic erythrina alkaloids.,[reaction: see text] Treatment of the anion derived from the ring-fused gem-dichlorocyclopropane 4c with silver tetrafluoroborate afforded the spirocyclic compound 17 in 74% yield. Product 17 was readily converted, over three steps, into the beta-iodoethyl derivative 20 and treatment of this latter compound with n-Bu(3)SnH then afforded, in 93% yield and via a radical addition/elimination sequence, compound 2 incorporating the ABCD framework of the aromatic erythrina alkaloids.

17002632,2,2006,Transfusion,Latency-associated human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein N genotypes in monocytes from healthy blood donors.,BACKGROUND: The beta-herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects a variety of cell types and maintains a lifelong relationship with its host by way of a latent infection in circulating monocytes, myeloid precursor cells, and the hematopoietic progenitor population. Viral strain heterogeneity, shown by gene polymorphisms, has been implicated in the majority of HCMV biologic behaviors. HCMV UL73 encodes the polymorphic envelope glycoprotein N (gN), which shows seven genotypes (gN-1, gN-2, gN-3a, gN-3b, gN-4a, gN-4b, and gN-4c).STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Monocyte subfractions from 64 HCMV-seropositive healthy blood donors were collected to analyze gN genotypes distribution in the few cells harboring the latent viral genome. Different experimental approaches to extract viral genomes from the monocyte population and amplify UL73 (polymerase chain reaction touchdown and nested) for subsequent genotyping were tested and compared with diagnostic gold standard. gN genotype distribution in monocytes from immunocompetent healthy carriers was compared with previously reported data obtained from patient populations with acute HCMV infections.RESULTS: The efficiency of UL73 amplification from monocytes of healthy seropositive blood donors was approximately 39 percent, one of the highest reported to date. The leading gN genotype was gN-1 (87%), whereas the gN-4 variant was poorly represented (13%). The comparison of gN genotypic frequencies in the immunocompetent healthy population with immunocompromised patients is discussed.CONCLUSIONS: This work further supports the idea that strain-specific features could determine the cell tropism and influence the onset of latency.
16996156,2,2006,Int J Food Microbiol,Characterization of Listeria monocytogenes isolated from retail foods.,Listeria monocytogenes isolates recovered from retail ready-to-eat (RTE) meats, raw chickens and fresh produce were characterized by serogroup identification using PCR, genotyping using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Five L. monocytogenes serogroups were identified. Of the 167 isolates 68 (41%) belonged to serogroup 1/2b, 3b; 53 (32%) belonged to serogroup 4b, 4d, 4e; 43 (26%) belonged to serogroup 1/2a, 3a; 2 (1.2%) belonged to serogroup 1/2c, 3c; and 1 (0.6%) belonged to serogroup 4a, 4c. PFGE generated 120 patterns which correlated well with PCR serogrouping. Most L. monocytogenes isolates were resistant to sulfonamide (73%) and some were resistant to tetracycline (8.4%) and ciprofloxacin (1.8%). Tetracycline resistance was conjugatively transferable and the tet(M) gene was identified in 14 tetracycline-resistant isolates as well as their transconjugants. These findings indicate that L. monocytogenes present in food were diverse, and that resistance to one or more antibiotics among these isolates was common. In addition, the presence of potential serotype 4b in all food categories is of public health concern, as serotype 4b has been the serotype most frequently associated with human listeriosis.
16952336,2,2006,Brain Res,Distribution of calbindin-28kD and parvalbumin in V1 in normal adult Cebus apella monkeys and in monkeys with retinal lesions.,Several proteins have their normal patterns of distributions altered by monocular visual deprivation. We studied the distribution of the calcium-binding proteins calbindin-28kD (Cb) and parvalbumin (Pv) in V1 in normal adult Cebus apella monkeys and in monkeys with monocular retinal lesions. In normal monkeys, the interblobs regions in layers 2/3 and the layer 4B are intensely labeled for Cb, while Pv reaction showed a complementary labeling pattern with a stronger staining in layers 4A, 4C and in the blob regions in layers 2/3. In monkeys with monocular retinal lesion, the laminar distribution of these proteins was differentially affected, although both reactions resulted in stronger labeling in non-deprived ocular dominance columns. While Cb reaction resulted in stronger labeling in layers 1 through 5, Pv labeling was heavier in layers 2/3, 4A and 4C. There was a clear reduction in the intensity of neuropil staining for both Pv and Cb in deprived ocular dominance columns with little or no reduction in number of labeled cells. This reduction could thus be attributed to activity-dependent changes at synapses level.
16838369,2,2006,J Neurobiol,Transplantation of embryonic neuroectodermal progenitor cells into the site of a photochemical lesion: immunohistochemical and electrophysiological analysis.,GFP labeled/NE-4C neural progenitor cells cloned from primary neuroectodermal cultures of p53- mouse embryos give rise to neurons when exposed to retinoic acid in vitro. To study their survival and differentiation in vivo, cells were transplanted into the cortex of 6-week-old rats, 1 week after the induction of a photochemical lesion or into noninjured cortex. The electrophysiological properties of GFP/NE-4C cells were studied in vitro (8-10 days after differentiation induction) and 4 weeks after transplantation using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, and immunohistochemical analyses were carried out. After transplantation into a photochemical lesion, a large number of cells survived, some of which expressed the astrocytic marker GFAP. GFP/GFAP-positive cells, with an average resting membrane potential (Vrest) of -71.9 mV, displayed passive time- and voltage-independent K+ currents and, additionally, voltage-dependent A-type K+ currents (KA) and/or delayed outwardly rectifying K+ currents (KDR). Numerous GFP-positive cells expressed NeuN, betaIII-tubulin, or 68 kD neurofilaments. GFP/betaIII-tubulin-positive cells, with an average Vrest of -61.6 mV, were characterized by the expression of KA and KDR currents and tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ currents. GFP/NE-4C cells also gave rise to oligodendrocytes, based on the detection of oligodendrocyte-specific markers. Our results indicate that GFP/NE-4C neural progenitors transplanted into the site of a photochemical lesion give rise to neurons and astrocytes with membrane properties comparable to those transplanted into noninjured cortex. Therefore, GFP/NE-4C cells provide a suitable model for studying neuro- and gliogenesis in vivo. Further, our results suggest that embryonic neuroectodermal progenitor cells may hold considerable promise for the repair of ischemic brain lesions.
16766089,2,2006,Eur J Med Chem,New highly potent GABA uptake inhibitors selective for GAT-1 and GAT-3 derived from (R)- and (S)-proline and homologous pyrrolidine-2-alkanoic acids.,We synthesized proline and pyrrolidine-2-alkanoic acid derivatives in their enantiomerically pure form and evaluated them for their affinity to the GABA transport proteins GAT-1 and GAT-3. Among the compounds presented herein, (R)-pyrrolidine-2-acetic acid (R)-4d substituted with a 2-[tris(4-methoxyphenyl)methoxy]ethyl residue at the nitrogen atom showed the highest affinity at GAT-3 (IC(50) = 3.1 microM) comparable with the well-known GAT-3 blocker (S)-SNAP-5114. Compound (R)-4d displayed excellent subtype selectivity for GAT-3 (GAT-3:GAT-1 = 20:1). (S)-2-pyrrolidineacetic acid derivatives (S)-4b provided with a 4,4-diphenylbut-3-en-1-yl moiety and (S)-4c substituted with a 4,4-[di(3-methylthiophen-2-yl)]phenylbut-3-en-1-yl residue at the nitrogen atom exhibited IC(50) values of 0.396 microM and 0.343 microM at the GAT-1 protein, respectively.
16650732,2,2006,Reprod Toxicol,Flow cytometry evaluation of lead and cadmium effects on mouse spermatogenesis.,Flow cytometry (FCM) is a powerful tool to evaluate cell DNA content and ploidy levels. We have assessed the accuracy of two protocols of nuclei isolation from paraffinized samples (P1 and P2) by comparing FCM results with those obtained using fresh material (F1-F3). After isolation, nuclei were stained with propidium iodide and quantitatively analysed by FCM for changes in germ cell ratios. Results obtained with Protocol P2 were similar to those obtained using the protocol that gave best results for fresh tissues (F2). Protocol P2 was then applied to paraffin embedded testicular samples from ICR-CD1 mice exposed to 1, 2 and 3 mg CdCl(2)/kg bw by single subcutaneous injection, and to 74 and 100 mg PbCl(2)/kg bw administered in four repeated doses. The highest doses of CdCl(2) decreased the number of haploid (1C) cells and increased the number of diploid (2C), S phase and tetraploid (4C) cells. Treatment with PbCl(2) did not induce significant changes in testicular cells subpopulations. These results support the usefulness of FCM in evaluating the effect of toxic substances on mouse spermatogenesis, using both fresh and paraffinized material.
16634587,2,2006,Inorg Chem,Copper(II) hexaaza macrocyclic binuclear complexes obtained from the reaction of their copper(I) derivates and molecular dioxygen.,Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out for a series of Cu(I) complexes bearing N-hexadentate macrocyclic dinucleating ligands and for their corresponding peroxo species (1c-8c) generated by their interaction with molecular O2. For complexes 1c-7c, it has been found that the side-on peroxodicopper(II) is the favored structure with regard to the bis(mu-oxo)dicopper(III). For those complexes, the singlet state has also been shown to be more stable than the triplet state. In the case of 8c, the most favored structure is the trans-1,2-peroxodicopper(II) because of the para substitution and the steric encumbrance produced by the methylation of the N atoms. Cu(II) complexes 4e, 5e, and 8e have been obtained by O2 oxidation of their corresponding Cu(I) complexes and structurally and magnetically characterized. X-ray single-crystal structures for those complexes have been solved, and they show three completely different types of Cu(II)2 structures: (a) For 4e, the Cu(II) centers are bridged by a phenolate group and an external hydroxide ligand. The phenolate group is generated from the evolution of 4c via intramolecular arene hydroxylation. (b) For 5e, the two Cu(II) centers are bridged by two hydroxide ligands. (c) For the 8e case, the Cu(II) centers are ligated to terminally bound hydroxide ligands, rare because of its tendency to bridge. The evolution of complexes 1c-8c toward their oxidized species has also been rationalized by DFT calculations based mainly on their structure and electrophilicity. The structural diversity of the oxidized species is also responsible for a variety of magnetic behavior: (a) strong antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling with J = -482.0 cm(-1) (g = 2.30; rho = 0.032; R = 5.6 x 10(-3)) for 4e; (b) AF coupling with J = -286.3 cm(-1) (g = 2.07; rho = 0.064; R = 2.6 x 10(-3)) for 5e; (c) an uncoupled Cu(II)2 complex for 8e.
16617300,2,2006,Gene Ther,Tumor-specific therapeutic effect induced by an oncolytic adenoviral vector containing heat shock protein 70 and prodrug activation genes.,We constructed a melanoma-specific oncolytic adenoviral vector Ad.MCDIRESE1.71Hsp3, in which the cytosine deaminase and adenoviral E1A genes linked by the IRES sequence were under the control of a mouse tyrosinase enhancer/promoter transcriptional element in the E1 region of the vector. We also inserted the human heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter into the E3 region of this vector. The RGD-4C peptide was inserted into the HI loop of the fiber knob domain of the Ad.MCDIRESE1.71Hsp3 vector to increase the transduction efficiency of this vector to tumor cells. The Ad.MCDIRESE1.71Hsp3 vector replicates specifically in melanoma cells, and it has a melanoma-specific cytotoxic effect in the presence of 5-fluorocytosine in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the in vivo killing of tumor cells associated with the overexpression of Hsp70 generated by the intratumoral injection of the Ad.MCDIRESE1.71Hsp3 vector into established subcutaneous tumors can lead to the suppression of tumor growth and potent melanoma-specific systemic immune responses.
16505075,2,2006,Br J Sports Med,Validation of a skinfold based index for tracking proportional changes in lean mass.,BACKGROUND: The lean mass index (LMI) is a new empirical measure that tracks within-subject proportional changes in body mass adjusted for changes in skinfold thickness.OBJECTIVE: To compare the ability of the LMI and other skinfold derived measures of lean mass to monitor changes in lean mass.METHODS: 20 elite rugby union players undertook full anthropometric profiles on two occasions 10 weeks apart to calculate the LMI and five skinfold based measures of lean mass. Hydrodensitometry, deuterium dilution, and dual energy x ray absorptiometry provided a criterion choice, four compartment (4C) measure of lean mass for validation purposes. Regression based measures of validity, derived for within-subject proportional changes through log transformation, included correlation coefficients and standard errors of the estimate.RESULTS: The correlation between change scores for the LMI and 4C lean mass was moderate (0.37, 90% confidence interval -0.01 to 0.66) and similar to the correlations for the other practical measures of lean mass (range 0.26 to 0.42). Standard errors of the estimate for the practical measures were in the range of 2.8-2.9%. The LMI correctly identified the direction of change in 4C lean mass for 14 of the 20 athletes, compared with 11 to 13 for the other practical measures of lean mass.CONCLUSIONS: The LMI is probably as good as other skinfold based measures for tracking lean mass and is theoretically more appropriate. Given the impracticality of the 4C criterion measure for routine field use, the LMI may offer a convenient alternative for monitoring physique changes, provided its utility is established under various conditions.
16468810,2,2006,J Org Chem,Highly diastereoselective enolate addition of O-protected alpha-hydroxyacetate to (S(R))-tert-butanesulfinylimines: synthesis of taxol side chain.,The taxol side chain (S(R),2R,3S)-N-tert-butanesulfinyl-O-Boc-3-phenylisoserine benzyl ester 4c was synthesized through a lithium enolate addition of O-Boc-alpha-hydroxyacetate benzyl ester 5c to benzylidene (S(R))-tert-butanesulfinamide 6a in excellent yield and diastereoselectivity. By similar approach, a series of enantiopure 3-substituted isoserine benzyl esters 4 useful for the semi-syntheses of taxol derivatives were also prepared in high to excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. The diastereoselective addition mechanism was discussed on the basis of the experimental observation.
16427796,2,2006,Pulm Pharmacol Ther,Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 7 in inflammatory cells from patients with asthma and COPD.,In inflammatory cells, the low K(m) cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 subtype is predominant in terms of expression and function, although more recently it has been suggested that PDE 7 may also play a role in regulating inflammatory cell activity. In the present study, PDE 4 and PDE 7 subtype messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts in CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes from healthy (n=10) and asthmatic (n=10) subjects and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and CD8 lymphocytes obtained from healthy (n=10) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=7) subjects were identified and quantified. PDE 4A, PDE 4B, PDE 4D and PDE 7A mRNA were present in similar quantities in both CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes obtained from healthy and asthmatic subjects and in CD8 lymphocytes obtained from healthy and COPD subjects. Expression of PDE 4C and PDE 7B mRNA was also observed, although transcript levels were low and variable between individuals. In addition, the effects of selective PDE 7 inhibition on both phytohaemagluttinin (PHA)-induced human peripheral blood mixed mononuclear cell (HPBMNC) proliferation and fMLP-induced neutrophil elastase (NE) release were studied. HPBMNC and human neutrophils, isolated from the venous blood of healthy volunteers (n=6) were treated with either a novel selective PDE 7 inhibitor PF 0332040 alone or in combination with rolipram. Proliferation of HPBMNC was stimulated by PHA (2microgml(-1)) and assessed by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation, while fMLP-induced (100nM) NE release was determined using a chromogenic substrate. Both rolipram (0.003-10microM) and PF 0332040 (0.003-10microM) significantly inhibited PHA-stimulated proliferation of HPBMNC ((**)P&lt;0.01). Co-administration of rolipram (0.3-10microM) and PF 0332040 (0.003-10microM) significantly increased the degree of inhibition observed, compared to when either drug was administered alone ((**)P&lt;0.01). PF 0332040 (0.003-10microM) had no inhibitory effect on NE release from human peripheral blood neutrophils stimulated with fMLP (100nM), while rolipram (0.003-10microM) significantly inhibited neutrophil degranulation ((**)P&lt;0.01). These findings suggest no evidence of altered PDE 4 or PDE 7 mRNA transcript levels in inflammatory cells isolated from the peripheral venous blood of mild asymptomatic asthmatic subjects or stable COPD subjects, however, inhibition of PDE 7 may influence mononuclear cell function.
17191890,1,2006,Chem Biodivers,Enzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidation as the key step in decano-4-lactone and decano-5-lactone degradation by Sporobolomyces odorus.,The biosyntheses of aroma active gamma- and delta-lactones have been previously characterized in yeasts and plants by incubation of labeled fatty acid derivatives. The lactones were considered as end products. Liquid cultures of the lactone-producing yeast Sporobolomyces odorus were used to investigate catabolic pathways of the lactones by incubation of ethyl (+/-)-5-hydroxy(1-(13)C1)decanoate ((13C)-1b) and methyl (+/-)-4-hydroxy(1-(13)C1)decanoate ((13C)-7a). Aliquots of the culture broth were analyzed with GC/MS after CH2N2 derivatization. S. odorus degraded (13C)-1b to 5-oxo(1-(13)C1)decanoic acid ((13C)-2c) and, subsequently, to pentyl (1-(13)C1)pentanedioate ((13C)-3c) and 3-[(1-(13)C1)carboxypropyl] hexanoate ((13C)-4c) by a Baeyer-Villiger-type oxidation (BVO). In addition, the oxidation of (13C)-7a to 4-oxo(1-(13)C1)decanoic acid ((13C)-8c) and a BVO of (13C)-8c to hexyl (1-(13)C1)butanedioate ((13C)-9c) is reported. So far, BVO has been observed in bacteria and some fungi; the data presented indicate a BVO catalyzed by the yeast S. odorus in the course of endogenous lactone metabolism.
17173407,1,2006,Inorg Chem,New Ru complexes containing the N-tridentate bpea and phosphine ligands: consequences of meridional vs facial geometry.,The synthesis and isolation of the complex cis,fac-[RuIICl2(bpea)(PPh3)][3; bpea = N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylamine] and three geometrical isomers of the complex [RuIICl(bpea)(dppe)](BF4) [4; dppe = (1,2-diphenylphosphino)ethane], trans,fac (4a), cis,fac (4b), and mer(down) (4c), have been described (see Chart 1 for a drawing of their structures). These complexes have been characterized through analytical, spectroscopic (IR, UV/vis, and 1D and 2D NMR), and electrochemical (cyclic voltammetry) techniques. In addition, complexes 3, 4a, and 4b have been further characterized in the solid state through monocrystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The molecular and electronic structures of isomers 4a, 4b, 4c, and 4d (the mer(up) isomer) have also been studied by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, their low-energy electronic transitions have been simulated using time-dependent DFT approaches, which have allowed unraveling of their metal-to-ligand charge-transfer nature. Complexes 3 and 4a-c are capable of catalyzing H-transfer types of reactions between alcohols and aromatic ketones such as acetophenone and 2,2-dimethylpropiophenone (DP). A strong influence of the facial versus meridional geometry in the bpea ligand coordination mode is observed for these catalytic reactions, with the meridional isomer being much more active than the facial one. The meridional isomer is even capable of carrying out the H-transfer reaction of bulky substrates such as DP at room temperature.
19089240,1,2006,J Appl Oral Sci,Evaluating noise in digitized radiographic images by means of histogram.,To evaluate the performance of three digital devices regarding the noise added to digital radiographic images containing different optical densities.</AbstractText>: To evaluate the performance of three digital devices regarding the noise added to digital radiographic images containing different optical densities.METHODS: A radiographic image was digitized repeatedly ten times using two scanners (HP 4c/T and HP 5370C) and a digital camera (Nikon 990). A histogram tool measured a mean pixel value and the standard deviation of the region of interest in each image. Both values were used to calculate the image noise at the different optical densities.RESULTS: The noise values found were different for all devices and optical densities. There was a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between the scanner HP 4c/T and the digital camera regarding the noise values. There was a significant correlation (p&lt;0.05) between the noise values found for the HP 4c/T scanner and the digital camera and between both scanners (p&lt;0.01).CONCLUSION: The noise added to the image was higher for scanner HP 4c/T and less for the digital camera. The noise was higher at the lower optical densities for the scanners. It seems that depending on the equipment and the optical density, a variable amount of noise can be incorporated to the images.
17048293,1,2006,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),New approach towards cytotoxic furyl macrolactones by ring closing metathesis.,Furan-2-ylalkenols 2a-d were esterified with undec-10-enoyl chloride and the resulting esters were cyclized to unsaturated 2- and 3-furyl macrolactones by ring closing metathesis using Grubbs catalyst I. Hydrolysis of the macrolactone 4b with NaOH led to the furylalkenoic acid and reaction of 4c with tert-butyllithium gave a tert-butyl ketone. Some of the resulting compounds were tested in the MTT assay for their cytotoxic activities against HL 60 cells and at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) against 60 cancer cell lines. The compounds only showed cytotoxic activities in the muM range.
17046712,1,2006,Biochim Biophys Acta,The glutamine/amino acid transporter (ASCT2) reconstituted in liposomes: transport mechanism, regulation by ATP and characterization of the glutamine/glutamate antiport.,The glutamine/amino acid transporter solubilized from rat renal apical plasma membrane (brush-border membrane) with C12E8 and reconstituted into liposomes has been previously identified as the ASCT2 transporter. The reconstituted transporter catalyses an antiport reaction in which external glutamine and Na+ are cotransported in exchange with internal glutamine (or other amino acids). The glutamine-Na+ cotransport occurred with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The concentration of Na+ did not influence the Km for glutamine and vice versa. Experimental data obtained by a bi-substrate analysis of the glutamine-Na+ cotransport, together with previous report on the glutamine(ex)/glutamine(in) pseudo bi-reactant analysis, indicated that the transporter catalyses a three-substrate transport reaction with a random simultaneous mechanism. The presence of ATP in the internal compartment of the proteoliposomes led to an increase of the Vmax of the transport and to a decrease of the Km of the transporter for external Na+. The reconstituted glutamine/amino acid transporter was inhibited by glutamate; the inhibition was more pronounced at acidic pH. A kinetic analysis revealed that the inhibition was competitive with respect to glutamine. Glutamate was also transported in exchange with glutamine. The external Km of the transporter for glutamate (13.3 mM) was slightly higher than the internal one (8.3 mM). At acidic pH the external but not the internal Km decreased. According with the Km values, glutamate should be transported preferentially from inside to outside in exchange for external glutamine and Na+.
17027265,1,2006,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis of antimicrobial 2,9,10-trisubstituted-6-oxo-7,12-dihydro-chromeno[3,4-b]quinoxalines.,A new series of 2,9,10-trisubstituted-6-oxo-7,12-dihydro-chromeno[3,4-b]quinoxalines was synthesized and submitted to antibacterial and antifungal activities. Result of the antimicrobial screening showed the compound 4j being the most effective among the various treatments in antimicrobial screening. Compounds 4c, 4d, 4k, and 4l showed moderate activity against the microorganisms tested.
16946596,1,2006,Yakugaku Zasshi,[Analysis of the chemical drugs among structural isomer].,Drugs that have a pharmacological effect similar to legal drugs such as narcotics and stimulants are available in the market and widely used. 5-methoxy-N,N-di-iso-propyl-tryptamine (5MeO-DIPT) and alpha-methyl-tryptamine (AMT) were categorized as narcotics and were specified as legal drugs in April 2005, and also 2,5-dimethoxy-4-n-propylthiophenethylamine (4C-T-7) and N-methyl-alpha-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxy-phenethylamine (MBDB) were categorized as narcotics and were specified as legal drugs in April 2006, in Japan. We are analyzing these chemical drugs by investigating the market research. It is recognized that during the analysis of chemical drugs, drugs that resemble a structural isomer of a target substance, such as 5MeO-DIPT and 5-methoxy-N,N-di-n-propyl-tryptamine (5MeO-DPT) or 4C-T-7 and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iso-propylthiophenethylamine (4C-T-4), should be distinguished. The results of TLC, IR, GC-MS and HPLC analyses were compared. 5MeO-DIPT and 5MeO-DPT could be distinguished by TLC and HPLC analyses, but not by IR and GC-MS analysis. The drugs 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-iso-propyl-tryptamine (4HO-MIPT) and 4-hydroxy-N,N-di-ethyl-tryptamine (4HO-DET) or could not be distinguished. Moreover, the isomers of 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-n-propyl-tryptamine (4HO-MPT) was not found to be present. Thus, we have demonstrated that the chemical drug could be distinguished from each other, and we have also shown that NMR data is essential for the analysis.
16900342,1,2006,Histochem Cell Biol,Expression of cell kinetics and death during monocyte-macrophage differentiation: effects of Actinomycin D and Vinblastine treatments.,The different effects of two cytostatic drugs, Actinomycin D and Vinblastine, during macrophage-like differentiation induced in THP-1 monocytic cell line by phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (6, 30, and 60 nM), were studied by morpho-cytochemical approaches. In PMA-unstimulated monocytic cells, the cytostatic effects of Actinomycin D (an antimetabolic drug) were characterized by a drastic reduction of the G2/M cells accompanied by dramatic death of the G1 cells; on the contrary, Vinblastine (a microtubule-depolymerizating drug) induced an accumulation of the G2/M cells with the appearance of aneugenic micronuclei and scarce cell death mainly from the G1 cells. After 60 nM PMA stimulation, the culture was mostly composed by macrophagic cells characterized by low proliferation and the appearance of mono-/binucleated polyploid cells; in this condition, the cytotoxicity of the two drugs, more effective for Vinblastine, induced cell death in the different ploidy classes (2c, 4c, 8c). Cell death appeared to be of apoptotic nature, but with some morpho-phenotypic differences due to the action mechanism of the drugs and dependent on cell culture growth and differentiation. As a consequence of the different block-action of the two drugs on the cell cycle phases and in relation to the different subcellular targets, the effects changed during the transition from not-adhering/proliferating monocytes to adhering/low-proliferating differentiated macrophages.
16891081,1,2006,Eur J Radiol,Columnar cell lesions of the breast: mammographic and US features.,OBJECTIVES: Columnar cell lesions are being encountered with increasing frequency in breast biopsies performed. The purpose of our study was to determine whether columnar cell lesions of the breast have any distinctive imaging characteristics.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our institutional database for all records of breast pathology obtained in a 17-month period. Columnar cell lesion was diagnosed in 53 lesions and 12 of these 53 lesions contained columnar cell lesions as the sole histopathologic findings. These 12 lesions in nine patients made up our study population. They included columnar cell change (n=4), columnar cell hyperplasia (n=5), and columnar cell hyperplasia with atypia (n=3).RESULTS: All nine patients underwent mammography and sonography within 1 month of each other. Of the mammograms in nine patients, nine lesions (75%) appeared as clustered amorphous or indistinct (n=5), fine pleomorphic (n=3), or round (n=1) microcalcifications. The tenth lesion showed a focal mass without microcalcifications and the remaining two lesions showed no abnormal findings. At sonography, not-circumscribed masses were depicted in six lesions and microcalcifications were visible in four lesions, of which three lesions were concurrent with masses. There were no sonographically focal lesions in the remaining five. Overall 11 lesions were classified as BI-RADS category 4 (92%) and one as category 3. Of the three lesions with atypia, two were classified as category 4a and one was classified as category 4c, and they showed no distinct imaging appearance from those without atypia.CONCLUSION: Columnar cell lesions usually present as nonpalpable, clustered indeterminate or suspicious microcalcifications on mammography. They are indistinguishable from other causes of suspicious microcalcifications such as atypical ductal hyperplasia or ductal carcinoma in situ and require needle biopsy or excisional biopsy for diagnosis.
16874408,1,2006,Biol Res,The G2 checkpoint activated by DNA damage does not prevent genome instability in plant cells.,Root growth, G2 length, and the frequency of aberrant mitoses and apoptotic nuclei were recorded after a single X-ray irradiation, ranging from 2.5 to 40 Gy, in Allium cepa L. root meristematic cells. After 72 h of recovery, root growth was reduced in a dose-dependent manner from 10 to 40 Gy, but not at 2.5 or 5 Gy doses. Flow cytometry plus TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) showed that activation of apoptosis occurred only after 20 and 40 Gy of X-rays. Nevertheless, irrespective of the radiation dose, conventional flow cytometry showed that cells accumulated in G2 (4C DNA content). Simultaneously, the mitotic index fell, though a mitotic wave appeared later. Cell accumulation in G2 was transient and partially reversed by caffeine, thus it was checkpoint-dependent. Strikingly, the additional G2 time provided by this checkpoint was never long enough to complete DNA repair. Then, in all cases, some G2 cells with still-unrepaired DNA underwent checkpoint adaptation, i.e., they entered into the late mitotic wave with chromatid breaks. These cells and those produced by the breakage of chromosomal bridges in anaphase will reach the G1 of the next cell cycle unrepaired, ensuring the appearance of genome instability.
16851235,1,2006,J Phys Chem B,Physicochemical and in situ photoluminescence study of the reversible transformation of oxide ions of low coordination into hydroxyl groups upon interaction of water and methanol with MgO.,The interaction of water and methanol with MgO samples with different distributions of oxide ions of low coordination has been investigated by physical techniques, particularly in situ photoluminescence. First, the three photoluminescence fingerprints of oxide ions vs their coordination number have been obtained for samples outgassed at 1273 K. By a pseudo quantitative approach, the relative distribution of the oxide ions of low coordination O(2-)LC (where LC = 3C, 4C, and 5C refer to tri-, tetra-, and pentacoordinated oxide ions, respectively) was determined and correlated with the shape and size of MgO particles determined by TEM and XRD. The photoluminescence of surfaces of MgO obtained after outgassing at increasing temperature or after interaction of water or methanol with a clean surface, i.e., obtained by outgassing at 1273 K, was then studied and evidenced three other photoluminescent species assigned to surface OH groups. The nature and mechanism of formation of the hydroxyls groups responsible for these new luminescent species are discussed in relation with their thermal stability and FTIR experiments.
16841995,1,2006,Inorg Chem,Synthesis and characterization of octa- and hexanuclear polyoxomolybdate wheels: role of the inorganic template and of the counterion.,Eight new compounds based on [O3PCH2PO3]4- ligands and {MoV2O4} dimeric units have been synthesized and structurally characterized. Octanuclear wheels encapsulating various guests have been isolated with different counterions. With NH4+, a single wheel was obtained, as expected, with the planar CO32- guest, (NH4)12[(MoV2O4)4(O3PCH2PO3)4(CO3)2].24H2O (1a), while with the pyramidal SO32- guest, only the syn isomer (NH4)12[(MoV2O4)4(O3PCH2PO3)4(SO3)2].26H2O (2a) was characterized. The corresponding anti isomer was obtained with Na+ as counterions, Na12[(MoV2O4)4(O3PCH2PO3)4(SO3)2]39H2O (2b), and with mixed Na+ and NH4(+) counterions, Na+(NH4)11[(MoV2O4)4(O3PCH2PO3)4(SO3)2].13H2O (2d). With [O3PCH2PO3]4- extra ligands, the octanuclear wheel Li12(NH4)2[(MoV2O4)4(O3PCH2PO3)4(HO3PCH2PO3)2].31H2O (4a) was isolated with Li+ and NH4+ counterions and Li14[(MoV2O4)4(O3PCH2PO3)4(HO3PCH2PO3)2].34H2O (4c) as a pure Li+ salt. A new rectangular anion, formed by connecting two MoV dimers and two MoVI octahedra via methylenediphosphonato ligands with NH4+ as counterions, (NH4)10[(MoV2O4)2(MoVIO3)2(O3PCH2PO3)2(HO3PCH2PO3)2].15H2)O (3a), and Li9(NH4)2Cl[(MoV2O4)2(MoVIO3)2(O3PCH2PO3)2]. 22H2O (3d) as a mixed NH4+ and Li+ salt have also been synthesized. The structural characterization of the compounds, combined with a study of their behavior in solution, investigated by 31P NMR, has allowed a discussion on the influence of the counterions on the structure of the anions and their stability. Density functional theory calculations carried out on both isomers of the [(MoV2O4)4(O3PCH2PO3)4(SO3)2]12- anion (2), either assumed isolated or embedded in a continuum solvent model, suggest that the anti form is favored by approximately 2 kcal mol(-1). Explicit insertion of two solvated counterions in the molecular cavity reverses this energy difference and reduces it to less than 1 kcal mol(-1), therefore accounting for the observed structural versatility.
16836335,1,2006,J Phys Chem B,Optical surface properties and morphology of MgO and CaO nanocrystals.,Optical absorption and photoluminescence emission properties of dehydroxylated MgO and CaO nanocrystals are discussed with respect to particle morphology and size. On MgO nanocubes with pronounced corner and edge features two emission bands at 3.4 and 3.3 eV result from the excitation of 4-coordinated surface O(4C)(2-) anions in edges at 5.4 eV and of regular oxygen-terminated corners at 4.6 eV, respectively. Morphologically ill-defined CaO particles are a factor of 5 larger, do not display regular corner features, and show only one photoluminescence emission band at 3.0 eV. The associated excitation spectrum indicates electronic excitations above the energy required to excite regular oxygen-terminated CaO corners. It is concluded that in the case of morphologically well-defined MgO nanocubes variations in the next coordination of oxygen-terminated corners can effectively be probed by photoluminescence spectroscopy and thus allows for discrimination between 3-coordinated surface O(2-) in regular corner sites and kinks.
16787094,1,2006,J Am Chem Soc,Structures, photoluminescence, and reversible vapoluminescence properties of neutral platinum(II) complexes containing extended pi-conjugated cyclometalated ligands.,Reacting K2PtCl4 with the tridentate R-C(wedge)N(wedge)C-H2 ligands 2,6-di-(2'-naphthyl)-4-R-pyridine (R = H, 1a; Ph, 1b; 4-BrC6H4, 1c; 3,5-F2C6H3, 1d) in glacial acetic acid, followed by heating in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), gave complexes [(R-C(wedge)N(wedge)C)Pt(DMSO)] (2a-d). In the crystal structures of 2a-c, the molecules are paired in a head-to-tail orientation with Pt...Pt separations &gt;6.3 A, and there are extensive close C-H...pi (d = 2.656-2.891 A), pi...pi (d = 3.322-3.399 A), and C-H...O=S (d = 2.265-2.643 A) contacts. [(Ph-C(wedge)N(wedge)C)Pt(PPh3)] (3) was prepared by reacting 2b with PPh3. Reactions of 2a-d with bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm) gave [(R-C(wedge)N(wedge)C)2Pt2(mu-dppm)] (4a-d). Both head-to-head (syn) and head-to-tail (anti) conformations were found for 4a.6CHCl3.C5H12, whereas only one conformation was observed for 4b.2CHCl3 (syn), 4c.3CH2Cl2 (syn), and 4d.2CHCl3 (anti). In the crystal structures of 4a-d, there are close intramolecular Pt...Pt contacts of 3.272-3.441 A in the syn conformers, and long intramolecular Pt...Pt separations of 5.681-5.714 A in the anti conformers. There are weak C-H...X (d = 2.497-3.134 A) and X...X (X = Cl or Br; d = 2.973-3.655 A) interactions between molecules 4a-d and occluded CHCl3/CH2Cl2 molecules, and their solvent channels are of varying diameters (approximately 9-28 A). Complexes 2a-d, 3, and 4a-d are photoluminescent in the solid state, with emission maxima at 602-643 nm. Upon exposure to volatile organic compounds, 4a shows a fast and reversible vapoluminescent response, which is most intense with volatile halogenated solvents (except CCl4). Powder X-ray diffraction analysis of desolvated 4a revealed a more condensed molecular packing of syn and anti complexes than crystal 4a.6CHCl3.C5H12.
16772826,1,2006,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,HCV genotype 4 in Belgium: three distinct patterns among patients from European and African origin.,BACKGROUND: Considered uncommon in western countries some years ago, hepatitis C virus of genotype 4 is now spreading in some areas of Europe. This is assumed to be due to immigration from a region of high prevalence for this genotype and to propagation among drug users. In the south of Belgium, genotype 4 currently accounts for 10% of hepatitis C virus patients and its prevalence is increasing with time.OBJECTIVE: To better define the genotype 4 carriers' characteristics.METHODS: In a database comprising 1726 viraemic hepatitis C virus patients, the files of 85 genotype 4 carriers were reviewed.RESULTS: Beside the African (58%) and European drug user (15%) subgroups classically described, a third subgroup consisting of European nondrug users (26%) was identified as peculiar: these patients were older, had been mostly contaminated sporadically, presented a great diversity of subtypes, and were mainly of Italian origin. In this subgroup, contamination was supposed to be ancient, having occurred probably in Italy before immigration into Belgium. By contrast, European drug users were infected with only two subtypes (4c/4d and 4), an observation in favour of recent spread. Africans had a great diversity of subtypes, were young, and were mostly contaminated sporadically in their home countries. Despite their epidemiological differences, the clinical management, and in particular the rates of eligibility for treatment, were similar for these three groups.CONCLUSIONS: Three different patterns of genotype 4 carriers were observed, corresponding to three different spreading profiles. They did not induce, however, different clinical management.
16762560,1,2006,Plant Physiol Biochem,Triterpenoids and ellagic acid derivatives from in vitro cultures of Camptotheca acuminata Decaisne.,The metabolic profile of secondary products in calli and cell suspension cultures of Camptotheca acuminata Decaisne was investigated and compared to that of the leaves and roots taken from the plant. Neither in vitro system produced the anticancer quinoline alkaloid camptothecin (CPT); they accumulated discrete quantities of polyhydroxylated triterpenoids, different from those found in the plant organs, and ellagic acid derivatives. Nine ellagic acid derivatives (1a-1d and 2a-2e) and eight triterpenoid acids (3a-3e and 4a-4c) were isolated and characterised. All the identified triterpenes were related to ursane- or oleanane-type skeletons and their concentrations rose to 4.5% in suspended cells.
16749830,1,2006,Inorg Chem,Dinuclear nickel and palladium complexes with bridging 2,5-diamino-1,4-benzoquinonediimines: synthesis, structures, and catalytic oligomerization of ethylene.,Dinuclear, divalent acetylacetonato (acac) complexes of the type [M(acac){mu-C6H2(--NR)4}M(acac)] (M = Ni, Pd) have been prepared by the reaction of the corresponding bis(acac) metal precursor with 2,5-diamino-1,4-benzoquinonediimines C6H2(NHR)2(=NR)2 (4a, R = CH2-t-Bu; 4b, R = CH2Ph; 4c, R = Ph), which are metalated and become bridging ligands, also like in the complex [(C8H11)Pt{mu-C6H2(--NCH2-t-Bu)4}Pt(C8H11)] (6) obtained by the reaction of 4a with [PtCl2(COD)]. The complexes were fully characterized, including by X-ray diffraction for [Ni(acac){mu-C6H2(--NCH2Ph)4}Ni(acac)] (9b) and [Pd(acac){mu-C6H2(--NCH2-t-Bu)4}Pd(acac)] (10a). The coordination geometry around the metal ions is square-planar, and a complete electronic delocalization of the quinonoid pi system occurs between the metal centers over the two N--C--C--C--N halves of the ligand. The nature of the N substituent explains the differences between the supramolecular stacking arrangements found for [Ni(acac){mu-C6H2(--NR)4}Ni(acac)] (9a; R = CH2-t-Bu; 9b, R = CH2Ph). The Ni complexes were evaluated as catalyst precursors for ethylene oligomerization in the presence of AlEtCl(2) or MAO as the cocatalyst, in particular in order to study possible cooperative effects resulting from electronic communication between the metal centers and to examine the influence of the N substituent on the activity and selectivity. These catalysts afforded mostly ethylene dimers and trimers.
16683131,1,2006,J Mol Med (Berl),Association of a polymorphism in the betacellulin gene with type 1 diabetes mellitus in two populations.,Betacellulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor family, is expressed in fetal and adult pancreas. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest a role for betacellulin in islet neogenesis and regeneration. Therefore, a mutation in the betacellulin gene might lead to fewer beta cells. With reduced beta cell reserve, beta cells may not be able to compensate for an autoimmune attack, and in turn, susceptibility to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) would increase. Previous mutational analysis identified seven polymorphisms in the betacellulin gene [5' UT (-233G&gt;C, -226A&gt;G), exon 1 (TGC19GGC, Cys7Gly), exon 2 (CTC130TTC, Leu44Phe), exon 4 (TTG370ATG, Leu124Met), intron 2 (-31T&gt;C), and intron 4 (-4C&gt;T)]. An association study of these variants with T1DM was first carried out in 100 Caucasian subjects with T1DM and 282 Caucasian subjects without diabetes recruited at the University of Maryland. The frequency of the intron 4 T-4 allele was significantly higher among nondiabetic controls than that among diabetic cases (0.29 vs 0.21, p=0.04). Allele frequencies for the other polymorphisms did not differ significantly between cases and controls. The intron 4 T-4 association was then replicated by transmission disequilibrium testing in a separate population of Caucasian parent/offspring with T1DM trios (n=168 trios, 113 informative) recruited at the Medical College of Wisconsin (p=0.024). An interaction of the intron 4 T-4 allele and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) was also detected with undertransmission of the T allele in those T1DM subjects with susceptible HLA types as compared to those T1DM subjects without susceptible HLA types (p=0.018). RNA studies of the intron T-4 variant showed similar RNA levels for intron 4 T-4 and intron 4 C-4 alleles. Additionally, there was no evidence for an effect of this variant on exon-intron splicing. We conclude that the intron 4 T-4 allele in the betacellulin gene is associated with lower risk of T1DM and may interact with HLA. Further studies will be necessary to establish the significance of this association.
16585614,1,2006,J Environ Qual,Constitutive expression of a high-affinity sulfate transporter in Indian mustard affects metal tolerance and accumulation.,The Stylosanthes hamata SHST1 gene encodes a high-affinity sulfate transporter located in the plasma membrane. In this study the S. hamata SHST1 gene was constitutively expressed in Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czern.] to investigate its importance for tolerance and accumulation of various oxyanions that may be transported by SHST1 and for cadmium, which is detoxified by sulfur-rich compounds. The transgenic SHST1 lines SHST1-12C and SHST1-4C were compared with wild-type Indian mustard for tolerance and accumulation of arsenate, chromate, tungstate, vanadate, and cadmium. As seedlings the SHST1 plants accumulated significantly more Cd and W, and somewhat more Cr and V. The SHST1 seedlings were less tolerant to Cd, Mo, and V compared to wild-type plants. Mature SHST1 plants were less tolerant than wild-type plants to Cd and Cr. SHST1 plants accumulated significantly more Cd, Cr, and W in their roots than wild-type plants. In their shoots they accumulated significantly more Cr and somewhat more V and W. Shoot Cd accumulation was significantly lower than in wild-type, and As levels were somewhat reduced. Compared to wild-type plants, sulfur accumulation was enhanced in roots of SHST1 plants but not in shoots. Together these results suggest that SHST1 can facilitate uptake of other oxyanions in addition to sulfate and that SHST1 mediates uptake in roots rather than root-to-shoot translocation. Since SHST1 overexpression led to enhanced accumulation of Cr, Cd, V, and W, this approach shows some potential for phytoremediation, especially if it could be combined with the expression of a gene that confers enhanced metal translocation or tolerance.
16570912,1,2006,J Med Chem,Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) inhibitors with anti-inflammatory activity.,In an attempt to examine the effect of inhibition of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO; EC 1.4.3.6, also known as VAP-1) as a novel anti-inflammatory target, the structure/mechanism based design and synthesis of a series of novel hydrazino-containing small molecules are described. The in vitro biological results show that compounds 4a,c are highly potent SSAO inhibitors with notable selectivity toward SSAO over monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO-A and MAO-B). SAR studies based on compound 4c were performed, and the results are discussed. The most potent and selective compound, 4a (IC(50) = 2 nM), is an orally active, competitive, and apparently irreversible inhibitor of SSAO that is effective at reducing disease incidence and severity in an in vivo animal disease model of multiple sclerosis.
16557318,1,2006,Org Biomol Chem,Positive effect of natural and negatively charged cyclodextrins on the stabilization of penicillins towards beta-lactamase degradation due to inclusion and external guest-host association. An NMR and MS study.,The complexation of penicillin (1a-c) and cephalosporin (2a,b) antibiotics with cyclodextrins (CDs), both natural [beta-CD (3b) and gamma-CD (3c)] and carboxylated [heptakis(6-oxycarbonylethylthio-6-deoxy)-beta-CD sodium salt (4b) and octakis(6-oxycarbonylethylthio-6-deoxy)-gamma-CD (4c) sodium salt], has been studied at neutral pH. Penicillins [ampicillin (1a), amoxicillin (1b) and dicloxacillin (1c) form inclusion complexes with the above CDs, as was shown by extensive NMR spectroscopic studies, whereas cephalosporins (cephalexin, cefadroxil) do not. Inclusion of the penicillins into either 3b or 4b was not accompanied by significant chemical shift changes in the 1H NMR spectra. On the contrary, with the wider 3c and its derivative 4c inclusion was evidenced by both chemical shift displacements of the cavity protons and intermolecular interactions, indicating the formation of primarily 1:1 guest-host inclusion complexes. The binding constants for 1a/3c, 1a/4c and 1c/3c were calculated as 19 +/- 4, 17 +/- 0.9 and 622 +/- 200 M(-1), respectively. With 4c, a 1:2 stoichiometry was also found. In addition, simultaneous formation of aggregates by external association takes place in solution, as shown by the ESI-mass spectrometric data. Studies on the hydrolysis of ampicillin under pseudo-first order conditions using an excess of 3c, 4c and of linear maltoheptaose at pH 7 showed that the drug hydrolysed at a similar rate in all cases. In the presence, however, of beta-lactamase enzyme and the carboxylated host 4c, ampicillin degraded twice as slowly (0.008 h(-1)) as in the presence of beta-lactamase alone (0.017 h(-1)). This was explained by the effective protection provided by both inclusion and external association of the host. The interaction, therefore, of penicillins with carboxylated CDs may present a means to lessen the chemical instability of these drugs in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.
16539476,1,2006,J Phys Chem B,Cation distribution in LiMgVO4 and LiZnVO4: structural and spectroscopic study.,The room temperature cation occupancy in LiMgVO(4) and LiZnVO(4) crystallographic sites is obtained by means of the combined use of X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), (7)Li and (51)V magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR), and micro-Raman measurements. In the LiMgVO(4) Cmcm orthorhombic structure, the 4c (C(2)(v) symmetry) tetrahedral vanadium site is fully ordered; on the contrary, the Li 4c tetrahedral site and the 4b (C(2)(h) symmetry) Mg octahedral site display about 22% of reciprocal cationic exchange. Higher cationic disorder is observed in LiZnVO(4): the three cations can distribute on the three tetrahedral and distinct sites of the R-3 structure. XRPD and MAS NMR analysis results highly agree for what concerns vanadium ion distribution on the three cationic sites (about 25, 26, and 47%). From the full profile fitting of XRPD patterns with the Rietveld method, it is also obtained that Li(+) displays a slightly preferred occupation of the T1 position (approximately 55%) and Zn(2+) of the T2 position (approximately 46%). The vibrational spectra of the two compounds are characterized by different peak positions and broadening of the Raman modes, reflecting the cation distribution and the local vibrational unit distortion. A comparison is also made with recent Raman results on Li(3)VO(4). High temperature XRPD measurements rule out possible structural transitions up to 673 K for both compounds.
16468787,1,2006,J Org Chem,Synthesis of azolyl carboximidamides as ligands for Zn(II) and Cu(II): application of the Zn(II) complexes as catalysts for the copolymerization of carbon dioxide and epoxides.,A series of novel S,N-heterocyclic (thiazolyl) substituted carboximidamides 3 and 4 was synthesized in yields up to 82% from specific triazinium salts 1 and primary or secondary amines 2 which additionally bear pyridine or imidazole units. These carboximidamides are used as tailor-made ligands for the complexation of Cu(II) and Zn(II). The coordination behavior of 3 and 4 and the properties of the resulting metal complexes are affected a significant extent especially by the nature of these amine substituents. The most important structural feature of the novel complexes is that the ligation of the metal cations is achieved by a 1,3,5-triazapentadienyl anion system, compare the X-ray structure of the model complex Cu-4d. Analogous Zn(II) complexes 5, 6a, 6b, 6c, 7a, and 7b were obtained from carboximidamides 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, and 4e after reaction with diethylzinc. Interestingly, these Zn(II) complexes possess an intrinsic activity to catalyze the copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide to give polycarbonates 15 (TON up to 113; Turn Over Number: moles of substrate 14 consumed per moles of zinc. Molecular weights: up to 206.10(3) Da). Contaminations of 15 by polyethers are produced only in remarkably small amounts.
16402549,1,2006,Z Naturforsch C,Metabolism of 4-n-nonylphenol by non-modified and CYP1A1- and CYP1A2-transgenic cell cultures of tobacco.,The metabolism of 14C-4-n-nonylphenol (l4C-4-n-NP), as a model for the xenoestrogen nonylphenol, was investigated in three types of tobacco cell suspension cultures: one genetically non-modified culture (NT) and two cultures constitutively expressing human cytochrome P450 CYP1A1 or CYP1A2. With 1 mg l(-1) of 14C-4-n-NP and 24 h of incubation, the xenobiotic was transformed almost completely to glycosides. After glycosidic cleavage, 14C-4-n-NP and several primary metabolites of 4C-4-n-NP were liberated. Portions of the primary metabolites were 29.3% (NT culture), 34.3% (CYP1A1 culture), and 50.7% of applied 14C (CYP1A2 culture). Thus, the endogenous capacity of the tobacco cells to form primary metabolites of 4-n-NP was noticeably higher than that of CYP1A1 or CYP1A2. The results however clearly suggest that 4-n-NP is - even though a poor - substrate of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2. In order to examine metabolic profiles of 4-n-NP in the NT, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 cultures, the suspensions were exposed to 10 mg 1(-1) of 14C-4-n-NP using a two-liquid-phase system with carrier n-hexadecane and 192 h of incubation. Results obtained resembled those of the low concentration study. The oxidative metabolic profiles determined after hydrolytic cleavage using GC-EIMS were similar in the NT, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 cultures. Main metabolites were side-chain mono-hydroxylated derivatives of 4-n-NP with 6'-, 7'- and 8'-OH-4-n-NP as prominent metabolites. In addition, olefinic side-chain hydroxy, ring methoxylated, keto and ring hydroxylated derivatives were observed. The lack of differences in metabolic profiles among the CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and NT cultures was referred to the low enzymatic activity of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 as compared to the higher endogenous oxidative capacity of tobacco, as well as to similar metabolic profiles of 4-n-NP produced by CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 and tobacco itself.
17193241,0,2006,Chem Biodivers,Aggregation of cyclodextrins as an important factor to determine their complexation behavior.,Here, we report a study on the complexation behavior of carotenoids with cyclodextrins (CDs) using solubility experiments and molecular-modelling methods. Carotenoids are an important group of naturally occurring dyes found in vegetables and fruits. Their antioxidant property has initiated investigations on their possible use as drugs. However, carotenoids are lipophilic molecules with very little inherent aqueous solubility. Cyclodextrin complexation has been widely used in order to increase the potential applications of hydrophobic compounds. Thus, the aim of our investigation was to design carotenoids with enhanced water solubility by cyclodextrin complexation. Molecular modelling of carotenoid-cyclodextrin complexes with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry successfully explained the experimentally observed capability of beta-cyclodextrins (beta-CDs) to form complexes with carotenoids as opposed to alpha-cyclodextrins (alpha-CDs) and gamma-cyclodextrins (gamma-CDs). Furthermore, molecular-dynamics calculations revealed that the aggregation properties of CD derivatives significantly influence their complexation behavior. Our docking calculations showed that RAMEB (random methylated beta-CD) is the beta-CD derivative that possesses the lowest tendency to aggregate. Solubility experiments yielded the same results, namely, RAMEB complexes possess the best water solubility. Our results showed that complexation of a ligand not buried inside of the CD cavity is dependent on two factors: i) the geometry of the inclusion part of the complex; ii) the self-aggregation property of the CD itself. The lower affinity the CDs possess for self-aggregation, the more likely are they involved in interactions with carotenoids. These results suggest that self-aggregation of CDs should be considered as an important parameter determining complexation in general.
17148830,0,2006,Phys Med Biol,Effect of electron contamination of a 6 MV x-ray beam on near surface diode dosimetry.,In critical organ in vivo x-ray dosimetry, the relative contaminating electron contribution to the total dose and total detector response outside the field will be different to the corresponding contributions at the central axis detector calibration position, mainly due to the effects of shielding in the linear accelerator head on the electron and x-ray energy spectrum. To investigate these contributions, the electron energy response of a Scanditronix PFD diode was measured using electrons with mean energies from 0.45 to 14.6 MeV, and the Monte Carlo code MCNP-4C was used to calculate the electron energy spectra on the central axis, and at 1 and 10 cm outside the edge of a 4 x 4, 10 x 10 and a 15 x 15 cm(2) 6 MV x-ray field. The electron contribution to the total dose varied from about 8% on the central axis of the smallest field to about 76% at 10 cm outside the edge of the largest field. The electron contribution to the total diode response varied from about 7-8% on the central axis of all three fields to about 58% at 10 cm outside the edge of the smallest field. The results indicated that a near surface x-ray dose measurement with a diode outside the treatment field has to be interpreted with caution and requires knowledge of the relative electron contribution specific to the measurement position and field size.
17139156,0,2006,Yakugaku Zasshi,[How I was enticed into molecular toxicology].,This paper introduces one of our projects performed at Hokkaido University. During the course of pharmacokinetic studies of SM-12502, which was under development as an anti-platelet-activating factor agent, we found three individuals who showed a slow metabolic phenotype in its pharmacokinetics. Analyzing the genes for CYP2A6 from the three, we discovered that they had the whole CYP2A6 gene deletion (CYP2A6*4C). Genetically engineered Salmonella YG7108 cells expressing human P450 were established to compare the mutagen-producing capacity of the P450 enzymes for various N-nitrosamines. We found that CYP2A6 was involved in the metabolic activation of N-nitrosamines with relatively bulky alkyl chains such as a tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), which has been known to cause lung tumors in rodents. Thus, to examine the hypothesis that individuals possessing the CYP2A6*4C have a reduced risk of cancer due to the lack of the metabolic activation of certain carcinogens in tobacco smoke, a case-control study was performed. The results clearly indicated a significant association between the CYP2A6 genotype and lung cancer risk in smokers. In contrast, there was no significant relationship between them in nonsmokers. In addition, our results showed that the reduced risk of cancer was caused by the reduced activity of CYP2A6. Thus it was expected that the inhibition of the enzyme would result in a reduced cancer risk caused by smoking. The results of experiments using mice which were treated with NNK, a carcinogenic nitrosamine contained in tobacco smoke, together with 8-methoxypsolaren, a strong inhibitor of CYP2A6, indicated that the inhibition of CYP2A6 completely abolished the occurrence of adenoma.
18503322,0,2006,J Neurosurg,A simple treatment planning strategy for patients with multiple metastases treated with Gamma Knife surgery.,OBJECT: In a substantial number of patients treated at the authors' facility for brain metastases, additional lesions are identified at the time of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). These lesions are often widely dispersed and may number over 10, which is the maximal number of matrices that can be currently placed for treatment with Leksell Gamma-Plan 4C. The authors describe a simple planning method for GKS in patients with multiple, widely dispersed central nervous system (CNS) metastases.METHODS: Two patients presented with three to five identified recurrent metastases from non-small cell lung carcinoma and breast carcinoma after having received whole-brain radiotherapy. At the time of treatment with GKS in each patient, spoiled-gradient Gd-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed substantially more metastases than originally thought, which were widely scattered throughout all regions of the brain. The authors simplified the treatment planning approach by dividing the entire CNS contents into six contiguous, nonoverlapping matrices, which allowed for the planning, calculation, and treatment of all lesions. Two patients were successfully treated with GKS for more than 10 CNS metastases by using this simple planning method. Differing peripheral doses to varied-size lesions were delivered by prescribing to different isodose curves within any given matrix when required. Dose-volume histograms showed brain doses as follows: 10% of the total brain volume received 5 to 6.4 Gy; 25% received 3.8 to 4.8 Gy; 50% received 2.7 to 3.1 Gy; and 75% received 2.2 to 2.5 Gy.CONCLUSIONS: The delineation of more metastases than appreciated on the diagnostic MR imaging is a common occurrence at the time of GKS at the authors' institution. The treatment of multiple (&gt;10), widely dispersed CNS metastases can be simplified by the placement of multiple, contiguous, non-overlapping matrices, which can be employed to treat lesions in all areas of the brain when separate matrices cannot be utilized.
17088609,0,2006,Acta Crystallogr C,Ca7.96Cu0.04Ge5O18: a new calcium germanate with GeO4 and Ge3O10 units.,The title compound, octacalcium copper pentagermanium octadecaoxide, represents a new intermediate phase between CaO and GeO2, and has not previously been reported in the literature. The structure consists of three different Ge sites, two of them on general 8d positions, site symmetry 1, one on special position 4d, site symmetry 2. Three of the five Ca sites occur on 8d positions, site symmtery 1, one Ca is on 4b with site symmetry -1 and one Ca is on 4c with site symmetry 2. All nine O atoms have symmetry 1 (8d position). By sharing common edges, the Ca sites form infinite bands parallel to the c axis, and these bands are interconnected by isolated GeO4 and Ge3O10 units.

17083218,0,2006,Inorg Chem,Fluoride abstraction and reversible photochemical reduction of cationic uranyl(VI) phosphine oxide complexes.,The syntheses, structural and spectroscopic characterization, fluoride abstraction reactions, and photochemical reactivity of cationic uranyl(VI) phosphine oxide complexes are described. [UO2(OPPh3)4][X]2 (1a, X = OTf; 1b, X = BF4) and [UO2(dppmo)2(OPPh3)][X]2 (2a, X = OTf; 2b, X = BF(4)) are prepared from the corresponding uranyl(VI) chloride precursor and 2 equiv each of AgX and phosphine oxide. The BF4- compounds 1b and 2b are prone to fluoride abstraction reactions in methanol, leading to dinuclear fluoride-bridged uranyl(VI) complexes. Fluoride abstraction of 2b in methanol generates two structural isomers of the fluoride-bridged uranyl(VI) dimer [(UO2(dppmo)2)2(mu-F)][BF4]3 (4), both of which have been structurally characterized. In the major isomer 4C, the four dppmo ligands are all chelating, while in the minor isomer 4B, two of the dppmo ligands bridge adjacent uranyl(VI) centers. Photolysis of 2b in methanol proceeds through 4 to form the uranium(IV) fluoride complex [UO2F2(dppmo)3][BF4]2 (5), involving another fluoride abstraction step. X-ray crystallography shows 5 to be a rare example of a structurally characterized uranium(IV) complex possessing terminal U-F bonds. Complex 5 reverts to 4 in solution upon exposure to air.
17050184,0,2006,Nat Prod Res,Synthesis and anti-inflammatory activities investigation of sinomenine derivatives on ring C.,Eighteen sinomenine derivatives on ring C were prepared, and their anti-inflammatory activities were also investigated. Most of these derivatives showed mild to moderate activities. Compounds 4a, 4c and 5b showed better anti-inflammatory activity. So further modification of the ring C in sinomenine should be worthwhile.
17037346,0,2006,Nihon Arukoru Yakubutsu Igakkai Zasshi,[The relationship between smoking behavior in young people and CYP2A6 gene polymorphisms, between them and personality traits assessed by NEO-FFI].,We performed a survey on nicotine dependence among young students. We examined the CYP2A6 gene polymorphism using PCR-RFLP. We examined the personality traits using NEO-FFI. Samples were taken from young students of which 87 were smokers and 142 were non-smokers and we tried to clarify the relationship between the nicotine metabolizing ability (CYP2A6), personality, and smoking behavior. As a result, the frequency of the CYP2A6*4C gene was significantly higher among non-smokers than smokers, and the Openness score by NEO-FFI was higher among smokers than non-smokers. We concluded that the CYP2A6*4C gene and the Openness personality trait may be a cause of smoking among the young smokers. Therefore, there is a possibility that smoking behavior in youths may be affected not only by the CYP2A6 gene but also by the Openness personality trait.
16999431,0,2006,Inorg Chem,Mono- and dinuclear oxovanadium(V)calixarene complexes and their activity as oxidation catalysts.,The background of the investigation is constituted by reactive moieties and intermediates playing relevant roles on the surfaces of vanadiumoxide-based catalysts during the oxygenation/dehydrogenation of organic substrates. With the aim of modeling such species, a series of mono- and dinuclear charged and uncharged vanadium oxo complexes containing p-tert-butylated calix[4]arene and calix[8]arene ligands (denoted H4B and H8B' ', respectively, in the protonated forms) has been synthesized and characterized: PPh4[O=VB] ((PPh41), O=VB(OAc) (2), PPh4[O2V2HB' '] (3), and [mu-O(O=V(OMe))2B(Me2)] (4), where superscripts OAc and Me2 indicate that one or two protons of H4B are substituted by these residues, respectively. These compounds were analyzed both in solution and by means of single-crystal X-ray crystallography; it turned out that the crystal structures are retained on dissolution (2 changed only from the paco to the cone structure). In the case of 4, it could be shown that the bulk product consists of a mixture of two isomers (4t and 4c) differing in the relative positions of the vanadium-bound methoxy groups. Subsequently, all compounds were tested as catalysts for the oxidation of alcohols with O2. It turned out that the two dinuclear complexes efficiently catalyze the oxidation of 1-phenyl-1-propargyl alcohol and fluorenol; in addition, they even show some activity with respect to the oxidation of dihydroanthracene. This may hint to a higher activity of dinuclear sites on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts as well.
16972097,0,2006,Plant Cell Rep,In vitro culture of tobacco callus on medium containing peptone and phytate leads to growth improvement and higher genetic stability.,Growth and genetic stability of Nicotiana tabacum L. callus were strongly improved by replacing the inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus of the Murashige and Skoog's medium by a soybean peptone and phytate, respectively. Cell proliferation after subcultivation on the modified medium was highly stimulated as evidenced by a strong biomass increase; this improvement was mainly due to the organic N source. In addition, while calluses grown under standard conditions displayed various cell sizes and DNA contents, subcultivation on the modified medium led to homogeneous cell size distribution and stable 4C-8C DNA contents through several subcultures. This improved genetic stability was due to replacement of inorganic P by phytate, provided the presence of peptone. Such new media composition could be useful for slow-growing cell suspensions or calluses.

16933948,0,2006,Inorg Chem,Diligating tripodal amido-phosphine ligands: the effect of a proximal antipodal early transition metal on phosphine donor ability in a building block for heterometallic complexes.,The ligand precursors P(CH2NH-3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)3 (1a), P(CH2NHPh)3 (1b), and P(CH2NH-3,5-Me2C6H3)3 (1c), react with the reagents Ti(NMe2)4 and tBuN=Ta(NEt2)3 to generate metal complexes of the type P(CH2NAr(R))3TiNMe2 (2a-c) and P(CH2NAr(R))3Ta=NtBu (3a-c) (where Ar(R) = 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3, Ph, and 3,5-Me2C6H3). Due to ring strain, the phosphine lone pair cannot chelate and is available to bind a second metal, and this feature can be utilized to synthesize heterometallic polynuclear complexes. The 31P chemical shifts observed upon complexation of the early transition metals to the amido donors are large and in the opposite direction expected for the increased C-P-C bond angles in these complexes; these unusual shifts are due to P-Ti and P-Ta distances that are significantly shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii. The reaction of 2c with Ni(CO)4 produces at first the bimetallic complex (CO)3Ni[P(CH2N-3,5-Me2C6H3)3TiNMe2] (4c), which gradually converts to the trimetallic complex (CO)2Ni[P(CH2N-3,5-Me2C6H3)3TiNMe2]2 (5c). The effect of the complexation of Ti and Ta fragments on the donor ability of the phosphine ligand was determined by the preparation of the bis-phosphine complexes trans-L(2)Rh(CO)Cl, (where L = 1a-c, 2a-c, and 3a-c) prepared by the reaction of the appropriate phosphine with [Rh(CO)2(mu-Cl)]2, and a measurement of the resultant CO stretching frequencies. Surprisingly, the complexes with the larger C-P-C angles are significantly poorer donors. Density functional theory calculations were performed to determine what factors affect the donor ability of the phosphine and if through-space interactions might play an important role in the observed electronic properties.
16925431,0,2006,J Am Chem Soc,Donor stabilized borylnitrene: a highly reactive BN analogue of vinylidene.,A donor atom stabilized borylnitrene, 2-nitreno-1,3,2-benzodioxaborole 4c, is characterized by matrix isolation IR, UV, and ESR spectroscopy as well as multiconfiguration SCF and CI computations. UV irradiation (lambda = 254 nm) of the corresponding azide 6c, isolated in solid argon at 10 K, produces 4c in high yield. The oxygen donor atoms in 4c result in a triplet ground state (|D/hc| = 1.492 cm(-)(1), |E/hc| = 0.004 cm(-)(1)) for the borylnitrene. The lowest energy singlet state ((1)A(1)) is 33 kcal mol(-)(1) higher in energy and closely related to the ground state of vinylidene. Under the conditions of matrix isolation, triplet 4c is photochemically and thermally stable toward rearrangement to the corresponding cyclic iminoborane. Photochemical irradiation (lambda &gt; 550 nm) of 4c rather causes an efficient reaction with molecular nitrogen, lying in matrix sites nearby, to give 6c. Similarly, photochemical, but not thermal, trapping of 4c with CO is possible and results in the corresponding isocycanate 9c. Thermal reaction of 4c with O(2) in doped argon matrixes at 35 K could be observed by IR spectroscopy to result in borylnitroso-O-oxide 17c as shown by (18)O(2) labeling experiments and DFT computations. The diradical 17c is very photolabile and quickly rearranges to the nitritoborane 16c upon irradiation.
16878963,0,2006,Inorg Chem,Titanium and zirconium complexes of a phosphorus-containing p-tert-butylcalix[5]arene ligand: importance of metal and conformation on ligand/metal binding.,Binding of a calix[5]arene containing a single phosphorus ligand and three hydroxyl groups, calix[5]PNMe2(OH)3, 1, toward titanium and zirconium is investigated to yield insight into the factors that determine the strength of the phosphorus/metal interaction within the constraint of the calix[5]arene. Treatment of 1 with tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium yields three complexes, 4a, 4b, and 4c, each of which shows the loss of 3 mol of dimethylamine in the reaction with the titanium bound to three oxygens. Treatment of 1 with tetrakis(diethylamino)zirconium proceeds similarly, although only two products, 5a and 5b, were isolated. X-ray structures of the products were obtained. Complexes 4a and 5a show similar geometries, with the calix[5]arene in an approximate cone conformation and the phosphorus lone pair directed toward the metal. The P...M distances are, however, markedly different: 3.69 A in 4a and 3.18 A in 5a, the former indicative of no interaction and the latter a weak one. Complexes 4b and 5b each are dimers, featuring a planar four-membered M-O-M-O ring; however, the titanium is five-coordinate in 4b with no phosphorus/metal bond, while the zirconium in 5b is six-coordinate with a P-Zr distance of 2.95 A. Complex 4c is monomeric with the calix[5]arene in an approximate 1,2-alternate conformation with a P...Ti distance of 2.90 A. The two most significant aspects controlling the phosphorus/metal contact are the metal, with the larger zirconium showing stronger interaction, and the calix[5]arene conformation, with the cone conformation showing the weaker interaction.
16872076,0,2006,Med Phys,Characterization of moderator assembly dimension for accelerator boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumors using 7Li(p, n) neutrons at proton energy of 2.5 MeV.,The characteristics of moderator assembly dimension are investigated for the usage of 7Li(p,n) neutrons by 2.5 MeV protons in boron newtron capture therapy (BNCT) of brain tumors in the present study. The indexes checked are treatable protocol depth (TPD), which is the greatest depth of the region satisfying the dose requirements in BNCT protocol, proton current necessary to complete BNCT by 1 h irradiation, and the heat flux deposited in the Li target which should be removed. Assumed materials are D2O for moderator, and mixture of polyethylene and LiF with 50 wt % for collimator. Dose distributions have been computed with MCNP 4B and 4C codes. Consequently, realized TPD does not show a monotonical tendency for the Li target diameter. However, the necessary proton current and heat flux in the Li target decreases as the Li target diameter increases, while this trend reverses at around 10 cm of the Li target diameter for the necessary proton current in the condition of this study. As to the moderator diameter, TPD does not exhibit an apparent dependence. On the other hand, necessary proton current and heat flux decrease as the moderator diameter increases, and this tendency saturates at around 60 cm of the moderator diameter in this study. As to the collimator, increase in inner diameter is suitable from the viewpoint of increasing TPD and decreasing necessary proton current and heat flux, while these indexes do not show apparent difference for collimator inner diameters over 14 cm for the parameters treated here. The practical viewpoint in selecting the parameters of moderator assembly dimension is to increase TPD, within the technically possible condition of accelerated proton current and heat removal from the Li target. In this process, the values for which the resultant characteristics mentioned above saturate or reverse would be important factors.
16851837,0,2006,J Phys Chem B,Single electron traps at the surface of polycrystalline MgO: assignment of the main trapping sites.,Paramagnetic centers at the surface of ionic oxides in the form of trapped electrons can be generated by exposure of the material to alkali metal or hydrogen atoms or of molecular hydrogen under UV irradiation. For many years, it has been assumed that the resulting paramagnetic centers consist of oxygen vacancies filled by one electron. High-resolution electron spin resonance spectra and ab initio quantum chemical calculations show that the paramagnetic centers consist of (H(+))(e(-)) electron pairs formed at morphological irregularities of the surface. At least three different kinds of (H(+))(e(-)) centers, [A], [B], and [C], have been identified with abundances of 80%, 10%, and 8%, respectively. In this work, we compare a wide set of measured and computed g-factors and hyperfine coupling constants of the unpaired electron with the surrounding (25)Mg, (17)O, and (1)H nuclei and we propose a general assignment of the centers. (H(+))(e(-)) pairs formed at Mg(4c) ions at steps and edges account for species [A], centers formed at Mg(4c) ions at reverse corners correspond to species [B], and species [C] originates from (H(+))(e(-)) pairs formed at Mg(3c) ions at corners and kinks.
16841493,0,2006,Tsitologiia,[Human large intestine adenocarcinoma cells (CaCo-2) in the process of cultivation].,Using cytomorphometry and cytophotometry cells of human large intestine adenocarcinoma (CaCo-2) were studied under condition of a 10 day cultivation. A reverse dependence was established between proliferative activity and monolayer density. The increase of the latter inhibits proliferation and promotes the formation of islets of polymorph cells. 2c-cells could be seen only at the beginning of culture growth; a larger part of cells polyploidized by cell blocking in G2-phase. These cells do not divide, which is testified by the absence of 2c-cells, but some part of 4c-cells start the next cycle, accumulates 8c-DNA and then divides, replenishing the 4c-cells population. In the process of cultivation, we observed an increase in the number and total volume of nucleoli in the nuclei, and a rise in DNA amount in the peri-nucleolar chromatin. The formation of numerous 4c-cells with multi-nucleolar nuclei may define an increase of functional activity of CaCo-2 culture as the whole, whereas the formation of separated groups of such cells in the monolayer may denote a possible initiation of their differentiation.
16834263,0,2006,J Phys Chem A,Structure, strain, and degenerate rearrangement of tricyclo[2.1.0.0 1,3]pentasilane and related molecules.,We theoretically investigate a highly strained tricyclic silane (tricyclo[2.1.0.0 1,3]pentasilane (4b), an isomer of pentasila[1.1.1]propellane (3b)) composed of three fused three-membered rings. The central ring is distorted. One of the fusion bonds in the central ring is shorter than the normal Si-Si single bond (2.350 A) whereas the other is as long as the fusion bonds in bicyclo[1.1.0]tetrasilane (2b) (2.860 A) and 3b (2.778 A). The tricyclic silane is less strained than the carbon congener and more strained than the isomer 3b. The electron delocalization between one of the fusion bonds and the geminal Si-Si ring bonds elongates the fusion bond and stabilizes the molecules to reduce the strain. The silanes composed of the fused three-membered rings are less strained than the carbon congener. A degenerate rearrangement of a three-membered ring is predicted. The enthalpy of activation of the rearrangement of the distorted central ring is low (7.2 kcal/mol) for 4b, but appreciable (22.3 kcal/mol) for the germanium congener, tricyclo[2.1.0.0(1,3)]pentagermane (4c). We investigate the effects of the substituents on the distortion of the central three-membered ring and the degenerate rearrangement.
16833553,0,2006,J Phys Chem A,Quantum chemical and master equation simulations of the oxidation and isomerization of vinoxy radicals.,The vinoxy radical, a common intermediate in gas-phase alkene ozonolysis, reacts with O2 to form a chemically activated alpha-oxoperoxy species. We report CBS-QB3 energetics for O2 addition to the parent (*CH2CHO, 1a), 1-methylvinoxy (*CH2COCH3, 1b), and 2-methylvinoxy (CH3*CHCHO, 1c) radicals. CBS-QB3 predictions for peroxy radical formation agree with experimental data, while the G2 method systematically overestimates peroxy radical stability. RRKM/master equation simulations based on CBS-QB3 data are used to estimate the competition between prompt isomerization and thermalization for the peroxy radicals derived from 1a, 1b, and 1c. The lowest energy isomerization pathway for radicals 4a and 4c (derived from 1a and 1c, respectively) is a 1,4-shift of the acyl hydrogen requiring 19-20 kcal/mol. The resulting hydroperoxyacyl radical decomposes quantitatively to form *OH. The lowest energy isomerization pathway for radical 4b (derived from 1b) is a 1,5-shift of a methyl hydrogen requiring 26 kcal/mol. About 25% of 4a, but only approximately 5% of 4c, isomerizes promptly at 1 atm pressure. Isomerization of 4b is negligible at all pressures studied.

16783838,0,2006,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis of beta-hydroxypropanoic acid derivatives as potential anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antimicrobial agents.,A series of new 3-(substituted) 3-hydroxy-propanoic acid ethyl esters 1a-c, hydrazides 2a-c, thiosemicarbazides 3a-f, and semicarbazides 3g, 3h has been synthesized. Cyclization of compounds 3a-d in basic medium yielded 1,2,4-triazole-5-thiones 4a-d. On the other hand, reaction of hydrazides 2a-c with CS(2 )in basic medium afforded 1,3,4-oxadiazole-5-thiones 5a-c. All the synthesized compounds were characterized by their physical and spectral analyses data. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antimicrobial activities. Compounds 1c, 3g, 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5c exhibited comparable anti-inflammatory activity to that of indomethacin and compounds 1c, 4c, and 5c were more analgesics than acetyl salicylic acid. Compounds 4b, 4c, and 5c showed superior GI safety profile (33.3%, 33.3% and 50.0% ulceration) than that of indomethacin (100% ulceration) at 100 mg/kg oral dose. Compounds 4b, 4c, and 5c were also non-toxic with a median lethal dose (LD(50)) up to 200 mg/kg. The antibacterial and antifungal screenings identified compounds 3c, 4b, 4d, 5a, and 5b as the most effective against a variety of tested microorganisms.
16713275,0,2006,Appl Radiat Isot,Analysis of neutron and gamma-ray streaming along the maze of NRCAM thallium production target room.,Study of the shield performance of a thallium-203 production target room has been investigated in this work. Neutron and gamma-ray equivalent dose rates at various points of the maze are calculated by simulating the transport of streaming neutrons, and photons using Monte Carlo method. For determination of neutron and gamma-ray source intensities and their energy spectrum, we have applied SRIM 2003 and ALICE91 computer codes to Tl target and its Cu substrate for a 145 microA of 28.5 MeV protons beam. The MCNP/4C code has been applied with neutron source term in mode n p to consider both prompt neutrons and secondary gamma-rays. Then the code is applied for the prompt gamma-rays as the source term. The neutron-flux energy spectrum and equivalent dose rates for neutron and gamma-rays in various positions in the maze have been calculated. It has been found that the deviation between calculated and measured dose values along the maze is less than 20%.
16711385,0,2006,Tsitologiia,[A study of DNA depolyploidization and depolytenization of the heterochromatized gonosomal chromatin bodies in the secondary giant trophoblast cells of the field vole Microtus rossiaemeridionalis using cytophotometry].,A study was made of the distribution of the heterochromatized gonosomal chromatin bodies (GCB) material in the course of nuclear fragmentation of secondary giant trophoblast cells resulting in polykaryocyte formation at the late stage of their differentiation. A simultaneous DNA cytophotometry in GCBs and nuclear fragments showed a progressive GCB DNA content decrease proportional to that of DNA content in nuclear fragments. DNA contents in the nuclear fragments corresponded to 2c, 4c and 8c. In most cases 1-2 GCBs were found in the nuclear fragments of different ploidy levels. Both the total DNA content in GCBs and the DNA content in separate GCBs well correlated with the ploidy levels of fragments. The data obtained demonstrate a regular, whole-genome distribution of chromosomal materials into the nuclear fragments exemplified by sex chromosome distribution in compliance with the ploidy of nuclear fragments. We discuss a possible mechanism of nuclear fragmentation that may ensure substantially a balanced genome of nuclear fragments without leading to mitotic cycle renewal in the giant trophoblast cell population.
16708841,0,2006,Tsitologiia,[Kinetic features of a white rat hepatocyte population under hormonal disbalance before and after partial hepatectomy].,Bilateral adrenalectomy, followed in 4 days by a partial hepatectomy, was performed using white rats weighing as much as 120-140 g. Under hormonal disbalance caused by bilateral adrenalectomy, the number of polyploid (4c, 4c x 2, and 8c) hepatocytes significantly increased, compared to that in non-operated control rats. Six hours after a partial hepatectomy, the share of highly ploid hepatocytes falls, being accompanied by a 9-fold increase in mitotic index. It is supposed that under hormonal disbalance condition, a partial hepatectomy may induce &quot;early&quot; mitoses in hepatocytes blocked in G2-phase of the cell cycle.
16702246,0,2006,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Dosimetry at the Portuguese research reactor using thermoluminescence measurements and Monte Carlo calculations.,This work presents an extensive study on Monte Carlo radiation transport simulation and thermoluminescent (TL) dosimetry for characterising mixed radiation fields (neutrons and photons) occurring in nuclear reactors. The feasibility of these methods is investigated for radiation fields at various locations of the Portuguese Research Reactor (RPI). The performance of the approaches developed in this work is compared with dosimetric techniques already existing at RPI. The Monte Carlo MCNP-4C code was used for a detailed modelling of the reactor core, the fast neutron beam and the thermal column of RPI. Simulations using these models allow to reproduce the energy and spatial distributions of the neutron field very well (agreement better than 80%). In the case of the photon field, the agreement improves with decreasing intensity of the component related to fission and activation products. (7)LiF:Mg,Ti, (7)LiF:Mg,Cu,P and Al(2)O(3):Mg,Y TL detectors (TLDs) with low neutron sensitivity are able to determine photon dose and dose profiles with high spatial resolution. On the other hand, (nat)LiF:Mg,Ti TLDs with increased neutron sensitivity show a remarkable loss of sensitivity and a high supralinearity in high-intensity fields hampering their application at nuclear reactors.

16675194,0,2006,Biomed Pharmacother,Prevention of the interaction between HVEM, herpes virus entry mediator, and gD, HSV envelope protein, by a Keggin polyoxotungstate, PM-19.,One of the Keggin-type heteropolyoxotungstates (K7[PTi2W10O40]6H2O:PM-19) is a potent inhibitor of the replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) both standard strain 169 and the thymidine kinase-defective strain YS-4C-1 in vitro and in vivo. HSV envelope protein, gD, is necessary for virus entry into the cells. Some cellular molecules, such as HVEM, were reported to act as cofactors during the viral entry step. We determined whether PM-19 prevents these interactions between HSV-gD and HVEM. These activities were investigated using the Ciphergen and BIACORE system. Using a protein chip, many kinds of gD-specific binding proteins were captured, but these proteins could not be identified. Several proteins in these gD-binding proteins were inhibited its interaction with gD due to the presence of PM-19. Using the BIACORE system, the affinity of PM-19 to gD was low, because PM-19 has no direct inactivation activity against the virion. The specific binding of HVEM to the gD was shown as KD of 1.1e-9. The affinity of PM-19 for HVEM was high (KD:2e-9). To determine the competitive binding, the PM-19 (10 microg/ml) and several concentrations of HVEM solution mixtures were injected over the gD-fixed sensor surface. Each binding signal was stable in the range of approximately 270-300 RU. In the case of the addition of PM-19 to HVEM solution, the binding signals were elevated by PM-19 dose dependently. These results suggest that the bindings of PM-19 to gD are not disturbed by the presence of HVEM. PM-19 prevents the interaction between HVEM and gD.

16604702,0,2006,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Modelling of radiation field around spent fuel container.,Operation of nuclear reactors leads to the production of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). There are two basic strategies of SNF management: ultimate disposal of SNF in geological formations and recycle or repeated utilisation of reprocessed SNF. In both options, there is an urgent necessity to study radiation properties of SNF. Information about SNF radiation properties is required at all stages of SNF management. In order to reach more effective utilisation of nuclear materials, new fuel cycles are under development based on uranium-plutonium, uranium-thorium and some other types of nuclear fuel. These promising types of nuclear fuel are characterised by quite different radiation properties at all the stages of nuclear fuel cycle (NFC) listed above. So, comparative analysis is required for radiation properties of different nuclear fuel types at different NFC stages. The results presented here were obtained from the numerical analysis of the radiation field around transport containers of different SNF types and in SNF storage. The calculations are carried out with the application of the computer code packages SCALE-4.3 and MCNP-4C. Comparison of the dose parameters obtained for different models of the transport container with experimental data allowed us to make certain conclusions about the errors of numerical results caused by the approximate geometrical description of the transport container.
16604600,0,2006,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Calculation of the store house worker dose in a lost wax foundry using MCNP-4C.,Lost wax casting is an industrial process which permits the transmutation into metal of models made in wax. The wax model is covered with a silicaceous shell of the required thickness and once this shell is built the set is heated and wax melted. Liquid metal is then cast into the shell replacing the wax. When the metal is cool, the shell is broken away in order to recover the metallic piece. In this process zircon sands are used for the preparation of the silicaceous shell. These sands have varying concentrations of natural radionuclides: 238U, 232Th and 235U together with their progenics. The zircon sand is distributed in bags of 50 kg, and 30 bags are on a pallet, weighing 1,500 kg. The pallets with the bags have dimensions 80 cm x 120 cm x 80 cm, and constitute the radiation source in this case. The only pathway of exposure to workers in the store house is external radiation. In this case there is no dust because the bags are closed and covered by plastic, the store house has a good ventilation rate and so radon accumulation is not possible. The workers do not touch with their hands the bags and consequently skin contamination will not take place. In this study all situations of external irradiation to the workers have been considered; transportation of the pallets from vehicle to store house, lifting the pallets to the shelf, resting of the stock on the shelf, getting down the pallets, and carrying the pallets to production area. Using MCNP-4C exposure situations have been simulated, considering that the source has a homogeneous composition, the minimum stock in the store house is constituted by 7 pallets, and the several distances between pallets and workers when they are at work. The photons flux obtained by MCNP-4C is multiplied by the conversion factor of Flux to Kerma for air by conversion factor to Effective Dose by Kerma unit, and by the number of emitted photons. Those conversion factors are obtained of ICRP 74 table 1 and table 17 respectively. This is the way to obtain a function giving dose rate around the source.

When the {O3P(CH2)(n)PO3}4- diphosphonate tether length n is 2-5, metal-oxide hybrids of type 1, [V2O2(H2O){O3P(CH2)(n)PO3}] x xH2O, are isolated. The type 1 oxides exhibit the prototypical three-dimensional (3-D) &quot;pillared&quot; layer architecture. When n is increased to 6-8, the two-dimensional (2-D) &quot;pillared&quot; slab structure of the type 2 oxides [V2O2(H2O)4{O3P(CH2)6PO3}] is encountered. Further lengthening of the spacer to n = 9 provides another 3-D structure, type 3, constructed from the condensation of pillared slabs to give V-P-O double layers as the network substructure. When organic cations are introduced to provide charge balance for anionic V-P-O networks, oxides of types 4-7 are observed. For spacer length n = 3, a range of organodiammonium cations are accommodated by the same 3-D &quot;pillared&quot; layer oxovanadium diphosphonate framework in the type 4 materials [H3N(CH2)(n)NH3][V4O4(OH)2 {O3P(CH)3PO3}2] x xH2O [n = 2, x = 6 (4a); n = 3, x = 3 (4b); n = 4, x = 2 (4c); n = 5, x = 1 (4d); n = 6, x = 0.5 (4e); n = 7, x = 0 (4f)] and [H3NR]y[V4O4(OH)2 {O3P(CH)3PO3}2] x xH2O [R = -CH2(NH3)CH2CH3, y = 1, x = 0 (4g); R = -CH3, n = 2, x = 3 (4h); R = -CH2CH3, y = 2, x = 1 (4i); R = -CH2CH2CH3, y = 2, x = 0 (4j); cation = [H2N(CH2CH3)2], y = 2, x = 0 (4k)]. These oxides exhibit two distinct interlamellar domains, one occupied by the cations and the second by water of crystallization. Furthermore, as the length of the cation increases, the organodiammonium component spills over into the hydrophilic domain to displace the water of crystallization. When the diphosphonate tether length is increased to n = 5, structure type 5, [H3N(CH2)2NH3][V4O4(OH)2(H2O){O3P(CH2)5PO3}2] x H2O, is obtained. This oxide possesses a 2-D &quot;pillared&quot; network or slab structure, similar in gross profile to that of type 2 oxides and with the cations occupying the interlamellar domain. In contrast, shortening the diphosphonate tether length to n = 2 results in the 3-D oxovanadium organophosphonate structure of the type 7 oxide [H3N(CH2)5NH3][V3O3{O3P(CH2)2PO3}2]. The ethylenediphosphonate ligand does not pillar V-P-O networks in this instance but rather chelates to a vanadium center in the construction of complex polyhedral connectivity of 7. Substitution of piperazinium cations for the simple alkyl chains of types 4, 5, and 7 provides the 2-D pillared layer structure of the type 6 oxides, [H2N(CH2CH2)NH2][V2O2{O3P(CH)(n)PO3H}2] [n = 2 (6a); n = 4 (6b); n = 6 (6c)]. The structural diversity of the system is reflected in the magnetic properties and thermal behavior of the oxides, which are also discussed.
16602238,0,2006,Tsitologiia,[Morpho-functional parameters of nucleoli in polyploid mucous and albumen cells of salivary gland in the snail Succinea lauta].,Variation of some characteristics of nucleoli of polyploid mucous and albumen cells was examined in salivary glands of the snail Succinea lauta. The number, total area and Ag-protein content of nucleoli, and DNA content in each nucleus were estimated on squashed preparations incubated with AgNO3, decolorized and then Feulgen stained. The ultrastructure of nucleoli was studied by electron microscopy. Differentiated mucous cells had 4c-8c-16c-32c nuclei; albumen cells had 8c-16c-32c-64c-128c nuclei. The ultrastructure of nucleoli of the two cell types was essentially the same. Normally, a large fibrous to granular zone was observed in the nucleoli, without a clear distinction between fibrous and granular components. At the same time, aggregations of granular matter could be discerned at the periphery of nucleoli. No fibrous centers were observed. Occassionally, nucleolonema-like structures occurred. Normally each nucleolus contacted several chromosomes. On squashed preparations, the least size of nucleoli was 2-3 microm, and the largest size amounted to 14 microm in mucous cells, and to 50-80 microm in albumen cells. The number of nucleoli rose from 1-2 in tetraploid nuclei to 2-3 in 32c-nuclei, and to 5-7 in 128c-nuclei. The disparity between the ploidy levels of nuclei and the numbers of nucleoli may be due, presumably, to aggregation of chromosome NORs. The Ag-protein content in the nucleoli, and the total nucleolar area displayed a strong mutual correlation. Both parameters differed significantly by 1.5-2.2 times in mucous and albumen cells of the same ploidy level. Thus, in albumen and mucous cells the total Ag-protein content in octaploid nuclei was 3.3 and 2.2 relative units (r. u.), respectively. In 16c- and 32c-nuclei of albumen cells, it was 7.6 and 15.1 r. u.; and in the same nuclei of mucous cells--3.8 and 6.8 r. u., respectively. On the whole, in albumen cells, in the course of 4 endocycles (4c-128c), the total Ag-protein content increased by 17 times. Therefore, the mean multiplication factor for this parameter was found to be 2.05 per endocycle. In mucous cells, in the course of 3 endocycles (4c-32c), the total Ag-protein content increased by 5.2 times against 8 times expected, with the mean multiplication factor equal to 1.75 per endocycle. Thus, in the course of polyploidization of albumen and mucous cell nuclei, the gene dosage effect was fully pronounced in the former, and only partly in the latter. This differtence is due obviously to peculiarities of differentiation of the two cell types, in particular, to differences in the number of activated ribosomal genes.
16595947,0,2006,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo),Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of iodinated derivatives of piperazine as a new ligand for sigma receptor imaging by single photon emission computed tomography.,A new series of radioiodinated analogues of 1-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine (SA4503) was synthesized and evaluated as a potential brain sigma-1 receptor imaging ligands by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Iodinated analogues of SA4503 (4a-c) were prepared from piperazine in a high yield. The in vitro competition binding studies using [3H] DTG (sigma-1, 2), [3H] (+)-pentazocine (sigma-1), and [3H] DTG in the presence of carbetapentane (sigma-2) as sigma receptor selective radioligands were revealed that iodinated analogues 4a-c possess high affinities to sigma receptors (IC50: 4a=7.1, 4b=31.0, and 4c=77.3 nM). In particular, the affinity of 4a, bearing iodine at ortho position on the phenyl ring, was 4.4 times greater than SA4503, and 3 times greater than that of haloperidol. The meta-iodo analogue 4b was the same to SA4503, the lead compound. The radioiodinated derivatives, [125I] 4a, 4b were synthesized no-carrier-added from the corresponding tributyltin precursors by the iododestannylation reaction with high yields. The binding of [125I] 4a, 4b have been characterized in the rat brain membranes. These compounds were indicated single population binding to sigma receptor with high affinity (4a: Kd=1.86+/-0.34 nM, Bmax=205+/-28.9 fmol/mg protein, 4b: Kd=3.30+/-0.51 nM, Bmax=231.5+/-13.8 fmol/mg protein). In vitro blocking studies were confirmed that the high specificity of 4a, 4b. These results suggest that radioiodinated 4a and 4b are promising sigma receptors imaging ligand for pursuing further in vivo studies.
16586426,0,2006,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis of some novel azo derivatives of 3,5-dimethyl-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyrazole as potent analgesic agents.,A series of 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3,5-dimethylpyrazolylazo derivatives, incorporating thiosemicarbazide 2a-c, 1,3,4-thiadiazole 3a-c, and 1,2,4-triazole-3-thione 4a-c were synthesized. The structure of these novel synthesized compounds 2a-c, 3a-c, and 4a-c was confirmed by spectral analysis. All these compounds were screened for their analgesic activity. Hot-plate and tail-immersion tests were used for the determination of the analgesic activity. Morphine, an analgesic through both spinal and supraspinal pathways, was used as a standard test drug. All compounds were administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg i.p. Among the compounds, 2-(butylamino)-5-[((1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3,5-dimethylpyrazole-4-yl)azo)phenyl]-1,3,4-thiadiazole 3a and 4-[((1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3,5-dimethylpyrazole-4-yl)azo)phenyl]-4-(2-phenethyl)-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione 4c showed analgesic effects in both tests. Especially 4c exerted strong analgesia starting at 30 min after injection.
16572481,0,2006,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis and biological evaluation of heteroaryldiamides and heteroaryldiamines as cytotoxic agents, apoptosis inducers and caspase-3 activators.,The work described here involved the synthesis and biological evaluation of new heteroaryldiamides and heteroaryldiamines. A new general model in which the structures can be adjusted has been applied in this study. Three different structural units can be distinguished: a central nucleus and two symmetric terminal units. The central element is either an aliphatic chain of varying length and flexibility, piperazine, or a polyamine nucleus. However, the terminal units are pyridine, quinoline, indole, benzene or pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine with different substituents. The antitumoural activities of the compounds were evaluated in vitro by examining their cytotoxic effects against human breast, colon, and bladder cancer cell lines. Compounds that showed cytotoxic activity were subjected to both apoptosis and caspase-3 assays. With regard to selectivity, the cytotoxicity was also determined in cell cultures of two nontumoural lines. The most promising compounds are 4c, 5c and 7, which are amino-pyridinium, quinolyl-N-oxide, and pyridyl derivatives, respectively, and these reveal a significant in vitro cytotoxicity in at least two of the three cell lines tested. These compounds induced apoptosis and also produced a rapid dose-dependent increase in the caspase-3 level in HT-29 cells. Other encouraging profiles were found, such as those presented by 1k and 8d, which are cytotoxic and apoptotic but do not provoke an increase in the level of caspase-3, or those presented by 2f, 3c and 4a, which are slightly cytotoxic but do not show any other significant activity. The different types of behaviour of each compound are not necessarily parallel in the three cell lines tested.
16572478,0,2006,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis of new 3-(substituted phenacyl)-5-[3'-(4H-4-oxo-1-benzopyran-2-yl)-benzylidene]-2,4-thiazolidinediones and their antimicrobial activity.,Synthesis of 3-(3-nitrophenacyl)thiazolidine-2,4-dione 2g and 3-(substituted phenacyl)-5-[3'-(4H-4-oxo-1-benzopyran-2-yl)-benzylidene]-2,4-thiazolidinediones 4a-g are reported in this paper. These compounds 4a-g were prepared from 3'-flavone carboxaldehyde and 3-substituted phenacyl-2,4-thiazolidinediones using Knoevenagel reaction. The structures of all compounds were confirmed by IR, 1H-NMR, mass spectral data, and elemental analyses. The molecules 4a-g were evaluated for in-vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis. Compounds 4c and 4f showed better inhibitory activity when compared to fluconazole against Candida krusei and Candida glabrata.
16562909,0,2006,Org Lett,4,5,6,7-Tetrachlorobenzo[d][1,3,2]dioxaborol- 2-ol as an effective catalyst for the amide condensation of sterically demanding carboxylic acids.,[reaction: see text] 4,5,6,7-Tetrachlorobenzo[d][1,3,2]dioxaborole (4a) and 4,5,6,7-tetrachlorobenzo[d][1,3,2]dioxaborol-2-ol (4b) are effective catalysts for the dehydrative amide condensation between an equimolar mixture of carboxylic acids and amines. In particular, these catalysts are greatly superior to 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (1) for the amide condensation of sterically demanding carboxylic acids. In contrast, 4c, which is prepared from a 1:2 molar mixture of B(OH)(3) and tetrachlorocatechol, is effective as a Lewis acid-assisted Brønsted acid (LBA) catalyst for Ritter reaction.
16562739,0,2006,Med Parazitol (Mosk),[Intestinal cryptosporidiosis at an early age and its negative consequences].,This review calls the attention of physicians, primarily pediatricians, to cryptosporidiosis, a still little known intestinal infection caused by the protozoan pathogen Cryptosporidium parvum (Coccidia, Sporozoa). By using 10--14-day rats as a model, the authors have first provided evidence that even 4-day intestinal cryptosporidiosis may trigger obvious negative changes in the liver and heart, i.e. in the organs where the parasite does not develop. In the infected rats, growth retardation was registered, in addition to liver hypertrophy and partial heart atrophy, and growth retardation. Light and electron microscopies, absorption and fluorescence cytometry, quantitative morphometry, and image analysis were applied. In both hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes, the polyploid cell fraction was seen much increased, with the occurrence of 4c, 8c, and even 16c nuclei. Besides, in the hepatocytes, the amount of glycogen decreased whereas the level of protein increased, along with enhanced nucleolar activity in the nuclei. Unlike, the cardiomyocytes of the infected rats were characterized by protein decrease, in addition to almost two-fold cell body elongation. This is the first documented evidence for serious pathological changes in the extraintestinal organs, caused by the intestinal pathogen C. parvum. Within the first 4 days of infection, both the liver and heart of the host seem to work under stress. It is plausible that on modulating liver and heart ploidy, the intestinal parasitic infection (cryptosporidiosis) may bring about functional impairments of these organs, untypical of early age, leading eventually to long-term consequences in further life of formerly infected individuals.
16536908,0,2006,J Pharm Pharmacol,Synthesis and evaluation of N-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-indole-carboxamides as cholecystokinin antagonists.,The structure-activity relationship optimization of the pyrazoline template 3a resulted in novel 3-oxo-1,2-diphenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-indole carboxamides 4a-4e. These non-peptidal CCK ligands have been shown to act as potent CCK1 ligands in a [125]I-CCK-8 receptor binding assay. The best amides (4c and 4d) of this series displayed an IC50 of 20/25 nM for the CCK1 receptor. In a subsequent in-vivo evaluation using various behaviour pharmacological assays, an anxiolytic effect of these novel 3-oxo-1,2-diphenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-indole carboxamides was found at high doses in the elevated plus-maze. In the despair swimming test, a model for testing antidepressants, an ED50 of 0.33/0.41 mg kg(-1) was determined for amide 4c/4d and the antidepressant effect had a magnitude comparable to desimipramine.
16536558,0,2006,J Am Chem Soc,Template synthesis of 1,4,7-triphosphacyclononanes.,Iron(II) templates based on a [(eta(5)-Cp(R))Fe]+ core have been employed for the successful synthesis of 1,4,7-triphosphacyclononane derivatives (9-aneP3R'3) from a range of appropriately functionalized coordinated diphosphines and monophosphines. 1,2-Diphosphinoethane (1,2-dpe) or (2-phosphinoethyl)phenylphosphine (Phdpe) undergo a base-catalyzed Michael-type addition to trivinylphosphine, divinyl(benzyl)phosphine, or divinyl(phenyl)phosphine in [(eta(5)-Cp(R))Fe(diphosphine)(monophosphine)]+ complexes (2a-j) to give [(eta(5)-Cp(R))Fe(9aneP3R'3)]+ derivatives (4a-j) containing coordinated triphosphacyclononanes bearing one (with Phdpe) or two (with 1,2-dpe) secondary phosphine donors. The rates of macrocyclization show a dependence on the nature of the substituent(s) R on the cyclopentadienyl ligand with increased rates being observed along the series R = H5 &lt; (Me3Si)H4 &lt; 1,3-(Me3Si)2H3 approximately = Me5. For coupling reactions with trivinylphosphine, a pendant vinyl function remains in the macrocyclic product (4a-g) which is readily hydrogenated to the corresponding ethyl derivatives (5a-g). Further functionalization of coordinated secondary phosphines in the initially formed macrocycles (5a-g) is achieved by proton abstraction followed by addition of the appropriate alkyl halide electrophile and gives rise to tritertiary-triphospha-cyclononanes (7a-g, 7l, 7m). All new complexes have been fully characterized by spectroscopic and analytical methods in addition to the structural determination by single-crystal X-ray techniques of [{eta(5)-(Me3Si)2C5H3)Fe(9-aneP3H2C2H3)]PF6, 4c, and [(eta(5)-Me3SiC5H4)Fe(9-aneP3Et3)]BF4, 7b. 1,4,7-Triethyl-1,4,7-triphosphacyclononane is released from its metal template (7a, 7b) by treatment with either H2O2 or Br2/H2O to give the trioxide 9-aneP3(O)3Et3 (8). Attempts to recover the trivalent phosphorus species, 1,4,7-triethyl-1,4,7-triphosphacyclononane, from the trioxide by reduction proved unsuccessful.
16516477,0,2006,Bioorg Med Chem,Design, synthesis, and antitumor evaluation of novel acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrrole-carboxylic acid esters with amino chain substitution.,8-Oxo-8H-acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrrole-9-carboxylic acid esters and derivatives were prepared and evaluated for cytotoxicity against A549 and P388 cell lines. Based on a novel chromophore precursor 8-oxo-8H-acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrrol-9-carbonitrile 1, the very insoluble 1 was converted to more soluble esters 5 and a series of 3-amino derivatives from 5 were obtained by mild S(N)Ar(H) reaction between 5 and various amines. The biological evaluation indicated that methyl esters 5a are the most cytotoxic with IC(50) values of 0.45 and 0.80 microM (against A549 and P388, respectively) among the parent esters 5a-5f, but 3-amino derivatives 4b and 4c of 5f with bromine showed the highest activity (with IC(50) values of 0.019-0.60 microM) among the 3-amino derivatives.
16500101,0,2006,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Novel substituted naphthalen-1-yl-methanone derivatives as anti-hyperglycemic agents.,A series of aminoalkoxy phenyl-substituted naphthalene-1-yl-methanone was synthesized and tested for its anti-hyperglycemic activity in SLM and STZ-S rat models. Some compounds (3b, 4c and 4h) of the series were showing significant anti-hyperglycemic activity in male Sprague-Dawley rats in sucrose-loaded model (SLM) as well as in streptozotocin-induced model (STZ-S). Active compounds were also evaluated for relative binding affinity against glucagon receptor.
16493468,0,2006,Org Biomol Chem,Design principles for alpha-tocopherol analogues.,An (RO)B3LYP/LANL2DZdp//B3LYP/LANL2DZ model for the prediction of the homolytic bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) and adiabatic ionisation potential (IP) of phenolic antioxidants containing heavy chalcogens has been developed. The model has been used to probe the relationship between geometry, chalcogen substitution and activity for a series of alpha-tocopherol analogues of varying ring size. From this, a series of design principles for cyclic antioxidants has emerged, embodied by the compound 4-hydroxy-2,2,3,5,6-pentamethylbenzoselenete (4c). This compound is predicted to have a BDE comparable to alpha-tocopherol, and should act in a dual chain-breaking and hydroperoxide-decomposing manner, by analogy with other selenide antioxidants. The stability of chalcogen-substituted benzoxetes was considered, and the as yet unsynthesised benzotelluretes are predicted to be stable. Finally, an attempt was made to determine antioxidant mechanism by considering calculated BDE and IP data together with experimental rate data.
16488660,0,2006,Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,DFT calculations of magnetic parameters for molybdenum complexes and hydroxymethyl intermediates trapped on silica surface.,Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of EPR parameters and their structure sensitivity for selected surface paramagnetic species involved in oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol over silica grafted molybdenum catalyst were investigated. Two surface complexes, Mo(4c)/SiO2 and {O(-)-Mo(4c)}/SiO2, as well as *CH2OH radical trapped on the SiO2 matrix were taken as the examples. The spin-restricted zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA) implemented in the Amsterdam Density Functional suite was used to calculate the electronic g tensor for those species. The predicted values were in satisfactory agreement with experimental EPR results. Five different coordination modes of the *CH2OH radical on the silica surface were considered and the isotropic 13C, 17O, and 1H hyperfine coupling constants (HFCC) of the resultant surface complexes were calculated. Structure sensitivity of the HFCC values was discussed in terms of the angular deformations caused by hydrogen bonding with the silica surface.
16477131,0,2006,Zhi Wu Sheng Li Yu Fen Zi Sheng Wu Xue Xue Bao,[Expression of an Arabidopsis actin-depolymerizing factor 4 gene (AtADF4) in tobacco causes morphological change of plants].,The actin-depolymerizing factor 4 gene (ADF4) of Arabidopsis thaliana was cloned and sequenced (Figs.1, 2). The plant expression vector with ADF4 was constructed and transformed into tobacco by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Molecular identification showed that the ADF4 gene was integrated into the genome of tobacco and expressed in transgenic tobaccos assayed by PCR and RT-PCR (Fig.3). Expression of an Arabidopsis thaliana ADF4 gene in tobacco resulted in morphological change of plants. The effects of ADF4 on transgenic tobaccos growth were as follows: the hypocotyls of transgenic plants were wavy, especially in darkness, whereas those of the control were straight (Fig.4A); the root hairs of transgenic plants were less than the control, and they were also wavy (Fig.4B); the parenchyma cells of transgenic plants were larger than the control and the arrangement of vascular bundle was out of order (Fig.4C); the flowering time of T(2) line was at least 7 days later than the control; the pollen tubes of transgenic plants were shorter than those of the control (Fig.4D).
16475775,0,2006,Med Phys,Contrast cancellation technique applied to digital x-ray imaging using silicon strip detectors.,Dual-energy mammographic imaging experimental tests have been performed using a compact dichromatic imaging system based on a conventional x-ray tube, a mosaic crystal, and a 384-strip silicon detector equipped with full-custom electronics with single photon counting capability. For simulating mammal tissue, a three-component phantom, made of Plexiglass, polyethylene, and water, has been used. Images have been collected with three different pairs of x-ray energies: 16-32 keV, 18-36 keV, and 20-40 keV. A Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment has also been carried out using the MCNP-4C transport code. The Alvarez-Macovski algorithm has been applied both to experimental and simulated data to remove the contrast between two of the phantom materials so as to enhance the visibility of the third one.
16465390,0,2006,Int J Mol Med,Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is locked in active conformation and polymerizes upon binding ligands neutralizing its activity.,Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a member of the serpin super-family, forms a covalent complex with its target proteinases, such as tissue and urokinase plasminogen activators. Thus, PAI-1 controls the physiological and pathological proteolysis. An abnormal expression of PAI-1 has been observed in different diseases, which can be treated by returning the proteolysis back to normal physiological levels. It has been reported that some PAI-1 inhibitors neutralize its activity by accelerating the conversion of PAI-1 into a latent form. We have found small organic chemicals that also neutralize PAI-1 activity, but by a different mechanism. Using the NBD fluorescent probe [N,N'-dimethyl-N-(acetyl)-N'-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)] incorporated into the reactive center loop (RCL) of PAI-1, we measured the kinetics of conversion from an active to a latent form. Unexpectedly, we found that some inhibitors of PAI-1 arrest this serpin in its active form instead of increasing the speed of conversion. Using docking calculations, we located two possible binding sites for these chemicals. The sites are in proximity of the P1/P1' amino acids of the RCL of PAI-1. Binding in this area can inactivate PAI-1 and additionally create a steric obstacle on the RCL making insertion of this loop between the A3 and A5 strands more difficult; hence abolishing a necessary step in the conversion of this protein into the latent form. Additionally, PAI-1 inhibitors link the RCL of one PAI-1 molecule with the strand 3C and strand 4C or helix A and strand 1B regions of the other PAI-1 molecule aiding polymerization or stabilizing the junction of the two. The polymerization of PAI-1 reduces PAI-1 activity by encapsulating the critical RCL fragment inside the formed PAI-1/PAI-1 polymers.
16411172,0,2006,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Cyanoacetic acid hydrazones of 3-(and 4-)acetylpyridine and some derived ring systems as potential antitumor and anti-HCV agents.,Two new acetylpyridinehydrazones derived from cyanoacetic acid hydrazide have been synthesized namely: cyanoacetic acid (1-pyridin-3 or 4-yl-ethylidene) hydrazides (1a,b). and some derived ring systems: 2-imino or 2-oxo-2H-chromenes (2a,b and 3a,b), substituted 2-thioxo-2,3-dihydrothiazoles (4a-d), substituted 2-thioxo-2,3-dihydro-6H-thiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-7-ones (5a-d), substituted dihydrothiazoles (7a,b), and substituted 2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridines (8a-d and 9a,b). Fifteen compounds were evaluated for their anticancer activity using the USA-NCI in-vitro screening program. Among the tested compounds, 8d exhibited a high value of percent tumor growth inhibition at concentrations of 10(-5) to 10(-7) M in all cancer cell lines, while 8b exhibited a significant value of percent tumor growth inhibition at concentration &lt;10(-8 )M against non-small cells lung HOP-92. In addition, nine compounds were investigated for their in-vitro effect on the replication of hepatitis-C virus (HCV) in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line infected with the virus using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique. Six compounds were capable of inhibiting the replication of both the HCV RNA (+)- and (-)-strands at 5-100 microg/mL concentration range. The activity order was 7b &gt; 1b = 3a &gt; 4c &gt; 7a &gt; 5c.
16409016,0,2006,J Chem Phys,A full dimensional time-dependent wave packet study for the H4 four-center, collision induced dissociation, and single exchange reactions: reaction probabilities for J=0.,A time-dependent initial state selected wave packet method has been developed to study the H2(v(1)=10-11,j1=0)+H2'(v2=0,j2=0)--&gt;HH'+HH' four-center (4C) reaction, and two other competing reactions: the H2+H2'--&gt;H+H+H2' collision induced dissociation (CID) and the H2+H2'--&gt;H+HH'+H' single exchange (SE) reaction, in full six dimensions. Initial state-specific total reaction probabilities for these three competing reactions are presented for total angular momentum J=0 and the effects of reagent vibration on reactions are examined. It is found that (a) the CID process is the dominant process over the whole energy range considered in this study, but the 4C and SE processes also have non-negligible probabilities; (b) the SE process has a lower threshold energy than the 4C process, but the SE probability increases slower than the 4C probability as collision energy increases; (c) the vibrational excitation of H2(v1) is much more efficient than translational motion for promoting these processes, in particular to the CID process.
16402830,0,2006,J Am Chem Soc,Changes in coordination of sterically demanding hybrid imidazolylphosphine ligands on Pd(0) and Pd(II).,Low-coordinate organometallic complexes are important in structure and catalysis, and hemilability or secondary interactions such as hydrogen bonding enabled by hybrid ligands are receiving increasing attention. To study the factors controlling these phenomena, three new imidazol-2-ylphosphine ligands, L, were made. In these ligands, the bulk around P and the hindrance at the basic and potentially coordinating imidazole N-3 were varied. Remarkably, L(2)Pd(0) complexes 3a-c were shown to be two-coordinate, 12-electron species, despite the availability of imidazole N-3 to enter into eta(2)-P,N chelation. In oxidative additions of C-X bonds to the Pd(0) complexes, reaction rates and products could be controlled by the nature of the C and X groups and the R groups on the phosphine. Most significantly, whereas 4c-PhI and 4c-MeOTf from 3c are normal trans-bis(phosphine)Pd(R)(X) species, 5a-PhI, 5a-PhBr, and 5b-PhI from 3a and 3b were shown by X-ray diffraction to be a monomeric species with a single eta(2)-P,N-chelating phosphine. From 3a and methyl triflate, an ionic complex [6a-Me](+)[OTf](-) with one chelating and one nonchelating phosphine was formed, with temperature-dependent windshield-wiper exchange of the two, showing hemilability. Thus, large phosphine substituents (R = tert-butyl rather than isopropyl) favor chelation. The chelate Pd-imidazole N-3 bond is longer when the heterocyclic nitrogen is hindered by an adjacent tert-butyl group at C-4 (comparing 5a-PhI and 5b-PhI). Finally, whereas in [8b-Ph](+)[OTf](-) from 5b-PhI and isopropylamine, the amine coordinates without chelate opening or hydrogen bonding, in [10c-Me](+)[OTf](-) made from 4c-MeOTf and isopropylamine, the amine is not only coordinated at N but also donates a hydrogen bond to each phosphine imidazol-2-yl substituent.
16393908,0,2006,J Liposome Res,NA,In the light of recent developments, changes in (1)H and (13)C NMR chemical shifts of methacrylate molecule associated with DMPC (L-alpha dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine) or DPPC (L-alpha-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) liposomes as a model for mimic native lipid bilayers were studied at 30, 37, and 52 degrees C. The chemical shifts of 3Ha, 3C, and 4C resonances in methacrylates (see Fig. 2) were greatly shifted higher field, suggesting the methacrylate molecule-lipid bilayer interaction. Comparison of the findings with methyl methacrylate (MMA), ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA), and triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) revealed that the interaction of dimethacrylates (EDMA, TEGDMA) was greater than monomethacrylate, MMA. Their interaction with DMPC liposomes was also judged by a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), indicating that the interaction was characterized by decreasing the enthalpy, entropy, and transition co-operativity. The evidence of the upfield NMR-shifts for methacrylate molecules was also judged by the descriptors such as the reactivity (HOMO-LUMO energy) and the electrostatic function (partial charges) between methacrylate molecules and DPPC, calculated by a PM 3 semiempirical MO method. The upfield NMR shifts were considerably well interpreted from the descriptors. NMR screening technique in methacrylates to phospholipid targets would be highly valuable in biomaterial developments. Figure 2 Changes in (1)H and (13)C NMR chemical shifts of methacrylate molecule associated with DMPC or DPPC liposomes. DMPC liposomes/MMA (1:1, molar ratio) and DMPC/TEGDMA (1:1) liposomes were measured at 30 degrees C. In DPPC liposome system, the rippled gel phase was measured at 30 degrees C, whereas the liquid crystalline phase for MMA and for both EDMA and TEGDMA were measured at 52 degrees C and 37 degrees C, respectively.
23074492,0,2006,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,Optimum methadone compliance testing: an evidence-based analysis.,OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to determine the diagnostic utility of oral fluid testing collected with the Intercept oral fluid collection device.CLINICAL NEED: TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION Opioids (opiates or narcotics) are a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy plant that typically relieve pain and produce a euphoric feeling. Methadone is a long-acting synthetic opioid used to treat opioid dependence and chronic pain. It prevents symptoms of opioid withdrawal, reduces opioid cravings and blocks the euphoric effects of short-acting opioids such as heroin and morphine. Opioid dependence is associated with harms including an increased risk of exposure to Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Hepatitis C as well as other health, social and psychological crises. The goal of methadone treatment is harm reduction. Treatment with methadone for opioid dependence is often a long-term therapy. The Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons estimates that there are currently 250 physicians qualified to prescribe methadone, and 15,500 people in methadone maintenance programs across Ontario. Drug testing is a clinical tool whose purpose is to provide objective meaningful information, which will reinforce positive behavioral changes in patients and guide further treatment needs. Such information includes knowledge of whether the patient is taking their methadone as prescribed and reducing or abstaining from using opioid and other drugs of abuse use. The results of drug testing can be used with behavior modification techniques (contingency management techniques) where positive reinforcements such as increased methadone take-home privileges, sustained employment or parole are granted for drug screens negative for opioid use, and negative reinforcement including loss of these privileges for drug screens positive for opioid used. Body fluids including blood, oral fluid, often referred to as saliva, and urine may contain metabolites and the parent drug of both methadone and drugs of abuse and provide a means for drug testing. Compared with blood which has a widow of detection of several hours, urine has a wider window of detection, approximately 1 to 3 days, and is therefore considered more useful than blood for drug testing. Because of this, and the fact that obtaining a urine specimen is relatively easy, urine drug screening is considered the criterion measure (gold standard) for methadone maintenance monitoring. However, 2 main concerns exist with urine specimens: the possibility of sample tampering by the patient and the necessity for observed urine collection. Urine specimens may be tampered with in 3 ways: dilution, adulteration (contamination) with chemicals, and substitution (patient submits another persons urine specimen). To circumvent sample tampering the supervised collection of urine specimens is a common and recommended practice. However, it has been suggested that this practice may have negative effects including humiliation experienced by patient and staff, and may discourage patients from staying in treatment. Supervised urine specimen collection may also present an operational problem as staff must be available to provide same-sex supervision. Oral fluid testing has been proposed as a replacement for urine because it can be collected easily under direct supervision without infringement of privacy and reduces the likelihood of sample tampering. Generally, the results of oral fluid drug testing are similar to urine drug testing but there are some differences, such as lower concentrations of substances in oral fluid than urine, and some drugs remain detectable for longer periods of time in urine than oral fluid.THE TECHNOLOGY BEING REVIEWED: The Intercept Oral Specimen Collection Device (Ora-Sure Technologies, Bethlehem, PA) consists of an absorbent pad mounted on a plastic stick. The pad is coated with common salts. The absorbent pad is inserted into the mouth and placed between the cheek and gums for 3 minutes on average. The pad absorbs the oral fluid. After 3 minutes (range 2min-5 min) the collection device is removed from the mouth and the absorbent pad is placed in a small vial which contains 0.8mL of pH-balanced preservative, for transportation to a laboratory for analysis. It is recommended that the person undergoing oral fluid drug testing have nothing to eat or drink for a 10- minute period before the oral fluid specimen is collected. This will remove opportunity for adulteration. Likewise, it is recommended that the person be observed for the duration of the collection period to prevent adulteration of the specimen. An average of 0.4 mL of saliva can be collected. The specimen may be stored at 4C to 37C and tested within 21 days of collection (or within 6 weeks if frozen). The oral fluid specimen must be analyzed in a laboratory setting. There is no point-of-care (POC) oral fluid test kit for drugs of abuse (other than for alcohol). In the laboratory the oral fluid is extracted from the vial after centrifugation and a screening test is completed to eliminate negative specimens. Similar to urinalysis, oral fluid specimens are analyzed first by enzyme immunoassay with positive specimens sent for confirmatory testing. Comparable cut-off values to urinalysis by enzyme immunoassay have been developed for oral fluidsREVIEW STRATEGY:  RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the diagnostic utility of the Intercept oral specimen device?INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies evaluating paired urine and oral fluid specimens from the same individual with the Intercept oral fluid collection device.The population studied includes drug users.EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies testing for marijuana (THC) only.OUTCOMES: Sensitivity and Specificity of oral fluid testing compared to urinalysis for methadone (methadone metabolite), opiates, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and alcohol. QUALITY OF THE BODY OF EVIDENCE: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to evaluate the overall quality of the body of evidence (defined as 1 or more studies) supporting the research questions explored in this systematic review. A description of the GRADE system is reported in Appendix 1.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: A total of 854 potential citations were retrieved. After reviewing titles and abstracts, 2 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two other relevant studies were found after corresponding with the author of the 2 studies retrieved from the literature search. Therefore a total of 4 published studies are included in this analysis. All 4 studies carried out by the same investigator meet the definition of Medical Advisory Secretariat level III (not a-randomized controlled trial with contemporaneous controls) study design. In each of the studies, paired urine and oral fluid specimens where obtained from drug users. Urine collection was not observed in the studies however, laboratory tests for pH and creatinine were used to determine the reliability of the specimen. Urine specimens thought to be diluted and unreliable were removed from the evaluation. Urinalysis was used as the criterion measurement for which to determine the sensitivity and specificity of oral fluid testing by the Intercept oral fluid device for opiates, benzodiazepines, cocaine and marijuana. Alcohol was not tested in any of the 4 studies. From these 4 studies, the following conclusions were drawn: The evidence indicates that oral fluid testing with the Intercept oral fluid device has better specificity than sensitivity for opiates, benzodiazepines, cocaine and marijuana.THE SENSITIVITY OF ORAL FLUIDS TESTING WITH THE INTERCEPT ORAL FLUID DEVICE SEEMS TO BE FROM BEST TO WORST: cocaine &gt; benzodiazepines &gt;opiates&gt; marijuana.The sensitivity and specificity for opiates of the Intercept oral fluid device ranges from 75 to 90% and 97- 100% respectively.The consequences of opiate false-negatives by oral fluid testing with the Intercept oral fluid device need to be weighed against the disadvantages of urine testing, including invasion of privacy issues and adulteration and substitution of the urine specimen.The window of detection is narrower for oral fluid drug testing than urinalysis and because of this oral fluid testing may best be applied in situations where there is suspected frequent drug use. When drug use is thought to be less frequent or remote, urinalysis may offer a wider (24-48 hours more than oral fluids) window of detection.The narrow window of detection for oral fluid testing may mean more frequent testing is needed compared to urinalysis. This may increase the expense for drug testing in general.POC oral fluid testing is not yet available and may limit the practical utility of this drug testing methodology. POC urinalysis by immunoassay is available.The possible applications of oral fluid testing may include:Because of its narrow window of detection compared to urinalysis oral fluid testing may best be used during periods of suspected frequent or recent drug use (within 24 hours of drug testing). This is not to say that oral fluid testing is superior to urinalysis during these time periods.In situations where an observed urine specimen is difficult to obtain. This may include persons with &quot;shy bladder syndrome&quot; or with other urinary conditions limiting their ability to provide an observed urine specimen.When the health of the patient would make urine testing unreliable (e,g., renal disease)As an alternative drug testing method when urine specimen tampering practices are suspected to be affecting the reliability of the urinalysis test.Possible limiting Factors to Diffusion of Oral Fluid Technology No oral fluid POC test equivalent to onsite urine dips or POC analyzer reducing immediacy of results for patient care.Currently, physicians get reimbursed directly for POC urinalysis.

15766614,115,2005,Am J Prev Med,Physical activity from childhood to adulthood: a 21-year tracking study.,BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate stability of physical activity from childhood and adolescence to adulthood in multiple age cohorts, and analyze how well adult physical activity can be predicted by various physical activity variables measured in childhood and adolescence.METHODS: The data were drawn from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. The study was started in 1980, when cohorts of randomly sampled boys and girls aged 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years (total of 2309 subjects) were examined for the first time. The measurements were repeated in 1983, 1986, 1989, 1992, and 2001. In 2001, the subjects (n =1563, 68%) were aged 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, and 39 years, respectively. Physical activity was measured by means of a short self-report questionnaire that was administered individually in connection with a medical examination. On the basis of a questionnaire, a physical activity index (PAI) was calculated. There were no significant differences in the 1980 PAI between participants and dropouts in 2001.RESULTS: Spearmans rank order correlation coefficients for the 21-year tracking period varied from 0.33 to 0.44 in males, and from 0.14 to 0.26 in females. At shorter time intervals the correlation was higher. On average, the tracking correlation was lower in females than in males. Persistent physical activity, defined as a score in the most active third of the PAI in two or three consecutive measurements, increased the odds that an individual would be active in adulthood. Odds ratios for 3-year continuous activity versus continuous inactivity varied from 4.30 to 7.10 in males and 2.90 to 5.60 in females. The corresponding odds ratios for 6-year persistence were 8.70 to 10.80 and 5.90 to 9.40.CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that a high level of physical activity at ages 9 to 18, especially when continuous, significantly predicted a high level of adult physical activity. Although the correlations were low or moderate, we consider it important that school-age physical activity appears to influence adult physical activity, and through it, the public health of the general population.
16175650,106,2005,Rev Med Virol,Phylogenetic analysis of global hepatitis E virus sequences: genetic diversity, subtypes and zoonosis.,Nucleotide sequences from a total of 421 HEV isolates were retrieved from Genbank and analysed. Phylogenetically, HEV was classified into four major genotypes. Genotype 1 was more conserved and classified into five subtypes. The number of genotype 2 sequences was limited but can be classified into two subtypes. Genotypes 3 and 4 were extremely diverse and can be subdivided into ten and seven subtypes. Geographically, genotype 1 was isolated from tropical and several subtropical countries in Asia and Africa, and genotype 2 was from Mexico, Nigeria, and Chad; whereas genotype 3 was identified almost worldwide including Asia, Europe, Oceania, North and South America. In contrast, genotype 4 was found exclusively in Asia. It is speculated that genotype 3 originated in the western hemisphere and was imported to several Asian countries such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan, while genotype 4 has been indigenous and likely restricted to Asia. Genotypes 3 and 4 were not only identified in swine but also in wild animals such as boar and a deer. Furthermore, in most areas where genotypes 3 and 4 were characterised, sequences from both humans and animals were highly conserved, indicating they originated from the same infectious sources. Based upon nucleotide differences from five phylogenies, it is proposed that five, two, ten and seven subtypes for HEV genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 be designated alphabetised subtypes. Accordingly, a total of 24 subtypes (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f, 3g, 3h, 3i, 3j, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4f and 4g) were given.
16307130,41,2005,Chem Commun (Camb),Tumor angiogenic vasculature targeting with PAMAM dendrimer-RGD conjugates.,PAMAM dendrimer-RGD-4C peptide conjugate was synthesized and in vitro targeting efficacy to integrin receptor expressing cells was studied by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.
15892677,24,2005,Curr Pharm Des,Highly active antiretroviral therapy: current state of the art, new agents and their pharmacological interactions useful for improving therapeutic outcome.,Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) dramatically changed the course of HIV infection. Currently, this therapy involves the use of agents from at least two distinct classes of antivirals: a protease inhibitor (PI) in combination with two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N(t)RTIs), or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) in combination with NRTIs. Recently, the third family of antivirals started to be used clinically, with the advent of enfuvirtide, the first fusion inhibitor (FI). Several pharmacological agents are available form these classes of antivirals, NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs and FIs, which will be briefly reviewed here. Some more agents are in advanced clinical evaluation or have recently been approved (such as tenofovir, a NtRTI; atazanavir, a PI; tipranavir, another PI), mainly against drug-resistant viruses. Compounds inhibiting HIV integrase, the third enzyme of HIV, are also available ultimately, with several such derivatives in clinical trials (L-731, 988 and S-1360). Another approach to inhibit the growth of retroviruses, including HIV, targets the ejection of zinc ions from critical zinc finger viral proteins, which has as a consequence the inhibition of viral replication in the absence of mutations leading to drug resistance phenotypes. All steps in the process of HIV entry into the cell may be targeted by specific compounds that might be developed as novel types of antiretrovirals. Thus, inhibitors of the gp120-CD4 interaction have been detected (zintevir, FP-21399 and BMS-378806 in clinical trials). Small molecule chemokine antagonists acting as HIV entry inhibitors also were described in the last period, which interact both with the CXCR4 coreceptor (such as AMD3100; AMD3465; ALX40-4C; T22, T134 and T140), or which are antagonist of the CCR5 coreceptor (TAK-779, TAK-220, SCH-C, SCH-D, E913, AK-602 and NSC 651016 in clinical trials), together with new types of fusion inhibitors possessing the same mechanism of action as enfuvirtide (such as T1249). Compounds interacting with Tat/Tar have also been detected which inhibit HIV replication in low micromolar range (EM2487, tamacrazine, CGP 64222 or CGA 137053 among others). Unexploited viral and cellular targets (such as the maturation process-with a first potent compound available, PA-457; the cellular proteins Tsg101, APOBEC3G, or the viral ones Vif, Rev or RNase H) are also presented, together with recently emerged approaches for eradication of HIV reservoirs. A review on the pharmacology and interactions of these agents with other drugs is presented here, with emphasis on how these pharmacological interferences may improve the clinical use of antivirals, or how side effects due to these drugs may be managed better by taking them into account.
16304683,20,2005,J Comp Neurol,Columnar projections from the cholinergic nucleus isthmi to the optic tectum in chicks (Gallus gallus): a possible substrate for synchronizing tectal channels.,The cholinergic division of the avian nucleus isthmi, the homolog of the mammalian nucleus parabigeminalis, is composed of the pars parvocellularis (Ipc) and pars semilunaris (SLu). Ipc and SLu were studied with in vivo and in vitro tracing and intracellular filling methods. 1) Both nuclei have reciprocal homotopic connections with the ipsilateral optic tectum. The SLu connection is more diffuse than that of Ipc. 2) Tectal inputs to Ipc and SLu are Brn3a-immunoreactive neurons in the inner sublayer of layer 10. Tectal neurons projecting on Ipc possess &quot;shepherd's crook&quot; axons and radial dendritic fields in layers 2-13. 3) Neurons in the mid-portion of Ipc possess a columnar spiny dendritic field. SLu neurons have a large, nonoriented spiny dendritic field. 4) Ipc terminals form a cylindrical brush-like arborization (35-50 microm wide) in layers 2-10, with extremely dense boutons in layers 3-6, and a diffuse arborization in layers 11-13. SLu neurons terminate in a wider column (120-180 microm wide) lacking the dust-like boutonal features of Ipc and extend in layers 4c-13 with dense arborizations in layers 4c, 6, and 9-13. 5) Ipc and SLu contain specialized fast potassium ion channels. We propose that dense arborizations of Ipc axons may be directed to the distal dendritic bottlebrushes of motion detecting tectal ganglion cells (TGCs). They may provide synchronous activation of a group of adjacent bottlebrushes of different TGCs of the same type via their intralaminar processes, and cross channel activation of different types of TGCs within the same column of visual space.
15912503,17,2005,J Comp Neurol,GRIP1 in GABAergic synapses.,The glutamate receptor-interacting protein GRIP1 is present in glutamatergic synapses and interacts with the GluR2/3/4c subunits of the AMPA receptors. This interaction plays important roles in trafficking, synaptic targeting, and recycling of AMPA receptors as well as in the plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. Although GRIP1 has been shown to be present at GABAergic synapses in cultured neurons, the use of EM (electron microscopy) immunocytochemistry in the intact brain has failed to convincingly reveal the presence of GRIP1 in GABAergic synapses. Therefore, most studies on GRIP1 have focused on glutamatergic synapses. By using mild tissue fixation and embedding in EM, we show that in the intact brain the 7-PDZ domain GRIP1a/b is present not only in glutamatergic synapses but also in GABAergic synapses. In GABAergic synapses GRIP1a/b localizes both at the presynaptic terminals and postsynaptically, being frequently localized on the synaptic membranes or the synaptic junctional complex. Considerably higher density of GRIP1a/b is found in the presynaptic GABAergic terminals than in the glutamatergic terminals, while the density of GRIP1a/b in the postsynaptic complex is similar in both types of synapses. The results also show that the 7-PDZ and the shorter 4-PDZ domain splice forms of GRIP1 (GRIP1c 4-7) frequently colocalize with each other in individual GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. The results suggest that GRIP1 splice forms might play important roles in brain GABAergic synapses.
15956372,15,2005,J Clin Microbiol,Outbreak of dysentery associated with ceftriaxone-resistant Shigella sonnei: First report of plasmid-mediated CMY-2-type AmpC beta-lactamase resistance in S. sonnei.,We document the first report of plasmid-encoded CMY-2-type AmpC beta-lactamase identified among Shigella sonnei isolates resistant to ceftriaxone and obtained after an outbreak of bacillary dysentery in Taiwan. One hundred eighty-two children in two elementary schools in Yu-Li, Taiwan, where an outbreak occurred after a typhoon hit this area in 2001, were enrolled in this study. Clinical and epidemiologic data on the infected children were collected. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on the isolates to determine the genetic relatedness of outbreak strains. Plasmid analysis and PCR were performed to identify beta-lactamase genes responsible for ceftriaxone resistance. Forty-seven children from the two elementary schools were culture positive for S. sonnei in this outbreak. Twenty-three children were asymptomatic. Of the total isolates 55.3% were resistant to ampicillin. One hundred percent of the isolates obtained from children in school A were initially susceptible to both ampicillin and ceftriaxone. Of isolates obtained from school B 96.2% were nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone. However, two isolates from school A developed resistance to ampicillin during the course of treatment. All 18 available isolates showed closely related PFGE patterns (4, 4a, 4b, and 4c). CMY-2-type AmpC beta-lactamase was responsible for ceftriaxone resistance in ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible isolates; Southern blot hybridization confirmed that such a resistance gene was located on the plasmid. This is the first report of plasmid-mediated CMY-2-type AmpC beta-lactamase in S. sonnei. Ampicillin-resistant isolates can develop during the course of antibiotic treatment.
15815702,14,2005,Gene Ther,Correction of a mineralization defect by overexpression of a wild-type cDNA for COL1A1 in marrow stromal cells (MSCs) from a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta: a strategy for rescuing mutations that produce dominant-negative protein defects.,Gene therapy for dominant-negative disorders presents a more difficult challenge than gene therapy for recessive disorders, since even partial replacement of a protein for a recessive disorder can reverse symptoms. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) has frequently served as a model disorder for dominant-negative defects of structural proteins. The disease is caused by mutations in type I collagen (COL1A1), the major structural component of bone, skin and other connective tissues. The severity of the phenotype is largely dependent on the ratio of normal to mutant type I procollagen synthesized by cells. Recently, attempts have been made to develop strategies for cell and gene therapies using the adult stem cells from bone marrow referred to as mesenchymal stem cells or marrow stromal cells (MSCs). In this study, we used MSCs from a patient with type III OI who was heterozygous for an IVS 41A+4C mutation in COL1A1. A hybrid genomic / cDNA construct of COL1A1 was transfected into the MSCs and the transfectants were expanded over a 200-fold. Transfected MSCs showed increased expression of the wild-type mRNA and protein. In vitro assays demonstrated that the transfected cells more efficiently differentiated into mineralizing cells. The results indicated that it is possible to overexpress COL1A1 cDNA in OI MSCs and thereby to correct partially the dominant-negative protein defect.
16316755,13,2005,Cell Biol Int,Cell reproduction and genome multiplication in the proliferative and invasive trophoblast cell populations of mammalian placenta.,Spatiotemporal &quot;time-table&quot; of ways of cell reproduction (mitosis, restitutional mitosis, endomitosis, endoreduplication) of trophoblast cell populations is described. The populations of mitotically active trophoblast cells (diploid and low-polyploid) are located mostly out of contact with maternal tissues. In rodent placenta they mainly switch from mitotic cycle to polyploidizing (restitutional) mitoses and reach 4c-8c. Thereafter they switch to endoreduplication and reach 16c-64c. Following a series of endoreduplication cycles a part of this cell population sets apart and penetrates deeply into the decidualized endometrium and myometrium, their capabilities for replication being lost progressively (in rodent--256c-1024c). The invasive trophoblast cells that reach 256c-1024c via endoreduplication simultaneously form a barrier between semiallogenic fetal and maternal tissues. Arrest of mitoses and complete repression of DNA replication after a series of endoreduplication cycles makes hardly probable the renewal of mitotic activity in the deeply invading tertiary giant trophoblast cells, thereby preventing the possibility of their ectopic expanding in the maternal tissues during the normal pregnancy.
15706356,13,2005,Cancer Gene Ther,Complex mosaicism is a novel approach to infectivity enhancement of adenovirus type 5-based vectors.,The use of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) for cancer therapy is limited by deficiency of its primary cell attachment receptor, coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), on cancer cells. Ad5 retargeting to alternate receptors through fiber genetic modification can be used to circumvent CAR dependence of its tropism, and thereby achieve infectivity enhancement. Here we propose and test a novel &quot;complex mosaicism&quot; approach for fiber modification, which combines serotype chimerism with peptide ligand(s) incorporation in a single-fiber molecule. We incorporated integrin-binding peptide RGD-4C in the HI-loop, at the carboxy (C)-terminus, or both locales of the Ad3 knob, in the context of Ad5/3 chimera fiber in order to retarget simultaneously the Ad vector to integrins and Ad3 receptors. The infectivity enhancement of the fiber modifications was assessed in various cancer cell lines as cancer-targeting models. Replication-defective complex mosaic Ad-luc vectors bearing chimeric fiber (F.5/3), with or without C-terminal RGD-modification of Ad3 knob, demonstrated up to 55-fold gene transfer increase in bladder cancer cell lines. Although this augmentation was primarily due to Ad3 receptor targeting, some contribution of RGD-mediated integrin-targeting was also observed, suggesting that complex mosaic modification can function in a dual-receptor targeting via a single Ad3 fiber knob.
15659402,13,2005,J Biol Chem,Novel symmetric and asymmetric DNA scission determinants for Streptococcus pneumoniae topoisomerase IV and gyrase are clustered at the DNA breakage site.,Topoisomerase (topo) IV and gyrase are bacterial type IIA DNA topoisomerases essential for DNA replication and chromosome segregation that act via a transient double-stranded DNA break involving a covalent enzyme-DNA &quot;cleavage complex.&quot; Despite their mechanistic importance, the DNA breakage determinants are not understood for any bacterial type II enzyme. We investigated DNA cleavage by Streptococcus pneumoniae topo IV and gyrase stabilized by gemifloxacin and other antipneumococcal fluoroquinolones. Topo IV and gyrase induce distinct but overlapping repertoires of double-strand DNA breakage sites that were essentially identical for seven different quinolones and were augmented (in intensity) by positive or negative supercoiling. Sequence analysis of 180 topo IV and 126 gyrase sites promoted by gemifloxacin on pneumococcal DNA revealed the respective consensus sequences: G(G/c)(A/t)A*GNNCt(T/a)N(C/a) and GN4G(G/c)(A/c)G*GNNCtTN(C/a) (preferred bases are underlined; disfavored bases are in small capitals; N indicates no preference; and asterisk indicates DNA scission between -1 and +1 positions). Both enzymes show strong preferences for bases clustered symmetrically around the DNA scission site, i.e. +1G/+4C, -4G/+8C, and particularly the novel -2A/+6T, but with no preference at +2/+3 within the staggered 4-bp overhang. Asymmetric elements include -3G and several unfavored bases. These cleavage preferences, the first for Gram-positive type IIA topoisomerases, differ markedly from those reported for Escherichia coli topo IV (consensus (A/G)*T/A) and gyrase, which are based on fewer sites. However, both pneumococcal enzymes cleaved an E. coli gyrase site suggesting overlap in gyrase determinants. We propose a model for the cleavage complex of topo IV/gyrase that accommodates the unique -2A/+6T and other preferences.
15746155,12,2005,Plant Cell Physiol,TONSOKU is expressed in S phase of the cell cycle and its defect delays cell cycle progression in Arabidopsis.,TONSOKU(TSK)/MGOUN3/BRUSHY1 of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a nuclear leucine-glycine-aspargine (LGN) domain protein implicated to be involved in genome maintenance, and mutants with defects in TSK show a fasciated stem with disorganized meristem structures. We identified a homolog of TSK from tobacco BY-2 cells (NtTSK), which showed high sequence conservation both in the LGN domain and in leucine-rich repeats with AtTSK. The NtTSK gene was expressed during S phase of the cell cycle in tobacco BY-2 cells highly synchronized for cell division. The tsk mutants of Arabidopsis contained an increased proportion of cells with 4C nuclei and cells expressing cyclin B1 compared with the wild type. These results suggest that TSK is required during the cell cycle and defects of TSK cause the arrest of cell cycle progression at G2/M phase.
16157681,10,2005,Genetics,Sister chromatids are often incompletely aligned in meristematic and endopolyploid interphase nuclei of Arabidopsis thaliana.,We analyzed whether sister chromatids are continuously aligned in meristematic and endopolyploid Arabidopsis interphase nuclei by studying sister-chromatid alignment at various chromosomal positions. FISH with individual BACs to flow-sorted 4C root and leaf nuclei frequently yielded more than two hybridization signals, indicating incomplete or absent sister-chromatid alignment. Up to 100% of 8C, 16C, and 32C nuclei showed no sister-chromatid alignment at defined positions. Simultaneous FISH with BACs from different chromosomal positions revealed more frequent sister-chromatid alignment in terminal than in midarm positions. Centromeric positions were mainly aligned up to a ploidy level of 16C but became separated or dispersed in 32C nuclei. DNA hypomethylation (of the whole genome) and transcriptional activity (at FWA gene position) did not impair sister-chromatid alignment. Only 6.1% of 4C leaf nuclei showed sister-chromatid separation of the entire chromosome 1 top arm territories. Homozygous transgenic tandem repeat (lac operator) arrays showing somatic homologous pairing more often than average euchromatic loci did not promote an increased frequency of sister-chromatid alignment. The high frequency of separated sister-chromatid arm positions in &gt; or =4C nuclei suggests that sister-chromatid cohesion is variable, dynamic, and not obligatory along the entire chromosome arm in meristematic and differentiated Arabidopsis nuclei.
16079194,10,2005,J Neurophysiol,Laminar variation in threshold for detection of electrical excitation of striate cortex by macaques.,Macaques were trained to signal their detection of electrical stimulation applied by a movable microelectrode to perifoveal striate cortex. Trains of &lt; or =100 cathodal, 0.2-ms, constant current pulses were delivered at 50 or 100 Hz. The minimum current that could be reliably detected was measured at successive depths along radial electrode penetrations through the cortex. The lowest detection thresholds were routinely encountered when the stimulation was applied to layer 3, particularly just at the juncture between layers 3 and 4A. On the average, there was a twofold variation in threshold along the penetrations, with the highest intracortical thresholds being in layers 4C and 6. Variations as high as 20-fold were obtained in some individual penetrations, whereas relatively little change was observed in others. The minimum detectable current was 1 muA at a site in layer 3, i.e., 10-100 times lower than that for surface stimulation. Because macaques, as do human subjects, find electrical stimulation of striate cortex to be highly similar at all loci (a phosphene in the human case), it is puzzling as to how such uniformity of effect evolves from the exceedingly intricate circuitry available to the effective stimuli. It is hypothesized that the stimulus captures the most excitable elements, which then suppress other functional moieties, producing only the luminance of the phosphene. Lowest thresholds presumably are encountered when the electrode lies among these excitable elements that can, with higher currents, be stimulated directly from some distance or indirectly by the horizontal bands of myelinated axons, the stria of Baillarger.
15641059,10,2005,Arthritis Rheum,Differential matrix degradation and turnover in early cartilage lesions of human knee and ankle joints.,OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there are differences in matrix turnover within early cartilage lesions of the ankle (talocrural) joint compared with the knee (tibiofemoral) joint that may help explain differences in the prevalence of osteoarthritis in these 2 joints.METHODS: Cartilage removed from lesions of the tali and femoral condyles was analyzed for type IIB collagen messenger RNA, C-terminal type II procollagen propeptide (CPII), the collagenase cleavage neoepitope (Col2-3/4C(short)), and the denaturation epitope (Col2-3/4m). The content of collagen, glycosaminoglycan, and epitope 846 of aggrecan was quantitated.RESULTS: In ankle lesions, there was an up-regulation of markers of synthesis (CPII [P = 0.07]; epitope 846 [P &lt; or = 0.0001]), but these were down-regulated in the knee (CPII [P = 0.1]; epitope 846 [P = 0.004]). In lesions of the knee, but not the ankle, there was an up-regulation of collagen degradation markers (P = 0.008). On a molar basis, there was 24 times more cleavage epitope than denaturation epitope in knee lesions compared with ankle lesions.CONCLUSION: The up-regulation of matrix turnover that is seen in early cartilage lesions of the ankle would appear to represent an attempt to repair the damaged matrix. The increase in collagen synthesis and aggrecan turnover seen in ankle lesions is absent from knee lesions. Instead, there is an increase in type II collagen cleavage. Together with the differences in collagen denaturation, these changes point to an emphasis on matrix assembly during early lesion development in the ankle and to degradation in the knee, resulting in fundamental differences in matrix turnover in these lesions.
15868627,9,2005,J Rheumatol,Glucosamine sulfate and cartilage type II collagen degradation in patients with knee osteoarthritis: randomized discontinuation trial results employing biomarkers.,OBJECTIVE: To determine whether glucosamine sulfate has an effect on cartilage type II collagen degradation in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).METHODS: A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled glucosamine discontinuation trial was conducted in 137 subjects with knee OA, who had had at least moderate relief of knee pain after starting glucosamine. Subjects were randomized to glucosamine at prestudy dose or placebo at an equivalent dose. Treatment was continued to Week 24 or disease flare, whichever occurred first. Serum and urine samples were collected at Weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24 or flare visit. Samples were analyzed in triplicate for 2 type II collagen degradation biomarkers: C2C epitope (COL2-3/4C(long)) and C1,2C epitope (COL2-3/4C(short)). The primary outcome was the mean change in serum and urine C1,2C/C2C ratio in the glucosamine and placebo groups from baseline to final (flare or Week 24) visit. Linear regression analyses were conducted to adjust for potential confounders. Due to non-normal distributions, the data were log-transformed (lnC1,2C/C2C). Secondary outcomes included comparison of mean change scores at final visit compared to baseline for serum and urine C1,2C and C2C in the 2 treatment groups and in Flare versus No-Flare groups.RESULTS: Baseline and final visit samples were available in 130 subjects for serum analysis and 126 subjects for urinalysis. No significant difference was seen between placebo and glucosamine groups in the serum C1,2C/C2C ratio, with a mean (SD) change from baseline to final visit of 0.8 (27.8) and -0.1 (1.8), respectively (mean difference 0.9; 95% CI -6.0, 7.7, p = 0.80). Similarly, no differences between treatment groups were seen for mean change in urine C1,2C/C2C (p = 0.82), or for mean change in C2C or C1,2C. In linear regression analysis, after adjustment for sex, radiographic severity, baseline lnC1,2C/C2C ratio, WOMAC function, and flare status, treatment was not a significant predictor of final serum or urine lnC1,2C/C2C ratio. When those who experienced flare were contrasted with those without flare, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a difference in mean baseline to final visit change score for serum C1,2C/C2C ratio (p = 0.12). In addition, in the multivariable linear regression analysis, flare status showed a borderline association with final visit serum lnC1,2C/C2C ratio (p = 0.16).CONCLUSION: No statistically significant effect of glucosamine sulfate on type II collagen fragment levels in serum or urine was observed for knee OA over 6 months. Further research is necessary to elucidate which biopathologic systems, if any, are affected by glucosamine treatment. While collagen degradation products may be of value in predicting progression, at least as defined by clinical flare, a larger dataset would be needed to prove this.
15823921,9,2005,Ophthalmic Genet,Penetrance and phenotype of the Thr377Met Myocilin mutation in a large Finnish family with juvenile- and adult-onset primary open-angle glaucoma.,PURPOSE: To study the role of myocilin (MYOC) as a susceptibility gene for juvenile- and adult-onset open-angle glaucoma (JOAG and POAG, respectively).METHODS: In a six-generation Finnish family with JOAG and POAG, we performed thorough ophthalmologic characterization (including assessment of the visual fields by Octopus perimetry, nerve-fiber layer thickness by photography, and disc size by Heidelberg tomography) of 51 individuals. The coding region of MYOC was screened for mutations by PCR amplification and direct sequencing.RESULTS: We detected a C &gt; T transition at codon 377 resulting in a substitution of a threonine residue for methionine (Thr377Met) in the olfactomedin-like domain of myocilin, segregating in the family. Of the 20 individuals heterozygous for the mutation, nine (45%) were glaucomatous and two (10%) had ocular hypertension (OHT). The mean age at diagnosis of glaucoma in these individuals was 34.3 years (range: 14-66 years). Moreover, three of these individuals suffered retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in one eye, while one individual without the mutation had RVO.CONCLUSION: Our results further support the evidence that the Thr377Met mutation in MYOC may represent a susceptibility allele for glaucoma. These findings may facilitate genetic counseling, and early diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma. The possible interaction of factors contributing to RVO in conjunction with the Thr377Met mutation warrants further investigation.
15648068,9,2005,J Med Virol,TRUGENE sequencing versus INNO-LiPA for sub-genotyping of HCV genotype-4.,Hepatitis C virus genotypes and subtypes determination is an important factor for understanding the epidemiology of the virus, in the pre-treatment evaluation of the patients and in defining better treatment strategies. In the present study, we compared two commercially available assays for HCV genotyping: the reverse hybridization based Innogenetics INNO-LiPA HCV II and the direct sequencing by TRUGENE assay. The study included 31 HCV-RNA positive Egyptian patients; 18 patients with chronic active hepatitis, 8 with HCC, and 5 with cirrhosis. Using the TRUGENE genotyping test, all the samples had genotype 4 (100%) and subtyped as 4a in 18/31(58%), 4c in 10/31 (32%), 4e in 1/31 (3%), 4a/c in 1/31 (3%), and 4g in 1/31 (3%). Using the INNO-LiPA assay, 30 samples had genotype 4 (97%), and 1 sample had genotype 1e (3%). One sample showed mixed infection with type 4f and type 1. Only six samples were subtypable by INNO-LiPA, three were genotype 4c/d, and the other three were 4f, 4e, and 1e. Seven samples gave reactivity in the INNO-LiPA of lines 5, 6, 16, 17, 18, which are considered untypable by the interpretation chart but considered to be a rare HCV genotype 4 by the manufacturer. At the genotype level, there was a 97% concordance between TRUGENE sequencing and INNO-LiPA, but at the subtype level the concordance rate was 3% only. We conclude that the TRUGENE genotyping assay is a reliable test for HCV genotyping for the detection of major types and subtypes detection, while INNO-LiPA is a good test at the genotype level but unreliable for subtyping especially in the Egyptian population. This is mainly due to the high diversity of genotype 4, which is the most prevalent genotype in Egypt.
15634755,9,2005,Mol Cancer Res,Enhancement of the antiangiogenic activity of interleukin-12 by peptide targeted delivery of the cytokine to alphavbeta3 integrin.,We engineered a fusion protein, mrIL-12vp [mouse recombinant interleukin (IL)-12 linked to vascular peptide], linking the vascular homing peptide CDCRGDCFC (RGD-4C), a ligand for alphavbeta3 integrin, to mrIL-12 to target IL-12 directly to tumor neovasculature. The fusion protein stimulated IFN-gamma production in vitro and in vivo, indicating its biological activity was consistent with mrIL-12. Immunofluorescence techniques showed mrIL-12vp specifically bound to alphavbeta3 integrin-positive cells but not to alphavbeta3 integrin-negative cells. In corneal angiogenesis assays using BALB/c mice treated with either 0.5 microg/mouse/d of mrIL-12vp or mrIL-12 delivered by subcutaneous continuous infusion, mrIL-12vp inhibited corneal neovascularization by 67% compared with only a slight reduction (13%) in angiogenesis in the mrIL-12-treated animals (P = 0.008). IL-12 receptor knockout mice given mrIL-12vp showed a marked decrease in the area of corneal neovascularization compared with mice treated with mrIL-12. These results indicate that mrIL-12vp inhibits angiogenesis through IL-12-dependent and IL-12-independent mechanisms, and its augmented antiangiogenic activity may be due to suppression of endothelial cell signaling pathways by the RGD-4C portion of the fusion protein. Mice injected with NXS2 neuroblastoma cells and treated with mrIL-12vp showed significant suppression of tumor growth compared with mice treated with mrIL-12 (P = 0.03). Mice did not show signs of IL-12 toxicity when treated with mrIL-12vp, although hepatic necrosis was present in mrIL-12-treated mice. Localization of IL-12 to neovasculature significantly enhances the antiangiogenic effect, augments antitumor activity, and decreases toxicity of IL-12, offering a promising strategy for expanding development of IL-12 for treatment of cancer patients.
16297707,8,2005,Cancer Lett,S100A4 regulates E-cadherin expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,S100A4 has multiple functions in cell cycle progression and cell motility, and has been implicated in cancer invasion. In this study, we examined the expression of S100A4, E-cadherin and its related proteins in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines with different invasive phenotypes, grade 4C and 4D. Furthermore, grade 4C OSC-19 cells expressing E-cadherin were transfected with S100A4-expression vector and the expression of E-cadherin-related proteins in the stable clone was examined to elucidate the relationship between S100A4 and E-cadherin. Constitutive over-expression of S100A4 in stable transformant of OSC-19 (OSC-19/S100A4) cells led to down-regulation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin. Furthermore, grade 4D invasive cell lines (HOC313 and TSU) expressing S100A4 mRNA did not express E-cadherin, P-cadherin, and beta-catenin, while gamma-catenin protein was only weakly expressed. Thus, the mRNA expression of E-cadherin was reversely correlated with S100A4 expression in oral SCCs. Interestingly, vascular endothelial growth factor-C was up-regulated in OSC-19/S100A4 cells. In summary, S100A4-mediated regulation of E-cadherin expression may play an important mechanism in invasion and metastasis of oral SCC.
15684699,8,2005,Hum Gene Ther,Comparison of the efficiency of transduction of leukemic cells by fiber-modified adenoviruses.,Efficient gene transfer with adenoviral type 5 (Ad5) vectors depends on the initial attachment of their fiber, which binds the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR), and their subsequent internalization, mediated by the interaction of viral penton base with target cell alphav integrins. We previously demonstrated that human leukemic cells lack these receptors and are therefore resistant to Ad5 transduction, limiting efforts to genetically modify these cells. Human leukemic blasts are, however, susceptible to transduction with an adenovector made CAR independent by substitution of a chimeric Ad5/35 fiber [Yotnda et al. (2001). Gene Ther. 8, 930-937]. Other receptors can also be targeted with recombinant ligand moieties incorporated into adenovirus fiber. We have determined which of these fiber-modified adenovectors is most effective at modifying human primary leukemia cells, and lines. We used a replication-incompetent Ad5-beta-gal vector, in which the Ad5 fiber was replaced with fiber from various adenovirus serotypes (Ad35 and Ad11), or modified either with variable length polylysine (K4, K7, K21) or RGD-4C peptide. All the modified fiber vectors transduced primary leukemia cells and cell lines more efficiently than Ad5. Polylysine-substituted Ad5F/K21 and peptide-modified Ad5F/RGD vectors were most effective overall (up to 100% efficiency), whereas Ad5F/RGD was the most effective at transducing B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (90% efficiency). Ad5F/K21 and Ad5F/RGD should be of value for the genetic modification of human primary leukemia cells.
15634653,8,2005,Mol Cancer Ther,Doxorubicin-formaldehyde conjugates targeting alphavbeta3 integrin.,We have reported the synthesis and biological evaluation of a prodrug to a doxorubicin active metabolite. Under physiologic conditions, release of the active metabolite, a conjugate of doxorubicin with formaldehyde, occurs with a half-life of 1 hour. To direct this prodrug to tumor, we designed two conjugates of the prodrug, doxsaliform, with the alphavbeta3-targeting peptides, CDCRGDCFC (RGD-4C) and cyclic-(N-Me-VRGDf) (Cilengitide). We now report the synthesis of these doxsaliform-peptide conjugates and their evaluation using MDA-MB-435 cancer cells. A hydroxylamine ether tether was used to attach 5''-formyldoxsaliform to RGD-4C in its acyclic form via an oxime functional group. The construct acyclic-RGD-4C-doxsaliform showed good binding affinity for alphavbeta3 in the vitronection cell adhesion assay (IC50 = 10 nmol/L) and good growth inhibition of MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells (IC50 = 50 nmol/L). In its bicyclic forms, RGD-4C showed less affinity for alphavbeta3 and significantly less water solubility. Cyclic-(N-Me-VRGDf) was modified by substitution of D-4-aminophenylalanine for D-phenylalanine to provide a novel attachment point for doxsaliform. The conjugate, cyclic-(N-Me-VRGDf-NH)-doxsaliform, maintained a high affinity for alphavbeta3 (IC50 = 5 nmol/L) in the vitronectin cell adhesion assay relative to the peptide bearing only the tether (0.5 nmol/L). The IC50 for growth inhibition of MDA-MB-435 cells was 90 nmol/L. Flow cytometry and growth inhibition experiments suggest that the complete drug construct does not penetrate through the plasma membrane, but the active metabolite does on release from the targeting group. These drug conjugates could have significantly reduced side effects and are promising candidates for in vivo evaluation in tumor-bearing mice.
16332793,7,2005,Appl Environ Microbiol,Relatedness of Listeria monocytogenes Isolates recovered from selected ready-to-eat foods and listeriosis patients in the United States.,Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and serotyping were performed for 544 isolates of Listeria monocytogenes, including 502 isolates recovered from contaminated samples from 31,705 retail ready-to-eat (RTE) food products and 42 isolates recovered from human cases of listeriosis. The isolates were from Maryland (294 isolates) and California (250 isolates) and were collected in 2000 and 2001. The isolates were placed into 16 AscI pulsogroups (level of relatedness within each group, &gt; or =66%), 139 AscI pulsotypes (levels of relatedness, &gt; or =25% to 100%), and eight serotypes (serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c, 3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, and 4d). The most frequently found pulsotypes belonged to either pulsogroup A (150 food isolates plus 4 clinical isolates) or pulsogroup B (104 food isolates plus 5 clinical isolates). The majority of the 502 food isolates were either serotype 1/2a (298 isolates) or serotype 1/2b (133 isolates), whereas the majority of the 42 clinical isolates were either serotype 1/2a (19 isolates) or serotype 4b (15 isolates). Additionally, 13 clinical isolates displayed pulsotypes also found in food isolates, whereas the remaining 29 clinical isolates displayed 24 unique pulsotypes. These data indicate that most (86%) of the L. monocytogenes subtypes found in the RTE foods sampled belonged to only two serotypes and that 90% of the isolates displayed 73 pulsotypes, with 107 isolates displaying pulsotype 1. These data should help define the distribution and relatedness of isolates found in RTE foods in comparison with isolates that cause listeriosis.
16011889,7,2005,Int J Dev Neurosci,SCL, GATA-2 and Lmo2 expression in neurogenesis.,SCL, Lmo2 and GATA factors form common transcription complexes during hematopoietic differentiation. The overlapping expression of SCL with GATA-2 and GATA-3 in the developing brain indicated that these factors might collaborate also in the course of neural tissue differentiation. The expression pattern of Lmo2 in the developing CNS, however, is not well understood. Here, we show that neural cells in the early embryonic chick mid- and hindbrain express SCL and GATA-2, while Lmo2 is expressed only in vascular elements. The lack of Lmo2 transcripts in neural cells demonstrated that SCL and GATA-2 cannot form common complexes with Lmo2 in the developing brain. In the course of neural tissue genesis, GATA-2 mRNA appeared prior to the SCL transcript. While GATA-2 expression decreased with maturation, SCL expression persisted at a high level also in post-neurogenic periods. The temporal pattern of SCL and GATA-2/3 expression was investigated also in vitro, in the course of induced neurogenesis by NE-4C neural stem cells. While GATA-2 expression increased from the very beginning of differentiation, SCL expression appeared only in more differentiated cells expressing proneural genes. GATA-3 expression, on the other hand, was detected only in advanced stages of the neuronal maturation, which were characterised by the activation of the Math2 neuronal gene. Similarly to the hematopoietic differentiation, GATA-2 expression precedes the activation of both SCL and GATA-3, and may play roles in the activation of the SCL gene in neuronal development. In contrast to hematopoietic differentiation, however, our results failed to demonstrate co-assembling of GATA factors or SCL with Lmo2. While overlapping expression of GATA-2/3 and SCL was detected, Lmo2 activation could not be demonstrated in neural cells in the investigated period of neuronal development.
15727849,7,2005,Bioorg Med Chem,Design, synthesis, antibacterial and QSAR studies of benzimidazole and imidazole chloroaryloxyalkyl derivatives.,In view of obtaining some potential antibacterial compounds, we have described synthesis of some chloroaryloxyalkyl imidazole and benzimidazole derivatives. The relevant step in the synthetic sequence was the initial condensation of 4-chloro or 2,4-dichlorophenol with 1, n-dibromoalkanes (n=2, 4, 5) to provide compounds 3a-f in sufficient yields. The subsequent condensation of 3a-f with some imidazole derivatives and benzimidazole afforded products 4a-l and 5a-e in good yields. Some of compounds 4a-l as well as 5a-e were tested in vitro against Salmonella typhi O-901 and Staphylococcus aureus A 15091. Compounds 4a and 4c showed considerable bactericidal activities against tested bacteria. Compound 4b showed significant activity against S. aureus A 15091 but was inactive against S. typhi O-901. Other compounds showed intermediate activities against S. aureus A 15091 but most of them were inactive against S. typhi O-901. Semiempirical AM1 calculations showed that negative electrostatic potentials around oxygen of the phenoxy and nitrogen of the imidazole moieties have direct effect on the antibacterial activity towards S. aureus A 15091. In QSAR analysis, different electronic, topologic, functional groups and physicochemical descriptors were calculated for each molecule and a three parametric equation was found between the logMIC and HOMO energy, hydration energy and number of primary carbon atoms of the molecules.
16377082,6,2005,Cancer Lett,Cytochrome P450 2A6 polymorphism in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,Nitrosamine has been identified as a carcinogen for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we investigated if a nitrosamine metabolizing gene, cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) played an important role in NPC development. Relationships between the disease and the CYP2A6 were studied in 74 NPC patients and 137 age-matched healthy controls by using PCR-RFLP assay to distinguish between a wide type allele, *1A, and two mutant alleles, *1B and *4C. Overall, a significant association between CYP2A6 polymorphism and NPC development was observed (P&lt;0.05). Individual with mutant alleles had an increased risk for NPC when compared to those with *1A/*1A (OR=2.37, 95% CI=1.27-4.46). In addition, males who carried mutant alleles of CYP2A6 had a fivefold increased risk for NPC when compared with those who carried *1A/*1A genotype (OR=5.02, 95% CI=1.82-14.14). It is thus suggested that CYP2A6 polymorphism may play a crucial role in NPC susceptibility and it may be used as a risk marker for NPC.
16313925,6,2005,Life Sci,Preferential inhibition of human phosphodiesterase 4 by ibudilast.,Ibudilast ophthalmic solution exhibited an improved clinical efficacy over cromoglycate in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. To further characterize its principal mode of action, the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitory profile of ibudilast has been examined using human recombinant enzymes. Ibudilast, but not the other commonly used anti-allergic ophthalmic solutions including cromoglycate, ketotifen, tranilast and levocabastine, potently inhibits purified human PDE4A, 4B, 4C and 4D with IC50 values at 54, 65, 239 and 166 nM, respectively. Ibudilast effectively blocks lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha, IC50 = 6.2 microM) and N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)-induced leukotriene (LT) B4 biosynthesis (IC50 = 2.5 microM) in human whole blood, which are 3 and 6-fold more potent than cilomilast, respectively. The attenuated inflammatory and allergic responses from the potent and preferential PDE4 inhibition of ibudilast may have contributed significantly to its beneficial pharmacological responses and distinguishes ibudilast from the other ophthalmic solutions in the treatment of ocular allergy.
16269078,6,2005,Int J Health Geogr,Towards understanding the presence/absence of Human African Trypanosomosis in a focus of Côte d'Ivoire: a spatial analysis of the pathogenic system.,BACKGROUND: This study aimed at identifying factors influencing the development of Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT, or sleeping sickness) in the focus of Bonon, located in the mesophile forest of Côte d'Ivoire. A previous study mapping the main daytime activity sites of 96 patients revealed an important disparity between the area south of the town- where all the patients lived- and the area north of the town, apparently free of disease. In order to explain this disparity, we carried out a spatial analysis of the key components of the pathogenic system, i.e. the human host, the tsetse vector and the trypanosomes in their environment using a geographic information system (GIS).RESULTS: This approach at the scale of a HAT focus enabled us to identify spatial patterns which linked to the transmission and the dissemination of this disease. The history of human settlement (with the rural northern area exploited much earlier than the southern one) appears to be a major factor which determines the land use pattern, which itself may account for differences found in vector densities (tsetse were found six times more abundant in the southern rural area than in the northern). Vector density, according to the human and environmental context in which it is found (here an intense mobility between the town of Bonon and the rural areas), may explain the observed spatial differences in HAT prevalence.CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates the role of GIS analyses of key components of the pathogenic system in providing a better understanding of transmission and dissemination of HAT. Moreover, following the identification of the most active transmission areas, and of an area unfavourable to HAT transmission, this study more precisely delineates the boundaries of the Bonon focus. As a follow-up, targeted tsetse control activities starting north of Bonon (with few chances of reinvasion due to very low densities) going south, and additional medical surveys in the south will be proposed to the Ivoirian HAT control program to enhance the control of the disease in this focus. This work also shows the evolution of HAT regarding time and environment, and the methodology used may be able to predict possible sleeping sickness development/extinction in areas with similar history and space organization.
16179927,6,2005,Cancer Gene Ther,Engineering conditionally replication-competent adenoviral vectors carrying the cytosine deaminase gene increases the infectivity and therapeutic effect for breast cancer gene therapy.,We constructed a conditionally replication-competent adenoviral vector Ad.Lp-CD-IRES-E1A(control) in which the expression of both the prodrug-activating cytosine deaminase gene and the viral replication E1A gene were driven by the L-plastin tumor-specific promoter. In order to overcome the low infectivity of the adenoviral vectors for breast cancer cells, and to increase the safety and efficacy for cancer gene therapy, this vector was further modified on a transductional level by simultaneously ablating the native tropism of the vector to the primary CAR receptor and inserting a RGD-4C peptide into the HI loop of the fiber, which allows the vector to use the alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 receptors as alternative receptors. The resulting vector was named Ad.Lp-CD-IRES-E1A(MRGD). The transduction efficiency of the vector for breast cancer cell lines which have low expression level of CAR was increased both in vitro and in vivo. The Ad.Lp-CD-IRES-E1A(MRGD) vector produces a higher vector particle yield and a greater cytotoxic effect in tumor cells which have a low expression level of CAR, than did the Ad.Lp-CD-IRES-E1A(control) vector. Intratumoral injection of the Ad.Lp-CD-IRES-E1A(MRGD) vector following the intraperitoneal injection of 5FC into xenotransplanted human breast cancer cell lines which have low expression level of CAR led to greater degree of tumor regression in vivo than did the intratumoral injection of control adenoviral vectors not so modified.
16176798,6,2005,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Genetic polymorphism of CYP2A6 as one of the potential determinants of tobacco-related cancer risk.,Analyzing the CYP2A6 gene of subjects who showed a poor metabolic phenotype toward SM-12502, we discovered a novel mutant allele (CYP2A6*4C) lacking the whole CYP2A6 gene. Using genetically engineered Salmonella typhimurium expressing a human CYP, we found that CYP2A6 was involved in the metabolic activation of a variety of nitrosamines such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) contained in tobacco smoke. Taking these results into consideration, we hypothesized that the subjects carrying the CYP2A6*4C allele had lower risk of tobacco-related lung cancer. In accordance with our hypothesis, our epidemiological studies indicated that smokers homozygous for the CYP2A6*4C allele showed much lower odds ratios toward cancer risk. Other mutant alleles reducing the CYP2A6 activity, besides CYP2A6*4C, also reduced the risk of lung cancer in smokers, particularly of squamous-cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma, both smoking-related cancers. 8-Methoxypsoralen, an inhibitor of CYP2A6, efficiently prevented the occurrence of adenoma caused by NNK in A/J mice.
15949122,6,2005,J Med Screen,Second reading of screening mammograms increases cancer detection and recall rates. Results in the Florence screening programme.,OBJECTIVE: To assess double reading effectiveness in mammography screening.DESIGN: Retrospective study of 177,631 consecutive mammograms double read during 1998-2003.SETTING: The Florence screening programme, involving 11 trained radiologists. Abnormalities reported by at least one reader prompted assessment.RESULTS: The referral rate was 2.89% for the first reader, 3.15% for the second reader, and 3.59% for either reader. Of 713 total cancers detected, 43 were suspected only by the second reader (6.4% relative, 0.024% increase in absolute detection rate) and had a lower stage compared to the first reader (pTis-pT1b = 65.7 versus 52.0%): 41 were reviewed and classified (error type) as &quot;minimal sign&quot; in six, and &quot;screening error&quot; in 35 cases, or as BI-RADS 3 in one, 4a in 20, 4b in 13, and 4c in three cases. The second reading cost was 2.70 per woman examined, or 11,168 per additional cancer detected (versus 11,585 at a single reading).DISCUSSION: Second reading is effective in detecting a limited number of additional cancer cases. Tumour stage (one-third over 1 cm in diameter) and review findings (high rate of &quot;screening errors&quot; and BI-RADS R4b-c categories) suggest that second reading detects small &quot;difficult cases&quot; as well as larger cancers missed due to fatigue or loss of attention. Second reading reduces screening specificity to a minor extent, and since cancer detection at second reading seems cost-effective the procedure is recommendable in routine practice.
15787579,5,2005,J Org Chem,Chemoenzymatic asymmetric total synthesis of phosphodiesterase inhibitors: preparation of a polycyclic pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine from an acylnitroso Diels-Alder cycloadduct-derived aminocyclopentenol.,[reaction: see text] Enzymatic resolution of Boc-protected 4-aminocyclopenten-1-ol 4c gave both enantiomers 5c and 6c in high ee. Boc removal and separate condensation with chloropyrazolopyrimidine 18 provided elaborated 1,4-aminocyclopentenol derivatives 20 and 26, respectively. Separate treatment of 20 and 26 with Pd(0) under basic conditions induced cyclization to unsaturated polycycles 22 and 27, which, upon catalytic hydrogenation, were transformed to new cyclopentane-containing pyrazolopyrimidines 24 and 28, analogues of recently described novel phosphodiesterase inhibitors.
15772752,5,2005,J Biomol NMR,1H and 15N resonance assignment, secondary structure and dynamic behaviour of the C-terminal domain of human papillomavirus oncoprotein E6.,E6 is a viral oncoprotein implicated in cervical cancers, produced by human papillomaviruses (HPVs). E6 contains two putative zinc-binding domains of about 75 residues each. The difficulty in producing recombinant E6 has long hindered the obtention of structural data. Recently, we described the expression and purification of E6-C 4C/4S, a stable, folded mutant of the C-terminal domain of HPV16 E6. Here, we have produced 15N-labelled samples of E6-C 4C/4S for structural studies by NMR. We have assigned most 1H and 15N resonances and identified the elements of secondary structure of the domain. The domain displays an original alpha/beta topology with roughly equal proportions of alpha-helix and beta-sheet. The PDZ-binding region of E6, located at the extreme C-terminus of the domain, is in a random conformation. Mass spectrometry demonstrated the presence of one zinc ion per protein molecule. Kinetics of replacement of zinc by cadmium followed by 1H,15N-HSQC experiments revealed specific frequency changes for the zinc-binding cysteines and their immediate neighbours. NMR spectra were affected by severe line-broadening effects which seriously hindered the assignment work. Investigation of these effects by 15N relaxation experiments showed that they are due to heterogeneous dynamic behaviour with mus-ms time scale motions occurring in localised regions of the monomeric domain.
16024113,4,2005,Radiother Oncol,The possible role of TP53 mutation status in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) with radiotherapy with different overall treatment times.,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: TP53-mutations have been shown to influence the radiosensitivity of HNSCC. Furthermore, HNSCC with mutated TP53, may have a higher proliferative potential caused by a lack of control in G1 checkpoint. Our aim of the study was to identify the role of TP53 mutations for the outcome of radiotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA extracted from 180 paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed pretreatment biopsies of HNSCC was screened for mutations in exon 4C-10 by denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC) followed by sequencing. Treatment was 66-68Gy, 2Gy/fx with overall treatment times of 6.5 and 5.5 weeks according to the DAHANCA-guidelines. Endpoints were local control at T-site, disease-specific and crude survival.RESULTS: 125 of 180 carcinomas (69%) carried in total 176 mutations. 72 carcinomas were WT (40%) and 108 carcinomas (60%) carried mutations giving dysfunctional p53. Overall, mutations in TP53 were not associated with the endpoints. However, when dichotomising according to TP53 status and evaluating the effect of the overall treatment time then tumours with mutant TP53 did benefit from 6 instead of 5fx/wk regarding local control, P=0.005; RR: 0.33 (C.I 95%:0.15-0.75) whereas WT-tumours did not (P=0.9). These observations were also reflected in the disease-specific and crude survival.CONCLUSIONS: If all patients were considered regardless of treatment schedule, then TP53-mutations were not related to local control or survival. However, mutations in TP53 may be associated with HNSCC that benefit of a reduced overall treatment time of radiotherapy.
15972986,4,2005,Phys Med Biol,A search for optimal x-ray spectra in iodine contrast media mammography.,The aim of this work was to search for the optimal x-ray tube voltage and anode-filter combination in digital iodine contrast media mammography. In the optimization, two entities were of interest: the average glandular dose, AGD, and the signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, for detection of diluted iodine contrast medium. The optimum is defined as the technique maximizing the figure of merit, SNR2/AGD. A Monte Carlo computer program was used which simulates the transport of photons from the x-ray tube through the compression plate, breast, breast support plate, anti-scatter grid and image detector. It computes the AGD and the SNR of an iodine detail inside the compressed breast. The breast thickness was varied between 2 and 8 cm with 10-90% glandularity. The tube voltage was varied between 20 and 55 kV for each anode material (Rh, Mo and W) in combination with either 25 microm Rh or 0.05-0.5 mm Cu added filtration. The x-ray spectra were calculated with MCNP4C (Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code System, version 4C). A CsI scintillator was used as the image detector. The results for Rh/0.3 mmCu, Mo/0.3 mmCu and W/0.3 mmCu were similar. For all breast thicknesses, a maximum in the figure of merit was found at approximately 45 kV for the Rh/Cu, Mo/Cu and W/Cu combinations. The corresponding results for the Rh/Rh combination gave a figure of merit that was typically lower and more slowly varying with tube voltage. For a 4 cm breast at 45 kV, the SNR2/AGD was 3.5 times higher for the Rh/0.3 mmCu combination compared with the Rh/Rh combination. The difference is even larger for thicker breasts. The SNR2/AGD increases slowly with increasing Cu-filter thickness. We conclude that tube voltages between 41 and 55 kV and added Cu-filtration will result in significant dose advantage in digital iodine contrast media mammography compared to using the Rh/Rh anode/filter combination at 25-32 kV.
15771461,4,2005,J Med Chem,Synthesis and in vitro and in vivo structure-activity relationships of novel antifungal triazoles for dermatology.,In search for new compounds with potential for clinical use as antifungal agents in dermatology, a series of 12 azole compounds were synthesized stereospecifically and investigated specifically for their activity against dermatophyte fungal infections in animal models. This panel of azoles was studied in vitro and compared with itraconazole and terbinafine for their antifungal activity using a panel of 24 Candida spp. and 182 dermatophyte isolates. Three azoles (1c, 2c, and 4c) showed in vitro antifungal potency equivalent to itraconazole, but superior to terbinafine, against a panel of 24 Candida spp. with comparable or lower activity than that of itraconazole and terbinafine against 182 dermatophyte isolates and only rare activity against other pathogenic fungi. However, in vivo 1c and 4c, both given orally, demonstrated antifungal activity at least three times greater than itraconazole and were superior compared to terbinafine in M. canis infected guinea pigs. In a mouse model infected by T. mentagrophytes, again 4c, but not 1c, showed 5-fold superior activity over itraconazole and terbinafine. Compound 2c was effective in both models but less effective than itraconazole in these models. On the basis of these promising results, 4c is currently being clinically investigated for its potential as a novel antifungal agent against dermatophytosis.
15661219,4,2005,Gynecol Oncol,Adenoviruses with an RGD-4C modification of the fiber knob elicit a neutralizing antibody response but continue to allow enhanced gene delivery.,OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of preexisting neutralizing antibody (NAbs) in naive mice and the effect of induced NAbs in mice immunized with either an RGD or nonmodified Ad5 vector on the transduction efficiency of adenoviral vectors.METHODS: BALB/c mice were immunized with Ad5LucRGD, with the unmodified Ad5Luc1, or with Opti-MEM intraperitoneally (ip) from one to three times. Sera were collected on day 27 and serially diluted to block Ad5Luc1 or Ad5LucRGD prior to infection of SKOV3.ip1 human ovarian carcinoma cells with these same vectors. Forty-eight hours post Ad infection, a luciferase assay was performed to determine the titer of NAbs.RESULTS: Luciferase assay data showed that the gene transfer efficacy of Ad5LucRGD was 1.56-fold higher than Ad5Luc1 in the presence of serum from naive mice. In the presence of serum from Ad5Luc1-challenged mice, the transduction efficiency of Ad5LucRGD was 3.27-fold higher (single challenge) and 4.2-fold higher (triple challenge) than Ad5Luc1. In the presence of serum from Ad5LucRGD-challenged mice, the transduction efficiency of Ad5LucRGD was 2.24-fold higher (single challenge) and 2.53-fold higher (triple challenge) than Ad5Luc1.CONCLUSION: The RGD-modified human Ad vectors appear to be less recognizable than unmodified Ad to preexisting NAbs in mouse models. RGD-modified Ad vectors also appear to elicit a relatively lower level of NAbs that may also contribute to the higher gene transduction efficiency of these modified vectors. Therefore, RGD-modified Ad vectors may be reagents of clinical utility in the context of preformed anti-Ad immunity and in the setting of repetitive dosing.
16279795,3,2005,J Med Chem,Tricyclic pyrazoles. 3. Synthesis, biological evaluation, and molecular modeling of analogues of the cannabinoid antagonist 8-chloro-1-(2',4'-dichlorophenyl)-N-piperidin-1-yl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[6,7]cyclohepta[1,2-c]pyrazole-3-carboxamide.,A series of analogues of 8-chloro-1-(2',4'-dichlorophenyl)-N-piperidin-1-yl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[6,7]cyclohepta[1,2-c]pyrazole-3-carboxamide 4a (NESS 0327) (Ruiu, S.; Pinna, G. A.; Marchese, G.; Mussinu, J. M.; Saba, P.; Tambaro, S.; Casti, P.; Vargiu, R.; Pani, L. Synthesis and Characterization of NESS 0327: A Novel Putative Antagonist of CB1 Cannabinoid Receptor. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 306, 363-370) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity to cannabinoid receptors. Depending on the chemical modification of the lead structure that was chosen, compounds 4b, 4c, 4i, 4l, and 4m still proved to be potent binders of the CB1 receptor. Moreover, several analogues (4c, 4d, 4e, and 4m) demonstrated superior CB2 receptor binding affinities compared to the parent ligand. Compounds 4b, 4c, 4i, and 4l displayed the most promising pharmacological profiles, having the highest selectivity for CB1 receptors with Ki(CB2) to Ki(CB1) ratios of 11,250, 2000, 3330 and 4625, respectively. Compound 4c increased the intestinal propulsion in mice and antagonized the effect induced by the CB1 receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2. Finally, molecular modeling studies were carried out on a set of tricyclic pyrazoles (2a-4a) and on rimonabant 1 (SR141716A), indicating that high CB1 receptors affinities were consistent for the tricyclic derivatives, both with a nonplanar geometry of the tricyclic cores and with a precise orientation of the substituent (chlorine) on this ring system.
16027006,3,2005,Protein Expr Purif,Expression, purification, and characterization of a neovasculature targeted rmhTNF-alpha in Escherichia coli.,The tumor vasculature is a suitable target for cancer treatment. RGD-4C (CDCRGDCFC) peptide can bind to human alphav integrins, which are known to be selectively expressed in human tumor blood vessels. Some studies showed that coupling anticancer drugs or peptides to the RGD peptides yielded compounds with increased efficacy against tumors and lowered toxicity to normal tissues in mice. TNF-alpha mutant (rmhTNF-alpha) that we previously constructed has been proved to have stronger antitumor effect compared with TNF-alpha. To increase antitumor effect and lower toxicity of rmhTNF-alpha, we coupled RGD4C to the N-terminal of rmhTNF-alpha (termed RGD4C-rmhTNF) and expressed RGD4C-rmhTNF in Escherichia coli. Here, we describe the expression, purification, and characterization of RGD4C-rmhTNF.
15950468,3,2005,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives as antibacterial and antiviral agents.,A series of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and antiviral activities. The structure-activity relationships of these compounds were also studied. The results suggest that compounds 9-22 showed in vitro marked antibacterial activity. Compounds 4c and 7a showed inhibitory effect against RNA dependent RNA polymerase induced poliovirus type 2 infected HeLa cells.
15942874,3,2005,J Gen Appl Microbiol,Synthesis of Schiff bases of 2-amino-5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles and their evaluation for antimicrobial activities.,Twenty Schiff bases of 2-amino-5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles have been synthesized with different aromatic aldehydes. The structures of the compounds were confirmed by nitrogen analysis, IR and 13C-NMR spectral data. The antibacterial properties of the compounds were investigated against Proteus mirabilis (MTCC-425), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC-424), Bacillus subtilis (MTCC-619) and Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC-96) using the broth dilution method. The most active compounds were 4c (64 microg/ml), 4f (68 microg/ml), 4m (64 microg/ml) and 4q (62 microg/ml). The antifungal screening of the compounds were carried out using Aspergillus niger (MTCC-1344) and Candida albicans (MTCC-227) using the broth dilution method. Active compounds were 4g (52 microg/ml), 4h (56 microg/ml), 4l (60 microg/ml), 4m (58 microg/ml).
15810842,3,2005,J Am Chem Soc,Highly enantioselective phase-transfer-catalyzed alkylation of protected alpha-amino acid amides toward practical asymmetric synthesis of vicinal diamines, alpha-amino ketones, and alpha-amino alcohols.,Highly enantioselective alkylation of protected glycine diphenylmethyl (Dpm) amide 1 and Weinreb amide 10 has been realized under phase-transfer conditions by the successful utilization of designer chiral quaternary ammonium salts of type 4 as catalyst. Particularly, remarkable reactivity of the chiral ammonium enolate derived from 1b and 4c allowed the reaction with less reactive simple secondary alkyl halides with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. An additional unique feature of this chiral ammonium enolate is its ability to recognize the chirality of beta-branched primary alkyl halides, which provides impressive levels of kinetic resolution and double stereodifferentiation during the alkylation, allowing for two alpha- and gamma-stereocenters to be controlled. Combined with the subsequent reduction using LiAlH4 in cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME), this system offers a facile access to structurally diverse optically active vicinal diamines. Furthermore, the optically active alpha-amino acid Weinreb amide 11 can be efficiently converted to the corresponding amino ketone by a simple treatment with Grignard reagents. In addition, reduction and alkylation of the optically active alpha-amino ketone into both syn and anti alpha-amino alcohols with almost complete relative and absolute stereochemical control have been achieved. With (S,S)- and (R,R)-4 in hand, the present approach renders both enantiomers of alpha-amino amides including Weinreb amides readily available with enormous structural variation and also establishes a general and practical route to vicinal diamines, alpha-amino ketones, and alpha-amino alcohols with the desired stereochemistry.
15801855,3,2005,J Med Chem,Preparation and pharmacological characterization of trans-2-amino-5(6)-fluoro-6(5)-hydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-indenes as D2-like dopamine receptor agonists.,The present work reports the synthesis of trans-2-amino-5(6)-fluoro-6(5)-hydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-indenes (4a-f, 5a-f) as a continuation of our studies to better understand the significance of the halo substituent in the trans-1-phenyl-2-aminoindane series and to extend knowledge of the monophenolic ligands of DA receptors. The affinity of the new compounds and related methoxylated precursors (10-15 and 18-23) was estimated in vitro by displacement of [(3)H]SCH23390 (for D(1)-like receptors) or [(3)H]YM-09-151-2 (for D(2)-like receptors) from homogenates of porcine striatal membranes. The results indicate that unsubstituted amines 4a, 5a, 10, and 11 are poorly effective at DA receptors. The introduction of two n-propyl groups on the nitrogen atom (compounds 14, 15, 4c, and 5c) and N-allyl-N-methyl- or N-methyl-N-propyl- substitution (compounds 20-23, 4e, 4f, 5e, 5f) increased the D(2)-like affinities and selectivity. The D(2)-like agonistic activity of selected compounds 15, 20, 21, 4e, 5c, and 5e was proved by evaluating their effects on the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content in rat neostriatal membranes. All tested compounds displayed a potential dopamine D(2)-like agonist profile decreasing basal levels of cGMP. The selective D(2)-like agonism of compounds 20 and 5e was proved by their effects on basal striatal adenylyl cyclase activity.
15762726,3,2005,Inorg Chem,Design of rhenium(I) polypyridine biotin complexes as a new class of luminescent probes for avidin.,This paper describes the design of a series of luminescent rhenium(I) polypyridine biotin complexes containing different spacer-arms, [Re(N-N)(CO)3 (py-4-CH2-NH-biotin)](PF6) (py-4-CH2-NH-biotin = 4-(biotinamidomethyl)pyridine; N-N = 1,10-phenanthroline, phen (1a), 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, Me4-phen (2a), 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, Me2-Ph2-phen (3a), dipyrido[3,2-f:2',3'-h]quinoxaline, dpq (4a)), [Re(N-N)(CO)3 (py-3-CO-NH-en-NH-biotin)](PF6) (py-3-CO-NH-en-NH-biotin = 3-(N-((2-biotinamido)ethyl)amido)pyridine; N-N = phen (1b), Me4-phen (2b), Me2-Ph2-phen (3b), dpq (4b)), and [Re(N-N)(CO)3 (py-4-CH2-NH-cap-NH-biotin)](PF6) (py-4-CH2-NH-cap-NH-biotin = 4-(N-((6-biotinamido)hexanoyl)aminomethyl)pyridine; N-N = phen (1c), Me4-phen (2c), Me2-Ph(2)-phen (3c), dpq (4c)). Upon irradiation, all of the rhenium(I)-biotin complexes exhibited intense and long-lived triplet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (3MLCT) (d pi(Re) --&gt; pi* (diimine)) emission in fluid solutions at 298 K. The interactions of these biotin-containing complexes with avidin have been studied by 4'-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid (HABA) assays, emission titrations, and competitive association and dissociation assays. On the basis of the results of these experiments, homogeneous assays for biotin and avidin have been designed.
16314124,2,2005,Cell Biol Int,Whole-genome chromosome distribution during nuclear fragmentation of giant trophoblast cells of Microtus rossiaemeridionalis studied with the use of gonosomal chromatin arrangement.,Gonosomal chromatin bodies (GCBs), i.e. blocks of condensed chromatin consisting of heterochromatized region of the sex chromosomes of the field vole M. rossiaemeridionalis, were used as a natural interphase chromosome marker in order to clarify the regularities of GCB rearrangement during nuclear fragmentation of secondary giant trophoblast cells (SGTCs) at the end of their differentiation. Cytophotometrical measurements of DNA content in the nuclei, nuclear fragments and simultaneously in the GCBs were made in the secondary giant SGTCs of field vole M. rossiaemeridionalis. In most cases 1 to 2 GCBs get into the nuclear fragments at different ploidy levels. In the nuclear fragments, GCB DNA content decreased mostly proportionally to DNA content in the whole fragments corresponding to 2c, 4c and 8c. The data obtained demonstrate a regular whole-genome chromosome distribution into nuclear fragments. A possible mechanism of nuclear fragmentation that largely ensures a balanced genome in nuclear fragments is discussed.
16183159,2,2005,Neurosci Res,Studies on the use of NE-4C embryonic neuroectodermal stem cells for targeting brain tumour.,Neural stem cells were suggested to migrate to and invade intracranial gliomas. In the presented studies, interactions of NE-4C embryonic neural stem cells were investigated with C6 and Gl261, LL and U87, glioblastoma cells or with primary astrocytes. Glioma-derived humoral factors did not influence the proliferation of stem cells. NE-4C-derived humoral factors did not alter the proliferation of Gl261 and U87 cells, but increased the mitotic activity of C6 cells and that of astrocytes. In chimera-aggregates, all types of glioma cells co-aggregated with astrocytes, but most of them segregated from stem cells. Complete intercalation of stem and tumour cells was detected only in chimera-aggregates of Gl261 glioma and NE-4C cells. If mixed suspensions of NE-4C and Gl261 cells were injected into the brain, stem cells survived and grew inside the tumour mass. NE-4C stem cells, however, did not migrate towards the tumour, if implanted near to Gl261 tumours established in the adult mouse forebrain. The observations indicate that not all types of stem cells could be used for targeting all sorts of brain tumours.
16139031,2,2005,Surg Clin North Am,Gastric motility, gastroparesis, and gastric stimulation.,Gastroparesis is the most common disorder of gastric motility. It is frequently overlooked in clinical practice because the symptoms of gastroparesis are nonspecific. This article reviews normal and abnormal gastric motility, discusses the etiology and pathogenesis of gastroparesis, and provides an overview on new treatment options for gastroparesis, including gastric stimulation.
16084100,2,2005,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and antitrichinellosis activity of some 2-substituted-[1,3]thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazol-3(2H)-ones.,Some new thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazolone derivatives were synthesized using two methods. The structures of the synthesized compounds were proved by means of IR, (1)H NMR and mass spectral data. Ab initio computations were performed in order to determine the electronic structure and geometry of the investigated molecules and to compare it to the geometry of albendazole. Biologically, experiments in vitro and in vivo were accomplished in order to identify the efficacy of the obtained thiazolobenzimidazolones against Trichinella spiralis. The effectiveness of compounds 4a-c in the intestinal phase of trichinellosis was 100% and in the muscle phase were 88% and 80% at a concentration of 100mg/kg mw for the compounds 4a and 4c. The results of the hepatotoxicity test showed that the compounds 4a and 4b possess hepatotoxicity comparable to that of albendazole.
16080528,2,2005,Anticancer Res,Cytokeratin expression correlates with aneuploidy in cytological specimens of melanoma metastases.,It has been postulated that the high malignancy of melanomas could be connected with an increased cytokeratin (CK) expression. In order to define the relationship between CK expression and genetic instability of melanoma metastases, ploidy-related parameters were compared in cytological specimens of CK-positive and CK-negative melanoma metastases. CK expression was investigated immunohistochemically in 35 melanoma liver metastases and in 52 melanoma lymphatic metastases. Ploidy-related parameters were evaluated on Feulgen-stained specimens with a CAS200 image analyzer. Cytokeratin was detected in 14 out of 35 melanoma liver metastases and in 24 out of 52 melanoma lymphatic metastases investigated. Significant differences between CK-positive and CK-negative melanoma metastases were found for the percentage of diploid cells, percentage of tetraploid cells, percentage of aneuploid cells between 4c and 8c, as well as for 5c exceeding rate. Our results confirmed that CK is present in more advanced (unstable), clearly aneuploid forms of melanoma metastases.
16061386,2,2005,Bioorg Med Chem,Molecular modeling, design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel 3',4'-dicamphanoyl-(+)-cis-khellactone (DCK) analogs as potent anti-HIV agents.,Our current studies aimed at developing new potential anti-AIDS drug candidates have focused on the design and synthesis of new DCK analogs with improved molecular water solubility. Based on the structures and biodata of previous DCK analogs, 3D-QSAR studies have been performed which resulted in two reliable computational models, CoMFA and CoMSIA, with r(2) values of 0.995 and 0.987, and q(2) values of 0.662 and 0.657, respectively. In accord with these 3D-QSAR models, 15 new DCK analogs with polar functional groups at the 3-position were subsequently designed, synthesized, and evaluated against HIV-1 replication in H9 and MT4 cell lines. New DCK analogs 3b, 3c, 4b, 4c, 6a, 7c, and 9a showed promising potency with EC(50) values ranging from 0.09 to 0.0002 microM in both assays. Meanwhile, these promising compounds also showed a wide range of predicted logP values from 0.90 to 5.19, which increased the probability of identifying anti-HIV drug candidates from this class of compounds for clinical trials. Furthermore, both experimental and predicted values matched well, corroborating the reliability of the established 3D-QSAR models.
16049679,2,2005,Mol Genet Genomics,Mpg1, a fission yeast protein required for proper septum structure, is involved in cell cycle progression through cell-size checkpoint.,Using a yeast two-hybrid screen we isolated a gene from Schizosaccharomyces pombe which corresponds to the previously uncharacterized ORF SPCC1906.01. We have designated this gene as mpg1, based on the putative function of its product as a mannose-1-phosphatase guanyltransferase. Mpg1 shows strong similarity to other GDP-mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferases involved in the maintenance of cell wall integrity and/or glycosylation. This homology, together with the protein's localization pattern demonstrated in this work, strongly suggests that Mpg1 is involved in cell wall and septum synthesis. Moreover, cells lacking Mpg1 present a defect in glycosylation, are more sensitive to Lyticase, and show an aberrant septum structure from the start of its deposition, indicating that the Mpg1 function is necessary for the correct assembly of the septum. Interestingly, lack of Mpg1 clearly affects cell cycle progression: mpg1 null mutants arrest as septated and bi-nucleated 4C cells, without an actomyosin ring. Wee1 is required for the G2/M arrest induced in the absence of Mpg1, since the blockade is circumvented when Wee1 is inactivated. Wee1 is part of a cell-size checkpoint that prevents entry into mitosis before cells reach a critical size. The results presented in this work demonstrate that the G2/M arrest induced in the absence of Mpg1 is mediated by this cell size checkpoint, since oversized mutant cells enter mitosis. The mpg1 loss-of-function mutant, therefore, provides a good model in which to study how cells coordinate cell growth and cell division.
16040161,2,2005,Eur J Med Chem,Novel milrinone analogs of pyridine-3-carbonitrile derivatives as promising cardiotonic agents.,In an attempt to design new inotropic drugs for congestive heart failure (CHF) with less proarrhythmic potential, three series of compounds analogous to milrinone were prepared, namely, 4-aryl-6-(4-pyridyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carbonitriles 2a-g, 4-aryl-6-(4-pyridyl)-2-thioxo-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carbonitriles 3a-g and 2-amino-4-aryl-6-(4-pyridyl)-pyridine-3-carbonitriles 4a-g. The first series was prepared by reacting 4-acetyl pyridine with the appropriate aldehyde, ethyl cyanoacetate and ammonium acetate in ethanol. Reaction of 2a-g with phosphorus pentasulfide afforded the second series 3a-g. The third target compounds 4a-g were prepared applying the same procedure used to synthesize 2a-g using malononitrile instead of ethyl cyanoacetate. All the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their cardiotonic activity and their in vivo cardiovascular effects. In addition, their oral and parenteral acute toxicity were determined. Compounds 2a, 2b, 2c, 4c and 4f proved to exert cardiotonic activity comparable to that of milrinone using spontaneously beating atria model from reserpine-treated guinea pigs. In addition these compounds proved to be non-toxic and well tolerated by mice up to 250 mg kg(-1) orally and up to 125 mg kg(-1) through parenteral route.
15901139,2,2005,Org Lett,Synthesis of C3-symmetric tris(beta-hydroxy amide) ligands and their Ti(IV) complex-catalyzed enantioselective alkynylation of aldehydes.,[reaction: see text]. A series of new chiral C3-symmetric tris(beta-hydroxy amide) ligands have been synthesized via the reaction of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic chloride and optically pure amino alcohols (up to 96% yield). The asymmetric catalytic alkynylation of aldehydes with these new C3-symmetric chiral tris(beta-hydroxy amide) ligands and Ti (O(i)'Pr)4 was investigated. Ligand 4c synthesized from (1R,2S)-(-)-2-amino-1,2-diphenylethanol is effective for the enantioselective alkynylation of various aldehydes, and high enantioselectivity was obtained with aromatic aldehydes and alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde (up to 92% ee).
15878684,2,2005,Microbes Infect,Monitoring for human cytomegalovirus infection in solid organ transplant recipients through antigenemia and glycoprotein N (gN) variants: evidence of correlation and potential prognostic value of gN genotypes.,Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) ORF UL73 encodes the envelope glycoprotein gpUL73-gN, which shows seven genotypes (gN-1, gN-2, gN-3a, gN-3b, gN-4a, gN-4b, gN-4c). The goal of this study was to determine retrospectively the distribution of gN variants in solid organ transplant recipients with HCMV infection and to establish an association with parameters important for monitoring post-transplantation clinical course during a follow-up of up to 2 years. Peripheral blood leukocytes from 40 solid organ transplant recipients were analysed for pp65-antigen by immunofluorescence and gN genotyped by sequencing or RFLP analysis. A correlation between gN genotypes and antigenemia peak was found, showing a highly significant difference between gN-1 and gN-4b variants (P&lt;0.005). In particular, gN-1 seems to be associated with patients developing low level antigenemia (&lt;50 pp65-positive cells/2 x 10(5) PBLs; PPV = 90%), whereas gN-4b predicts significantly higher values (&gt;50 pp65-positive cells/2 x 10(5) PBLs; PPV = 80%). Furthermore, the onset of positive antigenemia is significantly earlier in patients infected with a gN-4b strain, compared with those infected by a gN-1 variant. Reported data further support a role for gN genotypes in HCMV pathogenesis. gN-1 and gN-4b show a significantly different virulence and could serve as early predictors for the progression of HCMV infection in transplant patients.
15725541,2,2005,Vet Parasitol,Biochemical serum profiles in dogs experimentally infected with Angiostrongylus vasorum (Baillet, 1866).,The biochemical profiles of crossbred dogs experimentally infected with the parasite Angiostrongylus vasorum were studied. Two groups of five dogs were experimentally inoculated with 50 and 100 third stage infective larvae (L3) of A. vasorum per kilogram of body weight. A third group of five uninfected animals were used as control. Serum from these animals were used for biochemical tests to measure total and fractioned proteins, urea, creatinine and to determine the activities of aspartate (AST), alanine (ALT) aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (PAL) and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB). The alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta-globulins fractions showed alterations during acute phase of the infection. No modifications were observed in the biochemical profiles of ALT, AST, GGT, PAL, urea and creatinine. CK-MB was shown to be a good early indicator of cardiac injury in dogs experimentally infected with A. vasorum.
15662959,2,2005,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation with plant cells of new fosmidomycin analogues containing a benzoxazolone or oxazolopyridinone ring.,Fosmidomycin, 3-(N-formyl-N-hydroxyamido) propylphosphonic acid sodium salt, is an efficient inhibitor of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) reductoisomerase, the second enzyme of the 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway notably present in Plasmodium species. We have synthesized a new series of analogues of fosmidomycin, containing a benzoxazolone, benzoxazolethione or oxazolopyridinone ring. As the MEP pathway is involved in the biosynthesis of all isoprenoids, accumulation of ajmalicine in Catharanthus roseus cells was chosen as a marker of monoterpenoid indole alkaloid (MIA) production. None of the twelve studied phosphonic esters 3 and phosphonic acids 4 affected periwinkle cell growth, but some of them (3c, 3e, 3g and 3h) showed a significant inhibition of ajmalicine accumulation: 45-85% at 125 microM. Surprisingly, this effect disappeared by conversion of 3c and 3g into the corresponding acids 4c and 4g, respectively.
16366555,1,2005,J Am Chem Soc,Intramolecular metathesis of a vinyl group with vinylidene C=C double bond in Ru complexes.,The cationic complex {[Ru]=C=CHCPh2CH2CH=CH2}BF4 (3a, [Ru] = (eta5-C5H5)(PPh3)2Ru) in solution transforms to {[Ru]=C=CHCH2CPh2CH=CH2}BF4 (4a) via a new metathesis process of the terminal vinyl group with the C=C of the vinylidene group which is confirmed by 13C labeling studies. This transformation is irreversible as revealed by deuteration and decomplexation studies. The cationic complex {[Ru]=C=CHCPh2CH2CMe=CH2}BF4 (3b) undergoes a cyclization process yielding 6b containing a eta2-cyclic allene ligand which is fully characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Analogous complexes 4a' and 6b' ([Ru] = (eta5-C5H5)(dppe)Ru) containing dppe ligands were similarly obtained from protonation of the corresponding acetylide complexes via formation of vinylidene intermediate. Protonation of the acetylide complex containing a terminal alkynyl group [Ru]-CCCPh2CH2CCH (2c) generates the vinylidene complex {[Ru]=C=CHCPh2CH2CCH}BF4 (3c) which again undergoes an irreversible transformation to give {[Ru]=C=CHCH2CPh2CCH}BF4 (4c) possibly via a pi-coordinated alkynyl complex followed by hydrogen and metal migration. No similar transformation is observed for the analogous dppe complex 3c'. With an extra methylene group, complex {[Ru]=C=CHCPh2CH2CH2CH=CH2}BF4 (3d) and complex {[Ru]=C=CHCPh2CH2Ph}BF4 (3e) are stable. The presence of a gem-diphenylmethylene moiety at the vinylidene ligand with the appropriate terminal vinyl or alkynyl group along with the correct steric environment implements such a novel reactivity in the ruthenium vinylidene complexes.
16330573,1,2005,J Nucl Med,Intraorgan biodistribution and dosimetry of 153Sm-ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonate in juvenile rabbit tibia: implications for targeted radiotherapy of osteosarcoma.,Targeted radiotherapy using 153Sm-ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonate (153Sm-EDTMP) is currently under investigation for treatment of primary osteosarcoma. Human osteosarcoma most frequently occurs in skeletally immature individuals, and previous studies in a juvenile rabbit model demonstrated that clinically significant damage to developing physeal cartilage might occur as a result of systemic 153Sm-EDTMP therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of 153Sm-EDTMP within the tibias of juvenile rabbits and estimate the radiation-absorbed doses delivered to the physeal cartilage.</AbstractText>: Targeted radiotherapy using 153Sm-ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonate (153Sm-EDTMP) is currently under investigation for treatment of primary osteosarcoma. Human osteosarcoma most frequently occurs in skeletally immature individuals, and previous studies in a juvenile rabbit model demonstrated that clinically significant damage to developing physeal cartilage might occur as a result of systemic 153Sm-EDTMP therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of 153Sm-EDTMP within the tibias of juvenile rabbits and estimate the radiation-absorbed doses delivered to the physeal cartilage.METHODS: Eight-week-old New Zealand White rabbits were injected intravenously with 7.57 kBq (280 microCi) of 153Sm-EDTMP. At 21 h after injection, the biodistribution of 153Sm in the epiphysis, metaphysis, diaphysis, and red marrow of the tibia was obtained. Two-dimensional digital autoradiography was performed on 2-mm sections of tibias for qualitative comparison with the biodistribution data. Self-tissue and cross-tissue absorbed doses were calculated using absorbed fractions generated by the Monte Carlo particle transport code MCNP-4C.RESULTS: The highest uptakes (percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g] of tissue) of 153Sm, 1.99-2.56 %ID/g, were found in the proximal and distal metaphyses, 70%-73% of which localized within 3 mm of the physeal cartilage. The second highest tissues of uptake were the proximal and distal epiphyses, at 0.33-0.62%ID/g. Digital autoradiography imaging confirmed that the majority of 153Sm deposited in the tibia localized to these tissues. Radiation-absorbed doses to the proximal and distal metaphyses were 183 and 130 mGy/MBq, respectively, and those to the proximal and distal epiphyses were 141 and 43.4 mGy/MBq, respectively. These tissues represented the only source compartments contributing to the physeal cartilage doses of 50.0 mGy/MBq for the proximal physis and 39.2 mGy/MBq for the distal physis.CONCLUSION: The 153Sm absorbed doses to the physeal cartilage were consistent with values that can cause dose-limiting damage to rapidly proliferating and differentiating chondrocytes. The pronounced uptake in the juvenile epiphysis indicates that the proliferating zone of the physis can be irradiated from multiple areas, which could increase the expression and degree of radiation damage. Further investigation of the effects of 153Sm-EDTMP on immature physeal cartilage is warranted to develop optimized treatment regimens.
16277318,1,2005,J Org Chem,Synthesis, reaction, and recycle of fluorous palladium catalysts for an asymmetric allylic alkylation without using fluorous solvents.,[Chemical reaction: See text] Chiral fluorous aminophosphine 4c bearing two fluorous ponytails was prepared from (S)-prolinol and applied to palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of 1,3-diphenyl-2-propenyl acetate (7) with a dialkyl malonate-BSA-LiOAc system with high enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee). Results indicated that the chiral fluorous palladium catalyst from ligand 4c was easily separated from the reaction mixture by simple solid/liquid separation and could be reused up to five times.
16276161,1,2005,Skinmed,Improvement in psoriasis with rosiglitazone in a diabetic and a nondiabetic patient.,The authors conducted a prospective, open-label, pilot trial of the effects of the antidiabetic thiazolidinedione (TZD) rosiglitazone in two patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Case 1: A lean, euglycemic 43-year-old nondiabetic man with a 2-year history of plaque psoriasis presented with lesions involving 10% of his body surface (Figures 1A, 1B, 1C). He had no other chronic or acute medical problems. He had previously been managed sporadically with topical triamcinolone acetonide, an intermediate-strength glucocorticoid, and was off antipsoriatic medication for 5 months. He was started on rosiglitazone p.o., 8 mg q.d. After 10 weeks on rosiglitazone, the lesions developed increased erythema, spreading, and shedding of scale (Figures 2A, 2B, 2C). After an additional 26 weeks, the lesions had largely disappeared (Figures 3A, 3B, 3C). The patient remained euglycemic throughout the study. His liver function enzymes (alanine transferase [ALT] and aspartate transferase [AST]) remained normal throughout the study: ALT, 23 IU/L; AST, 47 IU/L before treatment; ALT, 25 IU/L; AST, 33 IU/L after treatment. There were no adverse events. Case 2: An overweight 68-year-old woman (body mass index, 29 kg/m2; with a 12-year history of type 2 diabetes and 5-year history of psoriasis presented with generalized plaque psoriasis over 20% of her body, including two large, thick, silvery plaques with the texture of leather over the lower part of the back (Figure 4A). She was given rosiglitazone p.o., 4 mg b.i.d. for 24 weeks, which resulted in significant improvement in psoriasis (Figure 4B). After an additional 26 weeks on rosiglitazone, the plaques had cleared on her back (Figure 4C) and over her entire body, including scalp, ears, and posterior forearms (not shown). Her glycemic control improved (hemoglobin A1c decreased from 7.7% to 7.2%) and liver function remained normal throughout the study (ALT, 24 IU/L; AST, 14 IU/L before treatment; and ALT, 26 IU/L; AST, 15 IU/L after treatment). There were no adverse events.
16039678,1,2005,Steroids,Electrochemical bromination of cholest-5-enes.,Four 5,6-unsaturated steroids--3beta-chlorocholest-5-ene (1a), cholesterol (1b) and its acetate (1c) and benzoate (1d)-were subjected to constant current electrolysis (50 mA, 2 F mol(-1)) in an electrolytic cell divided by a ceramic membrane, using a platinum foil as the anode and a graphite stick as the cathode. When electrolysis was carried out in a solution of tetraethylammonium bromide in aprotic solvents (dichloromethane, acetonitrile or acetic anhydride), the addition of electrochemically-generated elemental bromine onto the double bond of the cholesterol derivatives gave their corresponding 5alpha,6beta-dibromosteroids--3beta-chloro-5alpha,6beta-dibromocholestane (2a), 5alpha,6beta-dibromocholestan-3beta-ol (2b), 5alpha,6beta-dibromocholestan-3beta-yl acetate (2c) and 5alpha,6beta-dibromocholestan-3beta-yl benzoate (2d)--as the sole products, and in good yields (58-91%). However, the electrolysis of steroids 1a-c in a solution of tetraethylammonium bromide with methanol as the solvent proceeded to give, in addition to dibromides 2a-c, the corresponding diastereomeric pairs of 5-bromo-6-methoxysteroids: 5alpha-bromo-3beta-chloro-6beta-methoxycholestane (3a) and 5beta-bromo-3beta-chloro-6alpha-methoxycholestane (4a), 5alpha-bromo-6beta-methoxycholestan-3beta-ol (3b) and 5beta-bromo-6alpha-methoxycholestan-3beta-ol (4b) and 5alpha-bromo-6beta-methoxycholestan-3beta-yl acetate (3c) and 5alpha-bromo-6beta-methoxycholestan-3beta-yl acetate (4c). The benzoate 1d was not soluble enough in methanol, even with heating. The products were characterized by physical and spectral data (IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR). Single crystal X-ray structure determinations of compounds 2a and 3a are also reported.
15960954,1,2005,Gac Sanit,[Outbreak of 18 cases of hepatitis C in a hemodialysis unit].,OBJECTIVES: On September 30, 2001 we had notice of a probable outbreak of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in a hemodialysis unit in Ciudad Real (Spain). We conducted an investigation of the outbreak to determine its cause and implement control measures.METHODS: We performed a descriptive study and another analytic study (retrospective cohort study). In the descriptive study, the incidence of HCV infection in the unit between 01/01/98 and 09/30/01 was studied. In the cohort study, 86 subjects were included, of which 18 were infected with HCV during the outbreak. Virologic study was performed, including serology of anti-HCV antibodies, specific IgG avidity study, polymerase chain reaction and phylogenetic analysis of the viral subtypes found.RESULTS: In the study period, there were 86 patients under treatment in the hemodialysis unit, of which 27 (31.4%) were HCV-positive before 03/01/01. The epidemic curve suggested a common source with secondary cases. Since 1998 only one seroconversion had been documented (in 1999). Statistically significant differences were found only for the variable of dialysis shift. None of the patients who underwent dialysis on the Tuesday-Saturday-Thursday shift exclusively was infected. All cases were genosubtype 4d, which is uncommon in Spain (accounting for 3%), suggesting a common initial source for all cases. Most of the previous cases of HCV in the hemodialysis unit were 1b; three were 4c/4d and one was 1a. The IgG avidity study suggested that not all the cases were infected at the same time, supporting the hypothesis of a common source with secondary spread.CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak of HCV was confirmed, with 18 cases among dialyzed patients in the central unit. The outbreak was caused by the same viral strain, probably due to a common source with secondary person-to-person transmission among the patients.
15798339,1,2005,Phys Med Biol,Dosimetric study of a new polymer encapsulated palladium-103 seed.,The use of low-energy photon emitters for brachytherapy applications, as in the treatment of prostate or ocular tumours, has increased significantly over the last few years. Several new seed models utilizing 103Pd and 125I have recently been introduced. Following the TG43U1 recommendations of the AAPM (American Association of Physicists in Medicine) (Rivard et al 2004 Med. Phys. 31 633), dose distributions around these low-energy photon emitters are characterized by the dose rate constant, the radial dose function and the anisotropy function in water. These functions and constants can be measured for each new seed in a solid phantom (i.e. solid water such as WT1) using high spatial resolution detectors such as very small thermoluminescent detectors. These experimental results in solid water must then be converted into liquid water by using Monte Carlo simulations. This paper presents the dosimetric parameters of a new palladium seed, OptiSeed (produced by International Brachytherapy (IBt), Seneffe, Belgium), made with a biocompatible polymeric shell and with a design that differs from the hollow titanium encapsulated seed, InterSource103, produced by the same company. A polymer encapsulation was chosen by the company IBt in order to reduce the quantity of radioactive material needed for a given dose rate, and to improve the symmetry of the radiation field around the seed. The necessary experimental data were obtained by measurements with LiF thermoluminescent dosimeters (1 mm3) in a solid water phantom (WT1) and then converted to values in liquid water using Monte Carlo calculations (MCNP-4C). Comparison of the results with a previous study by Reniers et al (2002 Appl. Radiat. Isot. 57 805) shows very good agreement for the dose rate constant and for the radial dose function. In addition, the results also indicate an improvement in isotropy compared to a conventional titanium encapsulated seed. The relative dose (anisotropy value relative to 90 degrees ) from the seed at a distance of 3 cm is close to 70% at 0 degrees whereas that for the titanium encapsulated InterSource103seed is close to 40%. This paper also presents some new Monte Carlo calculations relating to shadowing produced by the seeds in an array implanted for a prostate cancer treatment. Recently, Mobit and Badragan (2004 Phys. Med. Biol. 49 3171) reported shadowing resulting in a 10% decrease in dose from titanium encapsulated 125I seed. We used Monte Carlo simulations (MCNP-4C) to evaluate shadowing for the InterSource103 titanium encapsulated seed and the OptiSeed polymer encapsulated seed. For a specific geometry specified, dose decreases of 13% and 7% were found for the InterSource103 titanium encapsulated and the OptiSeed polymer encapsulated seed, respectively.
15789883,1,2005,Clin Exp Rheumatol,Chondrocyte-mediated collagenolysis correlates with cartilage destruction grades in osteoarthritis.,OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with destruction of type II collagen-rich hyaline articular cartilage. We hypothesized that classical interstitial collagenases cleave collagen type II, leading to the increased expression of the 3/4 native type II collagen fragment (COL2-3/4C) and the corresponding denatured type II collagen fragment (COL2-3/4M), which could correlate with different cartilage destruction grades. In addition, we assessed whether these fragments could be measured in joint fluid and serve as diagnostic markers.METHODS: Cartilage specimens were obtained from the femoral heads of hip joints from total hip replacement operations. Articular gliding surfaces of the cartilage were categorized into normal (G0), fibrillated (G1), superficiallyfissured (G2) and deeplyfissured (fissures that reach to the subchondral bone) (G3). A histological scoring of the cartilage was also used. COL2-3/4C and COL2-3/4M were detected by immunohistochemical staining. Dot blotting was used to detect these fragments in joint fluid.RESULTS: COL2-3/4C and COL2-3/4M were found in the perichondrocyte matrix around lacunae. Such COL2-3/4C (p &lt; 0.05) and COL2-3/4M (p &lt; 0.05) immunoreactivity was significantly increased in G3 and G2 compared to GO and G1. A positive correlation (n = 35, Spearman rank correlation) was observed between the histological score and the percentage of COL2-3/4C positive lacunae (r = 0.43, p = 0.01) and COL2- 3/4M positive lacunae (r = 0.53, p = 0.001). All 7/7 joint fluid samples contained COL2-3/4C in dot blots whereas only 4/7 contained COL2-3/4M.CONCLUSION: Collagenase-cleaved collagen--both native and denatured--increases as the severity of OA increases, assessed using a macroscopic clinical and microscopic histological grading system. Collagen degradation was always most apparent around chondrocytes. Furthermore, the native COL2-3/4C fragment has potential as a joint fluid marker for OA.
15752472,1,2005,Farmaco,Homopterocarpanes as bridged triarylethylene analogues: synthesis and antagonistic effects in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells.,A series of new compounds structurally derived from 6a,12a-dihydro-6H,7H-[1]-benzopyran-[4,3-b]-benzopyran (homopterocarpane) was efficiently synthesized by reduction of the corresponding pyrilium salts obtained by treatment of selected flavanones and aldehydes with anhydrous HClO4. Cytotoxic effects on the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and antiestrogenic activity (only for compounds which resulted more active than tamoxifen (TAM)) on MCF-7 cells stimulated by 17beta-estradiol were evaluated. In vivo antiestrogenic activity and the relative binding affinity were also assessed. Some of the new compounds (4c, 4h, 4i and 4l) showed a biological activity in the micromolar range, and were more potent than TAM taken as the reference.
15750661,1,2005,J Nutr Health Aging,Percent body fat estimation from skin fold thickness in the elderly. Development of a population-based prediction equation and comparison with published equations in 75-year-olds.,OBJECTIVE: To develop a prediction equation for percent body fat (BF%) from skin fold thickness in a random sample of free-living 75-year-olds and to compare with published equations for the elderly.SETTING: Goteborg part of the Nordic Research on Aging (NORA) study in 1991/92.SUBJECTS &amp; METHODS: Anthropometric measurements were performed in 286 participants (125 males,161 females) and body composition was estimated by four compartment model (4C) from total body water (TBW) and total body potassium (TBK) in every alternative subjects. BF % predicted from skin fold thickness (BFSF) was validated against BF % estimated from 4C model (BF4C) and was compared with BFSF and BF % predicted from equations by Durnin and Womersley, 1974 (BFDW), Deurenberg et al.,1989 (BFPD) and, Visseretal.,1994(BFMV), respectively.RESULTS: The BFSF correlated well with BF4C (r = 0.86, SEE = 4.05). Compared to BF4C, both BFPD and BFMV over estimated BF % by 3.26 and 3.63 in males and 9.56 and 9.23 in females, respectively. BFDW underestimated BF % in females by 1.06 and overestimated by 3.12 in males. BFSF showed best agreement with BF4C, where the 95 % of differences lie between +/- 7.4 in males and +/- 8.7 in females, respectively.CONCLUSION: BF % predicted from skin fold thickness correlated well with estimated BF % in 75-year-olds. Different prediction equations gave different values for BF % and population-specific prediction equations seem preferable in the elderly population.
15715558,1,2005,Acta Ophthalmol Scand,Vasoactive mediators and retinopathy during type 1 diabetic pregnancy.,PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of various vasoactive hormones in the evolution of diabetic retinopathy during pregnancy and postpartum.METHODS: Retinopathy was graded from fundus photographs of 45 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes and seven pregnant women without diabetes in a prospective study. Markers of renin-angiotensin-system (RAS), plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (AngII), aldosterone, natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, CNP) and adreonomedullin (AM) were measured during the first and third trimesters and at 3 months postpartum. The women with diabetes were grouped by progression of retinopathy during pregnancy and postpartum.RESULTS: Levels of PRA (p = 0.001) and ANP (p = 0.03) were significantly lower in diabetes than in non-diabetes subjects throughout pregnancy and postpartum. No significant differences appeared in levels of AngII, aldosterone, AM, BNP or CNP between the two groups. In multivariate logistic regression analyses with retinopathy progression by the third trimester as the dependent variable, only duration of diabetes qualified in the model (p = 0.027, R = 0.227, Exp(B) = 1.28).CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic pregnancy is associated with lower levels of PRA and ANP compared to non-diabetic pregnancy. Lowered RAS activity may contribute to the hyperdynamic blood flow and progression of DR during diabetic pregnancy. Within the power of this study no clear associations between the vasoactive hormones and progression of retinopathy could be detected.
15672202,1,2005,Dalton Trans,The synthesis, structure and ethene polymerisation catalysis of mono(salicylaldiminato) titanium and zirconium complexes.,The silyl ethers 3-But-2-(OSiMe3)C6H3CH=NR (2a-e) have been prepared by deprotonation of the known iminophenols (1a-e) and treatment with SiClMe3 (a, R = C6H5; b, R = 2,6-Pri2C6H3; c, R = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2; d, R = 2-C6H5C6H4; e, R = C6F5). 2a-c react with TiCl4 in hydrocarbon solvents to give the binuclear complexes [Ti{3-But-2-(O)C6H3CH=N(R)}Cl(mu-Cl3)TiCl3] (3a-c). The pentafluorophenyl species 2e reacts with TiCl4 to give the known complex Ti{3-But-2-(O)C6H3CH=N(R)}2Cl2. The mononuclear five-coordinate complex, Ti{3-But-2-(O)C6H3CH=N(2,4,6-Me3C6H2)}Cl3 (4c), was isolated after repeated recrystallisation of 3c. Performing the dehalosilylation reaction in the presence of tetrahydrofuran yields the octahedral, mononuclear complexes Ti{3-But-2-(O)C6H3CH=N(R)}Cl3(THF) (5a-e). The reaction with ZrCl4(THF)2 proceeds similarly to give complexes Zr{3-But-2-(O)C6H3CH=N(R)}Cl3(THF) (6b-e). The crystal structures of 3b, 4c, 5a, 5c, 5e, 6b, 6d, 6e and the salicylaldehyde titanium complex Ti{3-But-2-(O)C6H3CH=O}Cl3(THF) (7) have been determined. Activation of complexes 5a-e and 6b-e with MAO in an ethene saturated toluene solution gives polyethylene with at best high activity depending on the imine substituent.
15643844,1,2005,J Am Chem Soc,Controlling both ground- and excited-state thermal barriers to Bergman cyclization with alkyne termini substitution.,The cross-coupling reaction of 2,3-dibromo-5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin with corresponding organostannanes in the presence of a Pd0 catalyst in THF at reflux temperature yields free base 2,3-dialkynylporphyrins 1a,c-e. The subsequent deprotection of trimethylsilyl group of 1a with TBAF in THF under aqueous conditions produces the 2,3-diethynyl-5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrins 1b in 87% yield. Compounds 1a-d undergo zinc insertion upon treatment with Zn(OAc)2.2H2O in CHCl3/MeOH to give zinc(II) 2,3-dialkynyl-5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrins (2a-d) in 70-92% yields. Thermal Bergman cyclization of 1a-e and 2a-d was studied in chlorobenzene and approximately 35-fold 1,4-cyclohexadiene at 120-210 degrees C. Compounds 1b and 2b with R = H react at lower temperature (120 degrees C) and produce cyclized products 3b and 4b in higher yields (65-70%) than their propyl, isopropyl, and phenyl analogues, with R = Ph being the most stable. Continuing in this trend, the -TMS derivatives 1a and 2a exhibit no reactivity even after heating at 190 degrees C in chlorobenzene/CHD for 24 h. Photolysis (at lambda &gt;/= 395 nm) of 1b and 2b at 10 degrees C leads the formation of isolable picenoporphyrin products in 15 and 35% yields, respectively, in 72 h, whereas these compounds are stable in solution under same reaction conditions at 25 degrees C in the dark. Unlike thermolysis at 125 degrees C, which did not yield Bergman cyclized product for R = Ph, photolysis generated very small amounts of picenoporphyrin products (3c: 5%; 4c: 8% based on 1H NMR) as well as a mixture of reduced porphyrin products that were not separable. Thus, trends in the barrier to Bergman cyclization in the excited state exhibit the same trend as those observed in the ground state as a function of R-group. Finally, photolysis of 2b at 10 degrees C with lambda &gt;/= 515 or 590 nm in benzene/iPrOH (4:1, 72 h) produces 4b in 15 and 6% isolated yields, indicating that conjugation of the enediyne unit into the porphyrin electronic transitions leads to sufficient distortion to generate photoproduct even with long wavelength excitation.
16381740,0,2005,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Analysis of neutron and photon response of a TLD-ALBEDO personal dosemeter on an ISO slab phantom using TRIPOLI-4.3 Monte Carlo code.,TRIPOLI-4.3 Monte Carlo transport code has been used to evaluate the QUADOS (Quality Assurance of Computational Tools for Dosimetry) problem P4, neutron and photon response of an albedo-type thermoluminescence personal dosemeter (TLD) located on an ISO slab phantom. Two enriched 6LiF and two 7LiF TLD chips were used and they were protected, in front or behind, with a boron-loaded dosemeter-holder. Neutron response of the four chips was determined by counting 6Li(n,t)4He events using ENDF/B-VI.4 library and photon response by estimating absorbed dose (MeV g(-1)). Ten neutron energies from thermal to 20 MeV and six photon energies from 33 keV to 1.25 MeV were used to study the energy dependence. The fraction of the neutron and photon response owing to phantom backscatter has also been investigated. Detailed TRIPOLI-4.3 solutions are presented and compared with MCNP-4C calculations.
16381737,0,2005,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,A new human eye model for ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry.,The present work proposes a new mathematical eye model for ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry. This new model includes detailed description of internal structures that were not treated in previous works, allowing dose determination in different regions of the eye for a more adequate clinical analysis. Dose calculations were determined with the MCNP-4C Monte Carlo particle transport code running n parallel environment using PVM. The Amersham CKA4 ophthalmic applicator has been chosen and the depth dose distribution has been determined and compared to those provide by the manufacturer. The results have shown excellent agreement. Besides, absorbed dose values due to both 125I seeds and 60Co plaques were obtained for each one of the different structures which compose the eye model and can give relevant information in eventual clinical analyses.
16381688,0,2005,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Gamma dose from activation of internal shields in IRIS reactor.,The International Reactor Innovative and Secure is a modular pressurised water reactor with an integral design. This means that all the primary system components, such as the steam generators, pumps, pressuriser and control rod drive mechanisms, are located inside the reactor vessel, which requires a large diameter. For the sake of better reliability and safety, it is desirable to achieve the reduction of vessel embrittlement as well as the lowering of the dose beyond the vessel. The former can be easily accomplished by the presence of a wide downcomer, filled with water, which surrounds the core region, while the latter needs the presence of additional internal shields. An optimal shielding configuration is under investigation, for reducing the ex-vessel dose due to activated internals and for limiting the amount of the biological shielding. MCNP 4C calculations were performed to evaluate the neutron and the gamma dose during operation and the 60Co activation of various shields configurations. The gamma dose beyond the vessel from activation of its structural components was estimated in a shutdown condition, with the Monte Carlo code FLUKA 2002 and the MicroShield software. The results of the two codes are in agreement and show that the dose is sufficiently low, even without an additional shield.
16377197,0,2005,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and antifungal activity of substituted-10-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrazino[1,2-a]indoles.,Series of substituted-10-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrazino[1,2-a]indoles derivatives have been synthesized and examined for their activity against pathogenic strains of Aspergillus fumigatus (ITCC 4517), Aspergillus flavus (ITCC 5192) Aspergillus niger (ITCC 5405) and Candida albicans (ITCC No 4718). All synthesized compounds showed mild to moderate activity, except for 2-substituted-10-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrazino[1,2-a]indoles 6a-d. The most active 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-10-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrazino[1,2-a]indole 4c exhibited a MIC value of 5.85 microg/disc against A. fumigatus and 11.71 microg/disc against A. flavus and A. niger in disc diffusion assay. Anti-Aspergillus activity of active compound 4c by microbroth dilution assay was found to be 15.62 microg/ml in case of A. fumigatus and 31.25 microg/ml with A. flavus and A. niger. The MIC90 value of the most active compound by percent germination inhibition assay was found to be 15.62 microg/ml against A. fumigatus. The MIC90 values of substituted-10-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrazino[1,2-a]indoles against C. albicans ranged from 15.62 to 250 microg/ml. The in vitro toxicity of the most active 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-10-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrazino[1,2-a]indole 4c was evaluated using haemolytic assay, in which the compound was found to be non-toxic to human erythrocytes up to a concentration of 312.50 microg/ml. The standard drug amphotericin B exhibited 100% lysis at a concentration of 37.5 microg/ml.

16355847,0,2005,J Food Prot,Subtyping Listeria monocytogenes from bulk tank milk using automated repetitive element-based PCR.,Sixty-one Listeria monocytogenes strains from raw milk were analyzed with an automated repetitive element-based PCR (rep-PCR) system to examine the utility of this system for serotype grouping and to determine whether specific regional relationships could be identified. Results of the similarity analysis revealed two primary clusters of L. monocytogenes isolates. Cluster 2 exclusively contained serogroup 1/2a isolates; however, two 1/2a isolates were also found in cluster 1. Isolates of serogroups 1/2b, 4b, 3b, and 4c were also in cluster 1. Clusters 1 and 2 were separated at a relative similarity of 86%. Listeria species other than L. monocytogenes (L. ivanovii, L. seeligeri, L. welshimeri, L. grayi, and L. innocua) had similarity scores of less than 80% in pairwise comparisons with the L. monocytogenes isolates. Thus, this method may be useful for species identification once an isolate is characterized as Listeria. When rep-PCR fingerprints of the L. monocytogenes 1/2a isolates were compared, there was no apparent regional grouping. However, discrimination between isolates suggests that the rep-PCR assay might be useful for tracking L. monocytogenes 1/2a and for tracking isolates across regions or within smaller ecological niches. The automated rep-PCR method could not discriminate between serotypes 1/2b and 4b but may be useful for discriminating between 1/2a and other serotypes and for tracking isolates within serotype 1/2a.

16321204,0,2005,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,[Analysis of CCM1 gene mutations in Chinese patients with intracranial cavernous malformations].,OBJECTIVE: To study the CCM1 gene (7q11.2 - q22) mutations in Chinese patients with intracranial cavernous malformations (ICM), METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 25 unrelated patients with ICM confirmed by post-operational pathology, 7 being with familial ICM, all of Han nationality, and from 30 healthy people as controls. The genomic DNA was extracted and the exons 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18 of CCM1 gene and part of intervening sequences near both sides of these exons were amplified by PCR. The PCR products were sequenced directly and then compared with the GenBank data.RESULTS: Seven new mutation sites of CCM1 gene were detected from 11 Chinese ICM patients with a total mutation rate of 44%. Of the seven new mutations there were three missense mutations: 1160A--&gt;C (Q387P) and 1172C--&gt;T (S391F) in exon12, and 1405A--&gt;C (N469H) in exon13; two insertion mutations: 704insT (K246stop) in exon8, and 2138insG (T733stop) in exon18; one intervening sequence mutation: IVS12 - 4C--&gt;T; and one synonymous mutation: 1875C--&gt;T (F625F) in exon17. None mutation was detected in the control group. The CCM1 mutation rate of familial ICM was 85.7%, significantly higher than that of sporadic ICM (27.7%, P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: As the genetic basis of ICM, CCM1 gene mutation exists in Chinese ICM patients too, that leads to functional loss or changes of the gene encoding KRIT1 protein.
16296850,0,2005,Inorg Chem,Tautomerization of methyldiazene to formaldehyde-hydrazone in ruthenium and osmium complexes.,Mixed-ligand hydrazine complexes [M(CO)(RNHNH2)P4](BPh4)2 (1, 2) [M = Ru, Os; R = H, CH3, C6H5; P = P(OEt)3] with carbonyl and triethyl phosphite were prepared by allowing hydride [MH(CO)P4]BPh4 species to react first with HBF4.Et2O and then with hydrazines. Depending on the nature of the hydrazine ligand, the oxidation of [M(CO)(RNHNH2)P4](BPh4)2 derivatives with Pb(OAc)4 at -30 C gives acetate [M(kappa1-OCOCH3)(CO)P4]BPh4 (3a), phenyldiazene [M(CO)(C6H5N=NH)P4](BPh4)2 (3c, 4c), and methyldiazene [M(CO)(CH3N=NH)P4](BPh4)2 (3b, 4b) derivatives. Methyldiazene complexes 3b and 4b undergo base-catalyzed tautomerization of the CH3N=NH ligand to formaldehyde-hydrazone NH2N=CH2, giving the [M(CO)(NH2N=CH2)P4](BPh4)2 (5, 6) derivatives. Complexes 5 and 6 were characterized spectroscopically and by the X-ray crystal structure determination of the [Ru(CO)(NH2N=CH2)[P(OEt)3]4](BPh4)2 (5) derivative. Acetone-hydrazone [M(CO)[NH2N=C(CH3)2]P4](BPh4)2 (7, 8) complexes were also prepared by allowing hydrazine [M(CO)(NH2NH2)P4](BPh4)2 derivatives to react with acetone.
16223751,0,2005,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Artificial neural networks in neutron dosimetry.,An artificial neural network (ANN) has been designed to obtain neutron doses using only the count rates of a Bonner spheres spectrometer (BSS). Ambient, personal and effective neutron doses were included. One hundred and eighty-one neutron spectra were utilised to calculate the Bonner count rates and the neutron doses. The spectra were transformed from lethargy to energy distribution and were re-binned to 31 energy groups using the MCNP 4C code. Re-binned spectra, UTA4 response matrix and fluence-to-dose coefficients were used to calculate the count rates in the BSS and the doses. Count rates were used as input and the respective doses were used as output during neural network training. Training and testing were carried out in the MATLAB environment. The impact of uncertainties in BSS count rates upon the dose quantities calculated with the ANN was investigated by modifying by +/-5% the BSS count rates used in the training set. The use of ANNs in neutron dosimetry is an alternative procedure that overcomes the drawbacks associated with this ill-conditioned problem.

Compounds 3b, 3c', 3c' ', 4c', 4c' ', 5b, 5c, 6, and 10 were found to be inhibitors of the integrated electron transfer chain (NADH oxidase activity) in beef heart submitochondrial particles (SMP), establishing that all of them except compound 3b and 6 only affected to complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The most potent product was 5b, with an IC50 of 0.27 microM, similar to the IC50 values of other known complex I inhibitors. The diastereomeric pairs 1c'/1c' ', 3c'/3c' ', 4c'/4c' ', and 5c have not been previously described. Chemical characterization, on the basis of spectral data, is also shown.
16204865,0,2005,Phys Med Biol,NA,Suggestions about determining the concentration of 10B in blood via the thermal neutron flux depression measurement (NFDM) are made. The use of a measuring set-up consisting of a 252Cf neutron source, polyethylene moderator and a slim BF3 counter surrounded by an annular sample is examined. It is shown experimentally that using 6 ml samples and the source emitting 1.4 x 10(7) neutrons s(-1), one can determine the concentration of 10B in water at the level of 10 ppm with a statistical precision of 10% in about 20 min. Monte Carlo simulations performed with the use of MCNP-4C code revealed a potential for further improvements of the NFDM technique both in respect of the sample volume and counting period.
16182583,0,2005,Transfus Clin Biol,Evaluation of NucliSens-AmpliScreen methodology to detect subtypes G of HIV-1 and 4c/4d of HCV in the screening of blood donors.,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Albeit, the NucliSens Extractor combined with the Ampliscreen was validated for application in NAT minipool screening, a study to evaluate the reliability of the procedure in relation to subtypes G of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 RNA and 4c/4d of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA should be performed, due to their genetic differences and the high frequency in our country.STUDY DESIGN: Samples from patients infected with subtypes G of HIV-1 RNA and 4c/4d of HCV RNA were diluted with negative plasma and tested eight times for each concentration. For nucleic acid extraction we used an automated silica-based extraction method (NucliSens Extractor) and for amplification and detection the AmpliScreen HIV-1 version 1.5 and AmpliScreen HCV version 2.0 (Roche Diagnostic Systems) were applied.RESULTS: The sensitivity for HIV-1 RNA genotype G using the NucliSens-AmpliScreen method-95% detection limit (95% CI) of 25 (18-50) copies per ml-is comparable with those described for genotypes B and E and to that obtained by the Multiprep procedure. In the case of HCV, the sensitivity of the method was also similar, when we compared the detection limits obtained for genotype 4c/4d-95% detection limit (95% CI) of 34 (24-71) IU/ml-with the genotype 1 published.CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here suggest that these infections will not be missed because of genetic variation, as the platform exhibited similar limits of detection for the subtypes evaluated, meeting the sensitivity requirements set by the regulatory bodies.
16180885,0,2005,Inorg Chem,NA,Platinum(II) complexes with (fluoren-9-ylidene)methanedithiolato and its 2,7-di-tert-butyl- and 2,7-dimethoxy-substituted analogues were obtained by reacting different chloroplatinum(II) precursors with the piperidinium dithioates (pipH)[(2,7-R2C12H6)CHCS2] [R = H (1a), t-Bu (1b), or OMe (1c)] in the presence of piperidine. The anionic complexes Q2[Pt{S(2)C=C(C12H6R(2)-2,7)}2] [R = H, (Pr(4)N)(2)2a; R = t-Bu, (Pr4N)(2)2b, (Et4N)(2)2b; R = OMe, (Pr4N)(2)2c] were prepared from PtCl(2), piperidine, the corresponding QCl salt, and 1a-c in molar ratio 1:2:2:2. In the absence of QCl, the complexes (pipH)(2)2b and [Pt(pip)(4)]2b were isolated depending on the PtCl(2):pip molar ratio. The neutral complexes [Pt{S2C=C(C12H6R(2)-2,7)L(2)] [L = PPh(3), R = H (3a), t-Bu (3b), OMe (3c); L = PEt(3), R = H (4a), t-Bu (4b), OMe (4c); L(2) = dbbpy, R = H (5a), t-Bu (5b), OMe (5c) (dbbpy = 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridyl)] were similarly prepared from the corresponding precursors [PtCl2L2] and 1a-c in the presence of piperidine. Oxidation of Q(2)2b with [FeCp2]PF6 afforded the mixed Pt(II)-Pt(IV) complex Q2[Pt2{S2C=C[C12H6(t-Bu)(2)-2,7]}4] (Q(2)6, Q = Et4N+, Pr4N+). The protonation of (Pr4N)(2)2b with 2 equiv of triflic acid gave the neutral dithioato complex [Pt2{S2CCH[C12H6(t-Bu)(2)-2,7]}4] (7). The same reaction in 1:1 molar ratio gave the mixed dithiolato/dithioato complex Pr4N[Pt{S2C=C[C12H6(t-Bu)(2)-2,7]}{S2CCH[C12H6(t-Bu)(2)-2,7]}] (Pr(4)N8) while the corresponding DMANH+ salt was obtained by treating 7 with 2 equiv of 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene (DMAN). The crystal structures of 3b and 5c.CH2Cl2 have been solved by X-ray crystallography. All the platinum complexes are photoluminescent at 77 K in CH2Cl2 or KBr matrix, except for Q(2)6. Compounds 5a-c and Q8 show room-temperature luminescence in fluid solution. The electronic absorption and emission spectra of the dithiolato complexes reveal charge-transfer absorption and emission energies which are significantly lower than those of analogous platinum complexes with previously described 1,1-ethylenedithiolato ligands and in most cases compare well to those of 1,2-dithiolene complexes.
16163504,0,2005,Plant Cell Rep,Visual selection and maintenance of the cell lines with high plant regeneration ability and low ploidy level in Dianthus acicularis by monitoring with flow cytometry analysis.,Efficient plant regeneration system from cell suspension cultures was established in D. acicularis (2n=90) by monitoring ploidy level and visual selection of the cultures. The ploidy level of the cell cultures closely related to the shoot regeneration ability. The cell lines comprising original ploidy levels (2C+4C cells corresponding to DNA contents of G1 and G2 cells of diploid plant, respectively) showed high regeneration ability, whereas those containing the cells with 8C or higher DNA C-values showed low or no regeneration ability. The highly regenerable cell lines thus selected consisted of compact cell clumps with yellowish color and relatively moderate growth, suggesting that it is possible to select visually the highly regenerable cell lines with the original ploidy level. All the regenerated plantlets from the highly regenerable cell cultures exhibited normal phenotypes and no variations in ploidy level were observed by flow cytometry (FCM) analysis.
16129421,0,2005,Carbohydr Res,X-ray structure of the dipotassium salt of D-mannose 1-phosphate 3.25 hydrate.,The first crystal structure of mannose 1-phosphate is described. The dipotassium hydrate salt crystallizes in the P2(1)2(1)2 space group. There are two independent dianions (I and II) in the asymmetric unit, which are alpha anomers adopting the 4C(1) chair conformation. The main difference between the two mannose 1-phosphate dianions is the orientation of the phosphate group with relation to the pyranosyl ring. In I, one of the phosphate oxygen atoms is antiperiplanar positions with respect to carbon atom C-1, whereas the two others are situated synclinally. The corresponding orientations of the terminal phosphate oxygen atoms in II are synperiplanar and anticlinal. The potassium cations are six- and seven-coordinate, mainly with O atoms of hydroxyl groups and water molecules. There are potassium channels extending along the c-axis. In the packing arrangement, water molecules and mannose phosphate groups also define two different types of layers parallel to a-axis. Within water channels there are extensive hydrogen-bonding networks.
16127493,0,2005,Dalton Trans,Coordination chemistry of N-aminopropyl pendant arm derivatives of mixed N/S-, and N/S/O-donor macrocycles, and construction of selective fluorimetric chemosensors for heavy metal ions.,The coordination chemistry of the N-aminopropyl pendant arm derivatives (L1c-4c) of the mixed donor macrocyclic ligands [12]aneNS2O, [12]aneNS3, [12]aneN2SO, and [15]aneNS2O2(L1a-4a) towards Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Hg(II), and Pb(II) in aqueous solution has been investigated. The protonation and stability constants with the aforementioned metal ions were determined potentiometrically and compared, where possible, with those of the unfunctionalised macrocycles. The measured values show that Hg(II) and Cu(II) in water have the highest affinity for all ligands considered, with the N-aminopropyl pendant arm weakly coordinating the metal centres. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were grown for the perchlorate salt (H2L1c)(ClO4)2.dmf, and for the 1 : 1 complexes [Cd(L3a)(NO3)2](1), [Cu(L4a)dmf](ClO4)2(2), [Zn(L1c)(ClO4)]ClO4(3), [Cd(L1c)(NO3)]NO3(4), and [Hg(L2c)](ClO4)2(5). Their structures show the macrocyclic ligands adopting a folded conformation, which for the 12-membered systems can be either [2424] or [3333] depending on the nature of the metal ion. L1c-4c were also functionalised at the primary amino pendant group with different fluorogenic subunits. In particular the N-dansylamidopropyl (Lnd, n= 1-4), and the N-(9-anthracenylmethyl)aminopropyl (Lne, n= 1, 2, 4, ) pendant arm derivatives of L1a-4a were synthesised and their optical responses to the above mentioned metal ions were investigated in MeCN/H2O (4 : 1 v/v) solutions.
16122342,0,2005,J Chem Phys,Chemistry at corners and edges: generation and adsorption of H atoms on the surface of MgO nanocubes.,We used UV light to generate site-selective O- hole centers at three-coordinated corner oxygen sites on MgO nanocubes. These highly reactive O- radicals split H2 homolytically and, in the course of this reaction, become hydroxylated and produce hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms adsorb predominantly at cube edges and dissociate into surface-trapped electrons and protons. We propose that the experimentally observed (H+)(e-) centers are formed adjacent to the hydroxyl groups generated in the homolytic splitting process and can be defined as (H+)3C...(e-)(H+)NC centers where 3C and NC refer to the coordination numbers of the corresponding hydroxylated oxygen sites. Our ab initio embedded cluster calculations reveal that the electronic properties of (H+)3C...(e-)(H+)4C centers situated along MgO nanocube edges are consistent with both the electron-paramagnetic-resonance signal parameters and the reported optical-absorption properties. The transformation of corner O- centers into the (H+)3C...(e-)(H+)NC-type centers prevents their recombination with electronic surface centers and, hence, significantly alters the electronic structure of MgO nanocubes by introducing shallow electron traps.

The X-ray crystal structure of complex 3a has also been investigated. Upon irradiation, most of the complexes exhibited triplet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (3MLCT) (d pi(Re) --&gt; pi*(diimine)) emission in fluid solutions at 298 K and in low-temperature glass. However, the structural features and long emission lifetimes of the Me4-phen complexes in solutions at room temperature suggest that the excited state of these complexes exhibited substantial triplet intraligand (3IL) (pi --&gt; pi*) (Me4-phen) character. The binding interactions of these complexes to indole-binding proteins including bovine serum albumin and tryptophanase have been examined.
16047412,0,2005,Z Naturforsch C,Assessment of genetic diversity among 16 promising cultivars of ginger using cytological and molecular markers.,Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) is an economically important plant, valued all over the world. The existing variation among 16 promising cultivars as observed through differential rhizome yield (181.9 to 477.3 g) was proved to have a genetic basis using different genetic markers such as karyotype, 4C nuclear DNA content and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The karyotypic analysis revealed a differential distribution of A, B, C, D and E type of chromosomes among different cultivars as represented by different karyotype formulas. A significant variation of 4C DNA content was recorded in ginger at an intraspecific level with values ranging from 17.1 to 24.3 pg. RAPD analysis revealed a differential polymorphism of DNA showing a number of polymorphic bands ranging from 26 to 70 among 16 cultivars. The RAPD primers OPC02, OPA02, OPD20 and OPN06 showing strong resolving power were able to distinguish all 16 cultivars. The extent of genetic diversity among these cultivars was computed through parameters of gene diversity, sum of allele numbers per locus and Shannon's information indices. Cluster analysis, Nei's genetic similarity and genetic distances, distribution of cultivars into special distance classes and principal coordinate analysis and the analysis of molecular variance suggested a conspicuous genetic diversity among different cultivars studied. The genetic variation thus detected among promising cultivars of ginger has significance for ginger improvement programs.

L3 can also be prepared in higher yield by the reaction of (NH2CH2CH2){(2-C5H4N)CH2}2N with the corresponding aryl bromide in the presence of base and a palladium(0) catalyst. Treatment of L1 or L2 with MCl2 [MCl2 = CoCl2.6H2O or FeCl2(THF)1.5] in THF affords the high spin complexes [(L1)MCl2](M = Co 1a, Fe 1b) and [(L2)MCl2](M = Co 2a, Fe 2b) in good yield, respectively; the molecular structure of reveals a five-coordinate metal centre with bound in a facial fashion. The six-coordinate complexes, [(L3a)MCl2](M = Co 3a, Fe 3b, Mn 3c) are accessible on treatment of tripodal L3a with MCl2. In contrast, the reaction with the more sterically encumbered leads to the pseudo-five-coordinate species [(L3b)MCl2](M = Co 4a, Fe 4b) and, in the case of manganese, dimeric [(L3b)MnCl(mu-Cl)]2 (4c); in 4a and 4b the aryl-substituted amine arm forms a partial interaction with the metal centre while in 4c the arm is pendant. The single crystal X-ray structures of , 1a, 3b.MeCN, 3c.MeCN, 4b.MeCN and 4c are described as are the solution state properties of 3b and 4b.
16022535,0,2005,Inorg Chem,Synthesis, characterization, biocide and toxicological activities of di-n-butyl- and diphenyl-tin(IV)-salicyliden-beta-amino alcohol derivatives.,The one pot reaction of salicylaldehyde 1, beta-amino alcohols 2a-2c, and di-n-butyltin(IV) oxide 3a or diphenyltin(IV) oxide 3b produced five diorganotin(IV) compounds, 4a-4c, 5a, and 5c, in good yields. All compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H, (13)C, and (119)Sn NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis; furthermore, compounds 4b, 4c, 5a, and 5c were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. After the structural characterization, all of the compounds were tested in vitro against Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive, strain ATCC 6633), Escherichia coli (Gram-negative, strain DH5alpha), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative, strain BH3), Desulfovibrio longus (strain DSM 6739), and Desulfomicrobium aspheronum (strain DSM 5918) to assess their antimicrobial activity. Compounds 4 and 5 demonstrated a wide range of bactericidal activities against the tested aerobic (one Gram-positive and two Gram-negative subtypes) and anaerobic bacteria (two sulfate-reducing bacteria, SRB). Compound 5 had better bactericidal performances than compound 4. For all of the compounds, the acute toxicity was measured using luminescent bacteria toxicity (LBT-Microtox) tests to track their further environmental impact. According to these results and in order to fulfill environmental regulations, the toxicity of the compounds studied herein can be modulated through the proper selection of the disubstituted tin(IV) moiety.
16010374,0,2005,Ann Acad Med Singapore,The founding of the medical school in Singapore in 1905.,This article traces briefly the origins of medical education in the early years of the Straits Settlements (Singapore, Penang and Malacca), which culminated in the founding of Medical School in Singapore in 1905. The first attempt was made in the early 19th century, when boys were recruited from local schools as Medical Apprentices to be trained as &quot;assistant doctors&quot;. They were to assist the British doctors and doctors from India in running the medical services. This scheme was not successful. There are 3 landmark years in the evolution of medical education in the Straits Settlements, namely 1852, 1867 and 1904. In 1852, the Governor, to relieve the shortage of staff in the Medical Department, instructed the Principal Civil Medical Officer to organise a proper course of training for Medical Apprentices and to establish a local Medical Service. This scheme was also unsuccessful and the Straits Settlements continued to rely on doctors recruited from India. In 1867, the Straits Settlements were transferred from the India Office to the Colonial Office and became a Crown Colony. The Indian Government requested that all its doctors be sent back. This would have led to the collapse of the Straits Settlements Medical Service. As a stop-gap measure, the Governor offered the Indian doctors appointment in the new Straits Settlements Medical Service, and at the same time arranged with the Madras Government for boys from the Straits Settlements to be trained in its Medical Colleges. The first 2 boys were sent in 1869. In 1889, the Principal Civil Medical Officer proposed to the Governor that a Medical School should be founded in Singapore, but not enough candidates passed the preliminary entrance examination. The plan was shelved and boys continued to be sent to Madras for training. In 1902, the Committee on English Education proposed that a Medical School should be started in Singapore, but senior British doctors opposed this. On 8 September 1904, Mr Tan Jiak Kim and other local community leaders petitioned the Governor to start a Medical School, raised enough funds to establish the School and the Straits and Federated Malay States Government Medical School (predecessor of the King Edward VII College of Medicine, and the Faculties of Medicine, University of Singapore and University of Malaya) was founded on 3 July 1905.
16002299,0,2005,Bioorg Med Chem,Binding studies and GRIND/ALMOND-based 3D QSAR analysis of benzothiazine type K(ATP)-channel openers.,For seventeen 1,4-benzothiazine potassium channel openers, we performed binding studies in rat aortic smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, compared their binding affinities with published relaxation data, and derived 3D-QSAR models using GRIND/ALMOND descriptors. Binding affinities in smooth muscle cells range from a pK(D) of 4.76 for compound 3e to 9.10 for compound 4c. Comparison of data for smooth muscle relaxation and binding shows preferentially higher pEC(50)s for the former. In cardiomyocytes, pK(D) values range from 4.21 for 3e to 8.16 for 4c. 3D-QSAR analysis resulted in PLS models of two latent variables for all three activities with determination coefficients of 0.97 (smooth muscle relaxation) and 0.94 (smooth muscle cells- and cardiomyocytes-binding). Internal validation yielded q(2) values of 0.69, 0.66, and 0.64. The carbonyl on the N-4 substituent, the hydrogen bond acceptor at C-6, the five-membered ring at N-4, and the gem-dimethyls mainly guide strong binding and strong smooth muscle relaxation.
15947734,0,2005,Med Sci Sports Exerc,Is leg-to-leg BIA valid for predicting minimum weight in wrestlers?,BACKGROUND: The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and several state associations require prediction of minimum weight (MW) for collegiate and high school wrestlers. The rule requires assessment of body composition before the competitive season to minimize unhealthy weight-loss practices. Leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) has been suggested for use with wrestlers.PURPOSE: To evaluate leg-to-leg BIA against a four-component (4C) criterion to determine whether leg-to-leg BIA predicted MW within acceptable limits for the sport of wrestling.METHODS: Criterion MW was calculated by the 4C equation of Lohman (19) using independent measurement of body density (BD) by hydrostatic weighing, bone mineral content (BMC) by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and total body water (TBW) by deuterium dilution. Subjects were 57 wrestlers (mean +/- SD; age = 19.7 +/- 1.3 yr, height = 176.6 +/- 7.3 cm, weight = 77.7 +/- 12.4 kg). Hydration was confirmed by the NCAA guidelines. Accuracy, precision, and systematic bias were examined.RESULTS: Comparable mean values (72.2 +/- 9.7 vs 72.2 +/- 10.3 kg), a high correlation (r = 0.94), and a regression line similar to the line of identity were found between BIA and 4C. However, large individual differences and systematic bias were seen across the range of MW. BIA predicted MW within 3.5 kg 68% of the time and within 7.0 kg 95% of the time. MW residuals ranged from -10.4 kg to +6.9 kg. When using 2.0 kg as an acceptable cutoff for error, only 40% of the BIA values were within 2.0 kg of the criterion.CONCLUSION: Large individual variation was seen, and, by definition, the precision was poor when estimating MW for individuals. In practical terms, the prediction error may span multiple weight classes, thus making leg-to-leg BIA unacceptable for prediction of MW in this sample under the conditions of the study.
15911308,0,2005,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and antimycobacterial evaluation of certain fluoroquinolone derivatives.,A number of fluoroquinolone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antimycobacterial activity. Preliminary results are (1) for 1-aryl fluoroquinolones, 1-(4-nitrophenyl) derivatives were inactive while their 1-(2-fluoro-4-nitrophenyl) counterparts were active anti-TB agents (3a vs 4a; 3b vs 4b) indicated the fluoro substituent at C-2 position is important. For the 1-(2-fluoro-4-nitrophenyl)quinolones, 7-piperidinyl derivative 4a and 7-(3,5-dimethylpiperazinyl) derivative 4e, which exhibited 97% and 98% inhibition, respectively, were more active than their 7-morpholinyl, 7-(4-methylpiperazinyl) and 7-piperazinyl congeners, 4b,4c and 4d, respectively. In addition, 7-[4-(8-hydroxyquinolin-2-ylmethyl)piperazin-1-yl] derivative 9d exhibited 44% inhibition on the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis while its 7-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl) counterpart 3c was inactive implied the metal-chelating 8-hydroxyquinoline moiety was capable of enhancing the anti-TB activity, (2) for the bifunctional fluoroquinolone-hydroxyquinoline complexes, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacine derivatives, which exhibited the same anti-TB activity (98% inhibition), are more potent than norfloxacin counterpart, which in turn is more potent than 1-aryl congeners (9b, 9c&gt;9a&gt;9d, 9e).
15901320,0,2005,Appl Spectrosc,Diels-alder adducts of 3,6-dibromophencyclone with short-chain N-n-alkylmaleimides: 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance studies of hindered rotations and magnetic anisotropy, and ab initio calculations for optimized structures.,3,6-Dibromophencyclone, 2, reacted with N-ethylmaleimide, 3a; N-n-propylmaleimide, 3b; and N-n-butylmaleimide, 3c; to form the corresponding Diels-Alder adducts, 4a, 4b, and 4c. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the adducts were studied at ambient temperatures at 300 MHz for proton and 75 MHz for carbon-13. Full proton assignments were achieved by high-resolution COSY45 spectra for the aryl proton regions. Rigorous assignments for protonated carbons were obtained with the heteronuclear chemical shift correlation spectra (HETCOR). Slow exchange limit (SEL) spectra were observed for both proton and carbon-13 NMR for each adduct, with slow rotation on the NMR timescales for the unsubstituted bridgehead phenyl groups. Endo Diels-Alder adduct stereochemistry was supported by substantial magnetic anisotropic shielding effects in the 1H NMR spectra of the alkyl groups. Proton NMR shifts are compared with those previously reported for the corresponding adducts, 5b and 5c, obtained from 3b and 3c, respectively, with the parent compound, phencyclone, 1. Results of ab initio molecular modeling calculations at the Hartree-Fock level using the LACVP* basis set for conformers of the dibrominated adducts, 4a-4c, are presented, together with HF/6-31G* results for the non-brominated adducts, 5a, 5b, and 5c. Novel aspects of this present work include: (a) attempts to quantitatively evaluate alkyl proton NMR shielding magnitudes in the adducts, relative to maleimide precursors, and (b) use of ab initio Hartree-Fock level calculations to try to reconcile adduct geometries with the observed shielding magnitudes. Our results here complement and extend studies of: (a) adducts of the parent phencyclone with straight-chain N-n-alkylmaleimides, and (b) adducts of 3,6-dibromophencyclone with other symmetrical dienophiles.
15881816,0,2005,Boll Chim Farm,Novel nicotinate esters of vasodilatation activity.,A variety of 2-substituted-4, 6-diaryl-3-pyridinecarboxylates 4 were obtained through aromatic nucleophilic substitution. reaction of secondary amines with 2-bromo-3-pyridinecarboxylate derivatives 3. The latters were obtained through bromination of 3-aryl-4-benzoyl-2-cyanobutyrates 2 in glacial acetic acid. However; reaction of primary aromatic amines with 2-bromopyridines 3 afforded 2-arylamino-3-pyridinecarboxylates 5 beside the unexpected 2-amino analogues 6. On the other hand, 3-hydroxy-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines 7 were isolated via reaction of 3 with hydrazine hydrate. Good to complete muscle relaxation of rabbit's jejunium, rat's uterus and rabbits aorta was observed during screening representative examples (3a, 4c, Sd, 5f and 6b) of the newly synthesized 3-pyridinecarboxylates indicating the vasodilatation and antihypertension activity for the tested compounds.
15837299,0,2005,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,NMDA-NR2B subtype selectivity of stereoisomeric 2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-isoquinolyl)ethanol derivatives.,Enantiopure 2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-isoquinolyl)ethanol derivatives were tested for their affinity to the ifenprodil binding site of the NMDA receptor, their potency to inhibit [3H]MK801 binding and their NMDA-NR2B subtype selectivity. The (1S,1'S)-configurated series displayed the highest affinity to the ifenprodil binding site. A reasonable potency and NMDA-NR2B subtype selectivity was found for (1S,1'S)-4c (R1=Me, R2=OMe). A high affinity to HERG K+ channels, however, suggests that (1S,1'S)-4c may involve an increased risk of cardiovascular side effects.
15822949,0,2005,J Org Chem,Upper rim allyl- and arylazo-coupled calix[4]arenes as highly sensitive chromogenic sensors for Hg2+ ion.,The syntheses and chromogenic properties of calix[4]arenes, carrying 5,17-bisallyl-11,23-bis(p-X-phenyl)azo 3a-c, 5,11,17-triallyl-23-(p-X-phenyl)azo 4a-c, and 5,17-bis(hydroxypropyl)-11,23-bis(p-X-phenyl)azo groups on the upper rims 5a,b, are described. Unexpectedly, UV/vis spectra of the very popular 4-(4-nitrophenyl)azophenol-coupled calix[4]arenes 3c and 4c did not show any shift in lambda(max) when 10 different metal perchlorates were added separately to the host in a methanol-chloroform (v/v = 1/399) cosolvent. In contrast, the absorption spectra of calix[4]arenes with either 4-methoxyphenylazo (3b-5b) or 4-phenylazo (3a-5a) on the upper rim showed substantial bathochromic shifts (Deltalambda = 128-162 nm) upon the addition of soft metal ions (such as Hg(2+), Cr(3+), and Cu(2+)). The 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)azophenol-coupled calix[4]arenes (the 3b-5b series) are found to be highly sensitive for mercury ion (Hg(2+)) among the 10 different metal ions screened. Strong interactions between Hg(2+) ion and the 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)azophenol(s) as well as the p-allyl groups are corroborated by the (1)H NMR studies of 3a,b.Hg(2+) complexes. Furthermore, Job's plots revealed 1:1 binding stoichiometry for all these p-allyl- and arylazo-coupled calix[4]arenes with transition metal ions, and Benesi-Hilderbrand plots were used for the determination of their association constants.
15820881,0,2005,Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,Quantum-chemical studies of methyl and silyl torsional frequencies and the structures of disilylsulphide and trisilylphosphine.,Torsional frequencies of methyl and silyl groups occurring in a range of molecules have been calculated by HF, B3LYP and MP2 methods using several basis sets. Linear correlations between calculated and observed values are derived and used to predict unobserved or dubious frequencies. The current experimental value for the E torsion in trimethylphosphine is questioned. The relative merits of the B3LYP and MP2 methods are explored. MP2 calculations can show wide variation with respect to basis set. In cases where two or more silyl groups are attached to a common atom, as in disilylsulphide (SiH3)2S, disilylmethane (SiH3)2CH2, trisilylmethane (SiH3)3CH and tetrasilylmethane (SiH3)4C, marked differences occur between B3LYP and MP2 estimates. These may be linked to concomitant differences in conformation or potential barrier restraining internal rotation. In disilylmethane the B3LYP results agree much better with experiment than those from the MP2 method. HF and B3LYP calculations for disilylsulphide and trisilylphosphine give normal C2v and C3v equilibrium structures, respectively, but in MP2 structures the silyl groups are twisted through 6-13 degrees yielding C2 and C3 configurations. It may be possible to distinguish between these structures through the observation of isolated SiH stretching frequencies in the spectra of fully deuterated materials. Dispersion forces could contribute to the twisting calculated by the MP2 method. Further studies of the microwave and vibrational spectra of disilylsulphide and trisilylphosphine isotopomers are needed.
15813221,0,2005,Acta Biol Hung,Determination of ploidy levels in Ipheion uniflorum (R. C. Graham) Rafin (Liliaceae).,In this study, chromosome number and ploidy levels of Ipheion uniflorum cv. &quot;Wisley Blue&quot; (spring starflower) were determined. In meristematic root tip cells, chromosome number was found as 2n = 12 and 4n = 24. The ratios of diploid and tetraploid cells were found as 80.74% and 19.26%, respectively. In differentiated root tissues and mature leaf tissues ploidy levels were analysed by flow cytometry and polysomaty were found in both organs. In differentiated root tissues, ploidy levels were found as 2C, 4C, 8C and 16C DNA. In root tissues percentages of 2C, 4C, 8C and 16C nuclear DNA content were observed as 57.2%, 33.1%, 2.47% and 7.23%, respectively. In mature leaf tissues, ploidy levels were determined 2C, 4C, 8C and 16C DNA. In this tissue the frequency of 4C DNA was found very higher (74.3%) and 2C DNA content was determined as 19.2%. In mature leaf tissue, 8C and 16C nuclear DNA contents were observed as 2.72% and 3.78%, respectively. When nuclear DNA contents in leaves and roots were compared, an apparent difference in 2C and 4C DNA contents was found.
15804022,0,2005,Hua Xi Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,[The histological research between the mode of invasion and cervical lymph node metastasis in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity].,OBJECTIVE: The relationship between the mode of tumor invasion in the tumor-host borderline and the frequency of cervical lymph node metastasis was investigated in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.METHODS: 200 cases with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity were studied by histological method with HE stained. The mode of invasion in the tumor-host relationship was classified into five grades by Yamamoto's criteria.RESULTS: With regard to the relationship between the mode of invasion and metastasis, the more invasive the tumor tissue was, the more frequent the metastasis formed (P &lt; 0.001). The frequency of metastasis in grades 1 and 2 was low (0 and 5.9%, respectively), The frequency of metastasis in grades 3 was moderate (14.3%), and that in grades 4c and 4d was highly rapid (63.0% and 82.9%, respectively). Single node metastases were frequent in grade 3 and grade 4c (66.7% and 58.8%, respectively), while plural node metastases were frequent in grade 4d (70.6%, P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the distribution of metastasized lymph nodes was focused on level 1 (41.2%) or level 1 and 2 (79.4%) in grade 4c and was dispersed from level 1 to 4 in grade 4d (P &lt; 0.05). In the present study, the degree of differentiation did not correlate well with the frequency of metastasis.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the more invasive the tumor cells were to the host, the more frequent the metastasis formed. The different mode of invasion would accompany with different frequency of metastasis, different number and distribution of metastasized lymph nodes.
15766126,0,2005,Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,[Fluorescence of Tb(3+) -calmodulin complex and its analytical application].,Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous Ca(2+) -binding protein of eukaryotes, and regulates a broad spectrum of fundamental cellular processes. CaM harbors four binding domains, among which domains I, II and III contain no tyrosine, only domain IV has one tyrosine for plant species. In contrast to mammals, plants express numerous CaM isoforms that exhibit differential activation or inhibition of CaM dependent enzymes in vitro. In the present study, the isoform II of Arabidopsis thaliana CaM was used to test the binding properties of metal ion to CaM by Tb3+ fluorescence. The increase in fluorescence was monitored at 545 nm as a function of the number of Tb3+ bound to CaM using direct (221 nm) and indirect (280 nm ) excitation. Upon direct excitation of Tb(3+) -CaM, the fluorescence of Tb3+ increased markedly, and one of the pathways of energy dissipation of the excited state of Tb3+ was energy transfer to the vibrational levels of water molecules in the hydration sphere around the Tb3+ ion. When waters of hydration were removed as a result of Tb3+ binding to CaM, an increase in rate constants of luminescence was observed. The titration curve with direct excitation increased up to 4 mol of Tb3+/mol of CaM before the onset of a plateau, in agreement with the expected maximum of four binding sites. Using indirect excitation at 280 nm, the resultant titration curve was sigmoid, albeit with less fluorescence intensity, also reached a maximum at a ratio of 4 mol of Tb3+/mol of CaM, in which the first phase exhibits an end at 2 : 1, and in this phase there was only a small increase in Tb3+ fluorescence. The fact that only the second pair of added Tb3+ shows a large enhancement in Tb3+ fluorescence suggests that it is Tb3+ bound to the low affinity sites that can accept energy from tyrosine group. The turning points of fluorescence titration curves were used to estimate the concentrations of CaM on the base of CTb3+ = 4c(CaM).
15766089,0,2005,Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,[Direct fluorophotometric and flow-injection fluorophotometric methods for the determination of trace ammonia].,Direct fluorophotometric and flow-injection fluorophotometric methods for trace ammonia measurement involving the fluorescent reaction of ammonia with o-phthaldlaldehyde (OPA) and 2-mercaptoethanol (ME) producing derivant of iso-indol in alkaline solution are described. Triton X-100 was added to improve the stability of the system. The maximum excitation wavelength is 415 nm, while the maximum emission wavelength is 486 nm. With direct fliuorophotometric method, the calibration curve's regression equation is deltaI = 22.286 + 785.71c(NH3) (microg x mL(-1)) (r = 0. 9995) in the range of ammonia concentration from 0.2 to 1.0 microg x mL(-1), and deltaI = -27.429 + 2 371.4c(NH3) microg x mL(-1)) (r = 0.9965) in the range of ammonia concentration from 0.02 to 0.10 microg x mL(-1). With flow-injection fluorophotometric method, the calibration curve's regression equation is deltaI = 1188c(NH3) (microg x mL(-1)) (r = 0. 9998) in the range of ammonia concentration of ammonia 0-0.7 microg x mL(-1). The mechanism of reaction was also briefly discussed.

15740147,0,2005,J Am Chem Soc,Formation and characterization of the hexanuclear platinum cluster [Pt6(mu-PBu(t)2)4(CO)6](CF3SO3)2 through structural, electrochemical, and computational analyses.,The reaction between equimolar amounts of Pt(3)(mu-PBu(t)()(2))(3)(H)(CO)(2), Pt(3)()H, and CF(3)SO(3)H under CO atmosphere affords the triangular species [Pt(3)(mu-PBu(t)()(2))(3)(CO)(3)]X, [Pt(3)()(CO)(3)()(+)()]X (X = CF(3)SO(3)(-)), characterized by X-ray crystallography, or in an excess of acid, [Pt(6)(mu-PBu(t)()(2))(4)(CO)(6)]X(2), [Pt(6)()(2+)()]X(2)(). Structural determination shows the latter to be a rare hexanuclear cluster with a Pt(4) tetrahedral core formed by joining the unbridged sides of two orthogonal Pt(3) triangles. The dication Pt(6)()(2+)() features also extensive redox properties as it undergoes two reversible one-electron reductions to the congeners [Pt(6)(mu-PBu(t)()(2))(4)(CO)(6)](+) (Pt(6)()(+)(), E(1/2) = -0.27 V) and Pt(6)(mu-PBu(t)()(2))(4)(CO)(6) (Pt(6)(), E(1/2) = -0.54 V) and a further quasi-reversible two-electron reduction to the unstable dianion Pt(6)()(2)()(-)() (E(1/2) = -1.72 V). The stable radical (Pt(6)()(+)()) and diamagnetic (Pt(6)()) species are also formed via chemical methods by using 1 or 2 equiv of Cp(2)Co, respectively; further reduction of Pt(6)()(2+)() causes fast decomposition. The chloride derivatives [Pt(6)(mu-PBu(t)()(2))(4)(CO)(5)Cl]X, (Pt(6)()Cl(+)())X, and Pt(6)(mu-PBu(t)()(2))(4)(CO)(4)Cl(2), Pt(6)()Cl(2)(), observed as side-products in some electrochemical experiments, were prepared independently. The reaction leading to Pt(3)()(CO)(3)()(+)() has been analyzed with DFT methods, and identification of key intermediates allows outlining the reaction mechanism. Moreover, calculations for the whole series Pt(6)()(2+)() --&gt; Pt(6)()(2)()(-)()( )()afford the otherwise unknown structures of the reduced derivatives. While the primary geometry is maintained by increasing electron population, the system undergoes progressive and concerted out-of-plane rotation of the four phosphido bridges (from D(2)(d)() to D(2) symmetry). The bonding at the central Pt(4) tetrahedron of the hexanuclear clusters (an example of 4c-2e(-) inorganic tetrahedral aromaticity in Pt(6)()(2+)()) is explained in simple MO terms.
15736472,0,2005,Anticancer Res,Application of new ploidy-related parameters for the diagnosis of ovarian tumours.,Differential diagnostics of borderline ovarian tumours and ovarian carcinomas is generally based on morphological criteria, which are not always sufficient for final diagnosis. Therefore, we investigated the practical diagnostic application of the CAS200 image analyzer and new ploidy-related parameters in a series of 68 borderline tumours and 42 low-grade carcinomas of the ovary. Highly significant differences between borderline and malignant lesions were found for the percentage of diploid cells (p = 0.0001), the percentage of aneuploid cells between 4c and 8c (p = 0.0001), the percentage of octaploid cells (p = 0.0001), as well as for the 5c exceeding rate (p = 0.0001). The difference concerning the ratio of tetraploid cells also reached the level of significance (p = 0.0320). We suggest that new ploidy-related parameters evaluated by the CAS200 image analyzer can be helpful in ovarian lesions with unclear morphology.

15727857,0,2005,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of new symmetrical derivatives as cytotoxic agents and apoptosis inducers.,Based on the research of less toxic anticancer therapies, we have looked for novel compounds with anticancer activity based on a proapoptotic mechanism. The described compounds are derivatives of ether, carbamate, urea, amide, or amine. Some of the prepared compounds decreased cell viability of various tumor cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and also induced DNA fragmentation, which indicated cell apoptosis. The potential antitumoral activity of the compounds was evaluated in vitro by examining their cytotoxic effects against human mama, colon, and bladder cancer cell lines (MD-MBA-231, HT-29, and T-24). Compounds showing cytotoxic activity were subjected to an apoptosis assay. In addition, some of the synthesized compounds provoked a rapid and dose-dependent increase in the level of caspase-3, an enzyme, which is considered to be one of the principal executing caspases in which all of the biochemical routes involved in the apoptosis response converge. The most promising compounds, with respect to cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction capability, were the 4-nitrophenylcarbamate derivative of 2,2'-methylenebis(4-chlorophenyl) 3c, the naphthylurea derivative 4d, and the n-propylurea derivative 4c, from 4,4'-methylenebisphenyl, all of which displayed cytotoxic activity and showed very interesting levels of apoptosis. Furthermore, good levels of apoptosis induction were achieved for 3a and 4b in the T-24 cell line. Therefore, compounds such as 7b, a pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivative, show a significant in vitro cytotoxicity, with IC(50) values between 3 and 8 microm in the three cell lines tested. This compound also produced a rapid and dose-dependent increase of the caspase-3 level and induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells. Other profiles have been found, such as those presented by 5c and 7c, which are cytotoxic and apoptotic but do not provoke an increase in the level of caspase-3, or those presented by 1c, 1d, and 2a, which are cytotoxic, without showing any other activity. The different types of behavior of each compound are not necessarily parallel in the three cell lines tested. A great number of these compounds of interest show no cytotoxicity in nontumoral human cells such as CRL-8799, a nontumoral line of mama. Subsequent modulation of these lead structures permits advances in the design of potent cytotoxic and proapoptotic anticancer drugs.
15703049,0,2005,Hereditas,Statistical and image analysis of sister chromatid exchange in maize.,The present study reports the use of the fluorescence plus Giemsa (FPG) technique, image analysis and statistical methods to assess the sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) frequency in maize. Roots derived from germinated maize seeds were treated with BrdU solution and fixed. The slides were prepared by enzymatic cellular dissociation, air-drying technique, stained with Hoechst 33258 fluorochrome, and incubated in salt solution. The chromosomes were irradiated with ultraviolet light and stained with Giemsa solution. The FPG technique associated with digital analysis system was used to measure the length of 597 BrdU-incorporated maize chromosomes and to identify 0.5243 SCE per chromosome. A range from 0 to 4 SCE events were classified and the chi-square test (chi2=1.586, P=0.662) showed a good fit to the hypothesis that the SCEs are independent and random events that follow Poisson distribution. The SCE frequencies in long and short chromosome arms corresponded to a mean value of 0.876 SCE microm(-1). Considering that the maize line used in this study contains 5.78 picogram (pg) DNA (2C value) in interphasic G0/G1 nuclei or 11.56 pg DNA (4C value) in metaphase, and that the DNA mean value corresponds to 0.578 pg/metaphasic chromosome, the analysis suggests an occurrence of approximately 0.9 SCE/pg DNA.

Photolysis of 1 with vinyltrimethylsilane ultimately yields three isomeric products of [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(CH2=CHSiMe3)2]2, 3a, 3b and 3c which are differentiated by the relative orientations of the vinylsilane. When this reaction is undertaken in d6-benzene, H/D exchange between the solvent and the alpha-proton of the vinylsilane is revealed. In addition evidence for two isomers of the solvent complex [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(C2H4)2][Rh(C2H4)(eta2-toluene)] was obtained in these and related experiments when the photolysis was completed at low temperature without substrate, although no evidence for H/D exchange was observed. Photolysis of 1 with Et3SiH yielded the sequential substitution products [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(C2H4)2][Rh(C2H4)(SiEt3)H] 4a, [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(C2H4)(SiEt3)H]2 4b, [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(C2H4)(SiEt3)H][Rh(SiEt3)2(H)2] 4c and [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(SiEt3)2(H)2]2 4d; deuteration of the alpha-ring proton sites, and all the silyl protons, of 4d was demonstrated in d6-benzene. This reaction is further complicated by the formation of two Si-C bond activation products, [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][RhH(mu-SiEt2)]2 5 and [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][(RhEt)(RhH)(mu-SiEt2)2] 6. Complex 5 was also produced when 1 was photolysed with Et2SiH2. When the photochemical reactions with Et3SiH were repeated at low temperatures, two isomers of the unstable C-H activation products, the vinyl hydrides [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][{Rh(SiEt3)H}{Rh(SiEt3)}(mu-eta1,eta2-CH=CH2)] 7a and 7b, were obtained. Thermally, 4c was shown to form the ring substituted silyl migration products [(eta5-C5H4)CH2(C5H3SiEt3)][Rh(SiEt3)2(H)2]2 8 while 4b formed [CH2(C5H3SiEt3)2][Rh(SiEt3)2(H)2]2 (9a and 9b) upon reaction with excess silane. The corresponding photochemical reaction with Me3SiH yielded the expected products [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(C2H4)2][Rh(C2H4)(SiMe3)H] 10a, [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(C2H4)(SiMe3)H]2 10b, [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(C2H4)(SiMe3)H][Rh(SiMe3)2(H)2] 10c and [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(SiMe3)2(H)2]2 10d. However, three Si-C bond activation products, [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][(RhMe)(RhH)(mu-SiMe2)2] 11, [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][(Rh{SiMe3})(RhMe)(mu-SiMe2)2] 12 and [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][(Rh{SiMe3})(RhH)(mu-SiMe2)2] 13 were also obtained in these reactions.

15700821,0,2005,Yao Xue Xue Bao,[Synthesis and in vitro antitumor activity of multi-methoxyl carbazole analogues].,AIM: To design and synthesize new methoxyl carbazole analogues as antitumor compounds.METHODS: Methoxyl-nitrobiphenyls (3a-3c) were prepared through the Ullmann reaction of 4,5-dimethoxyl-2-bromonitrobenzene and methoxyl-iodobenzene compounds with the catalysis of copper powder, and then reduced by P(EtO)3 to obtain methoxyl carbazoles 4a-4c. The modification at 9-position of the methoxyl carbazoles (4a-4c) gives 16 carbazole derivatives (5a-5p). These compounds were confirmed by 1HNMR, MS, IR and elemental analysis.RESULT: In vitro antitumor activities evaluation in vitro demonstrated that IC50 value of the target compounds 4c, 5a, 5b, 5g, 5h, 5i, 5l, 5n and 5p against HT-29 cells were 12.1, 10.6, 8.1, 3.1, 4.4, 10.1 and 9.2 micromol x L(-1) respectively, and IC50 value of the target compound 4a against KB was 17.7 micromol x L(-1).CONCLUSION: Some of the target compounds have better inhibitory effects against H-29 and KB cells.
15641356,0,2005,J Chromatogr A,Human insulin and desamido human insulin isotherms in ethanol-water reversed phase systems.,The multi-component isotherms for human insulin (HI) and desamido human insulin (dHI) over reversed phase packing (C18) and with 29.8% (w/w) ethanol-water as mobile phase have been determined experimentally. The isotherms of HI in ethanol-water differ from those obtained with the more commonly applied methanol-water and acetonitrile-water mobile phase, as described in this paper. The isotherm exhibits anti Langmuirian behavior and can be very well modeled by an anti Langmuir isotherm presented in this paper. The HI and dHI anti Langmuir isotherm are determined as: qHI = (8.4C(HI) + 3C(HI)CdHI)/(1 - 0.05C(HI) - 0.14CdHI + 0.04C(HI)CdHI) and qdHI = (11.4CdHI + 2C(HI)CdHI)/ (1 - 0.05C(HI) - 0.14CdHI + 0.04C(HI)CdHI)
15639093,0,2005,J Biotechnol,Efficient production of a soluble fusion protein containing human beta-defensin-2 in E. coli cell-free system.,Human beta-defensin-2 (hBD2), a small cationic peptide, exhibits a broad range of antimicrobial activity and does not cause microbial resistance. In order to produce hBD2 efficiently, an Escherichia coli cell-free biosynthesis system has been developed as an alternative method. A specific plasmid pIVEX2.4c-trxA-shBD2 was constructed for the cell-free expression of fusion protein (hBD2 linked with His-Tag and Trx-Tag). This allowed enhancement of protein stability and facilitated downstream purification process. Significant amount of target fusion protein was synthesized in the batch-mode bioreactor by optimizing the reaction conditions. About five-fold improvement of productivity (ca. 2.0 mg/ml soluble fusion protein) could be achieved by using a continuous exchange cell-free (CECF) system compared to batch system. One-step affinity chromatographic process was developed to recover high purity fusion protein (95.2%) with overall recovery ratio of about 50%. The fusion protein was cleaved by cyanogens bromide (CNBr), and the mature hBD2 had demonstrated strong inhibition on the growth of E. coli D31 at low concentration.
15234332,63,2004,Mol Genet Metab,Neuropathology provides clues to the pathophysiology of Gaucher disease.,To better understand the pathogenesis of brain dysfunction in Gaucher disease (GD), we studied brain pathology in seven subjects with type 1 GD (four also exhibited parkinsonism and dementia), three with type 2 GD and four with type 3 GD. Unique pathologic patterns of disease involving the hippocampal CA2-4 regions and layer 4b of the calcarine cortex were identified. While these findings were common to all three GD phenotypes, the extent of the changes varied depending on the severity of disease. Cerebral cortical layers 3 and 5, hippocampal CA2-4, and layer 4b were involved in all GD patients. Neuronal loss predominated in both type 2 and type 3 patients with progressive myoclonic encephalopathy, whereas patients classified as type 1 GD had only astrogliosis. Adjacent regions and lamina, including hippocampal CA1 and calcarine lamina 4a and 4c were spared of pathology, highlighting the specificity of the vulnerability of selective neurons. Elevated glucocerebrosidase expression by immunohistochemistry was found in CA2-4. Hippocampal (45)Ca(2+) uptake autoradiography in rat brain was performed demonstrating that hippocampal CA2-4 neurons, rather than CA1 neurons, were calcium-induced calcium release sensitive (CICR-sensitive). These findings match recent biochemical studies linking elevated glucosylceramide levels to sensitization of CA2-4 RyaR receptors and 300% potentiation of neuronal CICR sensitivity. In two patients with type 1 GD and parkinsonism, numerous synuclein positive inclusions, similar to brainstem-type Lewy bodies found in Parkinson disease, were also found hippocampal CA2-4 neurons. These findings argue for a common cytotoxic mechanism linking aberrant glucocerebrosidase activity, neuronal cytotoxicity, and cytotoxic Lewy body formation in GD.
15486191,33,2004,Mol Cancer Ther,The dietary isothiocyanate sulforaphane targets pathways of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and oxidative stress in human pancreatic cancer cells and inhibits tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficient mice.,Anticancer effects of the dietary isothiocyanate sulforaphane were investigated in the human pancreatic cancer cell lines MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1. Sulforaphane-treated cells accumulated in metaphase as determined by flow cytometry [4C DNA content, cyclin A(-), cyclin B1(+), and phospho-histone H3 (Ser(10))(+)]. In addition, treated cells showed nuclear apoptotic morphology that coincided with an activation of caspase-8, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and loss of plasma membrane integrity. The initial detection of caspase-3 cleavage occurring in G(2)-M arrest was independent of a change in phospho-cdc2 (Tyr(15)) protein; consequently, sulforaphane treatment combined with UCN-01 had no significant impact on cellular toxicity. Incubations at higher sulforaphane doses (&gt;10 micromol/L) resulted in cleavage of caspase-3 in the G(1) subpopulation, suggesting that the induction of apoptosis and the sulforaphane-induced mitosis delay at the lower dose are independently regulated. Cellular toxicity in MIA PaCa-2, and to a greater extent in PANC-1, was positively correlated with a decrease in cellular glutathione levels, whereas sustained increases in glutathione observed in MIA PaCa-2 cells or the simultaneous incubation with N-acetyl-L-cysteine in PANC-1 cells were associated with resistance to sulforaphane-induced apoptosis. Daily sulforaphane i.p. injections (375 micromol/kg/d for 3 weeks) in severe combined immunodeficient mice with PANC-1 s.c. tumors resulted in a decrease of mean tumor volume by 40% compared with vehicle-treated controls. Our findings suggest that, in addition to the known effects on cancer prevention, sulforaphane may have activity in established pancreatic cancer.
15616136,28,2004,Cereb Cortex,Orientation and direction selectivity of neurons in V1 of alert monkeys: functional relationships and laminar distributions.,We studied orientation selectivity in V1 of alert monkeys and its relationship to other physiological parameters and to anatomical organization. Single neurons were stimulated with drifting bars or with sinusoidal gratings while compensating for eye position. Orientation selectivity based on spike counts was quantified by circular variance and by the bandwidth of the orientation tuning curve. The circular variance distribution was bimodal, suggesting groups with low and with high selectivity. Orientation selectivity was clearly correlated with spontaneous activity, classical receptive field (CRF) size and the strength of surround suppression. Laminar distributions of neuronal properties were distinct. Neurons in the output layers 2/3, 4B and 5 had low spontaneous activity, small CRFs and high orientation selectivity, while the input layers had greater diversity. Direction-selective cells were among the neurons most selective for orientation and most had small CRFs. A narrow band of direction- and orientation-selective cells with small CRFs was located in the middle of layer 4C, indicating appearance of very selective cells at an early stage of cortical processing. We suggest that these results reflect interactions between excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms specific to each sublamina. Regions with less inhibition have higher spontaneous activity, larger CRFs and broader orientation tuning. Where inhibition is stronger, spontaneous activity almost disappears, CRFs shrink, and orientation selectivity is high.
14872497,27,2004,Arthritis Rheum,Analysis of cartilage biomarkers in the early phases of canine experimental osteoarthritis.,OBJECTIVE: To study 3 body fluids for changes in the levels of 5 biomarkers of cartilage metabolism during the early phases of experimental osteoarthritis (OA).METHODS: Twenty skeletally mature mixed-breed canines underwent unilateral surgical transection of the anterior cruciate ligament. Samples of joint fluid, serum, and urine were obtained preoperatively and just before necropsy (3 weeks or 12 weeks postoperatively). Biomarkers included 2 markers of cartilage matrix synthesis/turnover (aggrecan 846 epitope and C-propeptide of type II collagen) and 3 markers of cartilage degradation (keratan sulfate proteoglycan epitope, the collagenase-generated cleavage epitope of type II collagen [Col2-3/4C(long mono), or CIIC], and crosslinked peptides from the C-telopeptide domain of type II collagen [Col2CTx]). Significant changes in the levels of these biomarkers were determined by paired analyses.RESULTS: Joint pathology was more severe in the 12-week group compared with the 3-week group. In joint fluid, due to limited volume, only Col2-3/4C(long mono) and Col2CTx were measured. Significant elevations in the levels of both of these markers were observed in experimental joints in both the 3-week group and the 12-week group. In serum, the level of aggrecan 846 epitope was elevated at both 3 weeks and 12 weeks, the level of Col2-3/4C(long mono) was elevated at 12 weeks, and the level of Col2CTx was elevated at both 3 weeks and 12 weeks. In urine, the level of Col2-3/4C(long mono) was elevated at 12 weeks after surgery.CONCLUSION: Levels of biomarkers of intact aggrecan proteoglycan (aggrecan 846 epitope) and type II collagen degradation (Col2-3/4C(long mono) and Col2CTx) were elevated early after unilateral stifle joint injury, suggesting that these markers are sensitive and specific for early cartilage changes associated with isolated joint injury in this established model of experimental OA.
15115733,23,2004,Cereb Cortex,Oligodendrocytes, their progenitors and other neuroglial cells in the aging primate cerebral cortex.,In a previous study it was found that with age there is an increase in the frequency of paranodal profiles of myelinated nerve fibers in the cerebral cortex of monkeys. This indicates that there is an increase in the number of internodal myelin segments, and raises the question of whether additional oligodendrocytes are necessary to generate the increased numbers of internodal myelin segments. The present study shows that in layer 4C beta of monkey primary visual cortex there is an age-related increase in the number of oligodendrocytes. When young (4-10 years of age) and old (25-35 years of age) monkeys are compared, the increase is found to be approximately 50%, and it begins in middle age (12-19 years old). It is also shown that although there is no increase in the population of astrocytes in layer 4C beta with age, there appears to be a slight increase in the frequency of microglial cells. As their numbers increase, oligodendrocytes in pairs, rows and groups become more common, which suggests that additional oligodendrocytes are being generated by cell division. Since there is little evidence that mature oligodendrocytes can divide, it is probable that the new oligodendrocytes are generated from progenitor cells which, as many studies have shown, can be labeled by antibodies to NG2, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. By comparing the appearance of these NG2-labeled cells with cells encountered in thin sections of normally prepared tissue, it is shown that the NG2-positive cells have the features of neuroglial cells that were previously described as beta astrocytes.
15522252,21,2004,Biol Psychiatry,Catechol-O-methyltransferase val108/158met genotype predicts working memory response to antipsychotic medications.,BACKGROUND: The gene encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that regulates prefrontal cortex dopamine, contains a common functional polymorphism (val(108/158)met) that influences prefrontal cortex function in an allelic dose-dependent manner. A recent study reported that the COMT val(108/158)met polymorphism influences cognitive- and physiologic-related prefrontal cortex responses to antipsychotic treatment. The present study tested the effects of several COMT polymorphisms on the cognitive response to antipsychotic medication in patients with schizophrenia.METHODS: Twenty inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (5 with the val-val genotype, 11 with val-met, and 4 with met-met) were administered cognitive tests at two time points: once after 4 weeks of treatment with antipsychotic medication and once after 4 weeks of placebo administration, according to a counterbalanced, double-blind, within-subject study design.RESULTS: Patients homozygous for the COMT met allele displayed significant improvement on the working memory task after treatment. Patients homozygous for the COMT val allele did not show working memory improvement with treatment. Other COMT polymorphisms were not associated with significant differences between treatment and placebo conditions.CONCLUSIONS: These results support other data suggesting that the COMT val(108/158)met polymorphism might be an important factor in the cognitive response to antipsychotic medication.
15016847,17,2004,J Virol,Modulation of hepatitis B virus secretion by naturally occurring mutations in the S gene.,Alteration in hepatitis B virus (HBV) secretion efficiency may have pathological consequences. Naturally occurring mutations that regulate virion secretion have not been defined. We recently identified HBV genomes displaying high (4B), substantially reduced (3.4), or negative (4C) virion secretion. In the present study, the underlying mutations were mapped. A T552C point mutation in the 4B genome was responsible for its enhanced virion secretion, whereas a G510A mutation in 3.4 and G660C in 4C impaired virus secretion. The three point mutations generate M133T, G119E, and R169P substitutions in the S domains of viral envelope proteins, respectively, without modifying the coding capacity of the overlapping polymerase gene. The mutated residues are predicted to lie in the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or to be embedded in the ER membrane and thus are not involved in contact with core particles during envelopment. Of the two mutations inhibitory of virion secretion, G510A greatly reduced small envelope protein (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]) levels both inside cells and in culture medium, whereas G660C specifically abolished HBsAg secretion. Surprisingly, a T484G mutation in the 4B genome, generating an I110M substitution in the S domain, could also reduce HBsAg secretion and block virion secretion. However, its inhibitory effect was suppressed in the 4B genome by the T552C mutation, the enhancer of virion secretion. T552C can also override the inhibitory G510A mutation, but not the G660C mutation. These findings suggest a hierarchy in the regulation of virion secretion and a close link between defective virion secretion and impaired HBsAg formation or secretion.
14982733,16,2004,J Neurovirol,Region-specific distribution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeats containing specific configurations of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein site II in brains derived from demented and nondemented patients.,Previous studies have shown that two CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) binding sites (sites I and II) within the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) are critically important for efficient virus replication within cells of the monocyte lineage, a primary cell type infected by HIV-1. Sequence variation at C/EBP sites I and II has been shown to alter the affinity of C/EBP factors to these sites. Specifically, sequence variation within C/EBP binding site II has been shown to alter binding of purified C/EBP beta protein and basal activity of the HIV-1 LTR. We have previously demonstrated that the C/EBP site II consensus cladeB (ConB) variant was highly conserved in brain- and peripheral blood-derived LTRs of individuals with advanced HIV-1 disease. Given these important observations, the regional distribution of LTRs containing the C/EBP site II ConB variant derived from brain tissues of patients with and without HIV-1-associated dementia (HIVD) was examined. A statistically significant difference was found in the distribution of LTRs containing the C/EBP site II ConB variant in brain regions derived from patients with and without HIVD. In addition, we have previously shown that LTRs containing C/EBP site II 4C and 6G variants (designated according to the position at which nucleotide change occurred relative to ConB, followed by the actual nucleotide found at the variant position) were only found in brain tissue of patients with HIVD. As an extension of these observations, the regional distribution of LTRs containing C/EBP site II 4C or 6G variants derived from the brains of patients with HIVD was examined and a statistically significant difference was observed. We have shown that LTRs containing a low-affinity C/EBP site II 4C variant accumulated in the cerebellum. LTRs containing the 4C site variant in conjunction with the consensus cladeB (ConB) site I exhibited the lowest basal LTR activity of any of the LTRs examined. These results suggest that LTRs containing the C/EBP site II 4C configuration may promote the establishment of a latent provirus in the cerebellum, a region of the HIVD brain that exhibits little viral gene expression. Furthermore, LTRs containing a high affinity C/EBP site II 6G variant accumulated in the mid-frontal gyrus, a site of highly productive replication. In addition, LTRs containing the C/EBP site II 6G variant with the ConB at site I exhibited the highest basal LTR activity. In conclusion, distinct LTR populations with specific C/EBP site II configurations were found in different neuroanatomical regions of the brain, potentially due to differences in the molecular architecture of the LTR, viral entry pathways, and/or brain microenvironments.
15328021,14,2004,Dev Biol,Autoregulation of canonical Wnt signaling controls midbrain development.,After the primary anterior-posterior patterning of the neural plate, a subset of wnt signaling molecules including Xwnt-1, Xwnt-2b, Xwnt-3A, Xwnt-8b are still expressed in the developing brain in a region spanning from the posterior part of the diencephalon to the mesencephalon/metencephalon boundary. In this expression field, they are colocalized with the HMG-box transcription factor XTcf-4. Using antisense morpholino loss-of-function strategies, we demonstrate that the expression of this transcription factor depends on Xwnt-2b, which itself is under the control of XTcf-4. Marker gene analyses reveal that this autoregulatory loop is important for proper development of the midbrain and the isthmus. Staining for NCAM reveals a lack of dorsal neural tissue in this area. This reduction is caused by a reduced proliferation rate as shown by staining for PhosphoH3 positive nuclei. In rescue experiments, we demonstrate that individual isoforms of XTcf-4 control the development of different parts of the brain. XTcf-4A restored the expression of the mesencephalon marker genes pax-6 and wnt-2b but not the isthmus marker gene en-2. XTcf-4C, in contrast, restored en-2, but had only weak effects on pax-6 and wnt-2b. Thus, autoregulation of canonical Wnt signaling and alternative expression of different isoforms of XTcf-4 is essential for specifying the developing CNS.
15326378,13,2004,Cancer Biol Ther,Role of caveolin-1 in etoposide resistance development in A549 lung cancer cells.,Caveolin 1 expression is downregulated in various cancer cell lines. Interestingly, in several drug-resistant cancer cells, a strong induction of caveolin 1 expression has been reported suggesting a role for caveolin 1 in the acquisition and/or the maintenance of multidrug resistance phenotype. In addition, it was reported that p-glycoprotein localized to caveolin-rich membrane domains in these cells. In this study, we progressively exposed A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells to increasing doses of etoposide. Both R1 and R2 cell lines had greatly increased levels of p-glycoprotein expression while mrp expression levels were moderately increased but only R2 cells had raised caveolin levels compared to control A549 cells. Both caveolin-1 and p-glycoprotein colocalize in Triton-insoluble membrane domains in all our cell lines but only caveolins-1 was solubilized by the addition of octylglucoside at 4C suggesting that these two proteins are located in different membrane domains. Using an anti-caveolin-1 antibody, we did not succeed to immunoprecipitate p-glycoprotein. Interestingly, total cellular cholesterol (the major lipid component of caveolae and triton-insoluble domains) was greatly increased in both R1 and R2 cell lines compared to naive A549 cells.
15606806,12,2004,Insect Mol Biol,Tiny genomes and endoreduplication in Strepsiptera.,Using flow cytometry, the genome sizes of two species of Strepsiptera were studied: that of male Caenocholax fenyesi texensis Kathirithamby &amp; Johnston (Myrmecolacidae) at 108 Mb, which is the smallest insect genome documented to date; and those of male and female Xenos vesparum Rossi (Stylopidae), which are 1C = 130 and 133 Mb, respectively. The genome sizes of the following were analysed for comparative purposes: (a) the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), which was previously reported to be the smallest among insects: the male measured at 1C = 121 Mb and the female at 1C = 158 Mb; and (b) the female parasitic, haplodiploid, microhymenopteran wasp, Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko, which measured at 1C = 246 Mb. The hosts of the strepsipterans were also measured: male Solenopsis invicta Buren, the red imported fire ant (host of male C. f. texensis), which is 1C = 753.3 Mb, and female Polistes dominulus Christ, the paper wasp (host of X. vesparum), is 1C = 301.4 Mb. Endoreduplication (4C) of the genome of the thorax of the male strepsipteran, and higher levels of endoduplication (4, 8, 16C) in the body of the larger female was observed. In contrast, little or no endoreduplication was observed, either in the Hessian fly, or in the parasitic wasp.
15385512,12,2004,Infect Immun,Expression profiling reveals novel innate and inflammatory responses in the jejunal epithelial compartment during infection with Trichinella spiralis.,Infection with intestinal nematodes induces profound pathological changes to the gut that are associated with eventual parasite expulsion. We have applied expression profiling as an initial screening process with oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix MG-U74AV2 gene chips) and time course kinetics to investigate gene transcription triggered by the intraepithelial nematode Trichinella spiralis in jejunal epithelium from BALB/c mice. Of the 4,114 genes detected, 2,617 were present in all uninfected and T. spiralis-infected replicates, 8% of which were notably upregulated, whereas 12% were downregulated at the time of worm expulsion (day 14 postinfection). Upregulation of goblet cell mucin gene transcripts intestinal mucin gene 3 (MUC3), calcium chloride channel 5 (CLCA5), and goblet cell gene 4 (GOB4) is consistent with enhanced production and alteration of mucus, whereas a 60- to 70-fold upregulation of transcripts for mast cell proteases 1 and 2 (MCPT-1 and -2) is consistent with intraepithelial mucosal mast cell recruitment. Importantly, there was novel expression of sialyltransferase 4C (SIAT4C), small proline-rich protein 2A (SPRR2A), and resistin-like molecule beta (RELMbeta) on day 14 postinfection. In contrast, DNase I and regenerating protein 3 (REG3) transcripts were substantially downregulated. Time course analyses revealed early (within 48 h of infection) induction of Siat4c, Sprr2A, and Relmbeta and later (within 120 h) induction of Mcpt-1 and -2. The findings demonstrate early innate responses and later inflammatory changes within the epithelium. The early epithelial responses may be associated both with repair (Sprr2A) and with the development of innate immunity (Siat4c and Relmbeta).
15534475,11,2004,J Glaucoma,Investigation of the association between OPA1 polymorphisms and normal-tension glaucoma in Korea.,PURPOSE: OPA1, the gene responsible for autosomal dominant optic atrophy, represents a good candidate gene for normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). Single nucleotide polymorphisms on intervening sequence (IVS) 8 of the OPA1 gene (IVS8+4C&gt;T; +32T&gt;C) were recently found to be strongly associated with NTG in a Caucasian population. We investigated whether these polymorphisms in the OPA1 gene were associated with NTG in Korea.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five Korean NTG patients and 101 healthy Korean subjects were enrolled. DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes was extracted and the genotypes of two polymorphisms (IVS8+4C&gt;T; +32T&gt;C) in the OPA1 gene were determined using the restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The genotype and allele frequencies of two polymorphism in patients with NTG and normal controls were compared using the Fisher exact test and the chi test. Frequencies of haplotypes and haplotypes groups were also analyzed to assess the combined effect of two polymorphisms.RESULTS: The frequencies of the CT genotype of IVS8+4C&gt;T, CC genotype of IVS8+32T&gt;C, and TT genotype of IVS8+32T&gt;C were not significantly different between NTG patients and controls (4.6% versus 0.0%, P = 0.058 by the Fisher exact test; 10.8% versus 4.0%, P = 0.11 by the Fisher exact test; 61.5% versus 67.3%, P = 0.45 by the chi test, respectively). Any haplotype or haplotype group of IVS8+4C&gt;T and IVS8+32T&gt;C was not associated with NTG, and the C allele of IVS8+32T&gt;C was not a significant modifier of IVS8+4C&gt;T.CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant associations between IVS8+4C&gt;T; +32T&gt;C polymorphisms and NTG in the Korean population. These results do not support the results in Caucasians and indicate that ethnic differences may exist in the association between polymorphisms in the OPA1 gene and NTG.
14761198,11,2004,J Med Chem,Formation of water-soluble pincer silver(I)-carbene complexes: a novel antimicrobial agent.,Silver(I)-2,6-bis(ethanolimidazolemethyl)pyridine hydroxide (4a) and silver(I)-2,6-bis(propanolimidazolemethyl)pyridine hydroxide (4b) are water-soluble silver(I)-carbene complexes that were synthesized in high yield by reacting silver(I) oxide with N-substituted pincer ligands 3 (a = 2,6-bis(ethanolimidazoliummethyl)pyridine diiodide, b = 2,6-bis(propanolimidazoliummethylpyridine)pyridine dibromide). The X-ray crystal structure of 4a is a one-dimensional linear polymer, whereas the mass spectroscopy confirms a monomer in the gas phase. A change in the anion of 4a from a hydroxide to a hexafluorophosphate formed a silver(I)-carbene complex 4c that is dimeric in structure and insoluble in water. The bactericidal activities of the water-soluble silver(I)-carbene complexes were found to be improved over that of silver nitrate.
15132835,10,2004,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Anticarcinogenic and antioxidant activity of diindolylmethane derivatives.,AIM: To investigate the synthesis methods and the bioactivity of diindolylmethane (DIM) derivatives.METHODS: 1) A 3D-Quantitative Structure-Active Relationships (QSAR) Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) study of 14 DIM derivatives was investigated to predict their anticarcinogenic activity. 2) Based on CoMFA model, a series of new derivatives of DIM were designed and synthesized. 3) Their free radical scavenging and antioxidant potentials were tested using in-vitro DPPH radical scavenging and ?-carotene antioxidant models. 4) The anticarcinogenic activities of some compounds were tested by using microculture tetrazolium assay (MTT) and sulforhodamine B (SRB) proteochromosomic assays.RESULTS: 1) The CoMFA model derived from DIM analogues proved a good predictive ability with q2 value of 0.827. 2) New designed compounds 3c and 4c exhibited 3-fold more potent radical scavenging activity than reference substance Vitamin E in DPPH model expressed by IC50 values. 3) The primary antitumor screening essay showed that some DIM derivatives designed exhibited the inhibitory activities to some tumor cell growth at relatively high concentration, and DIM was the most effective among them.CONCLUSION: DIM's 3D-QSAR model is reliable. According to it, eleven DIM derivatives were synthesized, and two derivatives of them possess potent radical scavenging activities and some showed the inhibitory activities in primary anticancer assay in vitro.
15375040,9,2004,J Dairy Sci,Prevalence of Salmonellae, Listeria monocytogenes, and fecal coliforms in bulk tank milk on US dairies.,The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, and fecal coliforms in bulk tank milk in the United States. As part of the NAHMS Dairy 2002 survey, 861 bulk tank milk samples were collected from farms in 21 states. Milk was directly plated on selective agars for direct bacterial enumeration and was enriched in selective broths to increase detection sensitivity. Somatic cell counts (SCC) and standard plate counts (SPC) were also determined. Coliforms were detected in 95% (818 of 860) of the samples, and the average SCC was 295,000 cells/mL. Twenty-two samples (2.6%) were culture-positive for Salmonella, and 9 serotypes were identified: Montevideo (n = 7), Newport (n = 4), Muenster (n = 2), Meleagridis (n = 2), Cerro (n = 2), 44:Z36 (Z38) (n = 2), Dublin (n = 1), Anatum (n = 1), and 9, 12:nonmo-tile (n = 1). Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from 56 (6.5%) samples, and serotyping of these isolates yielded 5 serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 3b, 4b, and 4c). Of the L. monocytogenes isolates, 93% were serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b, the most common human clinical isolates. Regional differences in L. monocytogenes and Salmonella prevalence were observed, but more studies are needed to determine the validity of these differences. There were no apparent relationships between SCC or SPC and incidence of Salmonella or L. monocytogenes. Although the prevalence of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella was low, these pathogens represent a potential risk to consumers of raw milk and raw milk products.
15337292,9,2004,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of some new 1-(5-phenylamino-[1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)methyl-5-oxo-[1,2,4]triazole and 1-(4-phenyl-5-thioxo-[1,2,4]triazol-3-yl)methyl-5-oxo- [1,2,4]triazole derivatives.,Acetic acid ethyl esters containing 5-oxo-[1,2,4]triazole ring (2) were synthesized by the condensation of compounds 1a-f with ethyl bromoacetate in basic media. The reaction of compounds 2a-f with hydrazine hydrate led to the formation of acid hydrazides (3a-f). The treatment of compounds 3 with two divers aromatic aldehydes resulted in the formation of arylidene hydrazides as cis-trans conformers (4a,c,e,f, 5a,e,f). The thiosemicarbazide derivatives (6a,c,d,f) were afforded by the reaction of corresponding compounds 3 with phenylisothiocyanate. The treatment of compounds 6a,c,d,f with sulfuric acidic caused the conversion of side-chain of compounds 6a,c,d,f into 1,3,4-thiadiazol ring; thus, compounds 7a,c,d,f were obtained. On the other hand, the cyclization of compounds 6a,c,d,f in the presence of 2 N NaOH resulted in the formation of compounds 8a,c,d,f containing two [1,2,4]triazole rings which are linked to each other via a methylene bridge. Compounds 4a, f, 5a, 7a, d, f, 8a and d have shown antimicrobial activity against one or more microorganism, but no antifungal activity has been observed against yeast like fungi. Also inhibitory effect on mycelial growth by compounds 4e, 7d and 8f has been observed. Compounds 4c and 5f were found to possess antitumor active towards breast cancer.
15205347,9,2004,Cancer Res,Infectivity-enhanced cyclooxygenase-2-based conditionally replicative adenoviruses for esophageal adenocarcinoma treatment.,The employment of conditionally replicative adenoviruses (CRAd) constitutes a promising alternative for cancer treatment; however, in the case of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) the lack of an appropriate tumor-specific promoter and relative resistance to adenovirus infection have hampered the construction of CRAds with clinically applicable specificity and efficacy. By combining transcriptional targeting with infectivity enhancement for CRAds, we generated novel cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) promoter-controlled replicative viral agents for the treatment of EAC. We used infectivity enhancement based on incorporation of an RGD-4C motif into the HI loop of the adenoviral (Ad) fiber knob domain as well as replacement of the Ad5 knob with the Ad3 knob. The Cox-2 promoter was highly active in EAC, whereas showing no significant activity in Cox-2-negative cell lines and primary cells isolated from normal mouse esophagus and stomach. Evaluation of infectivity-enhanced vectors revealed that the transduction and virus-cell binding ability of Ad5/Ad3-chimera were significantly more efficient than that of unmodified and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-modified vectors. All of the Cox-2 CRAds demonstrated replication and subsequent oncolysis in EAC cells but not in Cox-2-negative cells in vitro, thus confirming the dependence of their replication on the Cox-2 promoter activity. Ad5/Ad3 CRAds exhibited significantly improved oncolysis and progeny production compared with unmodified and RGD-modified vectors without sacrificing tumor selectivity. Whereas unmodified and RGD-modified CRAds showed insignificant therapeutic effect in vivo, Ad5/Ad3 CRAds remarkably suppressed tumor growth of established xenografts in mice. Thus, our studies have demonstrated that Ad5/Ad3-chimeric Cox-2 promoter-driven CRAds are selective and potent agents for the treatment of EAC.
15197787,9,2004,Int J Cancer,Evaluation of a selectively oncolytic adenovirus for local and systemic treatment of cervical cancer.,Treatment options for disseminated cervical cancer remain inadequate. Here, we investigated a strategy featuring Ad5-Delta 24 RGD, an oncolytic adenovirus replication-competent selectively in cells defective in the Rb-p16 pathway, such as most cervical cancer cells. The viral fiber contains an alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(v)beta(5) integrin-binding RGD-4C motif, allowing coxsackie-adenovirus receptor-independent infection. These integrins have been reported to be frequently upregulated in cervical cancer. Oncolysis of cervical cancer cells was similar to a wild-type control in vitro. In an animal model of cervical cancer, the therapeutic efficacy of Ad5-Delta 24 RGD could be demonstrated for both intratumoral and intravenous application routes. Biodistribution was determined following intravenous administration to mice. Further preclinical safety data were obtained by demonstrating lack of replication of the agent in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results suggest that Ad5-Delta 24 RGD could be useful for local or systemic treatment of cervical cancer in patients with disease resistant to currently available modalities.
14999227,9,2004,Gene Ther,A cyclooxygenase-2 promoter-based conditionally replicating adenovirus with enhanced infectivity for treatment of ovarian adenocarcinoma.,Conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRADs) take advantage of tumor-specific characteristics for preferential replication and subsequent oncolysis of cancer cells. The antitumor effect is determined by the capability to infect tumor cells. Here, we used RGDCRADcox-2R, which features the cyclooxygenase-2 promoter for replication control and an integrin binding RGD-4C motif for enhanced infectivity of ovarian cancer cells. RGDCRADcox-2R replicated in and killed human ovarian cancer cells effectively, while the replication in nonmalignant cells was low. Importantly, the therapeutic efficacy, as evaluated in an orthotopic model of peritoneally disseminated ovarian cancer, was significantly improved and toxicity was lower than with a wild-type virus. Thus, this CRAD could be tested for treatment of ovarian cancer in humans.
14734452,9,2004,Clin Cancer Res,Conditionally replicative adenovirus with tropism expanded towards integrins inhibits osteosarcoma tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.,PURPOSE: The clinical course of osteosarcoma (OS) demands the development of new therapeutic options. Conditionally replicative adenoviruses (CRAds) represent promising agents for the treatment of solid tumors, because CRAds have an intrinsic replication capacity that allows in situ amplification and extensive tumor infection through lateral spread. The CRAd AdDelta24 has been developed to replicate selectively in cells with a defective retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway. Because genetic alterations in the Rb pathway are frequently observed in OS, AdDelta24 might be useful in the treatment of this cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because the lack of Coxsackie adenovirus receptor on OS cells limits the efficacy of CRAd treatment, we explored alternative target molecules on OS. Insertion of an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD-4C) integrin-targeting motif into the adenovirus fiber knob expanded tropism toward the alpha(nu)beta(3) and alpha(nu)beta(5) integrins. The oncolytic capacity of the CRAd Ad5-Delta24RGD was tested on primary OS cells in vitro and in vivo.RESULTS: The alpha(nu)beta(3)and alpha(nu)beta(5) integrins are abundantly expressed on OS cells. RGD-mediated infection augmented adenovirus infection of primary OS cells by two orders of magnitude. Ad5-Delta24RGD was shown to be highly active in killing human OS cell lines, as well as primary cell cultures. Furthermore, intratumoral injections with Ad5-Delta24RGD into established human OS xenografts that were derived directly from a patient with OS refractory for chemotherapeutic treatment caused a significant tumor-growth delay. Furthermore, adenoviral particles could be detected in tumor cells 25 days posttumor injection.CONCLUSIONS: Targeting adenovirus toward integrins rendered OS cells more sensitive to killing by Ad5-Delta24RGD. These findings suggest that Ad5-Delta24RGD has potential for use in OS treatment.
15358290,8,2004,Bioorg Med Chem,Syntheses and evaluation of antioxidant activity of sydnonyl substituted thiazolidinone and thiazoline derivatives.,3-Aryl-4-formylsydnone 4'-phenylthiosemicarbazones (3a-d) and 3-aryl-4-formylsydnone thiosemicarbazones (3e-h), which are precursors of 3-aryl-4-heterocyclic sydnones, are prepared by the condensation of 3-aryl-4-formylsydnones (1a-d) with 4'-phenylthiosemicarbazide (2a) and thiosemicarbazide (2b), respectively. The thiosemicarbazones 3 reacted with cyclic reagents such as ethyl chloroacetate (4a), ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate (4b) and 2-bromoacetophenone (4c) to produce heterocyclic substituted sydnone derivatives 5-7 that possess 4-oxo-thiazolidine and thiazoline groups. The antioxidant activity of synthesized compounds 5a-7h was evaluated. Among these compounds, 4-methyl-2-[(3-arylsydnon-4-yl-methylene)hydrazono]-2,3-dihydro-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (6e-h) and 4-phenyl-2-[(3-arylsydnon-4-yl-methylene)hydrazono]-2,3-dihydro-thiazoles (7e-h) exhibit the potent DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity, comparable to that of vitamin E.
15271896,8,2004,Infect Immun,Sequence and binding activity of the autolysin-adhesin Ami from epidemic Listeria monocytogenes 4b.,Ami is an autolytic amidase from Listeria monocytogenes that is targeted to the bacterial surface via its C-terminal cell wall anchoring (CWA) domain. We recently showed that the CWA domain from Ami of L. monocytogenes EGD (serovar 1/2a) (Ami 1/2a) mediated bacterial binding to mammalian cells. Here we studied the sequence and binding properties of Ami from CHUT 82337 (serovar 4b) (Ami 4b). The Ami 4b polypeptide is predicted to be 770 amino acids long (compared with the 917 amino acids of Ami 1/2a from EGD). Ami 1/2a and Ami 4b are almost identical in the N-terminal enzymatic domain (approximately 98% amino acid identity), but the sequence is poorly conserved in the C-terminal CWA domain, with only approximately 54% amino acid identity and eight GW modules in Ami 1/2a compared with six GW modules in Ami 4b. The purified Ami 4b CWA domain efficiently bound serovar 4b bacterial cells and only poorly bound serovar 1/2a bacterial cells. The Ami 4b CWA domain was also significantly less able to bind Hep-G2 human hepatocytic cells than the Ami 1/2a CWA domain. We sequenced the ami regions encoding CWA domains of reference strains belonging to the 12 L. monocytogenes serovars. The phylogenic tree constructed from the sequences yielded a binary division into group I (serovars 1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c, 3a, 3b, 3c, and 7) and group II (serovars 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, and 4e). This is the first direct evidence of divergence between serovars 1/2a and 4b in a gene involved in the adhesion of L. monocytogenes to mammalian cells, as well as the first demonstration of allelic polymorphism correlated with the somatic antigen in this species.
15252055,8,2004,J Biol Chem,Individual nucleotide bases, not base pairs, are critical for triggering site-specific DNA cleavage by vaccinia topoisomerase.,Vaccinia DNA topoisomerase forms a covalent DNA-(3'-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate at a specific target site 5'-C(+5)C(+4)C(+3)T(+2)T(+1)p downward arrow N(-1) in duplex DNA. Here we study the effects of abasic lesions at individual positions of the scissile and nonscissile strands on the rate of single-turnover DNA transesterification and the cleavage-religation equilibrium. The rate of DNA incision was reduced by factors of 350, 250, 60, and 10 when abasic sites replaced the -1N, +1T, +2T, and +4C bases of the scissile strand, but abasic lesions at +5C and +3C had little or no effect. Abasic lesions in the nonscissile strand in lieu of +4G, +3G, +2A, and +1A reduced the rate of cleavage by factors of 130, 150, 10, and 5, whereas abasic lesions at +5G and -1N had no effect. The striking positional asymmetry of abasic interference on the scissile and nonscissile strands highlights the importance of individual bases, not base pairs, in promoting DNA cleavage. The rate of single-turnover DNA religation by the covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex was insensitive to abasic sites within the CCCTT sequence of the scissile strand, but an abasic lesion at the 5'-OH nucleoside (-1N) of the attacking DNA strand slowed the rate of religation by a factor of 600. Nonscissile strand abasic lesions at +1A and -1N slowed the rate of religation by factors of approximately 140 and 20, respectively, and strongly skewed the cleavage-religation equilibrium toward the covalent complex. Thus, abasic lesions immediately flanking the cleavage site act as topoisomerase poisons.
15178651,8,2004,Clin Chem,Identification of CYP2B6 sequence variants by use of multiplex PCR with allele-specific genotyping.,BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) has a role in the metabolism of many clinically important substances, but the variation within the CYP2B6 gene has not been fully characterized. The aim of the present study was to develop a reliable and robust assay for determining genotypic variants.METHODS: We used a two-stage procedure. An initial multiplex PCR reaction amplified the relevant gene fragments in exonic and regulatory regions to ensure isolation of CYP2B6 from its similar pseudogene (CYP2B7). This product was then genotyped by allele-specific PCR.RESULTS: The assay detected the following published single-nucleotide polymorphisms: C64T (Arg22Cys), C78T, G216C, G516T (Gln172His), C777A (Ser259Arg), A785G (Lys262Arg), and C1459T (Arg487Cys), as well as additional loci found within the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) databases: A1190G, C1268A, C1330T, A1382G, A1402T, and an A/T SNP in intron 2 (A12917T). This approach detected all common, previously reported alleles and identified a new allele (CYP2B6*4C) present in 2.2% of a Caucasian population. Genotypic frequencies obtained were consistent with previously published results.CONCLUSIONS: This method is simple, reliable, rapid, and amenable to automation and could facilitate the large-scale genotypic analysis of CYP2B6.
15134547,8,2004,Curr Top Med Chem,HIV co-receptors as targets for antiviral therapy.,The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 are used as the main co-receptors by the T-cell-tropic (CXCR4-dependent, X4) and macrophage-tropic (CCR5-dependent, R5) HIV-1 strains, respectively, for entering their target cells. The natural ligands for CXCR4, the CXC-chemokine SDF-1 and CCR5, the CC-chemokines RANTES, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta are described to inhibit viral entry. In this review we focus on chemokine receptor/HIV co-receptor inhibitors. Modified chemokines such as Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES showed antiviral activity against R5 viruses. Several low-molecular weight CCR5 antagonists have been described (such as TAK-779 and SCH-C) with potent antiviral activity. The latter compound is also orally available and is able to decrease R5 viral load levels in HIV-infected subjects. Several peptidic compounds, such as T22 (an 18-mer), T134 (a 14-mer), ALX40-4C (a 9-mer) and CGP 64222 (also a 9-mer) have anti-HIV activity and have been identified as CXCR4 antagonists. Also, the HIV-1 Tat protein has been described as a &quot;natural&quot; CXCR4 antagonist with anti-HIV-1 activity. The most potent and specific CXCR4 antagonists are the bicyclam derivatives, which also potently inhibit X4 HIV replication. AMD3100 has proved to be a highly specific CXCR4 antagonist, which consistently blocks X4 viral replication in any target cell-type evaluated so far. AMD3100 was selected as the clinical drug candidate, which, after initial phase I (safety) studies, had proceeded to phase II (efficacy) trials. The compound dose-dependently inhibited X4 viruses after 10 days of continuous infusion of the drug. Recently, the orally bioavailable CXCR4 antagonist, AMD070, is presented as a candidate HIV drug. We believe that chemokine receptor antagonists will become important new antiviral drugs to combat AIDS. Both (CXCR4 and CCR5) chemokine receptor inhibitors will be needed in combination to inhibit viral replication and even in combinations of antiviral drugs that also target other aspects of the HIV replication cycle, such as reverse transcriptase and protease, to obtain optimum therapeutic effects.
15104448,8,2004,J Org Chem,Epoxide-initiated cationic cyclization of azides: a novel method for the stereoselective construction of 5-hydroxymethyl azabicyclic compounds and application in the stereo- and enantioselective total synthesis of (+)- and (-)-indolizidine 167B and 209D.,A novel and general method has been developed for the stereoselective construction of 5-hydroxymethyl azabicyclic ring skeletons based on epoxide-initiated cationic cyclization of azides. The key cyclization reaction was systematically studied with the model compound, 3-(1-oxa-spiro[2.4]hept-4-yl)propyl azide 3a, and EtAlCl(2) was found to be an ideal choice as the catalyst. The generality of this transformation was further tested with different ring sizes, where six- and seven-membered epoxyazides 3b,c underwent smooth cyclization to give 5-hydroxymethyl azepine 4b and 5-hydroxymethyl azocine 4c, respectively, as a single detectable diastereomer. This novel methodology was elegantly applied in the stereoselective total synthesis of indolizidine alkaloids 167B and 209D. Further, the enantioselective total synthesis of natural and unnatural indolizidine alkaloids 167B and 209D was accomplished by using Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation as a key step.
15051218,8,2004,Ophthalmology,Metastatic pattern and survival in disseminated conjunctival melanoma: implications for sentinel lymph node biopsy.,PURPOSE: To study the pattern of metastasis and overall survival in patients with disseminated conjunctival melanoma.DESIGN: Population-based, retrospective cross-sectional study.PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-five Caucasian patients with primary malignant conjunctival melanoma diagnosed between 1967 and 2000.METHODS: Data were collected from the Finnish Cancer and Population Registries and all involved hospitals. The pattern (regional or systemic) and site of first metastasis were recorded. The time to first metastasis and survival by pattern were estimated by cumulative incidence analysis, which takes competing risks into account, and by Kaplan-Meier analysis, respectively.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Metastatic pattern, time to metastasis by pattern, overall survival.RESULTS: In 45% (95% confidence interval, 23%-68%) of 20 patients with metastasis, regional lymph node metastases were detected before systemic ones. Median times to initial regional and systemic metastasis were 2.3 and 3.4 years, respectively, and the median time from regional to systemic metastasis, 1.0 year. The 10-year cumulative incidence of initial regional metastasis was 0.11, and it tended to be higher for tumors more than 2 mm thick (0.18 vs. 0.05, P = 0.062). The corresponding incidence of initial systemic metastasis was 0.18, and it was higher for nonlimbal tumors (0.38 vs. 0.07, P = 0.00023) and for tumors more than 2 mm thick (0.28 vs. 0.06, P = 0.026). Overall survival was longer after initial regional metastasis than after systemic metastasis (30 vs. 8 months, P = 0.012).CONCLUSION: Initial regional lymph node metastasis was as common as systemic metastasis, but initial lymph node metastasis was associated with better prognosis. Metastasis, especially initial regional lymph node metastasis, from limbal tumors and tumors less than 2 mm thick was rare. These patients may have less benefit from sentinel lymph node biopsy, a method that is currently under evaluation regarding its potential to improve survival.
14736256,8,2004,J Med Chem,Anti-AIDS agents. 52. Synthesis and anti-HIV activity of hydroxymethyl (3'R,4'R)-3',4'-di-O-(S)-camphanoyl-(+)-cis-khellactone derivatives.,To enhance the water solubility and oral bioavailability of DCK analogues, 12 new mono- and disubstituted (3'R,4'R)-3',4'-di-O-(S)-camphanoyl-(+)-cis-khellactone (DCK) analogues were synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of HIV-1 replication in H9 lymphocytes. 3-Hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-DCK (4c) exhibited significant anti-HIV activity in H9 lymphocytes and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells with EC(50) values of 0.004 and 0.024 microM, respectively. Although this compound was not as potent as 4-methyl-DCK (2) and 3-bromomethyl-4-methyl-DCK (4a), it provides increased water solubility and possible linkage to other moieties. Of particular note, 4c exhibits moderate oral bioavailability (15%) when administered as a carboxymethylcellulose suspension to rats, whereas 2 is not orally bioavailable in the same formulation. Further studies on mechanism of action suggest that 4c inhibits the production of double-stranded viral DNA from the single-stranded DNA intermediate. In addition, 4a is the most potent compound in this series of new analogues, with EC(50) and TI values of 0.00011 microM and 189,600, respectively. Thus, further modification at the 3-position of the coumarin ring can improve the potency of new DCK analogues.
15537348,7,2004,J Med Chem,Synthesis of C2-C3'N-linked macrocyclic taxoids. Novel docetaxel analogues with high tubulin activity.,Novel C2-C3'N-linked macrocyclic taxoids 4 bearing an aromatic ring at position C2 were synthesized. These compounds, tethered between N3' and the C2-aromatic ring at the ortho, meta, or para position, were constructed by ring-closing metathesis. The para-substituted derivatives were unable to stabilize microtubules, whereas the ortho- and meta-substituted compounds show significant activity in cold-induced microtubule disassembly assay. The meta derivative 4c is the first C2-C3'-linked cyclic analogue to be equipotent to paclitaxel in this assay and to show significant cytotoxicity. Computational studies of the conformational behavior of these compounds indicate that they can adopt several conformations including mainly the &quot;T-shaped&quot; forms. Docking experiments have shown that the &quot;T-shaped&quot; form is preferred for a good interaction of these compounds with the beta-tubulin binding pocket.
15509223,7,2004,Evol Dev,Conservation and divergence of BMP2/4 genes in the lamprey: expression and phylogenetic analysis suggest a single ancestral vertebrate gene.,Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) molecules are members of a large family of signaling molecules important in numerous developmental pathways throughout the metazoa. Single members of the BMP2/4 class have been found in invertebrates such as cnidarians, arthropods, nematodes, echinoderms, ascidians, and cephalochordates. In all vertebrates studied, there are at least two copies, BMP2 and BMP4, that play important roles in axial patterning, tissue specification, and organogenesis. The basal vertebrate, lamprey, diverged near the time of vertebrate origins and is useful for understanding the gene duplication events that led to the increased complexity of the vertebrate genome. We characterized the sequence and expression pattern of BMP2/4 class genes in the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus. We uncovered three genes that we named PmBMP2/4A, PmBMP2/4B, and PmBMP2/4C. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that PmBMP2/4A is closer than PmBMP2/4B or PmBMP2/4C in sequence identity to both BMP2 and BMP4 of gnathostomes. The developmental expression pattern of PmBMP2/4A also more closely resembles the combined early expression patterns of gnathostome BMP2 and BMP4, whereas PmBMP2/4B and PmBMP2/4C appear to play roles only later in development. Cell labeling showed that the BMP-expressing cells in the branchial arches of lampreys are of neural crest origin. Taken together, our sequence and expression data support the duplication of BMP2/4 genes in the lamprey from a single ancestral vertebrate BMP2/4 gene.
15464620,7,2004,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis of some new 5-(2-substituted-1,3-thiazol-5-yl)-2-hydroxy benzamides and their 2-alkoxy derivatives as possible antifungal agents.,The 2-hydroxy-5-(1,3-thiazol-5-yl) benzamide (4a), 5-(2-amino-1, 3-thiazol-5-yl)-2-hydroxy benzamide (4b), 2-hydroxy-5-(2-alkyl-1,3-Thiazol-5-yl) benzamide (4c and 4d), 5-(2-[(N-substituted aryl)amino]-1,3-thiazol-5-yl)2-hydroxy benzamides (6a-j) were prepared by reacting 5-(bromoacetyl) salicylamide (2) with thiourea, thioformamide, thioalkylamide (3c-d) and substituted thioureas (5a-j) in absolute ethanol. These compounds were converted to 5-(2-substituted-1,3-thiazol-5-yl)-2-alkoxybenzamides and 5-(2-N-(substituted aryl)-1,3-thiazol-5-yl)-2-alkoxy benzamides (8a-g) by reacting with n-alkylbromides (7a-b) in presence of a base. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR and mass spectral data. Compounds were also screened for their antifungal activity.
15382081,7,2004,Int J Cancer,Treatment of aggressive thyroid cancer with an oncolytic herpes virus.,Although many thyroid cancers carry a favorable prognosis, there is a subgroup of patients with more aggressive histologies. Current therapies offer no significant survival benefit to patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, which are considered fatal. Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) have potent antitumor effects against a variety of human malignancies. We assessed the activity of a replication-competent, attenuated, oncolytic HSV (NV1023) against 7 different thyroid cancers, including one papillary (NPA-187), one follicular (WRO82-1), one medullary (DRO81-1) and 4 anaplastic (DRO90-1, ARO, KAT-4C and KAT-18) cell lines. Only the follicular WRO82-1 line was resistant to NV1023 infection and cell lysis at a concentration of 5 viral pfu per cell (MOI 5). All other cell lines at MOI 5 demonstrated &gt;95% infection in vitro at day 2 by X-gal staining and &gt;88% cell death at day 4 by cytotoxicity assays. Even at MOI 0.1, 4 of these lines displayed complete cell death by day 7. Viral proliferation assays revealed that all of the nonfollicular cell lines supported logarithmic viral replication. Flank tumors of NPA-187, DRO81-1, DRO90-1 and ARO in athymic nude mice were treated with NV1023 (2 x 10(7) pfu). All NPA-187 tumors completely regressed following a single dose. DRO81-1 tumors demonstrated partial response with a single dose and significant improvement with 3 serial doses. ARO and DRO90-1 tumors showed a significant response following either single injection (54 +/- 22 and 292 +/- 138 mm3, respectively) or 3 serial injections (33 +/- 14 and 241 +/- 68 mm3, respectively) compared to saline injections (472 +/- 193 and 1,257 +/- 204 mm3, respectively) at day 20. These data suggest that herpes oncolytic therapy may be effective for the treatment of aggressive thyroid carcinomas and merits further investigation.
15316711,7,2004,Psychopharmacology (Berl),Benzodiazepines and heightened aggressive behavior in rats: reduction by GABA(A)/alpha(1) receptor antagonists.,RATIONALE: Positive modulators of the benzodiazepine/GABA(A) receptor complex can heighten aggressive behavior; the GABA(A)/alpha(1) subunit may play a critical role in benzodiazepine-modulated aggressive behavior.OBJECTIVE: The carboline derivatives, beta-CCt and 3-PBC, antagonists with preferential action at the GABA(A) receptors with alpha(1) subunits, may antagonize benzodiazepine-heightened aggression, thus implicating the alpha(1) subunit in heightened aggression.METHODS: The GABA(A) receptor agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4c]-pyridin-3-ol (THIP) (0.01-3.0 mg/kg), and the benzodiazepine receptor agonists midazolam (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) and triazolam (0.003-3.0 mg/kg) were administered to adult male resident rats to assess the drugs' effects on their aggressive behavior toward an intruder. Then beta-CCt (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) and 3-PBC (0.3-17.0 mg/kg) were each administered in conjunction with midazolam. The salient elements of aggressive and non-aggressive behavior were measured by analyzing video recordings and encoding each behavioral act and posture in terms of its frequency and duration of occurrence.RESULTS: Midazolam significantly increased the duration of aggressive behaviors at 1.0 and 1.7 mg/kg, and triazolam increased attack bite frequency at 0.03 mg/kg, both implicating GABA(A) receptors with benzodiazepine binding sites in aggressive behavior. In the present dose range, THIP did not affect any behaviors. The broad-spectrum benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg), antagonized the aggression-heightening effects of midazolam. beta-CCt (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) and 3-PBC (0.3-17.0 mg/kg) also antagonized the aggression-heightening effects of midazolam (1.0 mg/kg).CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate both the GABA(A) gamma and alpha(1) subunits in benzodiazepine-heightened aggression.
15254417,7,2004,Cell Cycle,Paclitaxel induces primary and postmitotic G1 arrest in human arterial smooth muscle cells.,Paclitaxel (PTX), a microtubule-active drug, causes mitotic arrest leading to apoptosis in certain tumor cell lines. Here we investigated the effects of PTX on human arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) cells. In SMC, PTX caused both (a) primary arrest in G(1) and (b) post-mitotic arrest in G(1). Post-mitotic cells were multinucleated (MN) with either 2C (near-diploid) or 4C (tetraploid) DNA content. At PTX concentrations above 12 ng/ml, MN cells had 4C DNA content consistent with the lack of cytokinesis during abortive mitosis. Treatment with 6-12 ng/ml PTX yielded MN cells with 2C DNA content. Finally, 1-6 ng/ml of PTX, the lowest concentrations that affected cell proliferation, caused G(1) arrest without multinucleation. It is important that PTX did not cause apoptosis in SMC. The absence of apoptosis could be explained by mitotic exit and G(1) arrest as well as by low constitutive levels of caspase expression and by p53 and p21 induction. Thus, following transient mitotic arrest, SMC exit mitosis to form MN cells. These post-mitotic cells were subsequently arrested in G(1) but maintained normal elongated morphology and were viable for at least 21 days. We conclude that in SMC PTX causes post-mitotic cell cycle arrest rather than cell death.
15149189,7,2004,Bioconjug Chem,Biotin reagents in antibody pretargeting. 6. Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of astatinated and radioiodinated aryl- and nido-carboranyl-biotin derivatives.,An investigation has been conducted to prepare and evaluate several radiohalogenated biotin derivatives as part of our studies to develop reagents for carrying (211)At in cancer pretargeting protocols. The primary goal of the investigation was to determine the in vivo stability and distribution properties of astatinated biotin derivatives. In addition to astatination, the biotin derivatives were radioiodinated for in vitro and in vivo comparison. Biodistributions were conducted in athymic mice, with sacrifice times of 1, 4, and 24 h to correspond to 9%, 32%, and 90% of (211)At decay (t(1/2) = 7.21 h). In the investigation, two biotin derivatives, 1a and 2a, were synthesized which had structures that contain a biotin moiety, a biotinidase-blocking moiety, an ether linker moiety, and an aryl stannane moiety for radiohalogenation. Biotin derivatives 1a and 2a were radiolabeled with (125/131)I to give [(125)/(131)I]1b or [(125)I]2b and with (211)At to give [(211)At]1c or [(211)At]2c. In vivo studies demonstrated that co-injected [(125)I]2b and [(131)I]1b had very similar tissue distributions in athymic mice. Co-injection of [(211)At]2c and [(125)I]2b provided data that indicated that rapid deastatination occurred in vivo. A second set of biotin derivatives, 3a, 4a, and 5a, were synthesized which had structures that contain a biotin moiety, a biotinidase-blocking moiety, and an anionic nido-carborane moiety for radiohalogenation. The biotin derivatives 4a and 5a contained an aryl moiety not present in 3a, and 5a had a trialkylamine functionality not present in 3a or 4a. Biotin derivative 3a was radioiodinated, but was not further investigated. Biotin derivatives 4a and 5a were radiolabeled with (211)At and (125)I to produce [(125)I]4b/[(211)At]4c and [(125)I]5b/[(211)At]5c. Comparison of [(125)I]4b and (separately) [(125)I]5b with [(131)I]1b showed that the nido-carborane containing biotin derivatives were retained in blood and tissue more than the aryl iodide derivative. In vivo evaluations of [(211)At]4c/[(125)I]4b and (separately) [(211)At]5c/[(125)I]5b indicated that some deastatination occurred in these compounds, but it was much less than observed for the aryl derivative [(211)At]2c. While the nido-carborane containing biotin derivatives provide a significant improvement in astatine stability over biotin derivatives previously studied, additional derivatives need to be prepared and studied to further improve the in vivo stability and blood/tissue clearance of these compounds.
15064592,7,2004,Med Sci Sports Exerc,Minimum weight prediction methods cross-validated by the four-component model.,The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) requires prediction of minimum weight (MW) for collegiate wrestlers. The rule was implemented to minimize unhealthy weight loss practices and requires assessment of body composition before the competitive season.</AbstractText>: The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) requires prediction of minimum weight (MW) for collegiate wrestlers. The rule was implemented to minimize unhealthy weight loss practices and requires assessment of body composition before the competitive season.PURPOSE: This study cross-validated the body composition methods of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), hydrostatic weighing (HW), and skinfolds (SF) for predicting MW using a four-component criterion (4C).METHODS: Criterion MW was calculated by the 4C model using independent measurement of body density (BD), bone mineral content (BMC), and total body water (TBW). Subjects were 53 Division I athletes from the University of Wisconsin (mean +/- SD; age = 19.7 +/- 1.3 yr, height = 176.2 +/- 7.4 cm, weight = 75.6 +/- 8.9 kg). Accuracy, precision, and systematic bias were examined in the predictions.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mean MW from HW (70.5 +/- 7.3 kg, P = 0.57), SF (70.5 +/- 7.2 kg, P = 0.29) BIA (70.6 +/- 7.6 kg, P = 0.39), DXA (70.3 +/- 7.5, P = 0.97), and the 4C criterion (70.3 +/- 7.4 kg). The regression for the relationships between 4C and HW (y = 0.994 x HW + 0.077 kg), 4C and SF (y = 1.003 x SF-0.437 kg), 4C and DXA (y = 0.942 x DXA + 4.034 kg), and 4C and BIA (y = 0.896 x BIA + 6.987 kg) did not significantly deviate from the line of identity. Pure error (PE) values ranged from 1.34 kg for HW to 3.08 kg for BIA.CONCLUSION: Comparable means, high correlations, regression lines that did not significantly deviate from the line of identity, and no systematic bias were found. However, the methods differed widely in precision. The best precision, based on SEE and PE values, were seen in the HW and SF methods. In conclusion, this rigorous four-component cross-validation study supports the NCAA methods as the most accurate and precise MW prediction methods in this sample.
15498513,6,2004,Biochem Pharmacol,Differential type 4 cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE4) expression and functional sensitivity to PDE4 inhibitors among rats, monkeys and humans.,It has been suggested that the rat is relatively more susceptible to toxicity induced by inhibitors for type 4 cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE4). In this study designed to elucidate possible biochemical basis for the higher susceptibility, we compared PDE4 expression levels and their functional relevance among rats, monkeys and humans. In several toxicologically relevant tissues and blood leukocytes, the mRNA expression levels of PDEs 4A, 4B, 4C and 4D were significantly higher in rats than in humans. We confirmed that higher PDE4 expression levels were correlated with a higher enzyme activity level in rat leukocytes. The PDE4 enzyme activity level of leukocytes in monkeys fell between that of rats and humans. Functionally, the potencies of the PDE4 inhibitors rolipram, SB 207499 and SCH 351591 in inhibiting tumor necrosis factor production from leukocytes were in the following order: rat &gt; monkey &gt; human. In addition, rolipram was about 10-fold more potent in rats than in humans in inhibiting phenylephrine-induced contraction of renal artery. These inhibitors were confirmed to be highly selective for PDE4 in comparison to all other PDE families, and to inhibit rat and human PDE4s with identical potencies. Taken together, these results suggest that the higher susceptibility of rats to PDE4 inhibitor-induced toxicity might be due to their higher expression levels of PDE4, and that PDE4 inhibitors may be safer in humans than in monkeys and, particularly, rats.
15297510,6,2004,J Clin Microbiol,New genome type of adenovirus serotype 4 caused nosocomial infections associated with epidemic conjunctivitis in Japan.,Human adenovirus type 4 is one of the major serotypes isolated from patients with adenoviral conjunctivitis. In 2001 we encountered nosocomial infections with epidemic conjunctivitis in the ophthalmology ward of one hospital in Sapporo, which is in the northern part of Japan. Adenoviruses were isolated from the patients with this nosocomial infection and identified as adenovirus type 4 (AdV-4) by a neutralization test with serotype-specific antiserum. When the cleavage patterns of the isolates were compared with the full viral genome with BamHI and SmaI, the cleavage patterns of the isolates were shown to be different from those of AdV-4p and other previously known AdV-4 variants. The nucleotide sequences of the fiber gene of the isolates showed the highest homologies (94.3%) with AdV-4 among the nucleotide sequences available from GenBank and formed a monophyletic cluster along with the prototype strain of AdV-4. The isolates, however, were located in a different lineage from those of AdV-4p and the AdV-4 variant from the sporadic infections. We conclude that the nosocomial infection that appeared in 2001 was caused by a new genome type of AdV-4, which was designated AdV-4c.
14871112,6,2004,J Am Chem Soc,Iridium bis(phosphinite) p-XPCP pincer complexes: highly active catalysts for the transfer dehydrogenation of alkanes.,A series of new bis(phosphinite) p-XPCPIrHCl pincer complexes ([PCP = eta(3)-5-X-C(6)H(2)[OP(tBu)(2)](2)-1,3], X = MeO (4a), Me (4b), H (4c), F (4d), C(6)F(5) (4e), and Ar(F) [=3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] (4f)) have been synthesized. Treatment of compounds 4a-f with NatOBu in cyclooctane (COA)/tert-butylethylene (TBE) mixtures generates species with unprecedented catalytic activity for the catalyzed transfer dehydrogenation of COA with TBE as acceptor to form cyclooctene (COE) and tert-butylethane (TBA). With substrate:precatalyst ratios of 3030COA:3030TBE:1p-XPCPIrHCl (4):1.1NaOtBu, turnover numbers (TONs) between 1400 and 2200 (up to 72% conversion in TBE) and initial turnover frequencies (TOFs) between 1.6 and 2.4 s(-1) have been observed at 200 degrees C.
15612811,5,2004,J Agric Food Chem,Hydrolysis of nitriles using an immobilized nitrilase: applications to the synthesis of methionine hydroxy analogue derivatives.,Mild and selective hydrolysis of a large range of nitriles leading to carboxylic acids was achieved under neutral conditions by an immobilized and genetically modified enzyme preparation from Alcaligenes faecalis ATCC8750. This immobilized nitrilase has been shown to be an effective catalyst for the stereoselective hydrolysis of mandelonitrile 1a to R-(-)-mandelic acid 1c. This method is particularly useful for the production of hydroxy analogues of methionine derivatives 2c-4c that could have an interest in cattle feeding and for the transformation of compounds containing other acid- or base-sensitive groups 3a-10a. A series of aliphatic dinitriles 11a-15a was hydrolyzed to the corresponding cyano acids. The suitability of the immobilized catalyst as a robust and versatile biocatalyst is discussed, and models to account for the stereoselectivity of the enzymic hydrolysis have been proposed.
15375578,5,2004,Int J Mol Med,Tumor targeting by doxorubicin-RGD-4C peptide conjugate in an orthotopic mouse hepatoma model.,Vascular targeting is a novel strategy that directs endothelial toxins at tumor vessels expressing specific markers and kills tumor cells by vascular occlusion. Integrin-binding RGD motif has been reported to have a homing property to experimental tumor vasculature. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of vascular targeting by doxorubicin-RGD-4C conjugate in an orthotopic murine hepatoma model. MTT assay showed that dox-RGD-4C conjugates had lower cytotoxicity against MH134 mouse hepatoma cells than free dox. When given intravenously to mice with implanted orthotopic hepatoma, however, the dox-RGD-4C suppressed the growth of hepatoma more effectively than free dox (mean tumor volumes 24 mm(3) vs. 67 mm(3), respectively; p=0.047). Histologic analysis of the hepatoma tissue revealed prominent tumor cell death in the dox-RGD-4C treated group and complete tumor cell necrosis in 40% of cases. Immunochemical staining showed expression of integrin alphav mainly around the tumor nodule. These results show that dox-RGD-4C conjugate has a better antitumor effect in an orthotopic mouse hepatoma model by tumor targeting. Integrin alphav of hepatoma feeding vessels is suggested to be targeted by the dox-RGD-4C conjugate.
15247715,5,2004,J Urol,Kruppel-like factor 6 germ-line mutations are infrequent in Finnish hereditary prostate cancer.,PURPOSE: Recently, Kruppel-like factor 6 gene (KLF6) has been shown to be inactivated in up to 77% of prostate carcinomas. KLF6 has an important role in regulating cell growth and differentiation. The function and high mutation frequency in sporadic prostate carcinomas make KLF6 an attractive candidate for prostate cancer predisposition and, therefore, DNA samples from 69 Finnish prostate cancer families were analyzed for KLF6 mutations.MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA samples from 69 Finnish prostate cancer families were screened for mutations in the KLF6 gene using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and confirmatory sequencing.RESULTS: In 8 (11.6%) families single-strand conformation polymorphism shifts were present. Sequencing revealed 6 201G&gt;A (R201R) polymorphisms, as well as a -4C&gt;A and a 956T&gt;C alteration in the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions, respectively. Nonsense or missense mutations were not found.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that KLF6 germ-line mutations are of marginal importance in prostate cancer predisposition in Finland.
15239652,5,2004,J Med Chem,Structure-based design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship studies of novel non-nucleoside adenosine deaminase inhibitors.,We disclose herein optimization efforts around the novel, highly potent non-nucleoside adenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibitor, 1-[(R)-1-hydroxy-4-(6-(3-(1-methylbenzimidazol-2-yl)propionylamino)indol-1-yl)-2-butyl]imidazole-4-carboxamide 1 (K(i)= 7.7 nM), which we recently reported. Structure-based drug design (SBDD) utilizing the crystal structure of the 1/ADA complex was performed in order to obtain structure-activity relationships (SAR) for this type of compound rationally and effectively. To utilize the newly formed hydrophobic space (F2), replacement of the benzimidazole ring of 1 with a n-propyl chain (4b) or a simple phenyl ring (4c) was tolerated in terms of binding activity, and the length of the methylene-spacer was shown to be optimal at two or three. Replacement of an amide with an ether as a linker was also well tolerated in terms of binding activity and moreover improved the oral absorption (6a and 6b). Finally, transformation of indol-1-yl to indol-3-yl resulted in discovery of a novel highly potent and orally bioavailable ADA inhibitor, 1-[(R)-4-(5-(3-(4-chlorophenyl)propoxy)-1-methylindol-3-yl)-1-hydroxy-2-butyl]imidazole-4-carboxamide 8c.
15178875,5,2004,Acta Crystallogr C,Hydrogen-bonding adducts of benzenepolycarboxylic acids with N,N-dimethylformamide: benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid N,N-dimethylformamide disolvate, benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid N,N-dimethylformamide tetrasolvate and benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid N,N-dimethylformamide disolvate monohydrate.,The N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvates of terephthalic acid, H(2)TA.2DMF (C(8)H(6)O(6).2C(3)H(7)NO), pyromellitic acid, H(4)PMA.4DMF (C(10)H(6)O(8).4C(3)H(7)NO), and hemimellitic acid, H(3)HMA.2DMF.H(2)O (C(9)H(6)O(6).2C(3)H(7)NO.H(2)O), are reported. The DMF solvate of terephthalic acid is centrosymmetric, containing one complete formula unit in the asymmetric unit. Both carboxylic acid groups hydrogen bond to a DMF molecule via an R(2)(2)(7) O-H.O/C-H.O motif. Discrete H(2)TA.2DMF units are observed. The DMF solvate of pyromellitic acid is centrosymmetric and the asymmetric unit contains half a formula unit. One of the unique carboxylic acid groups forms an R(2)(2)(7) motif with a DMF molecule, while the other forms a linear O-H.O hydrogen bond to the second unique DMF molecule. Discrete H(4)PMA.4DMF units are observed. The DMF solvate of hemimellitic acid is non-centrosymmetric and includes a molecule of water per formula unit. Both DMF molecules form an R(2)(2)(7) motif with the two outer carboxylic acid groups of HMA. A one-dimensional ladder structure is formed via hydrogen bonding between the central carboxylic acid group and the water molecules. The carboxylic acid R(2)(2)(8) head-to-tail motif is not observed in any of these examples. The inclusion of DMF thereby has the effect of limiting the dimensionality of the structures.
15128260,5,2004,Org Lett,Catalyst and ring size effects on periselectivity of oxonium ylide rearrangements.,Diazoketones were subjected to carbene-transfer with Rh(II) or Cu(II) catalysts to probe the selectivity for rearrangement via five- or six-membered oxonium ylides. 4,5-Bis(benzyloxy) and 4-allyloxy-5-benzyloxy substrates 3a,b showed a large preference for rearrangement via the five-membered ylide under all conditions. However, a sharp divergence was seen with 5-allyloxy-4-benzyloxy substrate 3c, which underwent predominantly a [2,3]-shift to pyran 5c via the six-membered ylide with Cu(II) catalysis and a [1,2]-shift to furan 4c via the five-membered ylide with Rh(II) catalysis.
15125934,5,2004,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,2,4-Bis(octadecanoylamino)benzenesulfonic acid sodium salt as a novel scavenger receptor inhibitor with low molecular weight.,In order to investigate the effect of the fixation of the orientations of the two long chains, three types of novel derivatives of scavenger receptor inhibitor 1 were synthesized, and their biological activities were evaluated. Among the novel derivatives, 2,4-bis(octadecanoylamino)benzenesulfonic acid sodium salt (4d) showed the most potent inhibitory activity against the incorporation of 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate-labeled acetyl-LDL (DiI-acetyl-LDL) into macrophages. 2,5-Bis(octadecanoylamino)benzenesulfonic acid sodium salt (4c), a regioisomer of 4d, did not exhibit as potent an inhibitory activity as 4d, meaning that the substitution pattern of two long chains on the benzene ring must be important. Compound 4d exhibited 10 times more potent inhibitory activity against the binding of 125I-labeled acetyl-LDL to the surface of macrophages than compound 1.
15076792,5,2004,Med Sci Sports Exerc,Body composition changes in bodybuilders: a method comparison.,INTRODUCTION: Few studies report on validation of body composition changes using the four-compartment model (4C), and no such studies are available in strength training. Here we present such a validation study for the determination of body fat and fat-free mass changes in bodybuilders, who used exercise and androgenic-anabolic steroids.METHODS: The study was carried out with 27 male bodybuilders in a cross-sectional study. Fifteen of these subjects also participated in an intervention program where body composition changes were measured. The 4C model served as the gold standard. The alternative mechanistic methods were underwater weighing (uww), deuterium dilution (dil), three-compartment model incorporating total body water (3Cw), three-compartment model incorporating bone mineral content (3Cb), and descriptive methods, namely dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), prediction equations based on body mass index (BMI), skinfold measurement, and bioimpedance analyses.RESULTS: From the cross-sectional study, it appeared that biases and errors of most mechanistic methods were small (maximal 0.5% BF and 3.4%BF, respectively; exception 3Cb model). The 3Cw model had the lowest error (0.9%BF). The descriptive methods had small biases (exception BMI) but relatively large errors (range: 5.5-8%). Results on body composition changes (intervention study) were comparable with the results from the cross-sectional study.CONCLUSIONS: Using the 4C model as the standard for determination of body fat and fat-free mass, this study revealed that apart from the prediction equation based on BMI and the 3Cb model, all methods gave acceptable group mean values. When accurate measurements on body composition and/or body composition changes on an individual level are needed, only the 3Cw model could serve as an alternative for the 4C method.
14981342,5,2004,Neuropsychobiology,Whole deletion of CYP2A6 gene (CYP2A6AST;4C) and smoking behavior.,The relationship between nicotine metabolism of CYP2A6 and the smoking behavior in a Japanese population was investigated. The CYP2A6 genotypes were determined by the PCR method. There was a significant difference in the frequency of the CYP2A6AST;4C allele, which is a whole deleted allele for the human CYP2A6 gene, between smokers and nonsmokers. The frequency of the CYP2A6AST;4C allele was higher in nonsmokers than in smokers, whereas the frequency of CYP2A6AST;1A/AST;1B heterozygotes with a higher activity of nicotine metabolism was lower. In this study it was suggested that the CYP2A6AST;4C allele may prevent the carrier from smoking and the CYP2A6AST;1A/AST;1B heterozygote may be at risk for developing smoking behavior.
15611990,4,2004,J Comp Neurol,Differential expression of Zif268 and c-Fos in the primary visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus of normal Cebus monkeys and after monocular lesions.,The transcription factors c-Fos and Zif268 have been used as markers of neuronal activity, and they also have been implicated in neuronal plasticity. In this study, we investigated the expression of c-Fos and Zif268 proteins in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and in the cortical primary visual area (V1) of normal adult Cebus apella monkeys and in animals with monocular lesions. In the LGN, the reaction for c-Fos showed immunopositive cells in both magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) layers; however, the label was heavier in P layers. In animals that suffered monocular lesions, the immunocytochemistry for c-Fos showed more labeling in layers related to the normal eye compared with those of the lesioned eye. No specific label was observed after the reaction for Zif268 in the LGN. In V1, the reaction for both Zif268 and c-Fos showed a pattern of lamination in which heavier labeling was found in layers 2/3, 4A, 4C, and 6. After monocular lesions, we observed a clear pattern of ocular dominance columns in V1 for both c-Fos and Zif268, in which the columns related to the normal eye are more heavily labeled than those related to the lesioned eye. This pattern is more evident in layer 4C after c-Fos reaction, whereas, after Zif268, it is more clearly observed in layers 2/3. These results suggest that, in addition to be regulated by functional activity, these transcription factors are involved in different processes during cortical reorganization.
15598079,4,2004,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,Synthesis, in vitro anticancer evaluation, and interference with cell cycle progression of N-phosphoamino acid esters of zidovudine and stavudine.,A series of N-diisopropylphosphoryl (DIPP) L-amino acid ester prodrugs of zidovudine (AZT) (3a-3e) and stavudine (d4T) (4a-4e) has been prepared. The activity of these compounds against MCF-7 cells (human pleural effusion breast adenocarcinoma cell line) and K562 cells (human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line) was evaluated. In difference from that of AZT amino acid phosphoramidates, the alophatic amino acid esters of AZT were found to be more cytotoxic than the aromatic analogues toward MCF-7 cell. Two DIPP-L-amino acid esters of d4T 4b (CC50 = 83 microM) and 4c (CC50 = 182 microM) were found to be more cytotoxic than the parent drug toward K562 cells. MCF-7 and K562 cell cycle disturbance was investigated showing detectable blockade in the S phase when exposed to biologically active AZT, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4b and 4c, indicating that they inhibit cell growth by blocking cell cycle progression. Together with previous reports, present findings suggest that anti-breast cancer activity of AZT may be due to hamper DNA synthesis.
15329371,4,2004,J Dent Res,Semaphorin profiling of periodontal fibroblasts and osteoblasts.,Cells of the periodontal attachment (cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and periodontal ligament fibroblasts) are descended from a common progenitor (the cranial neural crest). During their differentiation into different cell types, these cells separate from one another to form a laminated structure. Semaphorins (and their neuropilins and plexin receptors) act as cell guidance molecules for other neural crest derivatives. It is predicted that the differential expression of these molecules will correlate with the ability of these cells to segregate. It is demonstrated that human pre-osteoblasts segregate from PDL and gingival fibroblasts in culture. In addition, these cells express different semaphorins and plexins. Semaphorins 3D and 7A were expressed preferentially in dermal fibroblasts, while semaphorin 6B was selectively expressed by pre-osteoblasts. Semaphorins 3B, 4C, 5B, and 6C and plexins B1 and C1 were expressed in reduced levels in pre-osteoblasts. Analysis of the data suggests that differential expression of semaphorins and plexins may be involved in regulating cell-sorting in the formation and regeneration of the periodontal attachment structure.</AbstractText>: Cells of the periodontal attachment (cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and periodontal ligament fibroblasts) are descended from a common progenitor (the cranial neural crest).

15186857,4,2004,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and anticancer activity evaluation of new 2-alkylcarbonyl and 2-benzoyl-3-trifluoromethyl-quinoxaline 1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives.,As a continuation of our research in quinoxaline 1,4-di-N-oxide and with the aim of obtaining new anticancer agents, which can improve the current chemotherapeutic treatments, new series of 2-alkylcarbonyl and 2-benzoyl-3-trifluoromethylquinoxaline 1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antitumor activity against a 3-cell line panel, consisting of MCF7 (breast), NCI-H460 (lung), and SF-268 (CNS). These active compounds were then evaluated in the full panel of 60 human tumor cell lines derived from nine cancer cell types. The results have shown that, in general, anticancer activity depends on the substituents in the carbonyl group, improving in the order: ethyl&lt;isopropyl&lt;tert-butyl&lt;phenyl-ones. Among these, the compounds 4c, 6e, their difluorinated analogs (4g and 6g), and 5c were the most active, with mean GI(50) values of 1.02, 0.42, 0.52, 0.15, and 0.49microM, respectively. All of them were also found to inhibit the growth of the all of the Leukemia cell lines studied (with 75% of the GI(50) values less than 0.15microM) and therefore, were selected for further evaluation for the in vivo hollow fiber assays.
15051154,4,2004,Neuroscience,Neurites from trigeminal ganglion explants grown in vitro are repelled or attracted by tooth-related tissues depending on developmental stage.,Although neurite attracting factors are present in the developing dental pulp and trigeminal ganglion (TG) axons can respond to such factors, nerve fibres do not enter the tooth pulp until a late developmental stage compared with surrounding tissues supplied by the TG. This suggests that the dental pulp secretes neurite growth inhibitory molecules. Semaphorins represent one group of substances, which can inhibit/repel growing neurites. The aims of the present study were to investigate if dental tissue explants inhibit/repel neurite growth from TGs at some developmental stages in vitro, and if so, to seek evidence for or against a participation of semaphorins in that interaction. By co-culturing mandibular or dental epithelial and mesenchymal tissue explants and TGs in collagen gels, we found that embryonic day 11 (E11) mandibular and E13 dental mesenchymal explants repel neurites from corresponding TGs. Repulsion was replaced by attraction if tissues from late embryonic or early postnatal mice (E17-postnatal day 5) were used. Using semi-quantitative reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction we showed that a number of semaphorins were expressed by tooth-related mesenchyme collected from embryonic and postnatal mice. The expression of some semaphorins (3A, 3C, 3F, 4F, 5B, 6A, 6B and 6C) was high early in development and then decreased in a temporal pattern that correlated with neurite inhibitory/repulsive effects of dental mesenchyme observed in co-cultures. The expression of other semaphorins increased with development (3B, 4A and 7A), whilst others varied irregularly or remained at a fairly constant level (3E, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4G and 5A). Immunohistochemistry was used to determine if tooth-related nerve fibres possess neuropilins. This revealed that axons surrounding embryonic tooth buds express neuropilin-1, but not neuropilin-2. In postnatal teeth, nerve fibres located within the tooth pulp were immunonegative for neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2. We conclude that developing mandibular/dental mesenchyme can inhibit/repel neurite growth in vitro. Our results support the hypothesis that semaphorins may be involved in this interaction.
14967477,4,2004,Biochim Biophys Acta,Reconstitution into liposomes and functional characterization of the carnitine transporter from renal cell plasma membrane.,The carnitine transporter was solubilized from rat renal apical plasma membrane (brush-border membrane) with C12E8 and reconstituted into liposomes by removing the detergent from mixed micelles by hydrophobic chromatography on Amberlite XAD-4. The reconstitution was optimised with respect to the protein concentration, the detergent/phospholipid ratio and the number of passages through a single Amberlite column. The reconstituted carnitine transporter catalysed a first-order antiport reaction (carnitine/carnitine or carnitine/substrate) stimulated by external, not internal, Na+, with a positive cooperativity. Na+ was co-transported with carnitine. Optimal activity was found between pH 5.5 and pH 6.0. The sulfhydryl reagents MTSES, MTSET and mercurials strongly inhibited the transport. Substrate analogues inhibited the transport; the most effective were acylcarnitines and betaine, followed by dimethylglicine, tetraethylammonium and arginine. Besides carnitine, only acylcarnitines and betaine were efficiently translocated. The Km for carnitine on the external and internal side of the transporter was 0.08 and 1.2 mM, respectively. The transporter is asymmetrical and it is unidirectionally inserted into the proteoliposomal membrane with an orientation corresponding to that of the native membrane. The reconstituted carnitine transporter corresponds, very probably, to the OCTN2 protein.
14736220,4,2004,J Eukaryot Microbiol,Sporulation and survival of Toxoplasma gondii oocysts in seawater.,We have been collaborating since 1992 in studies on southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) as part of a program to define factors, which may be responsible for limiting the growth of the southern sea otter population. We previously demonstrated Toxoplasma gondii in sea otters. We postulated that cat feces containing oocysts could be entering the marine environment through storm run-off or through municipal sewage since cat feces are often disposed down toilets by cat owners. The present study examined the sporulation of T. gondii oocysts in seawater and the survival of sporulated oocysts in seawater. Unsporulated oocysts were placed in 15 ppt artificial seawater, 32 ppt artificial seawater or 2% sulfuric acid (positive control) at 24 C in an incubator. Samples were examined daily for 3 days and development monitored by counting 100 oocysts from each sample. From 75 to 80% of the oocysts were sporulated by 3 days post-inoculation under all treatment conditions. Groups of 2 mice were fed 10,000 oocysts each from each of the 3 treatment groups. All inoculated mice developed toxoplasmosis indicating that oocysts were capable of sporulating in seawater. Survival of sporulated oocysts was examined by placing sporulated T. gondii oocysts in 15 ppt seawater at room temperature 22-24 C (RT) or in a refrigerator kept at 4 C. Mice fed oocysts that had been stored at 4C or RT for 6 months became infected. These results indicate that T. gondii oocysts can sporulate and remain viable in seawater for several months.
14707783,4,2004,Med Sci Sports Exerc,The effect of dehydration on wrestling minimum weight assessment.,Given that some wrestlers arrive for minimum weight (MW) testing in a dehydrated condition, it is important to understand the effects of dehydration on MW assessment methods.</AbstractText>: Given that some wrestlers arrive for minimum weight (MW) testing in a dehydrated condition, it is important to understand the effects of dehydration on MW assessment methods.PURPOSE: To determine the effect of dehydration on the assessment of MW by three-site skinfolds with the Lohman formula (SF), leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and multifrequency bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) compared with a four-component (4C) criterion.METHODS: Twenty-two male collegiate wrestlers (mean +/- SD, age: 19.9 +/- 1.4 yr, height: 174.0 +/- 6.8 cm, body mass: 77.4 +/- 9.1 kg) had their body composition assessed by the 4C criterion, hydrostatic weighing (HW), SF, BIA, and BIS in euhydration (EUH) and dehydration (DEH). Subjects dehydrated 2-5% of body weight through fluid restriction and exercise in a hot environment.RESULTS: In EUH, the total error (TE) for HW (1.75 kg) and SF (2.15 kg) were not significantly different, but the TE for HW and SF methods were significantly lower than the TE for both BIS (3.68 kg) and BIA (3.77 kg). In DEH, SF, BIA, and BIS methods had a TE approaching or exceeding 4 kg (8.8 lb). Dehydration increased the TE for SF and BIA through an artificial lowering of body weight and for BIS by an increased error in intracellular water prediction.CONCLUSION: Acute thermal dehydration violates assumptions necessary for the accurate and precise prediction of MW by SF, leg-to-leg BIA, and multifrequency BIS.
15582503,3,2004,J Soc Gynecol Investig,Soluble Fas concentrations in the follicular fluid and oocyte-cumulus complex culture medium from women undergoing in vitro fertilization: association with oocyte maturity, fertilization, and embryo quality.,OBJECTIVE: Because soluble Fas (sFas) inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis by preventing death signal transduction, we determined sFas concentrations in the follicular fluid (FF) and oocyte-cumulus complex culture medium (CM) from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) in order to associate its concentrations with oocyte maturity, fertilization, and embryo quality.METHODS: We studied 82 follicles from 11 healthy women (mean age, 35.4 +/- 3.8 years) using a long protocol for IVF treatment. Individual FF and matched CM samples were immediately centrifuged at 4C and sFas concentrations were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.RESULTS: sFas concentrations were significantly higher in FF than in CM (P &lt;.0001) and when oocytes were mature rather than immature (P &lt;.002). Of 70 mature and 12 immature oocytes, 56 (80%) and two (16.6%), respectively, were fertilized. sFas concentrations in CM were significantly lower when mature oocytes were fertilized versus nonfertilized (P &lt;.005). sFas concentrations in FF and CM were significantly related in an inverse manner to embryo quality (P = .004 and P = .0002, respectively).CONCLUSION: FF and CM from women undergoing IVF contain sFas. The latter has anti-apoptotic properties and levels are higher: in FF when oocytes are mature and in CM when oocytes are nonfertilized. Furthermore, FF and CM sFas concentrations are negatively correlated with embryo quality.
15581847,3,2004,Biochim Biophys Acta,Reconstitution into liposomes of the glutamine/amino acid transporter from renal cell plasma membrane: functional characterization, kinetics and activation by nucleotides.,The glutamine/amino acid transporter was solubilized from rat renal apical plasma membrane (brush-border membrane) with C12E8 and reconstituted into liposomes by removing the detergent from mixed micelles by hydrophobic chromatography on Amberlite XAD-4. The reconstitution was optimised with respect to the protein concentration, the detergent/phospholipid ratio and the number of passages through a single Amberlite column. The reconstituted glutamine/amino acid transporter catalysed a first-order antiport reaction stimulated by external, not internal, Na+. Optimal activity was found at pH 7.0. The sulfhydryl reagents HgCl2, mersalyl and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and the amino acids alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine, asparagine, methionine and valine strongly inhibited the transport, whereas the amino acid analogue methylaminoisobutyrate had no effect. Glutamine, alanine, serine, asparagine, threonine were efficiently translocated from outside to inside and from inside to outside the proteoliposomes as well. Cysteine and valine were translocated preferentially from outside to inside. The Km for glutamine on the external and internal side of the transporter was 0.47 and 11 mM, respectively; the values were not influenced by the type of the counter substrate. The transporter is functionally asymmetrical and it is unidirectionally inserted into the proteoliposomal membrane with an orientation corresponding to that of the native membrane. By a bisubstrate kinetic analysis of the glutamine antiport, a random simultaneous mechanism was found. The glutamine antiport was strongly stimulated by internal nucleoside triphosphates and, to a lower extent, by pyrophoshate. The reconstituted glutamine/amino acid transporter functionally corresponds to the ASCT2 protein.
15578975,3,2004,Curr Drug Targets Infect Disord,New advances in HIV entry inhibitors development.,Considerable advances have been made in the last years in the design of derivatives acting as inhibitors of HIV entry and fusion. The discovery of chemokines focused the attention on cellular coreceptors used by the virus for entering within cells, and consequently the various steps of such processes have been characterized in detail. Intense research led to a wide range of effective compounds that are able to inhibit the initial steps of HIV life cycle. All steps in the process of HIV entry into the cell may be targeted by specific compounds that may be developed as novel types of antiretrovirals. Thus, several inhibitors of the gp120-CD4 interaction have been detected so far (zintevir, FP-21399 and BMS-378806 in clinical trials). Small molecule chemokine receptor antagonists acting as HIV entry inhibitors also were described in the last period, which interact both with the CXCR4 coreceptor (such as AMD3100; AMD3465; ALX40-4C; T22, T134 and T140), or which are antagonist of the CCR5 coreceptor (TAK-779, TAK-220, SCH-C, SCH-D, E913, AK-602, UK-427857 and NSC 651016 in clinical trials), together with new types of fusion inhibitors possessing the same mechanism of action as enfuvirtide (such as T1249). Recently, a third family of antivirals started to be used clinically (in addition to the reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors), with the advent of enfuvirtide (T20), the first fusion inhibitor to be approved as an anti-HIV agent. Some of these compounds demonstrated in vitro synergism with other classes of antivirals, offering thus the rationale for their combination in therapies for HIV-infected individuals. Many HIV entry and fusion inhibitors are currently being investigated in controlled clinical trials, and a number of them is bioavailable as oral formulations. This is an essential feature for an extended use of these compounds with the purpose of ameliorating adherence of patients to these medications and preventing the development of drug resistance.
15546025,3,2004,Asian J Androl,Radio-protective effect of vitamin E on spermatogenesis in mice exposed to gamma-irradiation: a flow cytometric study.,AIM: To investigate the effect of vitamin E on the radioprotection of spermatogenesis and chromatin condensation of spermatozoa during passage through the epididymis in mice exposed to irradiation.METHODS: Adult outbred male ICR mice were orally administered natural vitamin E (VE, D-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) at 400 IU/kg for 7 days before exposure to 1 Gy of gamma-irradiation. The animals were sacrificed at day 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 70 post-irradiation (IR) and the percentage of testicular germ cells and epididymal sperm chromatin condensation was analyzed using flow cytometry.RESULTS: Serum D-alpha-tocopheryl acetate levels were 47.4+/-3.2 microg/dL in the treated group, yet it could not be detected in the control group. The testicular weight of irradiated mice pretreated with VE+IR was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher than that of those without VE treatment (IR) at day 14 and 21 post-irradiation. The percentage of primary spermatocytes (4C) in the VE+IR group was comparable to the controls but significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher than those in the IR group from day 7 to 35 post-irradiation. The percentage of round spermatids (1C) in the VE+IR group was also significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher than those in the IR group at day 28 post-irradiation. The primary spermatocytes : spermatogonia ratio in the IR group was significantly (P&lt;0.05) declined at day 7 to 35 post-irradiation when compared to the VE+IR and control groups. The round spermatid : spermatogonia ratio in the VE+IR group was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher than that of the IR group at day 14 and 28 post-irradiation. The chromatin condensation of epididymal spermatozoa measured by propidium iodide uptake was not affected by 1 Gy of gamma-irradiation.CONCLUSION: The administration of VE prior to irradiation protects spermatogenic cells from radiation.
15540787,3,2004,J Urol,Inhibition of the bladder cooling reflex in the awake state: an experimental study in the cat.,PURPOSE: We assessed the bladder cooling reflex in the awake cat. The bladder cooling reflex is consistently observed in anesthetized adult cats but not in awake, neurologically normal humans. This discrepancy could indicate a state dependant control of the reflex or a species difference. This study was designed to differentiate between these alternatives,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Under ketamine-xylazine 5 animals had an indwelling catheter inserted into the bladder. The cooling reflex was tested by injections of cold saline into the bladder (4C to 8C), lowering its wall temperature to about 30C to 32C. The volume used (5 ml) was subthreshold for the Adelta micturition reflex, as confirmed by control injections of body warm saline. The procedure was repeated with the animals fully awake and it was well tolerated by all of them. Reflex responses were assessed by induced bladder pressures.RESULTS: Typical bladder cooling reflexes with peak pressures greater than 3 kPa were evoked in all cats when in narcotic sleep (group mean +/- CI 7.4 +/- 3.1 kPa). No such reflexes were elicited when the animals were awake (2.0 +/- 1.0 kPa). The difference was significant at the level of individual animals.CONCLUSIONS: The bladder cooling reflex is suppressed in adult cats during wakefulness, as in humans. This state dependent control of the bladder cooling reflex adds to its resemblance to the extensor plantar response (Babinski's sign).
15473900,3,2004,Genet Vaccines Ther,Improved gene delivery to human saphenous vein cells and tissue using a peptide-modified adenoviral vector.,The establishment of efficient gene delivery to target human tissue is a major obstacle for transition of gene therapy from the pre-clinical phases to the clinic. The poor long-term patency rates for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a major clinical problem that lacks an effective and proven pharmacological intervention. Late vein graft failure occurs due to neointima formation and accelerated atherosclerosis. Since CABG allows a clinical window of opportunity to genetically modify vein ex vivo prior to grafting it represents an ideal opportunity to develop gene-based therapies. Adenoviral vectors have been frequently used for gene delivery to vein ex vivo and pre-clinical studies have shown effective blockade in neointima development by overexpression of candidate therapeutic genes. However, high titers of adenovirus are required to achieve sufficient gene delivery to provide therapeutic benefit. Improvement in the uptake of adenovirus into the vessel wall would therefore be of benefit. Here we determined the ability of an adenovirus serotype 5 vector genetically-engineered with the RGD-4C integrin targeting peptide inserted into the HI loop (Ad-RGD) to improve the transduction of human saphenous vein smooth muscle cells (HSVSMC), endothelial cells (HSVEC) and intact saphenous vein compared to a non-modified virus (Ad-CTL). We exposed each cell type to virus for 10, 30 or 60 mins and measured transgene at 24 h post infection. For both HSVSMC and HSVEC Ad-RGD mediated increased transduction, with the largest increases observed in HSVSMC. When the experiments were repeated with intact human saphenous vein (the ultimate clinical target for gene therapy), again Ad-RGD mediated higher levels of transduction, at all clinically relevant exposures times (10, 30 and 60 mins tissue:virus exposure). Our study demonstrates the ability of peptide-modified Ad vectors to improve transduction to human vein graft cells and tissue and has important implications for gene therapy for CABG.
15473375,3,2004,Tsitologiia,Genome multiplication of extravillous trophoblast cells in human placenta in the course of differentiation and invasion into endometrium and myometrium. II. Mechanisms of polyploidization.,Peculiarities of the structure of interphase nuclei, mitotic activity, and Ki-67 protein intranuclear immunolocalization were studied to elucidate mechanisms of genome multiplication in proliferative and differentiating invasive extravillous trophoblast cells in the human placenta. The presence of numerous chromocenters was shown to be a characteristic feature of proliferative cell nuclei of both villous and extravillous trophoblast. At the beginning of extravillous trophoblast cell differentiation, i.e. in the proximal part of cell columns, some amount of cells with large nuclei containing enlarged chromocenters were found. DNA content was measured simultaneously with counting the number of chromocenters in similarly looking nuclei of squash preparations of placental villi. The increase in the ploidy level up to 4c-8c, accompanied by a slight increase in the number of chromocenters being not proportional to the ploidy level and not exceeding the diploid number of chromosomes of the human genome, was demonstrated. This suggests that genome multiplication of extravillous trophoblast cells may be accomplished by endoreduplication. In addition, pictures of endomitosis were seen at early steps of differentiation of EVT cells. The lack of polyploid mitotic figures or any obvious polyploidizing or restitutional mitoses suggests that these are not of considerable importance in genome multiplication of human EVT cells. However, the prevalence of metaphases at the boundary of the distal part of cell columns suggests that restitutional mitoses may be involved, even partly, in human trophoblast cell polyploidization. At later steps of differentiation, i.e. in the distal part of cell columns, the nuclear structure obviously changes, with a uniform &quot;network&quot; chromatin arrangement prevailing, whereas numerous chromocenters and features of endomitosis are no longer seen. The pattern of Ki-67 protein immunolocalization is also changing along the invasive pathway. In the proliferating stem cells and trophoblast cells of the proximal part of cell columns, Ki-67 was localized in the karyoplasm, chromocenters and numerous small nucleoli, whereas in the distal part of cell columns this protein was detected predominantly in 1-2 large nucleoli. The comparative analysis of the literature data on Ki-67 localization at different stages of cell cycle provided another evidence that EVT cells in the course of invasion may switch to the endoreduplication cycle. In agreement with the relevant report on rodent placentation, our present data suggest that acquirement of an invasive phenotype of EVT cells is accompanied by switching from mitotic division to endoreduplication cycle.
15338274,3,2004,Hum Genet,Analysis of genes implicated in iron regulation in individuals presenting with primary iron overload.,Extensive investigation into the molecular basis of iron overload disorders has provided new insights into the complexity of iron metabolism and related cellular pathways. The possible involvement of genes affecting iron homeostasis, including HFE, SLC40A1, HAMP and CYBRD1, was investigated in individuals who were referred for confirmation or exclusion of a diagnosis of haemochromatosis, but who tested negative or were heterozygous for the causative HFE mutation, C282Y. Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography analysis of these genes revealed a unique spectrum of mutations in the South African study population, including 67 unrelated patients and 70 population-matched controls. Two novel CYBRD1 gene mutations, R226H and IVS1-4C--&gt;G, were identified in 11% of South African Caucasian patient referrals. We identified a novel D270V mutation in the SLC40A1 gene in a Black South African female with iron overload. These mutations were absent in the control population. In Africans with iron overload not related to the HFE gene, the possible involvement of the SLC40A1 and CYBRD1 genes was demonstrated for the first time. This study confirms the genetic heterogeneity of haemochromatosis and highlights the significance of CYBRD1 mutations in relation to iron overload.
15273189,3,2004,Br J Sports Med,Validation of fan beam dual energy x ray absorptiometry for body composition assessment in adults aged 18-45 years.,BACKGROUND: Pencil beam dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) has been shown to provide valid estimates of body fat (%BF), but DXA fan beam technology has not been adequately tested to determine its validity.OBJECTIVE: To compare %BF estimated from fan beam DXA with %BF determined using two and three compartment (2C, 3C) models.METHODS: Men (n = 25) and women (n = 31), aged 18-41 years, participated in the study. Body density, from hydrostatic weighing, was used in the 2C estimate of %BF; DXA was used to determine bone mineral content (BMC) for the 3C estimate of %BF calculated using body density and BMC (3C(BMC)). DXA was also used to determine %BF. Analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences in %BF between sexes and among methods.RESULTS: Women were significantly shorter, weighed less, had less fat free mass, and a higher %BF than men. No significant differences were found among methods (2C, 3C(BMC), DXA) for determination of %BF in either sex. Although not significant, Bland-Altman plots showed that DXA gave higher values for %BF than the 2C and 3C(BMC) methods.CONCLUSION: DXA determination of %BF was not different from that of the 2C and 3C(BMC) models in this group of young adults. However, to validate fan beam DXA fully as a method for body composition assessment in a wide range of individuals and populations, comparisons are needed that use a 4C model with a measure of total body water and BMC.
15265569,3,2004,Vet Parasitol,Prevalence of anti-Neospora caninum antibodies in dogs from urban, periurban and rural areas of the city of Uberlândia, Minas Gerais--Brazil.,In Brazil there are few reports on the prevalence of anti-Neospora caninum antibodies in dogs from urban, periurban and rural areas. Serum samples from 450 dogs, 300 from urban, 58 from periurban and 92 from rural areas, were tested for the detection of anti-N. caninum IgG antibodies using IFAT: indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT, &gt; or =50). Antibodies were observed in 63 (14%) of the 450 serum samples analyzed, with 32 (10.7%) in dogs coming from the urban area, 11 (18.9%) from the periurban area and 20 (21.7%) from the rural area. Statistical differences were seen between the occurrences in animals from the urban area and those of the rural area (P = 0.01). The antibody titers found were: 1:50 in 20 dogs, 1:100-1:800 in 41 dogs, and 1:3200 in two dogs. In the female dogs, a smaller prevalence of dogs with antibodies was observed in those from the urban area (7.5%) in comparison with those of the rural (21.0%) (P = 0.05) and periurban (23.3%) (P = 0.01) areas. There were growing levels of antibody prevalence with the increase in age of the dogs in all three areas studied. Although this increase was not significant, it indicates a tendency towards more infections with age, suggesting post-natal exposure to N. caninum. However, a significant difference (P = 0.05) was observed in the occurrence of anti-N. caninum antibodies in dogs with ages = 2 years in urban (13.1% urban) versus rural environments (27.1% rural). Among the other age brackets studied the difference was not significant. The results confirm the presence of N. caninum in the region and reveal the important role of dogs in the parasite's epidemiology.
15242524,3,2004,Hum Gene Ther,Conditionally replication-competent adenoviral vectors with enhanced infectivity for use in gene therapy of melanoma.,To generate vector Ad.Tyr-E1A, which is cytolytic for tyrosinase-positive melanoma cells, we replaced the adenoviral E1A promoter with a human tyrosinase enhancer/promoter. To overcome the low transduction efficiency in populations of melanoma cells that exhibit a low level of the coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR), we inserted an RGD-4C peptide into the HI loop of the fiber knob domain of the Ad.Tyr-E1A vector. The resulting vector was named Ad.Tyr-E1A(RGD). As a result of these changes, the transduction efficiency of the RGD-modified vector was increased both in vitro and in vivo. Western blot analysis proved that infection of cells with the Ad.Tyr-E1A(RGD) vector led to expression of the E1A gene selectively in tyrosinase-positive melanoma cell lines, but not in tyrosinase-negative cell lines. The Ad.Tyr-E1A(RGD) vector was as potent in its cytotoxic effect as a tumor nonselective vector (Ad.CMV-E1A) in tyrosinase-positive melanoma cell lines. The Ad.Tyr-E1A(RGD) vector produced a higher vector particle yield in tumor cells than did the Ad.Tyr-E1A vector. Intratumoral injection of the Ad.Tyr-E1A(RGD) vector into xenotransplanted human melanoma tumors led to tumor regression in vivo. The combination of tumor-specific replication and enhanced infectivity generates a more potent CRAD vector for gene therapy of melanoma.
15038763,3,2004,Radiat Res,Optimal gamma-ray dose and irradiation conditions for producing low-molecular-weight chitosan that retains its chemical structure.,This study focuses on the optimal conditions for gamma irradiation to reduce the molecular weight of chitosan but still retain its chemical structure. Chitosan was irradiated under various conditions, i.e. flake solid state (condition 1), flake dispersed in water (condition 2), flake dispersed in 0.05, 0.1, 1 and 2% aqueous K(2)S(2)O(8) solution (conditions 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d, respectively), flake dispersed in 0.5, 1 and 2% aqueous H(2)O(2) solution (conditions 4a, 4b and 4c, respectively), and chitosan acetic acid solution (condition 5). Comparative studies were done using three types of chitosans with molecular weights of the order of 10(5) Da with degrees of deacetylation of 0.80, 0.85 and 0.90%. For all conditions, after irradiation, there were two regions of molecular weight reduction. A severe degradation occurred in the first region with decreases in the molecular weight of 80% for radiation doses up to 50 kGy for conditions 1, 2 and 3 (3a-3c) and 20 kGy for condition 4. In the second region, a slow degradation occurred, which resembled a plateau stage. The results for conditions 3d and 5 were the most dramatic, since the primary structure of chitosan was changed after the irradiation. The degradation of chitosan by gamma rays was found to be most effective for the amorphous structure. The retention of the structure of chitosan after gamma irradiation makes it possible to produce a low-molecular-weight chitosan that retains its functionality, as demonstrated by its activity in the coupling reaction with N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole.
14761395,3,2004,Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi,[Effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields on male reproduction in mice].,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMFs) on male reproduction in mice.METHODS: 94 adult male mice were exposed to 50 Hz sinusoidal electromagnetic fields of 0.2, 3.2 or 6.4 mT for 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Testicular histology and weight, sperm amount, sperm motility and morphology were measured. The percentages of different ploidy cells and cell phases, and DNA content of testis cells were estimated by flow cytometry. The micronucleus rate of bone-marrow cell was also observed.RESULTS: The testicular weight of the mice exposed to 6.4 mT for 4 weeks [(76.06 +/- 32.25) mg] was significantly lower than that of the control [(111.44 +/- 19.99) mg, P &lt; 0.05]; no significant histopathological changes were observed on the testis in EMFs exposed mice;the sperm amount was decreased after EMFs exposure for 4 weeks, and those of the mice exposed to 0.2 mT and 6.4 mT for 4 weeks [(4.87 +/- 0.94) x 10(6)/ml and (4.30 +/- 1.89) x 10(6)/ml respectively] were significantly lower than that of the control [(6.67 +/- 0.70) x 10(6)/ml, P &lt; 0.05]; the rates of sperm motility also showed a decline. After 0.2, 3.2 or 6.4 mT EMFs exposure for 2 weeks, the deformity rates of sperm [(7.416 +/- 3.352)%, (6.862 +/- 2.947)% and (8.112 +/- 4.615)% respectively] were significantly higher than that of the control [(4.098 +/- 2.028)%, P &lt; 0.01]. Similarly, those of the mice exposed for 4 weeks [(10.267 +/- 3.836)%, (11.027 +/- 7.059)%, (8.814 +/- 3.678)% respectively] were higher than that of the control [(3.714 +/- 1.830)%]. After 6.4 mT exposure for 2 weeks, the percentages of 1C testis cells [(69.56 +/- 4.07)%] was significantly lower than that of the control [(73.45 +/- 3.10)%, P &lt; 0.05]. There were not any remarkable changes in those of 2C, 4C cells. DNA content in different ploidy cells of the mice exposed to 6.4 mT was decreased. Moreover, the cell percentage in S phase was increased significantly (P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: ELF EMFs exposure may have some adverse effects on reproduction in mice.
14738557,3,2004,J Viral Hepat,Subtype mutations in the envelope 2 region including phosphorylation homology domain of hepatitis C virus do not predict effectiveness of antiviral therapy.,The aim of this study was to determine whether specific sequences of the phosphorylation homology domain (PePHD) region could be correlated with differences in response to antiviral therapy in patients infected with hepatitis C virus subtypes 1b, 2c, 3a and 4c/d. We included 43 patients (22 sustained responders and 21 nonresponders or relapsers) in the study, who were classified according to early viral decline during the first weeks of antiviral treatment and response at end of follow up. Type of mutations, mutation frequency, genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships were compared at the PePHD and flanking regions. Phylogenetic trees showed that each sequence clustered together with those of the same subtype. Sequences from subtypes 1b and 4c/d resembled more closely the phosphorylation sites of protein kinase R and eIF2 alpha than sequences from genotypes 2c and 3a, the latter with higher response rates to interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) treatment. However, within specific subtypes, no separate clusters of responders and nonresponders were observed either at the beginning or at the end of follow up. We were not able to find any particular sequence or mutation in the PePHD region or in any other subregion of the fragment studied that allowed prediction of treatment response.
15584746,2,2004,J Am Chem Soc,Organogermanium reactive intermediates. The direct detection and characterization of transient germylenes and digermenes in solution.,Diphenylgermylene (Ph2Ge) and its Ge=Ge doubly bonded dimer, tetraphenyldigermene (6a), have been characterized directly in solution for the first time by laser flash photolysis methods. The germylene is formed via (formal) cheletropic photocycloreversion of 3,4-dimethyl-1,1-diphenylgermacyclopent-3-ene (4a), which is shown to proceed in high chemical (&gt;95%) and quantum yield (phi = 0.62) by steady-state trapping experiments with methanol, acetic acid, isoprene, and triethylsilane. Flash photolysis of 4a in dry deoxygenated hexane at 23 degrees C leads to the prompt formation of a transient assigned to Ph2Ge (lambda(max) = 500 nm; epsilon(max) = 1650 M(-1) cm(-1)), which decays with second-order kinetics (tau approximately 3 micros), with the concomitant growth of a second transient species that is assigned to digermene 6a (tau approximately 40 micros; lambda(max) = 440 nm). Analogous results are obtained from 1,1-dimesityl- and 1,1-dimethyl-3,4-dimethylgermacyclopent-3-ene (4b and 4c, respectively), which afford Mes2Ge (tau approximately 20 micros; lambda(max) = 560 nm) and Me2Ge (tau approximately 2 micros; lambda(max) = 480 nm), respectively, as well as the corresponding digermenes, tetramesityl- (6b; lambda(max) = 410 nm) and tetramethyldigermene (6c; lambda(max) = 370 nm). The results for the mesityl compound are compared to the analogous ones from laser flash photolysis of the known Mes2Ge/6b precursor, hexamesitylcyclotrigermane. The spectra of the three germylenes and two of the digermenes are in excellent agreement with calculated spectra, derived from time-dependent DFT calculations. Absolute rate constants for dimerization of Ph2Ge and Mes2Ge and for their reaction with n-butylamine and acetic acid in hexane at 23 degrees C are also reported.
15465347,2,2004,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and anticonvulsant evaluation of some new 2-substituted-3-arylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidinones.,A series of 2-substituted-3-arylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidinones was prepared for evaluation as potential anticonvulsants. In murine screening, compounds 4a-c having a 2-oxo-2-(4-pyridyl)ethyl group in the 2-position and a 2-substituted phenyl moiety at the 3-position of the pyridopyrimidinone system displayed the most potent anti-seizure activity in both the maximal electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazol (scPTZ) tests at doses in the 3-10mg/kg range. Compound 4c showed no agonist activity at the GABA(A) receptor and was unable to block presynaptic sodium and calcium channels in vitro.
15456274,2,2004,J Med Chem,Design and synthesis of novel indole beta-diketo acid derivatives as HIV-1 integrase inhibitors.,Diketo acids such as S-1360 (1A) and L-731,988 (2) are potent and selective inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase (IN). A plethora of diketo acid-containing compounds have been claimed in patent literature without disclosing much biological activities and synthetic details (reviewed in Neamati, N. Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat. 2002, 12, 709-724). To establish a coherent structure-activity relationship among the substituted indole nucleus bearing a beta-diketo acid moiety, a series of substituted indole-beta-diketo acids (4a-f and 5a-e) were synthesized. All compounds tested showed anti-IN activity at low micromolar concentrations with varied selectivity against the strand transfer process. Three compounds, the indole-3-beta-diketo acids 5a and 5c, and the parent ester 9c, have shown an antiviral activity in cell-based assays. We further confirmed a keto-enolic structure in the 2,3-position of the diketo acid moiety of a representative compound (4c) using NMR and X-ray crystallographic analysis. Using this structure as a lead for all of our computational studies, we found that the title compounds extensively interact with the essential amino acids on the active site of IN.
15385573,2,2004,J Histochem Cytochem,Microwave irradiation of ethanol-fixed bone improves preservation, reduces processing time, and allows both light and electron microscopy on the same sample.,Methylmethacrylate (MMA) embedding is routinely used for histomorphometry of undecalcified bone preserved by prolonged immersion in ethanol, a procedure that yields poor ultrastructural detail. Because microwave irradiation (MWI) facilitates penetration of fixatives, we have investigated whether it can improve preservation by ethanol. Rat tibiae, some labeled with tetracycline, and a human iliac crest biopsy were immersed in 70% ethanol and dehydrated, both under MWI, for a total processing time of approximately 7 hr. Controls were not irradiated, and all specimens were embedded in MMA at 4C. They were then processed for histomorphometry, histochemistry, structural analysis, and immunolabeling. The results showed that histological preservation was improved with MWI. Static bone formation and resorption parameters and rate of mineral apposition were similar to those of conventionally processed specimens. Mineral distribution, as visualized by von Kossa staining and backscattered electron imaging, was not affected. Alkaline phosphatase and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, as well as immunolocalization of bone sialoprotein and osteopontin, were readily visualized. Ultrastructurally, osteopontin exhibited a typical distribution in mineralization foci, between calcified collagen fibrils, and at cement lines. These data show that MWI improves preservation and permits application of a broad spectrum of analytical methodologies on the same bone sample while considerably reducing processing time.
15385141,2,2004,Gynecol Oncol,Combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy during conception and first two trimesters of gestation in a woman with metastatic breast cancer.,A 33-year-old woman with T(4c)N(3) breast cancer with metastases in the skeleton (M(1)) received five cycles of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC regimen) before conception and during the first trimester. Salvage radiotherapy (28 Gy) was delivered during the 17th week. Tamoxifen and zolendronic acid were also administered throughout the second and third trimesters. The patient was not aware of her pregnancy until the 28th week. A female phenotypically normal infant was delivered in the 35th week of gestation by cesarean section. The child is functioning normally 12 months after delivery. The literature of anthracycline treatment during conception and the first trimester is reviewed. The effects of tamoxifen and biphosphonate therapy on the fetus during pregnancy are also discussed.
15246825,2,2004,Exp Neurol,Fate of cloned embryonic neuroectodermal cells implanted into the adult, newborn and embryonic forebrain.,NE-4C, one-cell derived neuroectodermal stem cells expressing a reporter gene--green fluorescent protein (GFP) or heat-resistant alkaline phosphatase (PLAP)--or prelabeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were implanted into the forebrain of adult, new-born and fetal mice and into the mid- and forebrain vesicles of early chick embryos. The fate of implanted cells in the mouse and chick hosts was followed up to 6 and 2 weeks, respectively. Neural differentiation was monitored by detecting the expression of neuron-specific markers and GFAP. NE-4C cells integrated into the early embryonic brain tissue and developed into morphologically differentiated neurons. The same cells produced expanding tumor-like aggregates in the newborn forebrain and were expelled from the adult forebrain parenchyma. In the adult brain, long-term survival and integration of stem cells were revealed only in neurogenic zones. The data suggest that noncommitted, proliferating neuroectodermal progenitors can integrate into the brain tissue at time and site of tissue genesis.
15205445,2,2004,J Bacteriol,Independent regulation of two genes in Escherichia coli by tetracyclines and Tet repressor variants.,We report a regulation system in Escherichia coli for independent regulation of two distinct reporter genes by application of Tet repressors with different specificities. One Tet repressor variant comprises wild-type tet operator (tetO) recognition and exclusive induction with the novel inducer 4-dedimethylamino-anhydrotetracycline. The other Tet repressor variant shows tetO-4C recognition and induction with tetracycline. We demonstrate that both variants are independently active in vivo and allow selective regulation of two genes in the same cell without any cross talk.
15160392,2,2004,J Neurosci Res,Role of gamma-aminobutyric acid in early neuronal development: studies with an embryonic neuroectodermal stem cell clone.,gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been known to function as an autocrine/paracrine signal molecule in addition to its well-known inhibitory neurotransmitter function. Studies on the developing brain and on primary brain cell cultures provided evidence for a variety of GABA functions in periods preceding the formation of synapses. The exact role of GABA in the early neural development, however, is still not well understood. In this study, one-cell-derived NE-4C neuroectodermal stem cells were induced to form neurons and astrocytes in vitro, and the role of GABA was investigated in defined phases of neurogenesis. Noninduced NE-4C cells contained GABA, expressed GABA(A)R alpha subunits, and carried functional GABA(A) ion channels. A moderate cytoplasmic GABA content was detected during the entire period of differentiation. By the time of the formation of differentiated neurons, neuron-like cells with both high and low GABA content were clearly distinguishable. HPLC analysis indicated that NE-4C cells released GABA into their fluid environment during all stages of neuronal development. By using the patch-clamp technique, GABA-evoked currents were recorded during the entire proliferation/differentiation period, whereas a GABA-evoked increase in intracellular Ca(2+) was detected only during the maturation of postmitotic neuronal precursors. Bicuculline blocked both the ion currents and the [Ca(2+)](i) increase in response to GABA. Neuron formation was facilitated by GABA through GABA(A) ion channels during postmitotic differentiation, but not earlier during the phases of cell fate commitment. Although the data clearly demonstrate an early responsiveness to GABA, understanding the significance of GABA influence in early neural cell fate decisions will require further investigation.
15108289,2,2004,Hum Mutat,Molecular analysis of the ABCA4 gene in Turkish patients with Stargardt disease and retinitis pigmentosa.,The clinical importance of sequence variations in the ABCA4 gene has been extensively discussed during the last decade. Mutations in the ABCA4 gene are involved in several forms of inherited retinal degenerations. We screened all 50 exons of the ABCA4 gene in a cohort of 5 Stargardt Disease (STGD) and 35 autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) patients of Turkish descent to assess the nature of ABCA4 mutant alleles in this population. Our results revealed the presence of three novel mutations: c.160T&gt;G (p.C54G), c.2486C&gt;T (p.T829M), and c.973-6C&gt;A; two mutations previously reported, c.634C&gt;T (p.R212C) and c.4253+4C&gt;T, and several polymorphic changes in the ABCA4 gene among Turkish patients affected with Stargardt and arRP. To our knowledge this report represents the first published study of ABCA4 mutations in the Turkish population resulting in STGD.
14987028,2,2004,J Org Chem,Extended hypervalent 5c-6e interactions: linear alignment of five C-Se---O---Se-C atoms in anthraquinone and 9-methoxyanthracene bearing arylselanyl groups at the 1,8-positions.,The structures of 1,8-bis(phenylselanyl)anthraquinone (1a), 1,8-bis(phenylselanyl)-9-methoxyanthracene (2a), and 1,8-bis(phenylselanyl)anthracene (3a) are determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis, together with the derivatives. The Se-C(i) (Ph) bonds in 1a are placed on the anthraquinone plane (both type B) and the phenyl planes are perpendicular to the anthraquinone plane. The structure around the Se atoms in 2a is very close to that of 1a: the conformations of the PhSe groups are both type B. Consequently, the five C(i)-Se- - -O- - -Se-C(i) atoms in 1a and 2a align linearly. The nonbonded Se- - -O distances in 1a and 2a are 2.673-2.688 and 2.731-2.744 A, respectively, which are about 0.7 A shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii of the atoms. The extended hypervalent sigma*(C(i)-Se)- - -n(p)(O)- - -sigma*(Se-C(i)) 5c-6e interactions are strongly suggested for the origin of the linear alignment of the five atoms in 1a and 2a. The 5c-6e must be constructed by the connection of the two hypervalent n(p)(O)- - -sigma*(Se-C(i)) 3c-4e interactions through the central n(p)(O). The five C(i)-Se- - -H- - -Se-C(i) atoms never align linearly in 3a. To reveal the nature of 5c-6e in 1a and 2a, QC calculations are performed on H(a)H(b)(A)Se- - -O([double bond]CH(2))- - -(B)SeH(a')H(b') (model a) and H(a)H(b)(A)Se- - -OH(2)- - -(B)SeH(a')H(b') (model b) with the B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2pd) method, where the nonbonded Se- - -O distances are fixed at 2.658 A. Four conformers, a (AA-cis), a (AA-trans), a (AB), and a (BB), are optimized to be stable for model a, where a (AA) shows both type A for the (A)Se-H(b) and (B)Se-H(b') bonds in model a. Three conformers, b (AA-cis), b (AB), and b (BB), are stable for model b. The bonding models in AA, AB, and BB correspond to 3c-6e, 4c-6e, and 5c-6e, respectively. The models become more stable by 42 +/- 5 kJ mol(-1), if the type A conformation of each Se-H bond changes to type B. No noticeable saturation is observed in the stabilization for each change. QC calculations are also performed on 1a-3a at the B3LYP level. Three conformers are evaluated to be stable for 1a and 2a. The relative energies of 1a (AA-trans), 1a (AB), and 1a (BB) are 0.0, -31.5, and -60.6 kJ mol(-1), respectively, and those of 2a (AA-cis), 2a (AB), and 2a (BB) are 0.0, -24.4, and -36.5 kJ mol(-1), respectively. These results demonstrate that the origin of the linear alignment of the five C-Se- - -O- - -Se-C atoms in 1a and 2a is the energy lowering effect by the extended hypervalent 5c-6e interactions of the sigma*(C-Se)&lt;--n(p)(O)--&gt;sigma*(Se-C) type. The pi-conjugation between pi(C[double bond]O) and n(pz)(Se) through the pi-framework of anthraquinone must also contribute to stabilize the BB structure of 1a, where z is the direction perpendicular to the anthraquinone plane.
14737518,2,2004,Chem Commun (Camb),First Br4 four centre-six electron and Se2Br5 seven centre-ten electron bonds in nonionic bromine adducts of selenanthrene.,Extended hypervalent Br(4) 4c-6e and Se(2)Br(5) 7c-10e bonds are detected in nonionic bromine adducts of selenanthrene, where the four Br(4) and seven Se(2)Br(5) atoms align linearly.
15609941,1,2004,J Org Chem,Synthesis and relative stability of 3,5-diacyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoles prepared by dipolar cycloaddition of enones and alpha-diazoketones.,An unusual reaction process that produced unexpected heterocyclic systems by a fragmentation-recombination mechanism is described. Thus treatment of the triketone, 3-acetyl-2,6-heptanedione, 1, with methanesulfonyl azide gave, in addition to the expected alpha-diazo ketone 3a, the dihydropyrazole 3c and its oxidation product, the pyrazole 3d. We propose that the initially formed alpha-diazo ketone 3a fragments into the simple alpha-diazomethyl ketone and methyl vinyl ketone which then undergo an intermolecular [2,3]-dipolar cycloaddition. Analogous treatment of the trifluoromethyl trione 2 again afforded a pyrazole 4c. Further experiments were carried out to lend evidence to our mechanistic hypothesis. Thus alpha-diazoacetophenone 5 and MVK underwent a [2,3]-dipolar cycloaddition under mild conditions to give the two regioisomeric dihydropyrazoles 6a and 6b. Interestingly these were formed in a 2:1 ratio, which suggested that 6a was more stable than 6b. The structures of 6a and 6b were optimized by using the B3LYP density functional method and the 6-31G* basis set and isomer 6a was predicted to be 1.5 kcal/mol more stable than isomer 6b. This energy difference could be rationalized by the greater capacity of the acetyl group than the benzoyl group to conjugate with the hydrazone. This difference in conjugation is reflected by key bond length differences. Thus we have discovered a novel fragmentation-cycloaddition process. We have also presented evidence for the mechanism of the formation of the dihydropyrazoles and carried out calculations to support these findings.
15596989,1,2004,Health Phys,Neutron spectra and dosimetric features around an 18 mv linac accelerator.,Using the difference between responses to neutrons of TLD-600 and TLD-700, three experimental devices were constructed and arranged to measure thermal neutron fluences, neutron spectra, and neutron doses inside the treatment room of a radiotherapy 18 MV Linear electron accelerator (Linac). Thermal neutron fluences were measured with TLD-600/TLD-700 pairs arranged in both a bare and a cadmium (Cd) foil covered methacrylate box. Neutron spectra were measured in 26 energy bins by introducing pairs of TLD-600/TLD-700 in air and into the middle of five polyethylene spheres with diameters of 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 inches. A PC version of the BUNKI code was used to unfold the six measurements in each sphere to obtain the 26 energy bins. Neutron and photon doses were measured by introducing pairs of TLD-600/TLD-700 into the middle of a single 25-cm-diameter paraffin sphere. The three required neutron calibrations were carried out at the Nuclear Technology Laboratory of the Polytechnique University of Madrid (UPM), using an 241Am-Be neutron source with an alpha activity of 111 GBq and a yield of 6.6 x 10(6) neutrons s(-1). Three devices were needed for the necessary calibrations: a BF3 counter for the thermal neutron fluence calibration, a LUDLUM 42-5 Bonner spectrometer with five 0.95 g cm(-3) polyethylene spheres with a LiI(Eu) 4 x 4 mm2 scintillation counter for the neutron spectrometer calibration and a NEMO 9140 remmeter for the paraffin remmeter calibration. The Monte Carlo code MCNP 4C has been used in two ways: to calculate the neutron kerma contribution to two TLDs (type 600 and 700) both in air and inside the paraffin sphere, and to determine the neutron spectra at those Linac room zones where the neutron spectra were measured. Thermal neutron fluences of 2.9 x 10(4) +/- 8.6 x 10(3) cm(-2) s(-1), measured around the Linac head plane, and 2.3 x 10(4) +/- 2.3 x 10(3) cm(-2) s(-1), measured at the patient couch plane, are in agreement with previous independent measurements from other authors. The calculated and measured neutron spectra obtained in the treatment room showed three distinct regions: a peak around 0.1 MeV, a flat epithermal region and a thermal region with values similar to those mentioned above. Patient dose equivalents of 0.5 mSv and 5 mSv from neutrons and photons, respectively, were obtained per treatment Gray.
15565274,1,2004,Mycorrhiza,Effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization and phosphorus application on nuclear ploidy in Allium porrum plants.,Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization can strongly affect the plant cell nucleus, causing displacement from the periphery to the center of the cell, hypertrophy and polyploidization. The hypertrophy response has been shown in a variety of AM plants whilst polyploidization has been reported only in Lycopersicon esculentum, a multiploid species with a small genome. In order to determine whether polyploidization is a general plant response to AM colonization, analyses were performed on Allium porrum, a plant with a large genome, which is much less subject to polyploidization than L. esculentum. The ploidy status of leaves, complete root systems and four zones of the adventitious roots was investigated in relation to phosphorus content, AM colonization and root differentiation in A. porrum plants grown under two different regimes of phosphate nutrition in order to distinguish direct effects of the fungus from those of improved nutrition. Results showed the presence of two nuclear populations (2C and 4C) in all treatments and samples. Linear regression analyses suggested a general negative correlation between phosphorus content and the proportion of 2C nuclei. The percentage of 2C nuclei (and consequently that of 4C nuclei), was also influenced by AM colonization, differentiation and ageing of the root cells, which resulted in earlier occurrence, in time and space, of polyploid nuclei.
15524480,1,2004,Org Lett,Rh(II)-catalyzed enantioselective cyclopropanation of olefins with dimethyl malonate via in situ generated phenyliodonium ylide.,Olefins are cyclopropanated with dimethyl malonate (1a) iodosylbenzene (PhI=O) and a Rh(II) carboxylate catalyst via an in situ generated phenyliodonium ylide (1c). Enantioselectivities of up to 90% for 4-bromostyrene and 98% for pent-1-ene have been observed with (S)-N-4-bromo-1,8-naphthanoyl-tert-leucine (4c) as the chiral ligand. The same catalyst was effective for olefin cyclopropanation with Meldrum's acid, giving cyclopropanes with 96% (with styrene) and 87% ee (with pent-1-ene), respectively.
15375726,1,2004,Plant Biol (Stuttg),Nuclear DNA amounts in 112 species of tropical hardwoods -- new estimates.,The 4C DNA values of 112 species, belonging to 37 families have a range from 0.83 pg (Bixa orellana) to 15.54 pg (Thryallis angustifolia), showing a 18.72-fold variation. The genome size varies from 0.21 pg (Bixa orellana) to 3.32 (Thespesia populnea), with a 15.8-fold difference. The Bombacaceae has the minimum range (1.08-fold) of variation, while the maximum (5.0-fold) is shown by the Fabaceae. The Boraginaceae, Lauraceae, Malpighiaceae, and Malvaceae generally have higher 4C DNA values of &gt; 10 pg, while the Bixaceae, Caricaceae, Oxalidaceae, and Santalaceae have lower values of &lt; 2.0 pg. These data add further to our knowledge on variation in DNA amount in tropical hardwoods.
15335092,1,2004,Int Dent J,Effect of home bleaching agents on the roughness and surface morphology of human enamel and dentine.,AIMS: Carbamide peroxide (CP) containing bleaching agents are now widely used in different concentrations. In this study, the effect of 10% and 15% CP containing home bleaching agents on the surface roughness and morphology of human enamel and dentine were evaluated in vitro.METHODS: 90 non-carious human mandibular incisors were divided randomly into two equal groups (enamel and dentine). The dentine group specimens were ground to expose dentine surfaces. The samples in both groups were then randomly divided into three main groups and then divided into three subgroups, according to bleaching application times (n=15). The samples in both enamel and dentine groups were treated with 10% CP at Group 1 and 4, 15% CP at Group 2 and 5 and distilled water at Group 3 and 6. The surface roughness of the samples was analysed before bleaching (1a, 2a, 3a for enamel, 4a, 5a, 6a for dentine), after 4hr (1b, 2b, 3b for enamel, 4b, 5b, 6b for dentine) and after 28hr of bleaching application (1c, 2c, 3c for enamel, 4c, 5c, 6c for dentine) using a computerised roughness tester. The surface morphologies of treated and control specimens were also examined by SEM.RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the surface roughness of untreated control specimens and the specimens treated with the bleaching materials (10% and 15% CP) for both enamel and dentine at any given measurement time (p&gt;0.05).CONCLUSION: Under the careful guidance of a dentist, home bleaching can be thought a reliable treatment for both stained enamel and dentine, regardless of whether 10% or 15% CP is used.
15293992,1,2004,J Med Chem,Tricyclic alkylamides as melatonin receptor ligands with antagonist or inverse agonist activity.,This work reports the design and synthesis of novel alkylamides, characterized by a dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene nucleus, as melatonin (MLT) receptor ligands. The tricyclic scaffold was chosen on the basis of previous quantitative structure-activity studies on MT1 and MT2 antagonists, relating selective MT2 antagonism to the presence of an aromatic substituent out of the plane of the MLT indole ring. Some dibenzo seven-membered structures were thus selected because of the noncoplanar arrangement of their benzene rings, and an alkylamide chain was introduced to fit the requirements for MLT receptor binding, namely, dibenzocycloheptenes with an acylaminoalkyl side chain at position 10 and dibenzoazepines with this side chain originating from the nitrogen atom bridging the two phenyl rings. Binding affinity at human cloned MT1 and MT2 receptors was measured by 2-[125I]iodomelatonin displacement assay and intrinsic activity by the GTPgammaS test. The majority of the compounds were characterized by higher affinity at the MT2 than at the MT1 receptor and by very low intrinsic activity values, thus confirming the importance of the noncoplanar arrangement of the two aromatic rings for selective MT2 antagonism. Dibenzocycloheptenes generally displayed higher MT1 and MT 2affinity than dibenzoazepines. N-(8-Methoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-10-ylmethyl)propionamide (4c) and -butyramide (4d) were the most selective MT2 receptor antagonists of the series, with MT2 receptor affinity comparable to that of melatonin and as such among the highest reported in the literature for MLT receptor antagonists. The acetamide derivative 4b produced a noticeable reduction of GTPgammaS binding at MT2 receptor, thus being among the few inverse agonists described.
15287804,1,2004,J Org Chem,Regioselective and stereoselective nucleophilic ring opening of trifluoromethylated cyclic sulfates: asymmetric synthesis of both enantiomers of syn-(3-trifluoromethyl)isoserine.,A novel and efficient enantioselective synthesis of both enantiomers of syn-(3-trifluoromethyl)isoserine was achieved. Ring opening of trifluoromethylated cyclic sulfates 3, derived from enantiopure trifluoromethylated vicinal diols 2, with various nucleophiles occurred exclusively at C2 with inversion of chirality. Treatment of 4c and 4d, obtained by nucleophilic opening of 3a and 3b with PhCO2NH4, with (CF3SO2)2O followed by substitution with sodium azide, Jones oxidation, and hydrogenolysis furnished (2S,3S)-(N-benzoyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)isoserine 9a and (2R,3R)-(N-benzoyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)isoserine 9b, respectively.

Lalat.,Aluminum toxicity in acidic soils poses a major threat to plant growth and development. The effects of a low dose of aluminum (50 microM, AlCl3) on various cytological parameters, including mitotic and meiotic chromosomal divisions, in situ nuclear DNA content, interphase nuclear volume (INV), and pollen fertility were compared in untreated (controls) and treated rice plants (Oryza sativa cv. Lalat). The results showed varied chromosomal abnormalities, including chromosome stickiness, laggards, sticky bridge, occurrence of micronuclei, as well as binucleate and multinucleated cells, as a result of aluminum treatment. Aluminum toxicity also inhibited to a small extent the growth of the rice cultivar Lalat. The mitotic and meiotic indexes, even after a prolonged period of recovery, were significantly low. The chromosomal anomalies in the meiotic cells persisted, and plants exhibited a high percentage of pollen sterility (approximately 64%). The nuclear DNA content declined markedly from 11.85 pg in the control to 6.30 pg in the treated plants. The INV also varied significantly between the untreated (controls) and the treated plants. The occurrences of different types of chromosomal aberrations, reduction in the amount of nuclear DNA, and persistence of the phytotoxic effects at the post-treatment stage suggest carcinogenic effects of aluminum on rice plants. The presence of aluminum in acidic soils might thus be extremely hazardous and might cause permanent cytotoxic disorder in rice plants.
15252617,1,2004,Dalton Trans,Various forms of linear dipyridyls in discrete rectangles, dinuclear rods, and one-dimensional networks containing (eta5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)rhodium(III).,[Cp*Rh(eta1-NO3)(eta2-NO3)] (1) reacted with pyrazine (pyz) to give a dinuclear complex [Cp*Rh(eta1-NO3)(mu-pyz)(0.5)]2.CH2Cl2(3.CH2Cl2). Tetranuclear rectangles of the type [Cp*Rh(eta1,mu-X)(mu-L)(0.5)]4(OTf)4(4a: X = N3, L = bpy; 4b: X = N3, L = bpe; 4c: X = NCO, L = bpy) were prepared from [Cp*Rh(H2O)3](OTf)2 (2), a pseudo-halide (Me3SiN3 or Me3SiNCO), and a linear dipyridyl [4,4'-bipyridine (bpy) or trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene (bpe)] by self-assembly through one-pot synthesis at room temperature. Treating complex with NH4SCN and dipyridyl led to the formation of dinuclear rods, [Cp*Rh(eta1-SCN)3]2(LH2) (5a: L = bpy; 5b: L = bpe), in which two Cp*Rh(eta1-SCN)3 units are connected by the diprotonated dipyridyl (LH2(2+)) through N(+)-H...N hydrogen bonds. Reactions of complex 2 with 1-(trimethylsilyl)imidazole (TMSIm) and dipyridyl (bpy or bpe) also produced another family of dinuclear rods [Cp*Rh(ImH)3]2.L (6a: L = bpy; 6b: L = bpe). Treating 1 and 2 with TMSIm and NH4SCN (in the absence of dipyridyl) generated a 1-D chain [Cp*Rh(ImH)3](NO3)2 (7) and a 1-D helix [Cp*Rh(eta1-SCN)2(eta1-SHCN)].H2O (8.H2O), respectively. The structures of complexes 3.CH2Cl2, 4a.H2O, 4c.2H2O, 5b, 6a, 7 and 8.H2O were determined by X-ray diffraction.
15252586,1,2004,Dalton Trans,Organotin and organogermanium linkers for simple, direct functionalization of polyoxotungstates.,Fifteen Keggin-anion-derived polytungstates [TW11O39[MCH2CH2X]]n- (T = Si, Ge, Ga; M = Sn, Ge; X = COOH, COOCH3, CONH2, CN; n = 5, 6) were prepared in aqueous or aqueous-organic solution from the corresponding lacunary polytungstates and trichlorotin and -germanium precursors, and were isolated as caesium salts. The derivatized polytungstates were characterized by elemental analysis, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry; they are stable in aqueous solution to pH 6-7. NMR spectroscopy revealed the presence of a second (beta1 or beta3) isomer in the tungstogallate derivatives. Acid hydrolysis of the ester and nitrile derivatives could be achieved without decomposition of the polytungstate moieties, and esterification and amidation of the carboxylate functions was straightforward using standard coupling techniques, e.g. the formation, isolation and characterization of [SiW11O39[Ge(CH2)2CONHCH2COOCH3]]5- from glycine methyl ester. Since the Cl3MCH2CH2X precursors are readily accessible by hydrostannation/germanation reactions with the corresponding alkenes, novel coupled polytungstates, such as [(SiW11O39GeCH2CH2COOCH2)4C]20- from pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, can also be prepared.
15209761,1,2004,Diabet Med,Angiopoietic factors and retinopathy in pregnancies complicated with Type 1 diabetes.,AIMS: To evaluate the role of systemic angiopoietic factors in the progression of diabetic retinopathy during pregnancy.METHODS: In a prospective study of 26 pregnant women with diabetes and eight non-diabetic pregnant women, retinopathy was graded from fundus photographs. Plasma levels of angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, human vascular endothelial growth factor A (hVEGF-A), and total soluble receptor of vascular endothelial growth factor (sVEGF) receptor-1 were measured during the first and third trimester and 3 months postpartum.RESULTS: In diabetic women, levels of angiopoietin-2 were 26.5 ng/ml (12.1-47.7) (median and range) during the first trimester, 2.9 ng/ml (0.6-3.5) during the third trimester, and 0.5 ng/ml (0.3-0.7) 3 months postpartum, compared with 44.3 (38.3-61.9), 5.7 (3.1-8.4) and 0.9 (0.6-4.9) ng/ml, respectively, in non-diabetic women (P = 0.002 between groups). Levels of angiopoietin-1 and sVEGF receptor-1 did not differ between the groups. Postpartum hVEGF-A levels were lowest in women with progression of retinopathy. In logistic regression analyses, progression of retinopathy during pregnancy was not explained by the levels of the angiopoietic factors.CONCLUSIONS: The circulating levels of angiopoietic factors in pregnant diabetic women were either lower than (Ang-2) or similar to (Ang-1, hVEGF-A, VEGFR-1) those levels observed in non-diabetic pregnant women. The levels of angiopoietic factors measured here appear not to be connected with the progression of retinopathy during pregnancy.
15186852,1,2004,Bioorg Med Chem,A study of the stability of tri(glucosyloxyphenyl)chlorin, a sensitizer for photodynamic therapy, in human colon tumoural cells: a liquid chromatography and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis.,Asymmetrical glycoconjugated tetrapyrrolic macrocycles are under study as efficient sensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT). In this context, tri(meta-O-beta-glucopyranosyloxyphenyl)chlorin [TPC(m-O-Glu)(3)] 2a/3a was found to be four times more photoactive in vitro than Foscan. In a further study of this interesting glycoconjugate, its metabolism by cellular glycosidases in HT29 cells has to be explored. Cellular extracts of HT29 cells incubated with TPC(m-O-Glu)(3) (24h, 6microM) were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In MALDI-TOF mass spectra, the presence of compounds distinct from TPC(m-O-Glu)(3) (m/z 1151) were observed at m/z 989, 827 and 665 corresponding to the loss of one, two or three glucose units (162u) and were be ascribed to TPC(m-OH)(m-O-Glu)(2) 2/3b,b',b&quot;, TPC(m-OH)(2)(m-O-Glu) 2/3c,c',c&quot; and TPC(m-OH)(3) isomers 2d/3d, respectively. The porphyrins resulting from chlorin oxidation TPP(m-O-Glu)(3) 4a, TPP(m-OH)(m-O-Glu)(2) 4b,b&quot;, TPP(m-OH)(2)(m-O-Glu) 4c,c&quot; and TPP(m-OH)(3) 4d were also observed. The HPLC profile (lambda(anal)=420 nm) showed eight peaks consistent with mass spectra. The kinetics of deglucosylation was studied from HPLC profiles between 1 and 48h incubation. The concentration of triglucoconjugated and diglucoconjugated molecules was maximum around 3 and 8h incubation, respectively, whereas, totally deglucosylated species appeared only after incubation for more than 10h. The fully deglycosylated porphyrin TPP(m-OH)(3) is the final metabolite, being observed at a concentration 15 times higher than that of the remaining TPC(m-O-Glu)(3) 2a/3a. Compared to the photobiological activity of the parent molecule [TPC(m-O-Glu)(3)], a three times higher TPP(m-OH)(3) concentration was necessary to observe a similar in vitro photoactivity.
15181388,1,2004,J Sports Med Phys Fitness,Multicompartment model to assess body composition in professional water polo players.,AIM: The aim of this study was to compare differences between skinfold thicknesses (SK), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), a 2-compartment model (2C), and 2, 3-compartment models (3C) of percent body fat (%BF) assessment with a 4-compartment model (4C) in professional water polo athletes.METHODS: Ten male subjects, 18 to 29 years of age, participated in this study. Under water weighing, deuterium dilution, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were used to provide the required values for the models. The two, 3C models used were established by Withers et al. (3C-W) and by the DXA manufacturers (3C-DXA). 4C was also established by Withers et al.RESULTS: There were no significant differences between 2C, 3C-W, and 3C-DXA when compared with 4C (criterion model). There were no significant differences between 2C and 3C-W. %BF was significantly greater using 2C compared with 3C-DXA. %BF derived from SK and BIA were significantly greater than all otherMETHODS: 4C was best correlated with 3C-W (R2=0.998), followed by 2C (R2=0.806), 3C-DXA (R2=0.5071), SK (R2=0.2945), and BIA (R2=0.2377).CONCLUSION: We conclude that 2C and 3C-W assess %BF equally as well as 4C; however, SK and BIA significantly over-estimated %BF in water polo athletes.
15179179,1,2004,Med Sci Sports Exerc,Effect of race and musculoskeletal development on the accuracy of air plethysmography.,PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of race and musculoskeletal development on the accuracy of estimates of body fatness (%fat) via air displacement plethysmography (AP).METHODS: Estimates of %fat were made via AP, hydrostatic weighing (HW), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and the criterion, a four-component model (4C) in 64 black (B) and white (W) men, who were either resistance trained (RT) or served as controls (C).RESULTS: Based on a three-way ANOVA, there were no statistically significant three-way or race x musculoskeletal development interactions. There was no main effect of race on the validity of estimating %fat by AP; the mean bias between %FatAP and %Fat4C was similar for B (3.6% body fat) and W (3.7%). In addition, the density of the fat-free mass (Dffm) for B (1.098 +/- 0.002 g x mL) was not different than 1.10 g x mL. There was a significant effect of musculoskeletal development on the validity of the estimation of %fat from AP; the mean difference in %fat between %FatAP and %Fat4C was less in RT (1.5% body fat) than in C (5.3%), but a large SEE of 5.5% was observed for RT. A significant (P &lt; 0.05) correlation was found between the mean bias between methods and body volume (-0.44) and mesomorphy (-0.55).CONCLUSIONS: Race does not affect the accuracy of estimating %fat by AP. Race-specific equations estimating %fat via densitometry (e.g., AP, HW) such as the Schutte are not justified, because Dffm is not greater than 1.10 g x mL. Estimation of %fat via AP is more accurate in larger individuals with high musculoskeletal development as a group, but individual results are highly variable.
15064802,1,2004,Org Biomol Chem,1H-1,3-diazepines, 5H-1,3-diazepines, 1,3-diazepinones, and 2,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.0]heptenes.,Tetrazolo[1,5-a]pyridines/2-azidopyridines 1 undergo photochemical nitrogen elimination and ring expansion to 1,3-diazacyclohepta-1,2,4,6-tetraenes 3, which react with alcohols to afford 2-alkoxy-1H-1,3-diazepines 4 (5), with secondary amines to 2-dialkylamino-5H-1,3-diazepines 16, sometimes via isolable 2-dialkylamino-1H-1,3-diazepines 15, and with water to 1,3-diazepin-2-ones 19. The latter are also obtained by elimination of isobutene or propene from 2-tert-butoxy- or 2-isopropoxy-1H-1,3-diazepines 4 or 5. 1,3-Diazepin-2-one 22B and 1,3-diazepin-4-one 24 were obtained from hydrolysis of the corresponding 4-chlorodiazepines. Diazepinones 19 undergo photochemical ring closure to diazabicycloheptenones 25 in high yields. The 2-alkoxy-1H-1,3-diazepines 4 and 5 interconvert by rapid proton exchange between positions N1 and N3. The free energies of activation for the proton exchange were measured by the Forsén-Hoffman method as DeltaG([double dagger])298= 16.2 +/- 0.6 kcal mol(-1) as an average for 4a-c in CD2Cl2, acetone-d6, and methanol-d4, and 14.1 +/- 0.6 kcal mol(-1) for in 4c acetone/D2O. The structures of 2-methoxy-5,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1H-1,3-diazepine 4k, 1,2-dihydro-4-diethylamino-5H-1,3-diazepin-2-one 22bB, and diazabicycloheptanone were 26 determined by X-ray crystallography. The former represents the first reported X-ray crystal structure of any monocyclic N-unsubstituted 1H-azepine.
14987983,1,2004,Farmaco,Anti-HIV-1 activity of pyrryl aryl sulfone (PAS) derivatives: synthesis and SAR studies of novel esters and amides at the position 2 of the pyrrole nucleus.,A SAR study has been performed in order to evaluate how much the ester function could be a determinant for the anti-human immunodeficiency virus type-1 activity of pyrryl aryl sulfones (PASs), a potent family of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors discovered in the last years. Twenty-three new esters were prepared with the aim to enhance the inhibitory potency of 4a and 4c, two PAS agents endowed with good activity (EC50 = 0.14 microM) and deprived of cytotoxicity up to &gt;200 microM. None of test derivatives was as potent as 4a and 4c and lacked of selectivity due to their higher cytotoxicity (compounds 22-25). Antiviral activity correlate with an ester ramified chain.
14987831,1,2004,Eur J Med Chem,Cytotoxic and anticonvulsant aryloxyaryl Mannich bases and related compounds.,A series of 1-(4-aryloxyphenyl)-3-diethylamino-1-propanone hydrochlorides 3a-3e and related compounds 3f, 3g and 4a-4d were synthesised. In addition, a group of 4-(4-aryloxyphenyl)-3-(4-aryloxyphenylcarbonyl)-1-ethyl-4-piperidinol hydrochlorides 6a-6e were prepared which incorporated most of the structural features of 3a-3e. All of these compounds displayed cytotoxic properties towards murine L1210 cells as well as human Molt 4/C8 and CEM T-lymphocytes. A number of these compounds possessed noteworthy potencies towards seven human colon cancer cell lines. Some correlations were noted between the IC(50) values generated in the different screens and the sigma, pi and molar refractivity constants of the aryl substituents as well as with the volumes and solvent accessible surface areas of various basic groups. Molecular modelling of representative compounds revealed structural features, which may have contributed to the varying potencies noted. In general, the compounds in series 6 were well tolerated when administered to mice. Anticonvulsant properties were demonstrated by a number of compounds in the maximal electroshock (MES) screen when administered intraperitoneally to mice while 4c and 6e afforded protection in the MES test when given orally to rats.
14971890,1,2004,J Med Chem,3-(4-Aroyl-1-methyl-1H-2-pyrrolyl)-N-hydroxy-2-propenamides as a new class of synthetic histone deacetylase inhibitors. 2. Effect of pyrrole-C2 and/or -C4 substitutions on biological activity.,Previous SAR studies (Part 1: Mai, A.; et al. J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 512-524) performed on some portions (pyrrole-C4, pyrrole-N1, and hydroxamate group) of 3-(4-benzoyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-N-hydroxy-2-propenamide (1a) highlighted its 4-phenylacetyl (1b) and 4-cynnamoyl (1c) analogues as more potent compounds in inhibiting maize HD2 activity in vitro. In the present paper, we investigated the effect on anti-HD2 activity of chemical substitutions performed on the pyrrole-C2 ethene chains of 1a-c, which were replaced with methylene, ethylene, substituted ethene, and 1,3-butadiene chains (compounds 2). Biological results clearly indicated the unsubstituted ethene chain as the best structural motif to get the highest HDAC inhibitory activity, the sole exception to this rule being the introduction of the 1,3-butadienyl moiety into the 1a chemical structure (IC50(2f) = 0.77 microM; IC50(1a) = 3.8 microM). IC50 values of compounds 3, prepared as 1b homologues, revealed that between benzene and carbonyl groups at the pyrrole-C(4) position a hydrocarbon spacer length ranging from two to five methylenes is well accepted by the APHA template, being that 3a (two methylenes) and 3d (five methylenes) are more potent (2.3- and 1.4-fold, respectively) than 1b, while the introduction of a higher number of methylene units (see 3e,f) decreased the inhibitory activities of the derivatives. Particularly, 3a (IC50 = 0.043 microM) showed the same potency as SAHA in inhibiting HD2 in vitro, and it was 3000- and 2.6-fold more potent than sodium valproate and HC-toxin and was 4.3- and 6-fold less potent than trapoxin and TSA, respectively. Finally, conformationally constrained forms of 1b,c (compounds 4), prepared with the aim to obtain some information potentially useful for a future 3D-QSAR study, showed the same (4a,b) or higher (4c,d) HD2 inhibiting activities in comparison with those of the reference drugs. Molecular modeling and docking calculations on the designed compounds performed in parallel with the chemistry work fully supported the synthetic effort and gave insights into the binding mode of the more flexible APHA derivatives (i.e., 3a). Despite the difference of potency between 1b and 3a in the enzyme assay, the two APHA derivatives showed similar antiproliferative and cytodifferentiating activities in vivo on Friends MEL cells, being that 3a is more potent than 1b in the differentiation assay only at the highest tested dose (48 microM).
15623944,0,2004,Cell Oncol,DNA ploidy and chromosome (FISH) pattern analysis of peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,BACKGROUND AND METHODS: 44 peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) (27 schwannomas, 9 neurofibromas and 8 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST)) were analyzed to determine DNA ploidy pattern and to clarify the conflicting data in the literature concerning this topic (whether benign PNSTs are aneuploid or not). For further insight we analyzed 6 schwannomas, one atypical neurofibroma and five MPNSTs by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique using centromeric chromosome probes (7, 17 and 18) and automatic image analysis station, Metafer 4.RESULTS: Benign schwannomas (including the problematic variants as ancient, cellular, neuroblastoma like and multiplex schwannomas) could be characterized by euploid-polyploidisation and by their 4c peak height value which was usually more than 10% of total cell number measured. These characters were not found among neurofibromas and MPNST-s. FISH analysis revealed and confirmed that the 'normal' euploid-polyploid cells are mainly eusomic-polysomic containing two, four, eight or sixteen signals for each chromosomes examined, but in a small proportion aneusomy was found among tumor cells of benign schwannomas (average: 2.58; range 1.33-3.44). In contrast, the atypical neurofibroma displayed marked aneusomy (18.44%) but it contained normal eusomic and polysomic cells too. Two diploid MPNSTs proved to be clearly aneusomic with trisomy of chromosome 17 and monosomy of chromosome 18.CONCLUSIONS: All these data suggest that ploidy pattern determination combined with FISH analysis may be a very useful supplementary tool for making a right diagnosis (to differentiate benign versus malignant schwannomas in problematic variants) and to understand better the malignant transformation in PNSTs.
15609544,0,2004,Genetica,Identification of RAPD markers, in situ DNA content and structural chromosomal diversity in some legumes of the mangrove flora of Orissa.,Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, karyotypes and 4C DNA content were analyzed in five legume mangroves belonging to the sub-family Papilinoideae (Dalbergia spinosa, Derris heterophylla and D. indica) and Caesalpinioideae (Caesalpinia crista, Cynometra ramiflora) of the family Fabaceae to establish the genetic variability and phylogenetic affinities. Somatic chromosome numbers were reported for the first time in D. spinosa (2n = 20), C. ramiflora (2n = 26) and D. heterophylla (2n = 24) with reconfirmation of the somatic chromosome number in D. indica (2n = 22) and C. crista (2n = 24). Significant intergeneric and interspecific variation of 4C DNA content was observed and that varied from 8.970 pg in C. ramiflora to 28.730 pg in D. indica. From the RAPD analysis, the dendogram showed clustering of Caesalpinia crista and Cynomitra ramiflora into one group (81.80). In the second groups Derris indica and Derris heterophylla were more similar (83.10) than Dalbergia spinosa (85.80). Species-specific DNA markers (900 bp) obtained in D. spinosa from OPN15; 700 and 2000 bp in C. ramiflora from OPN4 and 400 and 800 bp in D. heterophylla and 500 bp DNA fragment in C. crista obtained from OPN-11 were found characteristic RAPD markers of these species. C. crista found more closer affinity to C. ramiflora of the sub-family Caesalpinioideae [genetic distance (1-F) = 0.847]. Derris indica showed closer genetic relation with D. heterophylla [genetic distance (1-F) = 0.856] than D. spinosa [genetic distance (1-F) = 0.876] where Derris and Dalbergia belongs to the sub-family Papilionoideae. By employing these markers the present study has helped to resolve the relationship between the taxonomically diverse leguminous mangroves and study their ability to coexist with mangroves that would shed light on the evolution of mangroves from terrestrial species.
15584984,0,2004,Transfusion,The hepatitis C virus genotype and subtype frequency in hepatitis C virus RNA-positive, hepatitis C virus antibody-negative blood donors identified in the nucleic acid test screening program in Poland.,BACKGROUND: Since 2002, blood donors in Poland have been tested not only for hepatitis C virus antibodies (anti-HCV) but also for HCV RNA or HCV core antigen. This screening program identifies asymptomatic, recently infected individuals with no anti-HCV (in the &quot;window period&quot;). The aim of this study was to compare HCV genotype and subtype distribution in window-period (wp) donors, anti-HCV-positive donors, and chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 2.37 million donors were investigated for HCV RNA, and 340,000 for HCV core antigen. HCV genotypes and subtypes were investigated in 50 HCV RNA-positive, anti-HCV-negative donors; in 70 anti-HCV-positive donors; and in 170 CHC patients. Re-questioning of wp donors for probable risk factors was introduced.RESULTS: HCV RNA was detected in 50 donors of 2.71 million (1:54,200) anti-HCV-negative blood donations. Of these 50 donors, 36 percent exhibited Subtype 1b, whereas Subtypes 3a and 4c/d were identified in 40 and 14 percent, respectively. In anti-HCV-positive donors and CHC patients, the frequency of Subtype 1b was significantly higher (75.7 and 85.3%, respectively); in both groups the lower frequency of Subtypes 3a (14.3 and 10.6%, respectively) and 4c/d (4.3 and 1.2%, respectively) was found. The probable source of infection was identified in 9 wp donors.CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of wp donors is 18.5 per 1 million. The unexpected high frequency of Genotype 4 and Subtype 3a and the low frequency of Subtype 1b was observed in wp donors compared to anti-HCV-positive individuals. Additional epidemiologic questioning introduced after HCV RNA detection may help to identify infection source.
15582459,0,2004,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of 4H-1,4-benzothiazine-2-carbonitrile 1,1-dioxide and N-(2-cyanomethylsulfonylphenyl)acylamide derivatives as potential activators of ATP sensitive potassium channels.,1,2,4-Thiadiazine derivatives, like 3-methyl-7-chlorobenzo-4H-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide, diazoxide and 7-chloro-3-isopropylamino-4H-benzo-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide, BPDZ 73, are potent openers of Kir6.2/SUR1 K(ATP) channels. To explore the structure-activity relationship of this series of K(ATP) openers, 4H-1,4-benzothiazine-2-carbonitrile 1,1-dioxide and N-(2-cyanomethylsulfonylphenyl)acylamide derivatives were synthesized from 2-acetylamino-5-chloro-benzenesulfonic acid pyridinium salt or 2-aminobenzenethiols. The 4H-1,4-benzothiazine-2-carbonitrile 1,1-dioxide derivatives (e.g., 7-chloro-3-isopropylamino-4H-1,4-benzothiazine-2-carbonitrile 1,1-dioxide, 3f) were found to activate K(ATP) channels as indicated by their ability to hyperpolarize beta cell membrane potential, to inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin release in vitro and to increase ion currents through Kir6.2/SUR1 channel as measured by patch clamp. The potency and efficacy of, for example, 3f is however significantly reduced compared to the corresponding 4H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxide derivatives. Opening of the 4H-1,2,4-thiadiazine ring to get (e.g., 2-cyanomethylsulfonyl-4-fluorophenyl) carbamic acid isopropyl ester (4c) gives rise to compounds, which are able to open K(ATP) channels but with considerable reduced potency compared to, for example, diazoxide. Compound 3a, 7-chloro-3-methyl-4H-1,4-benzothiazine-2-carbonitrile 1,1-dioxide, which inhibits insulin release in vitro from beta cells and rat islets, reduces plasma insulin levels and blood pressure in anaesthetized rats upon intravenous administration.
15558133,0,2004,Dalton Trans,Formation and reactions of metal-metal bonded heterobimetallic (C5H4PR2)-bridged (Zr-Ir) and (Zr-Rh) complexes: evidence for the participation of metal hydride intermediates.,Treatment of the complexes [(C(5)H(4)PR(2))(2)Zr(CH(3))(2)](b: R = isopropyl; c: R = cyclohexyl) with the reagent HIr(CO)(PPh(3))(3) (2b) yield the heterobimetallic complexes [mu-C(5)H(4)PR(2))(2)(H(3)C-Zr-Ir(CO)(PPh(3)))] (4b, 4c) with evolution of methane. The reaction of the -PPh(2) substituted analogue with initially yields an intermediate [(H(3)C)(2)Zr(mu-C(5)H(4)PPh(2))(2)Ir(H)(CO)(PPh(3))] 5a, that still contains both methyl groups at zirconium and does not contain a metal-metal bond. At room temperature, the intermediate reacts further with methane formation to eventually yield the (Zr-Ir) complex 4a. The corresponding [mu-C(5)H(4)PR(2))(2)(H(3)C-Zr-Rh(CO)(PPh(3)))] complexes 3a (R = Ph) and 3b (R = isopropyl) react cleanly with isopropyl alcohol to liberate methane and yield the corresponding [mu-C(5)H(4)PR(2))(2)(Me(2)CHO-Zr-Rh(CO)(PPh(3)))] products (7a, 7b). Carefully monitoring the reaction of with Me(2)CHOH by NMR revealed that the Zr-Rh functionality is attacked first to give the intermediate [Me(Me(2)CHO)Zr([micro sign]-C(5)H(4)PR(2))(2)Rh(H)(CO)(PPh(3))] (6b). This intermediate then reacts further to cleave off methane and re-form the (Zr-Rh) metal-metal bond to yield the product 7b. The tetrametallic mu-oxo-(Zr-Rh) metallocene derivate 11a was obtained starting from the (Zr-Rh) complex 3a and it was characterized by X-ray diffraction. It may be that this reaction is also initiated by H-OH addition to the [Zr-Rh] metal-metal bond.

The gold(I) compounds Q(2)[Au(2)(mu-kappa(2)-S,S-S(2)C=C(C(12)H(6)R(2)-2,7))(2)], where Q(+) = PPN(+) or Pr(4)N(+) for R = H (Q(2)4a) or Q(+) = Pr(4)N(+) for R = OC(8)H(17) [(Pr(4)N)(2)4c], were synthesized by reacting Q[AuCl(2)] with 1a or 2 (1:1) and excess piperidine or diethylamine. Complexes of the type [(Au(PR'3))(2)(mu-kappa(2)-S,S-S(2)C=C(C(12)H(6)R(2)-2,7))(2)] with R = H and R' = Me (5a), Et (5b), Ph (5c), and Cy (5d) or R = t-Bu and R' = Me (5e), Et (5f), Ph (5g), and Cy (5h) were obtained by reacting [AuCl(PR'(3))] with 1a,b (1:2) and piperidine. The reactions of 1a,b or 2 with Q[AuCl(4)] (2:1) and piperidine or diethylamine gave Q[Au(kappa(2)-S,S-S(2)C=C(C(12)H(6)R(2)-2,7))(2)] with Q(+) = PPN(+) for R = H [(PPN)6a], Q(+) = PPN(+) or Bu(4)N(+) for R = t-Bu (Q6b), and Q(+) = Bu(4)N(+) for R = OC(8)H(17) [(Bu(4)N)6c]. Complexes Q6a-c reacted with excess triflic acid to give [Au(kappa(2)-S,S-S(2)C=C(C(12)H(6)R(2)-2,7))(kappa(2)-S,S-S(2)CCH(C(12)H(6)R(2)-2,7))] [R = H (7a), t-Bu (7b), OC(8)H(17) (7c)]. By reaction of (Bu(4)N)6b with PhICl(2) (1:1) the complex Bu(4)N[AuCl(2)(kappa(2)-S,S-S(2)C=C(C(12)H(6)(t-Bu)(2)-2,7))] [(Bu(4)N)8b] was obtained. The dithioato complexes [Au(SC(S)CH(C(12)H(8)))(PCy(3))] (9) and [Au(n)(S(2)CCH(C(12)H(8)))(n)] (10) were obtained from the reactions of 1a with [AuCl(PCy(3))] or [AuCl(SMe(2))], respectively (1:1), in the absence of a base.

The crystal structures of 5c.THF, 5e.(2)/(3)CH(2)Cl(2), 5g.CH(2)Cl(2), (PPN)6a.2Me(2)CO, and 11b were solved by X-ray diffraction studies. All the gold(I) complexes here described are photoluminescent at 77 K, and their emissions can be generally ascribed to LMMCT (Q(2)4a,c, 5a-h, 10) or LMCT (9) excited states.

In the case of palladium, the corresponding iodo analogues (6a-c) were readily synthesized in a one-pot reaction from [Pd2(dba)3], iodopentafluorobenzene, and the appropriate ligand. The platinum complexes 4c-d were then converted to the water complexes [Pt(L-L)(C6F5)(OH2)]OTf (L-L =dmpe 7a; dcpe 7b)via reaction with AgOTf in the presence of water. Attempts to convert the palladium complexes 3c-d to the corresponding water complexes resulted in the disproportionation of the intermediate water complex to form [Pd(L-L)(C6F5)2] (L-L=dmpe 8) or [Pd(L-L)2][OTf]2(L-L=dcpe 9). Upon standing in solution for prolonged periods, complex 7a undergoes an identical disproportionation reaction to the Pd analogues to form [Pt(L-L)(C6F5)2] (L-L=dmpe 10). Complexes 4c and 4d were converted to the corresponding hydrides (11b-c, respectively) using two different hydride sources: 11a was formed by the reaction of with NaBH4 in refluxing THF, while 11b was synthesized in near quantitative yield using [Cp2ZrH2] in refluxing THF. Attempts to synthesize eta2-tetrafluorobenzyne complexes [Pt(L-L)(C6F4)] (L-L=dmpe, dcpe) from reaction of 11a-b with butyllithium were unsuccessful. The molecular structures of 3a,4a, 4c, 4d, 6b, 7a, 8, 11b and have been determined by X-ray crystallographic studies, and are discussed.
15472467,0,2004,J Vet Med Sci,Generation of monoclonal antibodies to porcine interleukin 6 (PIL-6) using the recombinant PIL-6 expressed in Escherichia coli.,Porcine interleukin-6 (PIL-6) protein without signal peptide was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was expressed in an insoluble fraction, however, it was solubilized by refolding procedure using urea. From the solubilized protein, the recombinant PIL-6 (rPIL-6) was purified by a batch method using glutathione sepharose 4B and PreScission protease cleavage. By the B3B1 hybridoma cell proliferation assay, biological activity of the purified rPIL-6 was confirmed. Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) named 2B-1, 5A-8 and 4C-3 were generated by using the rPIL-6 as an immunogen. Immunoglobulin isotypes of the MAbs were IgG2a (4C-3) and IgG2b (2B-1 and 5A-8). For the epitope analysis, additive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot analysis using deletion mutants of PIL-6 were performed. These experiments revealed that the two MAbs (2B-1 and 5A-8) recognize an overlapped epitope and the other (4C-3) recognizes a distinct epitope, and all epitopes reside in the region of aa26-64 of PIL-6.
15453739,0,2004,J Am Chem Soc,Unique oxidative metal-metal bond formation of linearly aligned tetranuclear Rh-Mo-Mo-Rh clusters.,Reaction of Mo2(pyphos)4 (1) with [RhCl(CO)2]2 followed by treatment of excess amounts of tBuNC resulted in the clean formation of [Mo2Rh2(tBuNC)4(pyphos)4](X)2 (4a; X = Cl). The X-ray diffraction study as well as spectroscopic analyses of 4c (X = BPh4) implied that there is no direct sigma-bonding interaction between each Rh(I) atom and the Mo2 core. Each Rh(I) atom in 4 can be oxidized concurrently by 2 equiv of [Cp2Fe]PF6 to afford [Mo2Rh2(Cl)2(tBuNC)4(pyphos)4](PF6)2 (5) along with the formation of two Mo-Rh(II) single bonds and the reduction of the bond orders of the Mo-Mo moiety.
15367775,0,2004,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Applicability and limitations of the Adam mathematical phantom with respect to radiological protection.,Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of radiation transport is applied to an anthropomorphic mathematical (ADAM) or Zubal's voxel phantom, representing a male adult. The purpose is to compare absorbed energy in various organs (liver, kidneys, lungs, pancreas, spleen, adrenals and heart) in the simplified (mathematical) and more realistic (voxel) anatomy. A broad beam of monodirectional and monoenergetic photons (20 keV to 10 MeV), perpendicular to the longitudinal body axis, is incident on the front (AP) or the back (PA) of the phantom. Two MC codes, MCNP-4C and MCNPX-2.1.5, are used for the calculations. Specific absorbed fraction as a function of energy reflects the shielding of an organ by other organs. Comparison of the results for the two phantoms enables an evaluation of the applicability and the limitations of ADAM with respect to radiological protection. The cases studied indicate no urgent need to replace the (commonly used) mathematical phantom by a more sophisticated voxel phantom.
15353738,0,2004,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Methodology for worker neutron exposure evaluation in the PDCF facility design.,A project headed by Washington Group International is meant to design the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF) to convert the plutonium pits from excessed nuclear weapons into plutonium oxide for ultimate disposition. Battelle staff are performing the shielding calculations that will determine appropriate shielding so that the facility workers will not exceed target exposure levels. The target exposure levels for workers in the facility are 5 mSv y(-1) for the whole body and 100 mSv y(-1) for the extremity, which presents a significant challenge to the designers of a facility that will process tons of radioactive material. The design effort depended on shielding calculations to determine appropriate thickness and composition for glove box walls, and concrete wall thicknesses for storage vaults. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) staff used ORIGEN-S and SOURCES to generate gamma and neutron source terms, and Monte Carlo (computer code for) neutron photon (transport) (MCNP-4C) to calculate the radiation transport in the facility. The shielding calculations were performed by a team of four scientists, so it was necessary to develop a consistent methodology. There was also a requirement for the study to be cost-effective, so efficient methods of evaluation were required. The calculations were subject to rigorous scrutiny by internal and external reviewers, so acceptability was a major feature of the methodology. Some of the issues addressed in the development of the methodology included selecting appropriate dose factors, developing a method for handling extremity doses, adopting an efficient method for evaluating effective dose equivalent in a non-uniform radiation field, modelling the reinforcing steel in concrete, and modularising the geometry descriptions for efficiency. The relative importance of the neutron dose equivalent compared with the gamma dose equivalent varied substantially depending on the specific shielding conditions and lessons were learned from this effect. This paper addresses these issues and the resulting methodology.
15353625,0,2004,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Characteristics of the neutron field of the facility at DIN-UPM.,A new source facility (241Am-Be) has been installed in a bunker-type room of large dimensions. To characterise the neutron fields in the facility, detailed calculations have been made with MCNP-4C, showing the different components of the neutron radiation reaching the reference points (direct, inscattered, backscattered). The contribution from neutrons scattered in the walls to the total ambient dose equivalent remains reasonably low (&lt;10%) in the reference points. Additionally, spectra measurements have been performed with a Bonner spheres spectrometer with a 6LiI(Eu) scintillator (0.4 phi x 0.4 cm2), UTA4 response matrix and BUNKIUT unfolding code. The calculated and experimentally obtained spectra are compared, with small differences found in the epithermal and thermal region, attributable to the concrete composition used in the calculations. The H*(10) rate has been determined from the spectra, and then compared to the reading of an active dosemeter (LB6411), with differences found lower than 8%.
15352810,0,2004,J Chem Phys,Rovibrational distributions of HF in the photodissociation of vinyl fluoride at 193 nm: a direct MP2 quasiclassical trajectory study.,Quasiclassical trajectory calculations were performed to calculate rovibrational distributions of the nascent HF fragment in the photodissociation of vinyl fluoride at 193 nm. The trajectories were initiated at the transition states of the four-center (4C) and three-center (3C) HF elimination channels, using a microcanonical, quasiclassical normal-mode sampling. In general, the calculated distributions are in reasonably good agreement with experiment. In particular, the trajectory distributions show bimodal character, although not as pronounced as that observed experimentally. The calculations predict that the 3C and 4C distributions are rather similar to each other, which suggests that the low-J and high-J components of the rotational distributions cannot be specifically assigned to each of these channels.
15350597,0,2004,Cell Biol Int,Karyotype analyses and studies on the nuclear DNA content in 30 genotypes of potato (Solanum tuberosum) L.,The cytophotometric estimation of 4C DNA content, and karyotypic and somatic chromosome number analyses were carried out in 30 genotypes comprising seven cultivars and 23 advanced breeding lines of Solanum tuberosum. Detailed karyotype analysis revealed genotype specific chromosomal characteristics and structural alterations in chromosomes of the genome, with a rare phenomenon of aneusomatic (2n = 4x + 2 = 50) condition in cv.K. Chandramukhi. The origin of this variation could be attributed to mitotic non-disjunction in the shoots giving rise to aneusomatic roots. Highly significant variations in the genome length, volume and total form percentage were noted at the cultivar level. The total chromosome length varied from 84.56 microm in cv.K. Pukhraj to 127.62 microm in MS/89-60, with an average value of 100.94 microm +/- 1.82. Total chromosome volume varied from 57.22 microm3 in MS/92-1090 to 132.64 microm3 in JW-160. Significant variations in the 4C DNA content (7.28-15.83 pg) were recorded at the cultivar level, with an exceptionally high DNA content (22.24 pg) in cv.K. Chandramukhi. This could be due to the aneusomatic condition of this genotype. Correlation studies revealed interdependence between the chromosomal and nuclear parameters of the genotypes. Structural alterations in the chromosomes, as well as loss or addition of highly repetitive sequences in the genome, caused variations in DNA content at the cultivar level. Variations in genomic structure and nuclear DNA content of the 48-chromosome genotypes suggest a genetic drift during microevolution, leading to the development of new cultivars.
15341672,0,2004,BMC Cell Biol,Systemic endopolyploidy in Spathoglottis plicata (Orchidaceae) development.,BACKGROUND: Endopolyploidy is developmentally regulated. Presence of endopolyploidy as a result of endoreduplication has been characterized in insects, mammals and plants. The family Orchidaceae is the largest among the flowering plants. Many of the members of the orchid family are commercially micropropagated. Very little has been done to characterize the ploidy variation in different tissues of the orchid plants during development.RESULTS: The DNA contents and ploidy level of nuclei extracted from various tissues of a tropical terrestrial orchid Spathoglottis plicata were examined by flow cytometry. Sepals, petals and ovary tissues were found to have only a 2C (C, DNA content of the unreplicated haploid chromosome complement) peak. Columns, floral pedicels of newly open flowers and growing flower stems were observed to have an endopolyploid 8C peak in addition to 2C and 4C peaks. In developing floral pedicels, four peaks were observed for 2C, 4C, 8C and 16C. In root tips, there were 2C, 4C and 8C peaks. But in the root tissues at the region with root hairs, only a 2C peak was observed. Nuclei extracted from young leaves shown three peaks for 2C, 4C and 8C. A similar pattern was found in the vegetative tissues of both greenhouse-grown plants and tissue-cultured plantlets. In mature leaves, a different pattern of ploidy level was found at different parts of the leaves. In the leaf tips and middle parts, there were 2C and 4C peaks. Only at the basal part of the leaves, there were three peaks for 2C, 4C and 8C.CONCLUSIONS: Systemic variation of cellular endopolyploidy in different tissues during growth and development of Spathoglottis plicata from field-grown plants and in vitro cultures was identified. The implication of the findings was discussed.
15339417,0,2004,Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao,[Effect of soybean isoflavones on heart function of rats with adriamycin-induced heart failure].,OBJECTIVE: To observe the protective effect of soybean isoflavones (SI) on the heart function of the rats with adriamycin induced heart failure.METHODS: Thirty adult male SD rats were divided into 5 groups:normal control (NC) group, adriamycin (ADR) group, L-SI group, M-SI group and H-SI group. SI of 30, 60, 120 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) was orally administered through a stomach tube once a day for 6 days in L-SI group, M-SI group and H-SI group, respectively. The other two groups were given the same amount of normal saline the same way. Then ADR of 10 mg/kg was given intraperitoneally once to copy the model of heart-failure. The MedLab-U/4c biological signal collecting system was used to record and analyze the LVSP of the rats. The pathological changes of the cardiomyocytes were observed.RESULTS: As compared with NC group, the LVSP,+/-dp/dt max, Vpm of the ADR group were significantly lower (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01), but those of the H-SI group were markedly higher than those of the ADR group (P&lt;0.01). Electron microscopic morphometry of the heart samples of the rats in ADR group revealed typical alterations, consisting an increase of collagen content, vacuolation, diminishing of the cardiomyocyte diameter, alteration of myofilaments and Z-lines of myofibers, and myofibrillar degeneration. SI of 120 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) treatment could prevent the loss of myofibrillae and the reduction of myocyte diameter, and the degeneration of myofilaments and Z-lines were reversed by SI.CONCLUSION: SI of 120 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) treatment can relieve the toxic effect of ADR on myocardium, and also obviously improve the cardiac contractility of heart-failure rats.

Alkylation of 1 with PhCH(2)MgCl proceeded in high yield to liberate PMe(3) and give the 18-electron pi-benzyl complex Cp(dmpe)Mo(eta(3)-CH(2)Ph) (2). Variable temperature NMR experiments provided evidence that 2 is in equilibrium with its 16-electron eta(1)-benzyl isomer [Cp(dmpe)Mo(eta(1)-CH(2)Ph)]. This was further supported by reaction of 2 with CO to yield the carbonyl benzyl complex Cp(dmpe)(CO)Mo(eta(1)-CH(2)Ph) (3). Complex 2 was found to react with disubstituted silanes H(2)SiRR' (RR' = Me(2), Et(2), MePh, and Ph(2)) to form toluene and the silylene complexes Cp(dmpe)Mo(H)(SiRR') (4a: RR' = Me(2); 4b: RR' = Et(2); 4c: RR' = MePh; 4d: RR' = Ph(2)). Reactions of 2 with monosubstituted silanes H(3)SiR (R = Ph, Mes, Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) produced rare examples of hydrosilylene complexes Cp(dmpe)Mo(H)Si(H)R (5a: R = Ph; 5b: R = Mes; 5c: R = CH(2)Ph). Reactivity of complexes 4a-c and 5a-d is dominated by 1,2-hydride migration from metal to silicon, and these complexes possess H.Si bonding interactions, as supported by spectroscopic and structural data. For example, the J(HSi) coupling constants in these species range in value from 30 to 48 Hz and are larger than would be expected in the absence of H.Si bonding. A neutron diffraction study on a single crystal of diethylsilylene complex 4b unequivocally determined the hydride ligand to be in a bridging position across the molybdenum-silicon bond (Mo-H 1.85(1) A, Si-H 1.68(1) A). The synthesis and reactivity properties of these complexes are described in detail.
15305461,0,2004,Med Phys,Monte carlo simulation of the compton scattering technique applied to characterize diagnostic x-ray spectra.,The quality control of x-ray tubes for medical radiodiagnostic services is very important for such devices. Therefore, the development of new procedures to characterize the x-ray primary beam is highly interesting in order to obtain an accurate assessment of the actual photon spectrum. The Compton scattering technique is very useful to determine x-ray spectra (in the 10-150 kVp range), avoiding a pile-up effect in the detector since a large room is not usually available to apply other techniques. In this work, this process has been simulated using a Monte Carlo code, MCNP 4C. Some geometrical models have been developed and different techniques have been studied in order to improve statistics and accuracy in the acquisition of Pulse Height Distribution (PHD). The effect of both the collimation of the primary beam and the scattering angle of the spectrometer has been analyzed. Results obtained using simulation models have been compared with experimental measurements.
15303368,0,2004,Folia Biol (Krakow),Various DNA content in myotube nuclei during myotomal myogenesis in Hymenochirus boettgeri (Anura: Pipidae).,During myotomal myogenesis in Hymenochirus boettgeri primary myoblasts differentiate into morphologically and functionally mature, mononucleate myotubes. Further muscle development in the studied species is due to fusion of mesenchymal cells with the latter, resulting in the presence of two classes of nuclei in the myotube: large of myotomal origin and small of mesenchymal origin. Densitometric measurements of DNA content revealed that the myotube nuclei at stages 35 reached values close to 4C DNA (3, 3C DNA), while at a later stage (42) the values were equal to 4C. Conversely, the secondary myoblast nuclei following the fusion with the myotube at stage 42 had 2C DNA--a content comparable to that found in erythrocyte nuclei. PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)--marker of S-phase of cell cycle, detected in the myotube nuclei (at stages 35, 42) appears during DNA replication.

15257554,0,2004,Hum Pathol,Comparison of DNA ploidy status and DNA ploidy-related parameters in malignant melanoma tissue microarrays and full sections.,A new high-throughput tissue-arraying technique, now frequently used in tumor pathology, requires standardization of methods of DNA analysis, previously applied in full histological sections. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate DNA ploidy status and DNA ploidy-related parameters using the CAS200 image analyzer in malignant melanoma tissue microarrays and to compare them with full histological sections. Comparison of DNA ploidy-related parameters, including percentage of diploid cells, percentage of aneuploid cells between 2c and 4c, percentage of tetraploid cells, percentage of aneuploid cells between 4c and 8c, percentage of octaploid cells, percentage of 16-ploid cells, and 5c exceeding rate, did not reveal any significant differences between malignant melanoma tissue microarrays and full sections. The DNA ploidy status according to Auer differed in 1 out of 59 cases investigated. Our study demonstrated that it is possible to evaluate DNA ploidy status and DNA ploidy-related parameters in tissue microarrays, which is of practical relevance to tumor pathology.

The pyridinium-derived N-heterocyclic carbene complexes display localized C-C and C-N bonds within the pyridinium ligand that are indicative of carbene pi-acidity. The significantly shortened platinum-carbon distance, for &quot;parent&quot; complex 1b, together with NMR parameters and the nu(CO) values for carbonyl cations 1d-4d support a degree of Pt-C10 multiple bonding, increasing in the order 3 &lt; 4 &lt; 2 &lt; 1. Degenerate DMSO exchange kinetics have been determined to establish the nature and magnitude of the trans-labilizing ability of these new N-heterocyclic carbene ligands. Exceptionally large second-order rate constants (k(2) = 6.5 +/- 0.4 M(-1).s(-1) (3c) to 2300 +/- 500 M(-1).s(-1) (1c)) were measured at 25 degrees C using (1)H NMR magnetization transfer kinetics and variable temperature line shape analysis. These rate constants are as much as 4 orders of magnitude greater than those of a series of structurally similar cationic bis(nitrogen)-donor complexes [(N-N)Pt(CH(3))(DMSO)](+) reported earlier, and a factor of 32 to 1800 faster than an analogous charge neutral complex derived from cyclometalated 2-phenylpyridine, (C(11)H(8)N)Pt(CH(3))(DMSO) (k(2) = 0.21 +/- 0.02 M(-1).s(-1) (6c)). The differences in rate constant are discussed in terms of ground state versus transition state energies. Comparison of the platinum-sulfur distances with second order rate constants suggests that differences in the transition-state energy are largely responsible for the range of rate constants measured. The pi-accepting ability and trans-influence of the carbene donor are proposed as the origin of the large acceleration in associative ligand substitution rate.
15196004,0,2004,Biol Chem,New protease inhibitors from buckwheat seeds: properties, partial amino acid sequences and possible biological role.,Preparations of new low molecular weight protein inhibitors of serine proteinases have been obtained from buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum seeds by chromatography of seed extracts on trypsin-Sepharose 4B, Mono-Q and Mono-S ion-exchangers. Their molecular masses, determined by mass spectrometry, were equal to 5203 (BWI-1c), 5347 (BWI-2c), 7760 (BWI-3c) and 6031 daltons (BWI-4c). All inhibitors possessed high pH-stability in the pH range 2-12 and thermostability. In addition to trypsin, BWI-3c and BWI-4c inhibitors inhibited chymotrypsin and subtilisin-like proteases. The inhibition constants (Ki) for trypsin, chymotrypsin and subtilisin by the studied inhibitors were determined. The N-terminal sequences of all inhibitors were established: BWI-1c (23 residues), BWI-2c (33 residues), BWI-3c (18 residues) and BWI-4c (20 residues). According to the physicochemical properties and N-terminal amino acid sequences, buckwheat seed protease inhibitors BWI-3c and BWI-4c are suggested to belong to the potato proteinase inhibitor I family.
15192832,0,2004,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,[New mutations of the 12th exon of CCM1 gene in Chinese patients with intracranial cavernous angiomas].,OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of CCM1 gene mutations in Chinese patients with intracranial cavernous angiomas(ICCA).METHODS: Twenty-one ICCA patients confirmed by pathology after operations in hospital from June 2002 to Feb.2003 and 15 healthy individuals as contrast were recruited. The peripheral venous blood samples of all the individuals were collected, and then DNA was extracted from the blood samples followed by amplification of exon 12 and some of its intron sequence using PCR. After purification, the PCR products were directly sequenced by ABI PRISM377 sequencing instrument.RESULTS: Three mutations of CCM1 gene were found in 5 patients and reported firstly. There existed a missense mutation of 1172C--&gt;T in exon 12 in 5 patients, which led the No.391 amino acid of KRIT1 protein, serine, to phenyalanine. There existed a missense mutation of 1160A--&gt;C in one patient, which led the No.387 amino acid, glutamine, to proline. Another mutation was an intronic mutation of IVS12-4C--&gt;T in 4 patients. In contrast no mutations were found.CONCLUSION: The authors firstly report that mutations of CCM1 gene in exon 12 also exist in Chinese ICCA patients and those mutations are related with the occurring of ICCA.
15191284,0,2004,Med Phys,Monte Carlo modeling of a high-sensitivity MOSFET dosimeter for low- and medium-energy photon sources.,Metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) dosimeters are increasingly utilized in radiation therapy and diagnostic radiology. While it is difficult to characterize the dosimeter responses for monoenergetic sources by experiments, this paper reports a detailed Monte Carlo simulation model of the High-Sensitivity MOSFET dosimeter using Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) 4C. A dose estimator method was used to calculate the dose in the extremely thin sensitive volume. Efforts were made to validate the MCNP model using three experiments: (1) comparison of the simulated dose with the measurement of a Cs-137 source, (2) comparison of the simulated dose with analytical values, and (3) comparison of the simulated energy dependence with theoretical values. Our simulation results show that the MOSFET dosimeter has a maximum response at about 40 keV of photon energy. The energy dependence curve is also found to agree with the predicted value from theory within statistical uncertainties. The angular dependence study shows that the MOSFET dosimeter has a higher response (about 8%) when photons come from the epoxy side, compared with the kapton side for the Cs-137 source.
15190820,0,2004,Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue,[Effects of SNP and L-NAME on spermatogenesis in rats].,OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of nitric oxide(NO) on the DNA ploidy of germ cells and to evaluate the role of NO in modulating spermatogenesis by using SNP, a donor of NO and N-nitro-l-arginine-mythel-ester(L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthese(NOS) in rats physically in vivo.METHODS: Forty adult male, Sprague-Dawley rats (60-70 days) were divided into four groups, and injected ultraperitoneally with one of the following agents (once a day, for 12 days): SNP, L-NAME and SNP + L-NAME with normal saline. Two hours after the last injection the rats were sacrificed. The sera were collected and stored at -70 degrees C for subsequent hormone assay. The concentration of serum testosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay. Serum NOx- (nitrite/nitrate) concentration was measured by Greiss method. DNA of spermatogenic cells was detected by flow cytometry(FCM), and the percentage of 1c, 2c and 4c germ cells calculated.RESULTS: In the SNP treatment group, the serum concentration of NOx- was higher, testosterone concentration was lower and the number of 1c cells was smaller compared with the control group. However, in rats treated with L-NAME, the concentration of NOx- was significantly lower, testosterone concentration was higher and the number of 1c cells was larger compared with the control group(P &lt; 0.01). No changes were observed in the SNP + L-NAME group.CONCLUSION: Enhancing ectogenous NO will suppress spermatogenesis while inhibiting NO productive pathway will promote it.
15180416,0,2004,Inorg Chem,Synthesis of carbaalane halogen derivatives.,The carbaalane halogen derivatives [(AlX)(6)(AlNMe(3))(2)(CCH(2)CH(2)SiMe(3))(6)] (X = F (9), Cl (7), Br (10), I (11)) were prepared in toluene from [(AlH)(6)(AlNMe(3))(2)(CCH(2)CH(2)SiMe(3))(6)] (6) and BF(3).OEt(2), BX(3) (X = Br, I), Me(3)SnF, and Me(3)SiX (X = Cl, Br, I), respectively. A partially halogenated product [(AlH)(2)(AlX)(4)(AlNMe(3))(2)(CCH(2)CH(2)SiMe(3))(6)] (12) (X = Cl (approximately 40%), Br (approximately 60%)) was obtained from 5 and impure BBr(3). [(AlH)(6)(AlNMe(3))(2)(CCH(2)Ph)(6)] (5) was converted to [(AlX)(6)(AlNMe(3))(2)(CCH(2)Ph)(6)] (X = F (13), Cl (14), Br (15), I (16)) using BF(3).OEt(2) and Me(3)SiX (X = Cl, Br, I), respectively. The X-ray single-crystal structures of 11.C(6)H(6), 12.3C(7)H(8), 13.6C(7)H(8), and 15.4C(7)H(8) were determined. Compounds 7 and 9-11 are soluble in benzene/toluene and could be well characterized by NMR spectroscopy and MS (EI) spectrometry. The results demonstrate the facile substitution of the hydridic hydrogen atoms in 5 and 6 by the halides with different reagents.
15170382,0,2004,Biochemistry (Mosc),Cationic inhibitors of serine proteinases from buckwheat seeds: study of their interaction with exogenous proteinases.,The inhibition of exogenous serine proteinases of different origin by cationic protease inhibitors BWI-1c, -2c, -3c, and -4c from buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) seeds has been studied. High efficiency of the inhibitors in binding bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin as well as their broad antiprotease effect, including inhibition of proteinases secreted by fungi and bacteria, has been demonstrated. According to the data obtained, it is proposed that cationic inhibitors from buckwheat seeds may participate in the defense of plants against fungal and bacterial infection.
15154813,0,2004,Inorg Chem,Diimine-acetylide compounds of ruthenium: the structural and spectroscopic effects of oxidation.,The reaction of Ru(Me(2)bipy)(PPh(3))(2)Cl(2) 1 with terminal alkynes HCCR in the presence of TlPF(6) leads to the formation of the vinylidene compounds [Ru(Me(2)bipy)(PPh(3))(2)Cl(=C=CHR)][PF(6)] (2) (2a, R = Bu(t); 2b, R = p-C(6)H(4)-Me; 2c, R = Ph). These compounds decompose in oxygenated solution to form the carbonyl compound [Ru(Me(2)bipy)(PPh(3))(2)Cl(CO)][PF(6)] (3), and may be deprotonated by K(2)CO(3) to give the ruthenium(II) terminal acetylide compounds Ru(Me(2)bipy)(PPh(3))(2)Cl(CC-R) (4) (4a, R = Bu(t); 4b, R = p-C(6)H(4)-Me; 4c, R = Ph). Cyclic voltammetry shows that 2a-c may also be reductively dehydrogenated to form 4a-c. 4a-c are readily oxidized to their ruthenium(III) analogues [4a](+)-[4c](+), and the changes seen in their UV/visible spectra upon performing this oxidation are analyzed. These show that whereas the UV/visible spectra of 4a-c show MLCT bands from the ruthenium atom to the bipyridyl ligand, those of [4a](+)-[4c](+) contain LMCT bands originating on the acetylide ligands. This is in agreement with the IR and ESR spectra of [4a](+)-[4c](+). The X-ray crystal structures of the redox pair 4a and [4a][PF(6)()] have been determined, allowing the bonding within the metal-acetylide unit to be analyzed, and an attempt is made to determine Lever electrochemical parameters (E(L)) for the vinylidene and acetylide ligands seen herein. Room temperature luminescence measurements on 4a-c show that the compounds are not strongly emissive.

15066579,0,2004,Mutat Res,Bacterial mutagenicity of the three isomeric dicyclopenta-fused pyrenes: the effects of dicyclopenta topology.,Cyclopenta[cd]pyrene (1) and its congeners dicyclopenta[cd,mn]- (2), dicyclopenta[cd,fg]- (3), dicyclopenta[cd,jk]pyrene (4), which were all identified as constituents of combustion exhausts, as well as their partially hydrogenated derivatives 3,4-dihydrocyclopenta[cd]- (5), 1,2,4,5-tetrahydrodicyclopenta[cd,mn]- (6), 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrodicyclopenta[cd,fg]- (7) and 1,2,6,7-tetrahydrodicyclopenta[cd,jk]pyrene (8), were assayed for mutagenicity in the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 using different concentrations of microsomal protein in the metabolic activation system (S9-mix, with S9-fraction from liver of Aroclor-1254-treated rats: 2, 4 and 10% (v/v), respectively). Whereas a positive mutagenic response is found for 1-4 in the presence of S9-mix, 5-8 exert no mutagenicity either with or without S9-mix. Since for 1-4 the highest response is observed with S9-mix 2% (v/v) instead of the standard 4% (v/v), a one-step activation pathway, i.e. epoxidation of the five-membered ring olefinic bonds, appears to be operational. Surprisingly, 3 and, to a lesser extent, 2 (11.7 versus 4.2 His revertants/nmol) also give a positive response in the absence of S9-mix. Hence, 2 and 3 are expected to contribute to the direct-acting mutagenicity of the non-polar fraction of combustion exhausts. Presumably for the direct-acting mutagenicity one-electron transfer processes play a role in bioactivation. The experimental observations are supported by semi-empirical AM1 calculations on the possible ultimate metabolites, i.e. mono-epoxides (2a-4a), cis-di-epoxides (2b-4b) and trans-di-epoxides (2c-4c) and the related mono-hydroxy carbocations (2d-4d and 2e-4e), and the radical anions 1*(-)-4*(-).

15010740,0,2004,Can J Cardiol,Two-dimensional echocardiography estimation of right ventricular ejection fraction by wall motion score index.,BACKGROUND: Radionuclide angiography (RNA) and echocardiography (biplane Simpson method) are the most accepted methods for right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) evaluation. The authors tried to determine a new method to measure RVEF based on wall motion score index (WMSI).OBJECTIVES: One hundred forty-one patients with RV dysfunction had transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) evaluation of the right ventricle. In a first group of 54 patients, a correlation between RVEF using the biplane Simpson method (four chamber and two chamber [4C+2C]) and RV-WMSI was established from a polar map using an eight-segment model to find a regression equation. With the second group of 51 subsequent patients, this equation (RVEF=73.07-20.7 x WMSI), comparing the RVEF-WMSI with the biplane Simpson RVEF (4C+2C), was validated. In a third group of 36 consecutive patients with abnormal RV contractility, the RVEF was calculated by RNA and this RVEF was correlated to the RV-WMSI.RESULTS: The first group of 54 patients had a correlation coefficient of 0.84 between WMSI and RVEF (biplane Simpson method). The results from the second group of 51 patients with RVEF derived from the estimated regression equation correlated well with the biplane Simpson RVEF (r=0.84). The correlation coefficient for these two groups taken together (105 patients), that is, between WMSI and RVEF (biplane Simpson method), was 0.92. The third group of 36 patients with RNA-EF displayed a correlation coefficient of 0.83 with RV-WMSI.CONCLUSION: This new semiquantitative method for estimating RVEF from RV-WMSI is easy to use in routine TTE and shows an excellent correlation with the biplane Simpson method and RNA.

15005167,0,2004,Phys Med Biol,Dose backscatter factors for selected beta sources as a function of source, calcified plaque and contrast agent using Monte Carlo calculations.,Electron backscattering is a prominent secondary effect in beta dosimetry, and is closely correlated with factors such as the geometries of the source and the scattering material, as well as the composition of the scattering material. Previous results were varied depending on the experimental setup and detector resolution, and were generally performed for monoenergetic electron beams, which makes direct application of these factors to beta sources difficult. In this work, backscattering factors were calculated with MCNP 4C for selected beta sources currently in use (32P and 90Sr/90Y) as well as for sources of potential therapeutic use (45Ca, 142Pr and 185W). Specifically, the calculations used beta spectra generated by the SADDE MOD2 code. The factors were calculated as a function of the distance from the interface between water and scatterers. The scatterers include source surroundings, source supporting materials and contrast agents commonly used for imaging purposes in brachytherapy. The results were fit by a simple function for future incorporation into a dose point kernel code. Due to the high-Z material content (iodine, Z = 53) in the contrast agent, a significant dose backscatter was observed near the water interface. Different cross-section algorithms in the MCNP code (inherent and ITS 3.0) affect the factor calculations. The results generated by the ITS 3.0 algorithm closely matched the EGS4 calculations for 32P. The dependence of backscatter factors on log(Z + 1) (Baily 1980 Med. Phys. 7514-9) was observed for all the beta sources with a high correlation coefficient, R (&gt; 0.95). The overall results indicate that the backscattering effect is significant at short distances from the surface of the interface between water and the scattering material. This model can also aid in choosing a source support or mixing materials for beta brachytherapy sources.
14974569,0,2004,Am J Vet Res,Evaluation of serum concentrations of biomarkers of skeletal metabolism and results of radiography as indicators of severity of osteochondrosis in foals.,OBJECTIVE: To determine whether serum concentrations of biomarkers of skeletal metabolism can, in conjunction with radiographic evaluation, indicate severity of osteochondrosis in developing horses.ANIMALS: 43 Dutch Warmblood foals with varying severity of osteochondrosis.PROCEDURE: 24 foals were monitored for 5 months and 19 foals were monitored for 11 months. Monthly radiographs of femoropatellar-femorotibial and tibio-tarsal joints were graded for osteochondral abnormalities. Serial blood samples were assayed for 8 cartilage and bone biomarkers. At the end of the monitoring period, foals were examined for macroscopic osteochondrosis lesions.RESULTS: Temporal relationships were evident between certain serum biomarkers and osteochondrosis severity in foals during their first year. Biomarkers of collagen degradation (collagenase-generated neoepitopes of type-II collagen fragments, type-I and -II collagen fragments [COL2-3/4C(short)], and cross-linked telopeptide fragments of type-I collagen) and bone mineralization (osteocalcin) were positive indicators of osteochondrosis severity at 5 months of age. In foals with lesions at 11 months of age, osteochondrosis severity correlated negatively with COL2-3/4C(short) and osteocalcin and positively with C-propeptide of type-II procollagen (CPII), a collagen synthesis marker. Radiographic grading of osteochondrosis lesions significantly correlated with macroscopic osteochondrosis severity score at both ages and was strongest when combined with osteocalcin at 5 months and CPII at 11 months.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The ability of serum biomarkers to indicate osteochondrosis severity appears to depend on stage of disease and is strengthened with radiography. In older foals with more permanent lesions, osteochondrosis severity is significantly related to biomarker concentrations of decreased bone formation and increased cartilage synthesis.
14964415,0,2004,Pharmazie,[Benzo[c][2,7]naphthyridines from 2,6-dinor-nifedipine and its dimethyl 2,5-dicarboxylate isomer].,The reaction of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde with methyl propiolate and ammonium acetate in acetic acid yields 2,6-dinor-nifedipine (1a) and the isomeric rac. 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) 1b. The DHP 1 are dehydrogenated both chemically and by anodic oxidation using a rotating platinum electrode (RPE) by means of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) affording the corresponding pyridines 2a, b. Compound 1a is more stable, while compound 1b is less stable than nifedipine. Irradiation of the DHP 1 with UV-A light forms the nitrosophenyl-pyridines 3, which cyclize after addition of conc. hydrochloric acid to yield the chloro substituted hydroxamic acids 4a, b. The hydroxamic acids 4c, d are obtained treating 2a, b with zinc in acetate buffer pH 4.6. The hydroxamic acids 4b, d demonstrate only a moderate inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) of human whole blood compared with the activity of the reference compound zileutone. The formation of 15-HETE is also inhibited. Compound 4a reduces the activity of cyclooxygenase. The lactames 5, obtained from the hydroxamic acids 4 by desoxygenation with phosphorus trichloride, react with phosphoryl chloride to give compounds 6, representing educts for potential agents against malaria.
14769241,0,2004,Acta Pharm,Novel 1,2,5-oxadiazine derivatives--synthesis and in vitro biological studies.,A new synthetic approach to the 1,2,5-oxadiazine ring system is described. 2-Substituted or 2,4-disubstituted 2H-1,2,5-oxadiazine-3,6(4H,5H)-dione derivatives 4 were prepared by cyclisation of hydroxamic acids 3 derived from N-(1-benzotriazolylcarbonyl)-amino acids 1. The structures of the synthesised compounds were fully characterised by IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate biological activity of the newly synthesised oxadiazine derivatives. Cytotoxic and cytostatic activities were tested on two cell lines (HeLa and GMK) and evaluated by MTT-test. Two human DNA viruses (adenovirus 7 and herpesvirus 1) and two human RNA viruses (coxsackievirus B5 and echovirus 7) were used in the antiviral test. Selected biological studies indicated that 2-phenyl- -2H-1,2,5-oxadiazine-3,6(4H,5H)-dione (4a) and 4-benzyl-2-phenyl-2H-1,2,5-oxadiazine-3,6(4H,5H)-dione (4c) statistically significantly inhibited cell growth. A minor antiviral effect was observed upon adenovirus, herpesvirus and enteroviruses.
14762643,0,2004,Anal Bioanal Chem,Prompt-gamma neutron activation analysis facility for in vivo body composition studies in small animals.,The design, calibration, dosimetry and performance evaluation of a prompt-gamma neutron activation analysis facility for in vivo body composition studies in small animals (i.e. rats or rabbits) is discussed. The system design was guided by Monte Carlo transport calculations using MCNP-4C code. A system was built and performance evaluation was made using a 185-GBq Pu-Be neutron source. Prompt-gamma rays produced by neutron capture reactions were detected by a combination of a NaI(Tl) scintillation and a HPGe semiconductor detectors. Nitrogen and chlorine were quantified by analysis of the 10.83-MeV and 6.11-MeV peaks, respectively. Appropriate corrections for the animal body size were determined. The facility described allows the in vivo determination of protein and extracellular space in sets of experimental animals.

14738592,0,2004,J Pharm Pharmacol,Free radical scavenging and antioxidative activity of melatonin derivatives.,This article describes the synthesis and antioxidative properties of melatonin derivatives. Tryptamines and cysteinyl or mercaptopropionyl derivatives were deliberately condensed with coupling reagents to give melatonin derivatives 4a-d and 5a, b. The preliminary evaluation indicated that compound 4c showed improved scavenging activity compared with vitamin C (IC50 43 microM vs 65 microM, where IC50 is the concentration of the test compound that induced a change of 50% in absorbance during the 30 min observation) on diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) tests. Derivative 5b, which possesses the thiolactyl moiety, showed moderate potency compared with melatonin (IC50 235 microM vs 690 microM) in the H(2)O(2) scavenging test. Intriguingly, 4c displayed 2-fold more potency than melatonin (IC50 51 microM vs 125 microM) in scavenging NO in the macrophage model. These results suggested that the cysteinyl-conjugated derivative 4c may be a suitable lead to further optimize potent antioxidants for certain oxidative stress conditions.

12847266,53,2003,J Immunol,Dependence of IL-4, IL-13, and nematode-induced alterations in murine small intestinal smooth muscle contractility on Stat6 and enteric nerves.,IL-4 and IL-13 promote gastrointestinal worm expulsion in part through effects on nonlymphoid cells, such as intestinal smooth muscle cells. The roles of Stat6 in IL-4-, IL-13-, and parasitic nematode-induced effects on small intestinal smooth muscle contractility were investigated in BALB/c wild-type and Stat6-deficient mice treated with a long-lasting formulation of recombinant mouse IL-4 (IL-4C) or IL-13 for 7 days. Separate groups of BALB/c mice were infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or were drug-cured of an initial Heligmosomoides polygyrus infection and later reinfected. Infected mice were studied 9 and 12 days after inoculation, respectively. Segments of jejunum were suspended in an organ bath, and responses to nerve stimulation and to acetylcholine and substance P in the presence and absence of tetradotoxin, a neurotoxin, were determined. Both IL-4 and IL-13 increased smooth muscle responses to nerve stimulation in wild-type mice, but the effects were greater in IL-13-treated mice and were absent in IL-13-treated Stat6-deficient mice. Similarly, hypercontractile responses to nerve stimulation in H. polygyrus- and N. brasiliensis-infected mice were dependent in part on Stat6. IL-13, H. polygyrus, and N. brasiliensis, but not IL-4, also increased contractility to acetylcholine by mechanisms that involved Stat6 and enteric nerves. These studies demonstrate that both IL-4 and IL-13 promote intestinal smooth muscle contractility, but by different mechanisms. Differences in these effects correlate with differences in the relative importance of these cytokines in the expulsion of enteric nematode parasites.
12734316,53,2003,J Natl Cancer Inst,Preclinical characterization of the antiglioma activity of a tropism-enhanced adenovirus targeted to the retinoblastoma pathway.,BACKGROUND: Oncolytic adenoviruses are promising therapies for the treatment of gliomas. However, untargeted viral replication and the paucity of coxsackie-adenovirus receptors (CARs) on tumor cells are major stumbling blocks for adenovirus-based treatment. We studied the antiglioma activity of the tumor-selective Delta-24 adenovirus, which encompasses an early 1 A adenoviral (E1A) deletion in the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein-binding region, and of the Delta-24-RGD adenovirus. Delta-24-RGD has an RGD-4C peptide motif inserted into the adenoviral fiber, which allows the adenovirus to anchor directly to integrins.METHODS: CAR and integrin expression were examined by flow cytometry in six glioma cell lines and in normal human astrocytes (NHAs). Adenoviral vectors containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (AdGFP and AdGFP-RGD) were used to infect glioma cell lines with high or low CAR expression. Viability of glioma cells infected with different adenoviruses was assessed by trypan blue staining. Adenovirus replication was quantified with the infection-dose replication assay. Athymic mice carrying glioma xenografts received intratumoral injections of Delta-24-RGD or Delta-24 and were followed for survival, which was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: Half the glioma cell lines expressed low levels of CAR (defined as &lt;50% of cells expressing detectable CAR); all lines expressed integrins in more than 50% of cells. Infection of U-87 MG cells (a low-CAR-expressing line) with AdGFP-RGD resulted in approximately six times more GFP-positive cells than infection with AdGFP. Delta-24-RGD was more cytopathic to both low- and high-CAR-expressing glioma lines than Delta-24, and it replicated more efficiently in both cell lines. In the xenografted mice, intratumoral injection of Delta-24-RGD was associated with longer survival than intratumoral injection of Delta-24 (P&lt;.001, log-rank test). Furthermore, 60% of Delta-24-RGD-treated mice but only 15% of Delta-24-treated mice survived more than 4 months (difference = 45%, 95% CI = 21% to 68%).CONCLUSIONS: The antitumor activity of Delta-24-RGD suggests that it has the potential to be an effective agent in the treatment of gliomas.
14673996,35,2003,Arthritis Rheum,Gene deletion of either interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme, inducible nitric oxide synthase, or stromelysin 1 accelerates the development of knee osteoarthritis in mice after surgical transection of the medial collateral ligament and partial medial meniscectomy.,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the development of osteoarthritis (OA) after transection of the medial collateral ligament and partial medial meniscectomy in mice in which genes encoding either interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE), stromelysin 1, or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were deleted.METHODS: Sectioning of the medial collateral ligament and partial medial meniscectomy were performed on right knee joints of wild-type and knockout mice. Left joints served as unoperated controls. Serial histologic sections were obtained from throughout the whole joint of both knees 4 days or 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks after surgery. Sections were graded for OA lesions on a scale of 0-6 and were assessed for breakdown of tibial cartilage matrix proteoglycan (aggrecan) and type II collagen by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases with immunohistochemistry studies using anti-VDIPEN, anti-NITEGE, and Col2-3/4C(short) neoepitope antibodies. Proteoglycan depletion was assessed by Alcian blue staining and chondrocyte cell death, with the TUNEL technique.RESULTS: All knockout mice showed accelerated development of OA lesions in the medial tibial cartilage after surgery, compared with wild-type mice. ICE-, iNOS-, and particularly IL-1beta-knockout mice developed OA lesions in the lateral cartilage of unoperated limbs. Development of focal histopathologic lesions was accompanied by increased levels of MMP-, aggrecanase-, and collagenase-generated cleavage neoepitopes in areas around lesions, while nonlesional areas showed no change in immunostaining. Extensive cell death was also detected by TUNEL staining in focal areas around lesions.CONCLUSION: We postulate that deletion of each of these genes, which encode molecules capable of producing degenerative changes in cartilage, leads to changes in the homeostatic controls regulating the balance between anabolism and catabolism, favoring accelerated cartilage degeneration. These observations suggest that these genes may play important regulatory roles in maintaining normal homeostasis in articular cartilage matrix turnover.
14668866,35,2003,Nature,Parallel colour-opponent pathways to primary visual cortex.,The trichromatic primate retina parses the colour content of a visual scene into 'red/green' and 'blue/yellow' representations. Cortical circuits must combine the information encoded in these colour-opponent signals to reconstruct the full range of perceived colours. Red/green and blue/yellow inputs are relayed by the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of thalamus to primary visual cortex (V1), so understanding how cortical circuits transform these signals requires understanding how LGN inputs to V1 are organized. Here we report direct recordings from LGN afferent axons in muscimol-inactivated V1. We found that blue/yellow afferents terminated exclusively in superficial cortical layers 3B and 4A, whereas red/green afferents were encountered only in deeper cortex, in lower layer 4C. We also describe a distinct cortical target for 'blue-OFF' cells, whose afferents terminated in layer 4A and seemed patchy in organization. The more common 'blue-ON' afferents were found in 4A as well as lower layer 2/3. Chromatic information is thus conveyed to V1 by parallel, anatomically segregated colour-opponent systems, to be combined at a later stage of the colour circuit.
12518067,33,2003,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Direct interaction with a nuclear protein and regulation of gene silencing by a variant of the Ca2+-channel beta 4 subunit.,The beta subunits of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels are known to be regulators of the channels' gating properties. Here we report a striking additional function of a beta subunit. Screening of chicken cochlear and brain cDNA libraries identified beta(4c), a short splice variant of the beta(4) subunit. Although beta(4c) occurs together with the longer isoforms beta(4a) or beta(4b) in the brain, eye, heart, and lung, the cochlea expresses exclusively beta(4c). The association of beta(4c) with the Ca(2+)-channel alpha(1) subunit has slight but significant effects on the kinetics of channel activation and inactivation. Yeast two-hybrid and biochemical assays revealed that beta(4c) interacts directly with the chromo shadow domain of chromobox protein 2heterochromatin protein 1gamma (CHCB2HP1gamma), a nuclear protein involved in gene silencing and transcriptional regulation. Coexpression of this protein specifically recruits beta(4c) to the nuclei of mammalian cells. Furthermore, beta(4c) but not beta(4a) dramatically attenuates the gene-silencing activity of chromobox protein 2heterochromatin protein 1gamma. The beta(4c) subunit is therefore a multifunctional protein that not only constitutes a portion of the Ca(2+) channel but also regulates gene transcription.
14561095,31,2003,J Med Chem,Synthesis and antiprotozoal activity of aza-analogues of furamidine.,6-[5-(4-Amidinophenyl)furan-2-yl]nicotinamidine (8a) was synthesized from 6-[5-(4-cyanophenyl)furan-2-yl]nicotinonitrile (4a), through the bis-O-acetoxyamidoxime followed by hydrogenation. Compound 4a was prepared via selective bromination of 6-(furan-2-yl)nicotinonitrile (2a) with N-bromosuccinimide, followed by Suzuki coupling with 4-cyanophenylboronic acid. In a similar way, diamidines 8b and 8c were prepared from the dicyano derivatives 4c and 4d, respectively. N-Methoxy-6-[5-[4-(N-methoxyamidino)phenyl]-furan-2-yl]-nicotinamidine (6a) was prepared via methylation of the respective diamidoxime 5a with dimethylsulfate. Prodrugs 6b and 6c were also prepared by methylation of the respective diamidoximes 5b and 5d. The symmetrical diamidines 14a,b were synthesized through the corresponding bis-O-acetoxyamidoxime followed by hydrogenation. The key compounds 11a,b were conveniently obtained by Stille coupling between 2,5-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)furan and the corresponding heteroaryl halides. These compounds have been evaluated in vitro for activity against Trypanosoma b.rhodesiense (T. b. r.) and P. falciparum (P. f.). The diamidines 8a, 8c, and 14b gave IC(50) values versus T. b. r. of less than 10 nM. Against P. f. 8a, 8b, and 14b exhibited IC(50) values less than 10 nM. In an in vivo mouse model for T. b. r. four compounds 6a, 6c, 6d, and 8a were curative. Compound 6a produced cures at an oral dosage of 5 mg/kg.
12587007,29,2003,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,Low body mass index but high percent body fat in Taiwanese subjects: implications of obesity cutoffs.,OBJECTIVES: To compare the different correlations of body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat (BF%) with other ethnic groups and to evaluate the appropriateness of Asia-Pacific redefining obesity criteria in the Taiwanese population. The corresponding BF% to BMI cutoffs of overweight and obesity will also be studied.DESIGN: A cross-sectional epidemiological survey.SUBJECTS: A total of 509 male and 570 female Taiwanese subjects aged &gt; or =20 y sampled by the systematic stratified clustering sampling method were analyzed.MEASUREMENTS: BMI was obtained by body weight (kg) divided by squared body height (m(2)). The estimated BMI (BMIe) was deduced from the Caucasian-based four-compartment equation (4C). BF% measured by the methods of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or Caucasian-based 4C were used and abbreviated as DXA-BF and 4C-BF, respectively.RESULTS: The curvilinear relationship between age and BMI or DXA-BF was established. When compared by age-stratified groups, Taiwanese subjects had a higher BF% (4C-BF) in any given BMI than Caucasians. That is, the level of 4C-BF for BMI&gt; or =25 kg/m(2) in Taiwanese subjects was similar to BMI&gt; or =30 kg/m(2) in Caucasians. The BMIe values of 25 and 30 kg/m(2) were nearly equal to the BMIs of 23.6 and 25.3 kg/m(2) in males, and 22.7 and 24.8 kg/m(2) in females, respectively. The 4C-BF of 25% was nearly equal to a BMI of 26.2 kg/m(2) in males, and 35% was equal to a BMI of 24.4 kg/m(2) in females. Consequently, the DXA-BF cutoffs for BMIs of 23 and 25 kg/m(2) were compatible to 23 and 25% in males, and 35 and 38% in females, respectively.CONCLUSION: It was demonstrated that Taiwanese subjects had a relatively lower BMI but a higher BF% than Caucasians. In general, the newly proposed Asia-Pacific BMI cutoffs for overweight (&gt; or =23 kg/m(2)) and obesity (&gt; or =25 kg/m(2)) may be acceptable to both male and female Taiwanese subjects. The corresponding BF% (DXA-BF) cutoffs for obesity would be 25% in male and 38% in female Taiwanese subjects, respectively.
12814614,28,2003,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Early osteoarthritic changes of human femoral head cartilage subsequent to femoro-acetabular impingement.,OBJECTIVE: To use the surgical samples of patients with femoro-acetabular impingement due to a nonspherical head to analyze tissue morphology and early cartilage changes in a mechanical model of hip osteoarthritis (OA).DESIGN: An aberrant nonspherical shape of the femoral head has been assumed to cause an abutment conflict (impingement mechanism) of the hip with subsequent cartilage lesions of the acetabular rim and surface alterations of the nonspherical portion of the head. In this study, 22 samples of the nonspherical portions of the head have been obtained during hip surgery from young adults (mean 30.4 years, range 19-45 years) with an impingement conflict. The samples were first compared with tissue from the same area obtained from six age-matched deceased persons (control group) with normal hip morphology and second with cartilage from 14 older patients with advanced OA. All samples were characterized histologically and hyaline cartilage was graded according to the Mankin criteria. They were further subjected to examination on a molecular basis by immunohistology for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), tenascin-C and a collagenase cleavage product (COL2-3/4C(long)) and by in situ hybridization for collagen type I and collagen type II.RESULTS: All samples from the patient group revealed hyaline cartilage with degenerative signs. According to the Mankin criteria, the cartilage alterations were significantly different when compared with the control group (p=0.007) but were less distinct when compared with cartilage from patients with advanced OA (p=0.014). Positive staining and distribution pattern for COMP, tenascin-C and COL2-3/4C(long) showed similarities between the samples from the impingement group and osteoarthritic cartilage but they were distinctly different when compared with healthy cartilage. Levels of collagen I and II transcripts were upregulated in 6 and 10, respectively, of the 14 samples with OA and in 9 and 12, respectively, of the 22 samples from the impingement group. None of the samples from the control group showed upregulation of Collagen I and II mRNA.CONCLUSIONS: The aberrant nonspherical portion of the femoral head in young patients with an impingement conflict consists of hyaline cartilage which shows clear degenerative signs similar to the findings in osteoarthritic cartilage. The tissue alterations are distinctly different when compared with a control group, which substantiates an impingement conflict as an early mechanism for degeneration at the hip joint periphery.
14517802,27,2003,Gastroenterology,Infectivity enhanced, cyclooxygenase-2 promoter-based conditionally replicative adenovirus for pancreatic cancer.,BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive human malignancies. Conditionally replicative adenoviruses (CRAds) have shown some promise in the treatment of cancers. However, to date, their application for pancreatic cancer has met several obstacles: one is lack of a good control element to regulate replication, and the other is relatively low adenoviral infectivity. Thus, we constructed infectivity enhanced cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 promoter-based CRAds to develop a safe and effective therapeutic modality.METHODS: The CRAds were designed to achieve COX-2 promoter-controlled E1 expression for regulated replication (COX-2 CRAds). The infectivity-enhanced CRAds also have an RGD-4C motif in the adenoviral fiber-knob region. The selectivity and efficacy of these constructs were analyzed with cell lines in vitro. The in vivo therapeutic effect and viral replication were analyzed with a xenograft model. Pathology of the major organs and E1 RNA levels in the liver were also studied after systemic administration.RESULTS: The COX-2 CRAds showed a selective cytocidal effect in vitro in COX-2-positive cells and killed most of the pancreatic cancer cells. In vivo, intratumoral administration of the infectivity-enhanced COX-2 CRAds (10(9) particles) showed a strong antitumor effect comparable to wild-type virus, whereas the COX-2 CRAds without infectivity enhancement showed a limited effect. Viral replication was confirmed in the xenograft tumors. Systemic administration did not cause any detectable toxicity; the E1 RNA level in the liver after COX-2 CRAd administration was minimal.CONCLUSIONS: Infectivity-enhanced COX-2 CRAd is a promising agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
14574644,24,2003,Am J Hum Genet,Mutations in a gene encoding a novel SH3/TPR domain protein cause autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4C neuropathy.,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C (CMT4C) is a childhood-onset demyelinating form of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy associated with an early-onset scoliosis and a distinct Schwann cell pathology. CMT4C is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and has been mapped to a 13-cM linkage interval on chromosome 5q23-q33. By homozygosity mapping and allele-sharing analysis, we refined the CMT4C locus to a suggestive critical region of 1.7 Mb. We subsequently identified mutations in an uncharacterized transcript, KIAA1985, in 12 families with autosomal recessive neuropathy. We observed eight distinct protein-truncating mutations and three nonconservative missense mutations affecting amino acids conserved through evolution. In all families, we identified a mutation on each disease allele, either in the homozygous or in the compound heterozygous state. The CMT4C gene is strongly expressed in neural tissues, including peripheral nerve tissue. The translated protein defines a new protein family of unknown function with putative orthologues in vertebrates. Comparative sequence alignments indicate that members of this protein family contain multiple SH3 and TPR domains that are likely involved in the formation of protein complexes.
12846580,22,2003,Biochemistry,Inhibition of c-src transcription by mithramycin: structure-activity relationships of biosynthetically produced mithramycin analogues using the c-src promoter as target.,The aureolic acid antitumor antibiotic mithramycin (MTM) inhibits both cancer growth and bone resorption by cross-linking GC-rich DNA, thus blocking binding of Sp-family transcription factors to gene regulatory elements. Transcription of c-src, a gene implicated in many human cancers and required for osteoclast-dependent bone resorption, is regulated by the binding of Sp factors to specific elements in its promoter. Therefore, this gene represents an important anticancer target and a potential lead target through which MTM displays its so far uncharacterized action against osteoclastic bone resorption. Here we demonstrate, using DNA binding studies, promoter reporter assays, and RT-PCR, that MTM inhibits Sp binding to the c-src promoter region, thereby decreasing its expression in human cancer cells. Furthermore, selected mithramycin analogues, namely, premithramycin B, mithramycin SK, 7-demethylmithramycin, 4E-ketomithramycin, and 4C-ketodemycarosylmithramycin, generated through combinatorial biosynthesis, were compared with MTM for their ability to block Sp binding to the c-src promoter. Although most of the tested compounds lost their ability to bind to the DNA, alteration of the MTM 3-pentyl side chain led to a compound (mithramycin SK) with the same DNA binding specificity but with lower binding affinity than MTM. While this compound was comparable to MTM in promoter reporter, gene expression, and anticancer assays, given its weaker interaction with the DNA, it may be much less toxic than MTM. The results presented here supplement recent findings and, moreover, allow new conclusions to be made regarding both the structure-activity relationships, particularly with respect to the alkyl side chains, and the mechanism of action of aureolic acid drugs.
12729901,22,2003,FEBS Lett,Valproic acid, a mood stabilizer and anticonvulsant, protects rat cerebral cortical neurons from spontaneous cell death: a role of histone deacetylase inhibition.,We studied the neuroprotective effects of valproic acid (VPA), a primary mood stabilizer and anticonvulsant, in cultured rat cerebral cortical neurons (CCNs). CCNs underwent spontaneous cell death when their age increased in culture. As shown by mitochondrial activity and calcein-AM assays, treatment of CCNs with VPA starting from day 9 in vitro markedly increased viability and prolonged the life span of the cultures. The neuroprotective action of VPA was time-dependent and occurred at therapeutic levels with a maximal effect at about 0.5 mM. LiCl (1 mM) also protected CCNs from aging-induced, spontaneous cell death but less effectively. VPA-induced neuroprotection in aging CCN cultures was associated with a robust increase in histone H3 acetylation levels and the protective effect was mimicked by treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, but not by VPA analogs which are inactive in blocking histone deacetylase. Our results suggest a role of histone deacetylase inhibition in mediating the neuroprotective action of VPA.
14613270,21,2003,Arthritis Rheum,Turnover of type II collagen and aggrecan in cartilage matrix at the onset of inflammatory arthritis in humans: relationship to mediators of systemic and local inflammation.,OBJECTIVE: To determine in vivo the extent of damage to, and changes in turnover of, articular cartilage type II collagen (CII) and the proteoglycan aggrecan following the onset of inflammatory arthritis in humans, and to examine the hypothesis that there are direct relationships between cartilage biomarkers of damage/turnover and clinical, histologic, and molecular markers of inflammation.METHODS: Synovial fluid (SF) and synovial membrane (SM) were obtained by arthroscopy, and a synovitis score was determined, in 32 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (13 with early untreated disease, 19 with established disease), 18 with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 10 with osteoarthritis (OA). Systemic disease activity markers were recorded, and SM CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD68+ macrophages, and lining layer hyperplasia were quantified. SF levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-10 (IL-10), matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), MMP-3, Col2-3/4C(Long mono) neoepitope (C2C) (reflecting collagenase cleavage of cartilage CII), C-propeptide of type II procollagen (PIICP) (a biosynthesis marker), keratan sulfate (KS), and the 846 epitope of aggrecan (turnover) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or radioimmunoassay.RESULTS: Levels of cartilage degradation products in early RA or early PsA were not elevated above levels in OA, although in early inflammatory arthritis, TNFalpha and MMP-1 levels were similar to those observed in late inflammatory disease and higher than those in OA. PIICP was reduced in early RA. Correlations were observed between the SF C2C neoepitope level and the Health Assessment Questionnaire score, C-reactive protein level, plasma viscosity, synovitis score, and SF TNFalpha and MMP-1 levels. KS epitope content was reduced in direct relation to SM macrophage infiltration in the sublining and lining layers and in the presence of elevated SF MMP-3. Both SF MMP-1 and SF MMP-3 levels correlated with CD4+ T cell infiltration and lining layer hyperplasia in the SM, and MMP-1 levels correlated with lining layer CD68 levels, but TNFalpha and IL-10 levels did not.CONCLUSION: Except for CII synthesis, there were no significant changes in extracellular matrix turnover of aggrecan or CII in the early stages of human inflammatory arthritis. However, the direct correlation between the increases in TNFalpha and MMP-1 production and collagen degradation suggests that collagenase cleavage of cartilage collagen is related to the activities of TNFalpha and MMP-1. The reduction in CII synthesis in early RA may contribute to the developing pathology, since a lack of synthesis of this molecule would inhibit maintenance of cartilage matrix.
12895697,21,2003,Antiviral Res,HIV-1 resistance to the gp41-dependent fusion inhibitor C-34.,The gp41 subunit of HIV-1 has been recently recognized as a target for antiviral therapy. C-34 is a peptide that mimics the heptad repeat 2 in the ectodomain of gp41. Here, we describe two HIV-1 strains selected after 5 and 17 passages in culture with increasing concentrations of C-34 (breakthrough concentration of 10 microg/ml). The HXB2-derived strain was more than 1000-fold resistant and contained a V38E mutation in the gp41 coding DNA sequence. The NL4-3-derived strain was more than 500-fold resistant and contained a L33S mutation in gp41. No cross-resistance to the RT inhibitor AZT, the HIV binding inhibitor dextran sulfate (DS), or the chemokine receptor antagonist ALX-40-4C was detected. These data indicate that HIV-1 can overcome C-34 inhibition through mutations at residues not involved in the formation of the hydrophobic cavity of gp41.
12531910,19,2003,J Appl Physiol (1985),Percent body fat via DEXA: comparison with a four-compartment model.,This study compared body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA; Lunar DPX-L) with that via a four-compartment (4C; water, bone mineral mass, fat, and residual) model. Relative body fat was determined for 152 healthy adults [30.0 +/- 11.1 (SD) yr; 75.10 +/- 14.88 kg; 176.3 +/- 8.7 cm] aged from 18 to 59 yr. The 4C approach [20.7% body fat (%BF)] resulted in a significantly (P &lt; 0.001) higher mean %BF compared with DEXA (18.9% BF), with intraindividual variations ranging from -2.6 to 7.3% BF. Linear regression and a Bland and Altman plot demonstrated the tendency for DEXA to progressively underestimate the %BF of leaner individuals compared with the criterion 4C model (4C %BF = 0.862 x DEXA %BF + 4.417; r(2) = 0.952, standard error of estimate = 1.6% BF). This bias was not attributable to variations in fat-free mass hydration but may have been due to beam-hardening errors that resulted from differences in anterior-posterior tissue thickness.
12923563,15,2003,Gene Ther,The alphavbeta5 integrin of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells is a transduction receptor of RGD-4C fiber-modified adenoviruses.,Epithelial and endothelial cells expressing the primary Coxsackie virus B adenovirus (Ad) receptor (CAR) and integrin coreceptors are natural targets of human Ad infections. The fiber knob of species A, C, D, E and F Ad serotypes binds CAR by mimicking the CAR-homodimer interface, and the penton base containing arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motifs binds with low affinity to alphav integrins inducing cell activation. Here, we generated seven different genetically modified Ad vectors with RGD sequences inserted into the HI loop of fiber knob. All mutants bound and infected CAR and alphav integrin-positive epithelial cells with equal efficiencies. However, the Ads containing two additional cysteines, both N and C terminals of the RGD sequence (RGD-4C), were uniquely capable of transducing CAR-less hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic human tumor cell lines and primary melanoma cells. Both binding and transduction of RGD-4C Ad were blocked by soluble RGD peptides. Flow cytometry of cell surface integrins and virus binding to CAR-less cells in the presence of function-blocking anti-integrin antibodies indicated that the alphavbeta5 integrin, but not alphavbeta3, alphaIIbbeta3 or beta1,alpha5 or alpha6-containing integrins served as a functional transduction receptor of the RGD-4C Ads. However, in cells with low levels of alphavbeta5 integrin, the function-blocking anti-alphavbeta5 antibodies were not effective, unlike soluble RGD peptides. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the alphavbeta5 integrin is a functional transduction receptor of RGD-4C Ads in the absence of CAR, and that additional RGD receptors are targets of these viruses. The RGD-4C vectors further extend the tropism of Ads towards potential human therapies.
14613902,14,2003,Biol Reprod,Protection from radiation-induced male germ cell loss by sphingosine-1-phosphate.,Male germ cells are susceptible to radiation-induced injury, and infertility is a common problem after total-body irradiation. Here we investigated, first, the effects of irradiation on germ cells in mouse testis and, second, the role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) treatment in radiation-induced male germ cell loss. Irradiation of mouse testes mainly damaged the early developmental stages of spermatogonia. The damage was seen by means of DNA flow cytometry 21 days after irradiation as decreasing numbers of spermatocytes and spermatids with increasing amounts of ionizing radiation (0.1-2.0 Gy). Intratesticular injections of S1P given 1-2 h before irradiation (0.5 Gy) did not protect against short-term germ cell loss as measured by in situ end labeling of DNA fragmentation 16 h after irradiation. However, after 21 days, in the S1P-treated testes, the numbers of primary spermatocytes and spermatogonia at G2 (4C peak as measured by flow cytometry) were higher at all stages of spermatogenesis compared with vehicle-treated testes, indicating protection of early spermatogonia by S1P, whereas the spermatid (1C) populations were similar. In conclusion, S1P appears to protect partially (16%-47%) testicular germ cells against radiation-induced cell death. This warrants further studies aimed at development of therapeutic agents capable of blocking sphingomyelin-induced pathways of germ cell loss.
12633868,14,2003,FEBS Lett,Lithium-induced inhibition of Src tyrosine kinase in rat cerebral cortical neurons: a role in neuroprotection against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity.,The neuroprotective effects of lithium, a mood stabilizer, against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in rat cortical neurons were associated with a decrease in Tyr1472 phosphorylation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor NR2B subunit and a loss of receptor activity. Since this receptor tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by the Src-family tyrosine kinases, we investigated the effects of lithium on the Src kinase activity. Levels of phosphorylated Src kinase at Tyr416, an index of Src activation, were reduced after treatment with LiCl (1 mM) for more than 3 days. Protein levels of Src-family kinases such as Src, Fyn, and Yes were unchanged by lithium treatment. The activities of cytosolic protein tyrosine kinase and protein phosphatase were also unchanged by lithium treatment, indicating the selectivity and the modulation. Moreover, the levels of postsynaptic densities (PSD) and SynGAP, the scaffolding proteins of the NMDA receptor complex, were unaltered by lithium. A Src kinase inhibitor, SU6656, and an NR2B antagonist, ifenprodil, partially blocked glutamate excitotoxicity. Our results suggest that lithium-induced inactivation of Src kinase contributes to this drug-induced NMDA receptor inhibition and neuroprotection against excitotoxicity.
12872042,13,2003,J Hypertens,Allelic variants of natriuretic peptide receptor genes are associated with family history of hypertension and cardiovascular phenotype.,OBJECTIVE: Abnormalities in the natriuretic peptide system could play a key role in the genesis of hypertension. We evaluated the associations between a family history of hypertension, cardiovascular phenotype and allelic variants of Npr1 and Npr3, two candidate genes that codify for natriuretic peptide receptors.METHODS: We genotyped 45 young normotensive subjects (19 males, 26.8 +/- 3.7 years) with accurately assessed family history of hypertension (FH+) and 52 (26 males, 26.1 +/- 3.1 years) without (FH-) for the known variants of Npr1 and Npr3 genes, and for a novel length difference (3C/4C) polymorphism at position 15129 in the 3'-untranslated region of the Npr1 gene. Blood pressure, echocardiography and plasma brain natriuretic peptide were assessed.RESULTS: Both the novel Npr1 3C allele (59 versus 33%, P &lt; 0.001) and the 3C/3C genotype (31 versus 8%; P &lt; 0.001) were significantly more frequent in FH+ than in FH-. The inverse distribution of the 4C/4C genotype suggested that a casual association was very unlikely. Moreover, the 3C/3C homozygous had significantly higher systolic blood pressure (121.1 +/- 6.3 versus 115.6 +/- 7.8 mmHg in 4C/4C; P &lt; 0.05) and a longer left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time (67 +/- 10 versus 61 +/- 9 ms; P &lt; 0.05). The Npr3 C(-55) allele variant was also more frequent in FH+ (88 versus 76%, P &lt; 0.05), but was not associated with the cardiovascular phenotype.CONCLUSIONS: The novel Npr1 gene 3C variant and the Npr3 gene C(-55) allele are associated with hypertensive family history. Moreover, the functional Npr1 3C variant, when homozygous, is also associated with higher systolic blood pressure and prolonged ventricular relaxation.
12853416,13,2003,J Neurosci,The representation of retinal blood vessels in primate striate cortex.,The blood vessels that nourish the inner retina cast shadows on photoreceptors, creating &quot;angioscotomas&quot; in the visual field. We have found the representations of angioscotomas in striate cortex of the squirrel monkey. They were detected in 9 of 12 normal adult animals by staining flatmounts for cytochrome oxidase activity after enucleation of one eye. They appeared as thin profiles in layer 4C radiating from the blind spot representation. Angioscotomas can be regarded as a local form of amblyopia. After birth, when light strikes the retina, photoreceptors beneath blood vessels are denied normal visual stimulation. This deprivation induces remodeling of geniculocortical afferents in a distribution that corresponds to the retinal vascular tree. Angioscotoma representations were most obvious in monkeys with fine ocular dominance columns and were invisible in monkeys with large, well segregated columns. In monkeys without columns, their width corresponded faithfully to the inducing retinal shadow, making it possible to calculate the minimum shadow required to produce a cortical representation. The &quot;amblyogenic threshold&quot; was calculated as the fraction of the pupil area eclipsed to trigger remodeling of geniculocortical afferents. It was found to be constant over retinal eccentricity, vessel size, and shadow size. Ambliogenic shadows only three to four cones wide were sufficient to generate a cortical representation, testifying to the remarkable precision of the cortical map. The representations of retinal blood vessels separated by only 0.65 degrees were resolvable in the cortex, yielding an upper limit on cortical resolution of 340 microm in layer 4C.
12672020,13,2003,J Neurobiol,Targeted expression of tetanus toxin reveals sets of neurons involved in larval locomotion in Drosophila.,The Drosophila larva is widely used for studies of neuronal development and function, yet little is known about the neuronal basis of locomotion in this model organism. Drosophila larvae crawl over a plain substrate by performing repetitive waves of forward peristalsis alternated by brief episodes of head swinging and turning. To identify sets of central and peripheral neurons required for the spatial or temporal pattern of larval locomotion, we blocked neurotransmitter release from defined populations of neurons by targeted expression of tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC) with the GAL4/UAS system. One hundred fifty GAL4 lines were crossed to a UAS-TeTxLC strain and a motion-analysis system was used to identify larvae with abnormal movement patterns. Five lines were selected that show discrete locomotor defects (i.e., increased turning and pausing) and these defects are correlated with diverse sets of central neurons. One line, 4C-GAL4, caused an unusual circling behavior that is correlated with approximately 200 neurons, including dopaminergic and peptidergic interneurons. Expression of TeTxLC in all dopaminergic and serotonergic but not in peptidergic neurons, caused turning deficits that are similar to those of 4C-GAL4/TeTxLC larvae. The results presented here provide a basis for future genetic studies of motor control in the Drosophila larva.
12625453,13,2003,Hippocampus,Temporal specific patterns of semaphorin gene expression in rat brain after kainic acid-induced status epilepticus.,Mossy fiber sprouting and other forms of synaptic reorganization may form the basis for a recurrent excitatory network in epileptic foci. Four major classes of axon guidance molecules--the ephrins, netrins, slits, and semaphorins--provide targeting information to outgrowing axons along predetermined pathways during development. These molecules may also play a role in synaptic reorganization in the adult brain and thereby promote epileptogenesis. We studied semaphorin gene expression, as assessed by in situ hybridization, using riboprobes generated from rat cDNA in an adult model of synaptic reorganization, kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE). Within the first week after KA-induced SE, semaphorin 3C, a class III semaphorin, mRNA content is decreased in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and is increased in the upper layers of cerebral cortex. Another class III semaphorin, semaphorin 3F, is also decreased in CA1 and CA3 of hippocampus within the first week after KA-SE. These changes in gene expression are principally confined to neurons. By contrast, there was little change in the semaphorin 4C mRNA content of CA1 neurons at this time. No changes in expression of semaphorin 3A and 4C genes were detected 28 days after KA-induced SE. Regulation of semaphorin gene expression after KA-induced SE suggests that neurons may regulate the expression of axonal guidance molecules and thereby contribute to synaptic reorganization after injury of the mature brain. The anatomic locale of the altered semaphorin gene expression may serve as a marker for specific networks undergoing synaptic reorganization in the epileptic brain.
12966544,12,2003,J Med Virol,Genomic and phylogenetic analysis of hepatitis C virus isolates: a survey of 535 strains circulating in southern France.,The present study examines the distribution of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes in Marseille, France in 2001-2002 and evaluates the efficiency of two in house direct sequence PCR protocols based on 5'NC analysis or NS5B analysis. By 5'NC sequencing, the distribution of 535 HCV strains derived from patients attending gastroenterology and AIDS referral centers, or dialysis units was as follows: 33% were infected by genotype 1a; 26% by 1b; 7% by 2; 22% by 3a; 10.7% by 4. In univariate analysis, HCV distribution was associated with age and source of infection, whereas in multivariate analysis only injecting drug use was an independent determinant for genotype distribution. Among the 535 specimens submitted to 5'NC direct sequencing, 18% could not be classified accurately into subtypes. A subset of 187 samples was amplified efficiently and sequenced by targeting the NS5B region of the viral genome. The two methods yielded concordant results in 70% of cases. Specimens unsubtypeable or misclassified most frequently by 5'NC analysis were type 1b and subtypes 2a/2c and 4a/4c. The data show that 5'NC direct sequence analysis is a sensitive method to identify genotypes in all cases, but that it can lead to subtyping misclassification (in particular, subtype 1b and 1a) or doubtful results (in particular subtypes 2a/2c and 4a/4c). Conversely, NS5B direct sequence assay, based on phylogenetic analysis, allowed better discrimination between subtypes. These two approaches are complementary and should be made available in clinical laboratories to ensure a reliable survey of HCV strains.
14665846,10,2003,J Urol,Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in cold ischemia: renal artery perfusion.,PURPOSE: Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy represents a feasible option for patients with small renal masses. We describe our initial experience with laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in cold ischemia achieved by renal artery perfusion.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2001 to March 2003 laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in cold ischemia was performed in 15 patients with renal cell carcinoma. Cold ischemia was achieved by continuous perfusion of Ringers lactate at 4C through the renal artery, which was clamped. Tumor excision was performed in a bloodless field with biopsy taken from the tumor bed. The collecting system was repaired if needed. Renal reconstruction was performed by suturing over hemostatic bolsters.RESULTS: All procedures were successfully completed laparoscopically by our new technique. Mean operative time was 185 minutes (range 135 to 220). Mean ischemia time was 40 minutes (range 27 to 101). Estimated mean intraoperative blood loss was 160 ml (range 30 to 650). Entry to the collecting system in 6 patients was repaired intraoperatively. Additional vascular repair was done in 2 patients. There were no significant postoperative complications. Postoperative followup in 8 patients showed that the renal parenchyma was not damaged by the ischemic period.CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience of incorporating cold ischemia via arterial perfusion into laparoscopic partial nephrectomy shows the feasibility and safety of the technique. We believe that this approach has the potential to make laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma safe and reliable.
12732955,10,2003,Curr Microbiol,The role of the sigB gene in the general stress response of Listeria monocytogenes varies between a strain of serotype 1/2a and a strain of serotype 4c.,The ability of Listeria monocytogenes to resist many adverse environmental conditions has been attributed in part to activation of the alternative sigma factor sigma(B), encoded by the sigB gene. The ability of this pathogen to survive and grow under stress conditions varies between strains within the species. The current study was undertaken to determine whether the role played by the sigB gene in the stress response varies among strains of different serotypes. Null mutations were generated in the sigB genes of L. monocytogenes L61 (serotype 1/2a) and L99 (serotype 4c), and the survival of the resulting mutants was compared with that of the wild-type strains under osmotic, oxidative, and carbon starvation stress conditions and on exposure to bacteriocins, ethanol, acid, and heat. Except in a few cases, strain L61 displayed greater dependence on the sigB products for survival of adverse conditions than did strain L99. The results of this study indicated that the relative importance of the sigB gene in the stress response is not the same in all strains of L. monocytogenes, and this difference may be specific to serotype groupings within the species.
12544293,10,2003,J Urol,Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for renal tumor: single center experience comparing clamping and no clamping techniques of the renal vasculature.,PURPOSE: We performed a nonrandomized retrospective comparison of 2 techniques for laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, that is without and with clamping the renal vessels.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 1997 and February 2002, 28 consecutive patients underwent transperitoneal laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for renal tumor. In group 1 (12 patients) partial nephrectomy was performed with ultrasonic shears and bipolar cautery without clamping the renal vessels, while in group 2 (16 patients) the renal pedicle was clamped before tumor excision. In group 2 patients intracorporeal kidney cooling was achieved by a ureteral catheter connected to 4C solution. Intracorporeal freehand suturing techniques were used to close the collecting system when opened and approximate the renal parenchyma.RESULTS: All procedures were successfully completed laparoscopically. Mean renal ischemia time +/- SD was 27.3 +/- 7 minutes (range 15 to 47) in group 2 patients. Mean laparoscopic operating time was 179.1 +/- 86 minutes (range 90 to 390) in group 1 compared with 121.5 +/- 37 minutes (range 60 to 210) in group 2 (p = 0.004). Mean intraoperative blood loss was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (708.3 +/- 569 versus 270.3 +/- 281 ml., p = 0.014). Three patients in group 1 and 2 in group 2 required blood transfusions. Immediately postoperatively mean creatinine was 1.26 +/- 0.36 and 1.45 +/- 0.61 mg./dl. in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.075). Surgical margins were negative in all specimens. Pathological examination revealed renal cell cancer in 18 cases (stages pT1 in 17 and pT3a in 1), oncocytoma in 4, angiomyolipoma in 5 and renal adenoma in 1.CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy represents a feasible option for patients with small renal masses. Clamping the renal vessels during tumor resection and suturing the kidney mimics the open technique and seems to be associated with less blood loss and shorter laparoscopic operative time.
14555670,9,2003,J Appl Physiol (1985),Comparison of body composition methods in overweight and obese children.,The objective of the present study was to investigate the accuracy of percent body fat (%fat) estimates from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, air-displacement plethysmography (ADP), and total body water (TBW) against a criterion four-compartment (4C) model in overweight and obese children. A volunteer sample of 30 children (18 male and 12 female), age of (mean +/- SD) 14.10 +/- 1.83 yr, body mass index of 31.6 +/- 5.5 kg/m, and %fat (4C model) of 41.2 +/- 8.2%, was assessed. Body density measurements were converted to %fat estimates by using the general equation of Siri (ADPSiri) (Siri WE. Techniques for Measuring Body Composition. 1961) and the age- and gender-specific constants of Lohman (ADPLoh) (Lohman TG. Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews. 1986). TBW measurements were converted to %fat estimates by assuming that water accounts for 73% of fat-free mass (TBW73) and by utilizing the age- and gender-specific water contents of Lohman (TBWLoh). All estimates of %fat were highly correlated with those of the 4C model (r &gt; or = 0.95, P &lt; 0.001; SE &lt; or = 2.14). For %fat, the total error and mean difference +/- 95% limits of agreement compared with the 4C model were 2.50, 1.8 +/- 3.5 (ADPSiri); 1.82, -0.04 +/- 3.6 (ADPLoh); 2.86, -2.0 +/- 4.1 (TBW73); 1.90, -0.3 +/- 3.8 (TBWLoh); and 2.74, 1.9 +/- 4.0 DXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), respectively. In conclusion, in overweight and obese children, ADPLoh and TBWLoh were the most accurate methods of measuring %fat compared with a 4C model. However, all methods under consideration produced similar limits of agreement.
12556213,9,2003,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,The therapeutic potential of CXCR4 antagonists in the treatment of HIV.,Since the identification of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 as co-receptors for HIV-1 entry, several antagonists against these receptors have been synthesised. A highly selective CXCR4 antagonist, T22, and its downsized analogues T140 and TC14012, which inhibit X4-HIV-1 infection through their specific binding to CXCR4, have been identified. Besides T22 analogues, several other CXCR4 antagonists have been reported, such as AMD3100, ALX40-4C, KRH-1120 and AMD8664. Discovery of entry inhibitors, such as chemokine antagonists, may lead to the development of a new generation of antiHIV agents, since these inhibitors are thought to be useful for the clinical treatment of HIV-1-infected patients, especially at the late stage of treatment for AIDS patients developing multi-drug-resistant strains. In this review, recent research into CXCR4 antagonists in comparison with development of other antagonists is summarised.
12880954,8,2003,Cancer Lett,Long-term results and risk profiles of patients in five consecutive trials (1979-1997) with stage 4 neuroblastoma over 1 year of age.,During the last two decades new diagnostic and therapeutic tools have been utilized to improve the poor survival chances of children with stage 4 neuroblastoma. This study reviews the risk profiles and the long-term outcome of patients from five consecutive German neuroblastoma trials. A total of 96% of all German patients registered at the German childhood cancer registry with neuroblastoma stage 4 over 1 year of age at diagnosis entered one of the trials during 1979-2001. Eight hundred and twenty-eight consecutive children were analyzed retrospectively. In spite of having significantly improved diagnostic tools like bone marrow superstaging and mIBG scintigraphy the stage 4 incidence did not increase after reaching completeness of the registry (5.4 cases/100,000 children at 1-14 years of age; P=0.52). The distribution of the primary tumors and of metastases was constant over the periods. The amount of bone marrow infiltration did not change with time. The risk factors lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin and MYCN, and the clinical risk groups 4A, 4B, 4C also remained constant over the trials with a few exceptions for NB97. The 5-year event free survival increased from 0.01+/-0.01 (NB79) to 0.14+/-0.03 (NB85), 0.16+/-0.04 (NB82), 0.27+/-0.02 (NB90), and 0.33+/-0.04 (NB97). The overall survival rates improved similarly from 0.04 (NB79) to 0.44 (NB97). In conclusion, the improved survival was associated with better treatment and not caused by lower risk profiles in stage 4 neuroblastoma patients.
12749606,8,2003,J Epidemiol,Association of CYP2A6 gene deletion with cigarette smoking status in Japanese adults.,BACKGROUND: Genetic variation of CYP2A6 is shown to alter nicotine metabolism. This study was developed to investigate the genetic influence of the whole deletion-allele of CYP2A6 on active and passive smoking behavior.METHODS: Two hundred and forty Japanese adults, who visited Aichi Cancer Center as outpatients, were genotyped for the wild-type (CYP2A6*1A, CYP2A6*1B) and the whole deletion-type (CYP2A6*4C) polymorphism of CYP2A6. Information about active and passive smoking status was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. Genetic influence of CYP2A6 polymorphism on smoking behavior was evaluated using the Mantel extension test.RESULTS: The frequency of the deletion allele was 18%. All 8 subjects carrying two deletion alleles had no smoking habit, and the homozygous deletion genotype showed a tendency to correlate with active smoking status after adjustment for sex and age (p = 0.054). However, the proportion of never smokers among heterozygous subjects was almost the same as among subjects carrying no deletion allele (54% and 58%, respectively). Furthermore, CYP2A6 genotypes were correlated neither with the number of cigarettes smoked per day nor with the age at starting smoking (p = 0.364 and 0.880, respectively). Among never smokers, CYP2A6 genotypes were not correlated with exposure to passive smoking at home or in the workplace (p = 0.623 and 0.484, respectively).CONCLUSION: Despite the possible protection against active smoking behavior in subjects homozygous for the deletion allele, the CYP2A6 polymorphism has only a limited impact on public health because no protective effect was found in heterozygous subjects.
12609601,8,2003,Gene Expr Patterns,The medaka midblastula transition as revealed by the expression of the paternal genome.,At midblastula transition (MBT), zygotic gene transcription is activated, cells become motile and cell division becomes asynchronous. The onset of the medaka (Oryzias latipes) MBT was examined using expressed sequence tag (EST) markers. Among 187 randomly chosen medaka EST markers, 33 EST markers and two genes (eIF-4C and hsc70) showed polymorphisms in terms of insertion/deletions or restriction sites between the two parental inbred strains, one from the northern Japanese population and the other from the southern Japanese population. There was no evidence of zygotic expression of these EST markers before Stage 10 (early blastula stage), whereas expression of 12 genes was found from Stage 11 on. These results suggest that the medaka MBT in terms of first time transcription of paternal genes in the life of the embryo begins at Stage 11 (late blastula stage).
12524361,8,2003,Genetics,Genetic analysis, expression and molecular characterization of BoGSL-ELONG, a major gene involved in the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway of Brassica species.,We cloned a major aliphatic glucosinolate (GSL) gene, BoGSL-ELONG in Brassica oleracea, using the Arabidopsis sequence database. We based our work on an Arabidopsis candidate gene forming part of a gene family coding for isopropyl malate synthetase-like enzymes (IPMS). This gene is presumably responsible for synthesis of GSL possessing side chains consisting of four carbons (4C). The similarity of the Brassica homolog IPMS-Bo from broccoli to its Arabidopsis counterpart IPMS-At was on the order of 78%, both sharing the same number of exons. A nonfunctional allele of the BoGSL-ELONG gene from white cauliflower, based on the absence of 4C GSL in this crop, displayed a 30-bp deletion, which allowed us to develop a codominant marker for 4C-GSL. Gene expression analysis based on RT-PCR revealed a splicing site mutation in the white cauliflower allele. This resulted in a longer transcript containing intron 3, which failed to excise. Perfect cosegregation was observed for broccoli and cauliflower alleles at the IPMS-Bo gene and 4C-GSL content, strongly indicating that this gene indeed corresponds to BoGSL-ELONG. Cloning of two other major genes, BoGSL-ALK and BoGSL-PRO, is underway. The availability of these genes and BoGSL-ELONG is essential for the manipulation of the aliphatic GSL profile of B. oleracea.
14695837,7,2003,J Med Chem,Cyclodextrin-derived diorganyl tellurides as glutathione peroxidase mimics and inhibitors of thioredoxin reductase and cancer cell growth.,Water-soluble diorganyl tellurides of the alkyl aryl or dialkyl type were prepared by treatment of mono-6-tosyl-beta-cyclodextrin with sodium alkanetellurolates or arenetellurolates or sodium telluride. The novel cyclodextrin-derived organotelluriums were evaluated for their capacity to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and cumene hydroperoxide in the presence of glutathione, NADPH, and GSSG-reductase (coupled reductase assay). Cyclodextrins 4d and 4e, carrying 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenyltelluro and n-butyltelluro groups, respectively, were the most efficient glutathione peroxidase mimics. Reduction of lipophilic cumene hydroperoxide often proceeded 10-20 times faster than reduction of the more hydrophilic hydroperoxides, which cannot bind into the hydrophobic interior of the cyclodextrin. Thus, it seems that the carbohydrate moiety acts as a binding site for the hydroperoxide substrate. The cyclodextrin derivatives were also evaluated for their capacity to inhibit thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin and cancer cell growth in culture. IC(50) values for inhibition of thioredoxin or thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase were in the submicromolar range for the best inhibitors (compounds 4d and 5). Two of the compounds (4c and 5) were found to inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells in culture with IC(50) values in the low micromolar range.
12930155,7,2003,J Med Chem,Pyrazole derivatives as partial agonists for the nicotinic acid receptor.,Nicotinic acid as a hypolipidemic agent appears unique due to its potential to increase HDL cholesterol levels to a greater extent than other drugs. However, it has some side effects, among which severe skin flushing is the most frequent and often limits patients' compliance. In a search for novel agonists for the recently identified and cloned G protein-coupled nicotinic acid receptor, we synthesized a series of substituted pyrazole-3-carboxylic acids that proved to have substantial affinity for this receptor. The affinities were measured by inhibition of [(3)H]nicotinic acid binding to rat spleen membranes. Potencies and intrinsic activities relative to nicotinic acid were determined by their effects on [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to rat adipocyte and spleen membranes. Interestingly, most compounds were partial agonists. In particular, 2-diazabicyclo[3,3,0(4,8)]octa-3,8-diene-3-carboxylic acid (4c) and 5-propylpyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (4f) proved active with K(i) values of approximately 0.15 microM and EC(50) values of approximately 6 microM, while their intrinsic activity was only approximately 50% when compared to nicotinic acid. Even slightly more active was 5-butylpyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (4g) with a K(i) value of 0.072 microM, an EC(50) value of 4.12 microM, and a relative intrinsic activity of 75%. Of the aralkyl derivatives, 4q (5-(3-chlorobenzyl)pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid) was the most active with a relatively low intrinsic activity of 39%. Partial agonism of the pyrazole derivatives was confirmed by inhibition of G protein activation in response to nicotinic acid by these compounds. The pyrazoles both inhibited the maximum effect elicited by 100 microM nicotinic acid and concentration dependently shifted nicotinic acid concentration-response curves to the right, pointing to a competitive mechanism of action.
12561726,7,2003,Tsitologiia,Genome multiplication of extravillous trophoblast cells in human placenta in the course of differentiation and invasion into endometrium and myometrium. I. Dynamics of polyploidization.,Polyploidization of the extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells at different stages of differentiation and invasion into the uterine wall in human placenta has been studied. An increase in the ploidy level of EVT cells in the course of their differentiation within cell columns (CC) was shown. Stem cells were mainly diploid (86.2%); incidence of polyploid nuclei of highly proliferative cells of the proximal part of CC increased progressively. In the distal part of CC, where EVT cells did not divide mitotically, polyploid cells prevailed, with 58.0 and 3.5% nuclei being 4c and 8c, respectively. The highest percentage of polyploid cells was found in the population of EVT cells attached directly to the surface of the decidualized endometrium: percentage of tetraploid cells turned out to be 74.7% and the share of octaploid nuclei rose up to 4.9%; however, there appeared a few (0.3%) 16c cells. The majority of EVT cells invading the decidualized endometrium were polyploid, the share of octaploid and hexadecaploid cells rose up to 9.7 and 1.4%, respectively. On the other hand, the percentage of diploid cells also increased up to 29.2% as compared to EVT cells attached to decidua (20.0%). The same tendency proved to be even stronger in myometrium: the share of diploid EVT cells increased up to 46.0%, a prominent amount of tetraploid (45.1%) and highly polyploid (8c and 16c) cells retained in the EVT cell population (7.4 and 1.1%, respectively). Immunohistochemical staining of Ki-67 protein (MIB1), which labels cells held in the cell cycle, showed a high incidence of MIB1-positive stem cells (93.7%) and the EVT cells of the proximal part of CC (85.5%) characterized by high mitotic activity. A lower MIB1-positivity (43.2%) was found in the distal part of CC, whereas invasive EVT cells showed no MIB1-labeling. The presence of MIB1-positive nuclei in the distal part of CCs in the absence of mitoses, taken together with data on polyploidization of these cells, indicates their switch to the endoreduplication cycle. As a whole, the data obtained evidence that differentiation of EVT cells of the invasive pathway is accompanied by polyploidization. However, in a population of trophoblast cells capable of most profound invasion (up to myometrium), the proportion of diploid cells rose. These results suggest that the human cytotrophoblast invasion into the uterine wall requires an optimum, not the highest, ploidy level, whereas highly polyploid cells may form a subpopulation at the border between the maternal and fetal parts of placenta.
14670229,6,2003,J Liposome Res,Targeting of lipid-protamine-DNA (LPD) lipopolyplexes using RGD motifs.,The incorporation of pegylated lipid into Lipid-Protamine-DNA (LPD-PEG) lipopolyplexes causes a decrease of their in vitro transfection activity. This can be partially attributed to a reduction in particle binding to cells. To restore particle binding and specifically target LPD formulations to tumor cells, the lipid-peptide conjugate DSPE-PEG5K-succinyl-ACDCRGDCFCG-COOH (DSPE-PEG5K-RGD-4C) was generated and incorporated into LPD formulations (LPD-PEG-RGD). LPD-PEG-RGD was characterized with respect to its biophysical and biological properties. The Incorporation of DSPE-PEG5K-RGD-4C ligands into LPD formulations results in a 5 and a 15 fold increase in the LPD-PEG-RGD binding and uptake, respectively, over an LPD-PEG formulation. Enhancement of binding and uptake resulted in a 100 fold enhancement of transfection activity. Moreover, this transfection enhancement was specific to cells expressing appropriate integrin receptors (MDA-MB-231). Huh7 cells, known for their low level of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin expression, failed to show RGD mediated transfection enhancement. This transfection enhancement can be abolished in a competitive manner using free RGD peptide, but not an RGE control peptide. Results demonstrated RGD mediated enhanced LPD-PEG cell binding and transfection in cells expressing the integrin receptor. These formulations provide the basis for effective, targeted, systemic gene delivery.
14534529,6,2003,Oncogene,Human wee1 kinase is directly transactivated by and increased in association with c-Fos/AP-1: rheumatoid synovial cells overexpressing these genes go into aberrant mitosis.,Wee1 kinase downregulates the M-phase promoting factor, a complex of cdc2 and cyclin B kinase, that controls mitotic cell division. We isolated human wee1 kinase gene promoter and found that it contained one AP-1-binding motif in its promoter region (5'-CGAGTCA-3'; -823/-817), through which wee1 kinase gene was directly transactivated by c-Fos/AP-1. In rheumatoid synovial cells, wee1 kinase was increased in conjunction with the increase of c-Fos/AP-1 and the substrate of wee1, cdc2, was phosphorylated. The amount of wee1 and c-Fos and the phosphorylation of cdc2 were decreased after treatment of the cells with an inhibitor of AP-1, curcumin. A significant proportion of cultured synovial cells of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but not those of osteoarthritis, shifted to a tetraploid (4C) state upon long-term culture. Thus, human wee1 kinase gene is directly transactivated by and increased in association with c-Fos/AP-1, and rheumatoid synovial cells overexpressing these genes go into aberrant mitosis.
12967926,6,2003,Cereb Cortex,Experience-dependent regulation of the zincergic innervation of visual cortex in adult monkeys.,Zinc is packaged in, and released from, a subset of glutamatergic synapses in the mammalian telencephalon where it has been shown to act as a potent neuromodulator. In order to establish the functional role for zincergic neurons in visual cortical function and plasticity we have compared the topographic distribution of zincergic terminals in the primary visual cortex (V1) of normal adult vervet monkeys (Cercopithicus aethiops) to that in monkeys monocularly deprived of visual input for short (24 h) or long (3 months) survival times. In normal animals, staining levels for zinc were highest in layers 1-3, 4b, 5 and 6 and lowest in layers 4a and 4c. The laminar and tangential patterns of zinc staining were complementary to staining patterns demonstrated using cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry. Following 3 months of monocular deprivation by enucleation, levels of zinc staining in layers 3, 4calpha and 6a were heterogeneously reduced, clearly revealing the ocular dominance pattern in V1. When compared with the pattern of CO staining, levels of both CO and zinc were reduced in cortical territory innervated by the enucleated eye. Zinc histochemistry also revealed the ocular dominance pattern after only 24 h of monocular impulse blockade induced by enucleation or intravitreal tetrodotoxin infusion. However, by either means of deprivation for 24 h, levels of zinc were increased in deprived-eye stripes relative to nondeprived-eye stripes. These results indicate that zincergic terminals demarcate distinct compartments in the primate visual cortex. Furthermore, levels of synaptic zinc are rapidly and dynamically regulated, suggesting that zinc and/or zincergic neurons participate in mediating activity-dependent changes in the organization of the adult neocortex.
12682810,6,2003,Infection,Prevalence rates of viral hepatitis infections in refugee Kurds from Iraq and Turkey.,BACKGROUND: Since little is known about the burden of viral hepatitis in Kurds, the prevalence of infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) was investigated in a sample of refugee Kurds from Iraq and Turkey.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out. Serological markers to hepatitis viruses were determined for 1,005 subjects from all age-groups of which 36.6% were from Turkey and 63.4% from Iraq.RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence for anti-HAV was 94.4% and 14.8% for anti-HEV. A significantly higher prevalence for anti-HEV was found among Iraqis (17.5%) compared to Turkish immigrants (10.0%). The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and total anti-HBc (core) was 6.8% and 35.6% in Turkish Kurds and 2.2% and 12.7% in Iraqis, respectively. Only 10% of children aged up to 10 years and 2.8% of subjects aged 11-20 years had been vaccinated against HBV, the majority of them coming from Iraq. One subject was confirmed as positive for anti-HCV (0.1%) and HCV-RNA and analysis showed a 4c/4d genotype.CONCLUSION: This survey shows a high prevalence of enterically transmitted viral hepatitis in Kurds. HBV infection is moderately endemic, while the prevalence of HCV infection is low. There is a need for a universal immunization strategy for HBV in the Kurd population.
12648840,6,2003,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,Nucleic acid-based, cultivation-independent detection of Listeria spp and genotypes of L monocytogenes.,Based on comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, two oligonucleotide probes for in situ detection of all members of the genus Listeria were designed. These probes allowed fast and reliable in situ detection of Listeria spp. even in complex samples like raw milk. Almost full-length iap (invasion-associated protein) gene sequences were determined for 69 Listeria monocytogenes strains of all 13 known serotypes. A comparison of these sequences revealed that the L. monocytogenes strains can be grouped into three distinct genotypes. These clusters correlate well with distinct serotypes. Thus, strains of serotypes b and d belong to genotype I, a and c to genotype II, and 4a and 4c, which are rarely isolated from humans, group together within genotype III. These results could be corroborated by further comparative sequence analysis of genes encoding two phospholipases - plcA and plcB. Based on the iap gene sequences, a highly specific and reproducible competitive PCR detection method was developed. Primer pairs targeting genotype-specific regions of the iap gene were designed. The amplification of non-specific PCR products from DNA of non-target strains was prevented by adding competitive primers. By applying this method, the rapid and reliable distinction of the three L. monocytogenes genotypes was possible.
12593919,6,2003,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and preliminary evaluation of some N-[5-(2-furanyl)-2-methyl-4-oxo-4H-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-3-yl]-carboxamide and 3-substituted-5-(2-furanyl)-2-methyl-3H-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ones as antimicrobial agents.,Two series of N-[5-(2-furanyl)-2-methyl-4-oxo-4H-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-3-yl]-carboxamide (4a-m) and 3-substituted-5-(2-furanyl)-2-methyl-3H-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ones (5a-m) were synthesised using appropriate synthetic route. All the test compounds 4a-m and 5a-m were assayed in vitro for antibacterial activity against two different strains of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and S. typhi) and Gram-positive (S. aureus, B. subtilis) bacteria and the antimycobacterial activity was evaluated against M. tuberculosis and M. avium strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for test compounds as well as for reference standards. The test compounds have shown significant antibacterial and antimycobacterial activity against all the microbial strains used, when tested in vitro. In general, along with the thienopyrimidinone ring, substituted amido or imino side chain at position 3 is essential for antimicrobial activity. Among the compounds tested, compounds 4c, 4e and 4g in N-[5-(2-furanyl)-2-methyl-4-oxo-4H-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-3-yl]-carboxamide series and compounds 5c, 5e and 5g in 3-substituted-5-(2-furanyl)-2-methyl-3H-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ones series were found to be the most potent. Further the toxicity of most potent compounds 4c, 4e and 4g and 5c, 5e and 5g were assessed using hemolytic assay and minimal hemolytic concentration (MHCs) were determined. In general, test compounds were found to be non-toxic up to a dose level of 200 micromol L(-1) (MHC).
14529964,5,2003,J Microbiol Methods,An SNP-based PCR assay to differentiate between Listeria monocytogenes lineages derived from phylogenetic analysis of the sigB gene.,The alternative sigma factor sigB gene is involved in the stress response regulation of Listeria monocytogenes, and contributes towards growth and survival in adverse conditions. This gene was examined to determine if it could be a useful indicator of lineage differentiation, similar to the established method based on ribotyping. The sigB sequence was resolved in four local L. monocytogenes strains and the phylogenetic relationship among these, and a further 21 sigB gene sequences from strains of different serotype and lineage including two Listeria innocua strains, obtained from the GenBank database were determined. The sigB nucleotide sequences of these 25 Listeria strains were then examined for single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) sites that could differentiate between the three lineages. Based on nucleotide sequences L. monocytogenes lineage I/serotype 1/2b and 4b clustered together, lineage II/serotype 1/2a and 1/2c strains clustered together, lineage III/serotypes 4a and 4c strains clustered together and L. innocua strains clustered together as an outgroup. SNPs differentiating the three lineages were identified. Individual allele-specific PCR reactions based on these polymorphisms were successful in grouping known and a further 37 local L. monocytogenes isolates into the three lineages.
12818677,5,2003,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis of new 3-alkoxy-7-amino-4-chloro-isocoumarin derivatives as new beta-amyloid peptide production inhibitors and their activities on various classes of protease.,A series of new 7-substituted-4-chloro-3-alkoxy isocoumarin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of representative classes of proteases: serine protease (alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin), cysteine protease (Caspase-3), and aspartyl protease (HIV-protease), 20S proteasome and also as inhibitors of amyloid peptide gamma-secretase-mediated production. Protease inhibition selectivity is directly related to the structure of the substituent at the 7-position of the isocoumarin nucleus. 7-Nitro-isocoumarin derivatives (4c, 4d, 4f) are potent alpha-chymotrypsin inhibitors but slightly active or inactive on HIV-protease, as well as on cysteine protease. In contrast, only derivatives bearing a free amino (5d, 5f) or a substituted amino group (6f) at the 7-position of the isocoumarin nucleus, were found weakly active or inactive on alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin, Caspase-3 and HIV-protease, but prevent gamma-secretase-mediated production of Abeta 40/42 amyloid peptides, which is known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the most active compounds on beta-amyloid peptide production [JLK6 (5d), JLK2 (5f) and JLK7 (6f)] show only weak or moderate inhibitory activity on the 20S proteasome. The obtained results suggest that the described new isocoumarin analogues could be of interest, since compounds like JLK6 (5d), JLK2 (5f) and JLK7 (6f) can be considered as possible hits for the development of new agents directed towards Alzheimer's disease.
12909623,4,2003,J Biol Chem,Site-specific DNA transesterification by vaccinia topoisomerase: effects of benzo[alpha]pyrene-dA, 8-oxoguanine, 8-oxoadenine and 2-aminopurine modifications.,Vaccinia DNA topoisomerase forms a covalent DNA-(3'-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate at a specific target site 5'-C+5C+4C+3T+2T+1p downward arrow N-1 in duplex DNA. Here we study the effects of base modifications on the rate and extent of single-turnover DNA transesterification. Chiral trans opened C-10 R and S adducts of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide were introduced at single N6-deoxyadenosine (dA) positions within the 3'-G+5G+4G+3A+2A+1T-1A-2 sequence of the nonscissile DNA strand. The R and S BPdA adducts intercalate from the major groove on the 5' and 3' sides of the modified base, respectively, and perturb local base stacking. We found that R and S BPdA modifications at +1A reduced the transesterification rate by a factor of 700-1000 without affecting the yield of the covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex. BPdA modifications at +2A reduced the extent of transesterification and elicited rate decrements of 200- and 7000-fold for the S and R diastereomers, respectively. In contrast, BPdA adducts at the -2 position had no effect on the extent of the reaction and relatively little impact on the rate of cleavage. A more subtle probe of major groove contacts entailed substituting each of the purines of the nonscissile strand with its 8-oxo analog. The +3 oxoG modification slowed transesterification 35-fold, whereas other 8-oxo modifications were benign. 8-Oxo substitutions at the -1 position in the scissile strand slowed single-turnover cleavage by a factor of six but had an even greater slowing effect on religation, which resulted in an increase in the cleavage equilibrium constant. 2-Aminopurine at positions +3, +4, or +5 in the nonscissile strand had no effect on transesterification per se but had synergistic effects when combined with 8-oxoA at position -1 in the scissile strand. These findings illuminate the functional interface of vaccinia topoisomerase with the DNA major groove.
12782945,4,2003,Anticancer Drugs,Phosphodiesterase 4 in osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells as a potential target for growth inhibition.,Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that HOSM-1 cells, an osteosarcoma cell line established from human mandible, expressed mRNA for osteoblastic markers, such as alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, osteocalcin and parathyroid hormone receptor, thus exhibiting an osteoblastic phenotype. We have investigated a possible role of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in osteosarcoma cells. RT-PCR analysis revealed that HOSM-1 cells expressed mRNA for PDE4A, 4B and 4C. In addition, rolipram, a specific inhibitor of PDE4, inhibited HOSM-1 cell proliferation. The finding that PDE4 is involved in proliferation of osteosarcoma cells suggests the possibility that PDE4 may be a new target for antitumor therapy.
12582848,4,2003,Theor Appl Genet,The ploidy level of transgenic plants in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of tomato cotyledons ( Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is genotype and procedure dependent [corrected].,A protocol avoiding the feeder-layer cell system was optimized for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of tomato cotyledonary explants. Over 500 transgenic plants from five tomato cultivars were regenerated in 15 independent experiments. Depending on both genotype and procedure, transformation frequencies ranged from 1.8% to 11.3%. The optimal transformation rate was obtained by inoculating explants with a bacterial suspension in exponential growth ( D(600) = 10(2)-10(3) cells/ml) and transferring cotyledon explants to fresh selective regeneration medium every 3 weeks. The ploidy level of both tomato genotypes used as explant source and primary transformants, was studied by flow cytometry. The inbred lines and cultivars were diploid but a polysomatic pattern in the cotyledon explant was confirmed. The rate of tetraploid transgenic plants ranged from 24.5% to 80% and depended on both the genotype and the transformation procedure. Surprisingly, the percentages of transformed plants with higher ploidy levels were not related to the proportion of 4C and 8C nuclei in the cotyledonary tissue. For some genotypes the optimisation of the transformation rate resulted in an increase of tetraploid transgenic plants. Results obtained in this work indicate the convenience of checking the ploidy level of the primary transformants before performing basic studies or introducing tomato transgenic material in a breeding program.
14672470,3,2003,Obstet Gynecol,Single additional dose postpartum therapy for women with chorioamnionitis.,OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a short course of antibiotics provides adequate treatment for chorioamnionitis.METHODS: Women received intravenous ampicillin, 2 g every 6 hours, and gentamicin, 1.5 mg/kg every 8 hours, when clinical chorioamnionitis was diagnosed. After delivery, subjects were randomized to continue this regimen until afebrile and asymptomatic for 24 hours (control group) or to receive only the next scheduled dose of each drug (study group). If delivered via cesarean, patients received clindamycin, 900 mg intravenously, at umbilical cord clamping. The control group continued receiving clindamycin every 8 hours until antibiotics were discontinued. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as a single temperature after the first postpartum dose of antibiotics of 39.0C or more, or two temperatures 38.4C or more at least 4 hours apart. To detect a 150% increase in rate of treatment failures from 8% in the control group to 20% in the study group, 292 subjects were needed (alpha = .05; 1 - beta = .80).RESULTS: From December 26, 1999, to March 18, 2003, a total of 292 women were enrolled in the study. In the intent-to-treat analysis, treatment failure rate did not differ between the control (n = 141) and study (n = 151) groups (3.5% versus 4.6%; P = .639).CONCLUSION: If treated promptly intrapartum, one additional dose of a broad-spectrum combination of antibiotics is sufficient postpartum therapy for immune-competent women with chorioamnionitis.
14618436,3,2003,Acta Diabetol,Usefulness of age-adjusted equations to estimate body fat with air displacement plethysmography in male adolescent athletes.,This study was designed to examine the accuracy of air-displacement plethysmography (ADP) using Lohman's age-adjusted equations (Leq) and Siri's equation (Seq) in estimating body fat (BF) in male adolescent athletes, with the four-compartment (4C) model as reference. Subjects were 51 Caucasian boys (age, 15.5+/-1.2 years; weight, 71.0+/-11.9 kg; stature, 1.79+/-0.12 m). Comparison of means with the Wilcoxon test showed that BF estimates with Seq to be different from those with Leq and 4C model, (8.8+/-4.4 vs. 7.9+/-4.5 and 8.1+/-4.0 kg, respectively) ( p&lt;0.001), suggesting an overestimation of BF. However, BF estimates with the Leq and with the 4C model were identical ( p&gt;0.05). Estimates using Seq and Leq with the 4C model were similar, as shown by the 95% confidence intervals (-4.7-2.4 and -4.0-3.7, respectively). These findings suggest that in male adolescent athletes, the use of Leq improves estimates of BF by densitometry using ADP.
12879085,3,2003,Eur J Clin Nutr,Body composition estimated by bioelectrical impedance in the Swedish elderly. Development of population-based prediction equation and reference values of fat-free mass and body fat for 70- and 75-y olds.,OBJECTIVE: To develop a bioelectrical impedance (BIA) prediction equation for fat-free mass (FFM(BIA)) and present reference values of FFM and body fat (BF) for healthy Swedish elderly from population-based representative samples.SUBJECTS: This study is based on 823 (344 males, 479 females) participants from two systematic samples of birth cohorts in Göteborg aged 70 (cohort H70V, 201 males and 299 females) and 75 (cohort NORA75, 143 males and 180 females).METHODS: Body composition was measured with BIA (BIA-101, RJL system, Detroit) in both cohorts and was estimated by a four-compartment (4C) model from total body water (TBW) and total body potassium (TBK) in a sub-sample of the NORA75 cohort. The FFM(BIA) was validated against the FFM from the 4C model (FFM(4C)).RESULTS: The FFM(BIA) correlated well with FFM(4C) (r=0.95, SEE=2.64 kg). The FFM(BIA) (kg) in 70-y-old males and females were 58.5+/-5.4 and 43.4+/-4.4, and for 75-y-old males and females were 56.1+/-4.7 and 42.5+/-4, respectively. The body fat in kg (FM) among 70-y-old males and females were 25.2+/-8.1 and 25.7+/-8.4, and for 75-y-old males and females were 21.7+/-7.1 and 22.8+7.2, respectively. The percent body fat (BF%) among 70-y-old males and females were 29.5+/-5.8 and 36.3+/-6.4, and for 75-y-old males and females were 27.3+/-6 and 34.1+/-6.1, respectively.CONCLUSION: The FFM, FM and BF% from this study might be used as reference values for Swedish elderly aged 70 and 75 y.
12658637,3,2003,Mol Reprod Dev,Development of the meiotic step in testes of pubertal rats: comparison between the in vivo situation and under in vitro conditions.,The present work aimed to compare some features of the meiotic process which develops in the testis of pubertal rats, in vivo and in vitro, paying special attention to the time-course of the phenomenon. The differentiation of spermatocytes was assessed in testes of 20- to 46-day-old rats and in tubule segments of 20- or 28-day-old rats cultured over a 4-week period. Very similar results were obtained in vivo and in vitro, during the first week of culture, when considering the changes in the cell populations of different ploidy, the gene expression of germ cells, the kinetics of differentiation of BrdU-labeled early or middle pachytene spermatocytes and the levels of apoptosis in the different cell populations. However, during the second week of culture, the decrease in the proportion of the 4C cell population which was only slightly more marked than that observed in vivo between 27 and 34 days, was not associated with an increase in the 1C cell population as large as in vivo. This result could be explained partly by a high proportion of apoptotic 1C cells beyond one week of culture. Concomitantly, the rate of in vitro differentiation of BrdU-labeled spermatocytes slowed down when reaching the stage of middle pachytene spermatocytes and BrdU-labeled round spermatids were observed 6-11 days later than when BrdU-labeled spermatocytes differentiated in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that the bottleneck for the development of the meiotic cells in vitro is at the transition from middle to late pachytene spermatocytes. Hence, comparing the expression of locally produced regulatory molecules in vivo and in vitro at different days of culture should allow to identify key regulators of the meiotic step of spermatogenesis.
14684338,2,2003,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,P1 and P3 optimization of novel bicycloproline P2 bearing tetrapeptidyl alpha-ketoamide based HCV protease inhibitors.,With the aim of discovering potent and selective HCV protease inhibitors, we synthesized and evaluated a series of 1a based tetrapeptidyl ketoamides with additional modification(s) at P1', P1, and P3 positions. As a result of this effort, we found that replacement of the P3 valine with tert-leucine resulted in the discovery of a series of inhibitors (e.g., 3a, 3c, and 4c) endowed with improved enzyme and/or cellular activity relative to 1a. When dosed to F-344 rats orally at 50mg/kg, 3a achieved 2.5x higher liver and plasma exposure in comparison to that detected with 1a.
14646319,2,2003,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo),Synthesis and biological evaluation of ebselen and its acyclic derivatives.,Five ebselen and three acyclic ebselen derivatives were synthesized. These compounds were screened for their glutathione peroxidase (GSH Px)-like activity and scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-pycryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and peroxynitrite radical. All tested compounds displayed similar significant GSH Px-like activity, which are slightly higher than that of ebselen. The peroxynitrite scavenging activity showed that the acyclic allylseleno 4c was five times more potent than ebselen.
12943134,2,2003,Crit Care Nurs Clin North Am,Nursing's role in complementary and alternative therapy use in critical care.,Critical care nurses can expect to encounter more patients using CAT and increasing opportunities and requests for CAT use in their critical care environments. This provides an opportunity for nurses' involvement to shape proactively how the use of these therapies will unfold in critical care. This can be accomplished in various ways. Actively ask patients and families about use of CAT. Initiate discussions with colleagues and peers about professional and personal use of therapies. Explore the knowledge and education needed to administer specific CAT. Engage in research regarding the use of CAT in critical care. Identify experts in the institution and surrounding community. Encourage critical care units and institutions to consider how CAT should be implemented across the institution. From a broader perspective, nurses may become part of professional political processes shaping patient accessibility to CAT and the use of CAT in the discipline, across disciplines, and in healthcare settings and public domains. It is crucial that nurses not relinquish their role as traditional providers of CAT in providing safe, effective, and holistic care at the bedside of critically ill patients.
12919324,2,2003,Eur J Biochem,Does different orientation of the methoxy groups of ubiquinone-10 in the reaction centre of Rhodobacter sphaeroides cause different binding at QA and QB?,The different roles of ubiquinone-10 (UQ10) at the primary and secondary quinone (QA and QB) binding sites of Rhodobacter sphaeroides R26 reaction centres are governed by the protein microenvironment. The 4C=O carbonyl group of QA is unusually strongly hydrogen-bonded, in contrast to QB. This asymmetric binding seems to determine their different functions. The asymmetric hydrogen-bonding at QA can be caused intrinsically by distortion of the methoxy groups or extrinsically by binding to specific amino-acid side groups. Different X-ray-based structural models show contradictory orientations of the methoxy groups and do not provide a clear picture. To elucidate if distortion of the methoxy groups induces this hydrogen-bonding, their (ring-)C-O vibrations were assigned by use of site-specifically labelled [5-13C]UQ10 and [6-13C]UQ10 reconstituted at either the QA or the QB binding site. Two infrared bands at 1288 cm(-1) and 1264 cm(-1) were assigned to the methoxy vibrations. They did not shift in frequency at either the QA or QB binding sites, as compared with unbound UQ10. As the frequencies of these vibrations and their coupling are sensitive to the conformations of the methoxy groups, different conformations of the C(5) and C(6) methoxy groups at the QA and QB binding sites can now be excluded. Both methoxy groups are oriented out of plane at QA and QB. Therefore, hydrogen-bonding to His M219 combined with electrostatic interactions with the Fe2+ ion seems to determine the strong asymmetric binding of QA.
12832131,2,2003,Eur J Med Chem,Cytotoxic effects, alkylating properties and molecular modelling of coumarin derivatives and their phosphonic analogues.,The cytotoxic effects and alkylating activity of a series of 3-[1-(alkylamino)-ethylidene]-chroman-2,4-dione (4a-4c), 2-methoxy-3-[1-(alkylamino)-ethylidene]-2,3-dihydro-2,4-dioxo-2lambda(5)-benzo[e][1,2] oxaphosphinane (5a-5c) and [2-oxo-4-phenyl(alkyl)-2H-chromen-3-yl]-phosphonic acids dimethyl ester (6a-6c) on the two leukemia cell lines HL-60 and NALM-6 have been determined. The test compounds are much more toxic to NALM-6 cells than to HL-60 cells. IC(50) data are up to nine times lower for the NALM-6 than for the HL-60 cell lines. As determined in an in vitro Preussmann test phosphonic derivatives 6a-6c possess very high (+++) alkylating activity, phosphoric derivatives 5a-5c are less active (++) while the derivatives 4a-4c can be included in the group of low activity (+) alkylating agents. Using regression analysis QSAR we found a relationship between biological activity and the physicochemical properties of the test compounds. Their cytotoxic effect increases with an increase of the hydrophobic parameters in the region of the substituents at the 2-, 3- and 4-positions of the benzopyrone skeleton of 4-6.
12828467,2,2003,J Nat Prod,Synthetic method and biological activities of cis-fused alpha-methylene gamma-lactones.,A reliable method was developed for the synthesis of cis-fused alpha-methylene gamma-lactones via alpha-methyl gamma-lactones. Bromination of alpha-methyl gamma-lactones with LDA/CBr(4) or TMSOTf/PTAB and successive dehydrobromination with DBU or TBAF of the resulting alpha-bromo-alpha-methyl gamma-lactones gave the desired alpha-methylene gamma-lactones in high yield. This method was successfully applied to the synthesis of biologically active compounds. alpha-Methylene gamma-lactone derivatives 1c, 2c, 4c, and 17 showed cell growth inhibitory activity to P388 lymphocytic leukemia. They also showed significant activities to crop diseases. Thus, alpha-methylene gamma-lactone 1c showed preventive activity in controlling scab of apple caused by Venturia inaequalis. alpha-Methylene gamma-lactones 2c, 4c, 17, and 18 also showed significant preventive activities in controlling damping off of cucumber caused by Pythium aphanidermatum.
12617910,2,2003,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Design and synthesis of the tumor-activated prodrug of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibitor, RO0094889 for combination therapy with capecitabine.,A series of tumor-activated prodrugs of the inhibitors of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), an enzyme catabolizing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU: 4g), has been designed and synthesized. RO0094889 (11c) is a prodrug of 5-vinyluracil (4c), a known DPD inhibitor, and was designed to generate 4c selectively in tumor tissues by sequential conversion of 11c by three enzymes: esterase, cytidine deaminase and thymidine phosphorylase, the latter two of which are known to be highly expressed in various tumor tissues. When capecitabine (1), a tumor-activated prodrug of 5-FU, was co-administered orally with 11c, 5-FU in tumor tissues was significantly increased with only a slight increase of 5-FU in plasma as compared with oral capecitabine alone.
12610815,2,2003,J Rheumatol,Molecular changes in human osteoarthritic cartilage after 3 weeks of oral administration of BAY 12-9566, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor.,OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of BAY 12-9566, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, on articular cartilage metabolism in patients with osteoarthritis (OA).METHODS: Thirty-five patients with OA were randomized to receive oral daily dosing of BAY 12-9566 (25, 100, or 400 mg) or placebo for 3 weeks prior to knee surgery. Cartilage samples were obtained at surgery and examined for markers of proteoglycan aggrecan turnover (846 epitope, a putative synthesis marker, and keratan sulfate epitope content) and type II collagen synthesis (C-propeptide content), cleavage by collagenase (COL 2-3/4C short), denaturation, and content (COL2-3/4m epitope). BAY 12-9566 concentrations were measured by HPLC in serum, synovial fluid, and cartilage.RESULTS: Comparisons between study drug and placebo treatments revealed that at the 100 mg dose there was a significant increase in the 846 epitope (p = 0.012). Total type II collagen content was also higher at this dosage (p = 0.012). Alterations in collagen degradation and synthesis were not detected.CONCLUSION: BAY 12-9566 at daily doses of 100 mg significantly altered proteoglycan turnover, resulting in a cartilage composition reflected by the content of the 846 epitope that is more characteristic of a young growing individual. The increase in this epitope may signify increased matrix synthesis. The increase in type II collagen content was unexpected, since there was no other evidence for altered collagen turnover. However, increased matrix assembly would also be indicated by this increased content.
12605988,2,2003,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,Clinical significance of atomic inner shell ionization (ISI) and Auger cascade for radiosensitization using IUdR, BUdR, platinum salts, or gadolinium porphyrin compounds.,PURPOSE: Halogenated pyrimidines (iododeoxyuridine [IUdR] and bromodeoxyuridine [BUdR]), platinum salts, and gadolinium porphyrins are heavy atom compounds used as radiosensitizers. For IUdR, it has been hypothesized that iodine inner shell ionizations (ISI) and Auger cascades could be one of the primary radiosensitization mechanisms. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the number of ISI produced per tumor cell and per 2 Gy irradiation in clinically relevant modelings.MATERIALS AND METHODS: ISI were evaluated using a two-step method. Photon-induced ISI were calculated using the MCNP-4C Monte Carlo code, heavy atom concentrations from clinical data published in the literature, and at various depths in a water phantom irradiated with 6-MV, (60)Co, (137)Cs, or (192)Ir sources. Electron knock-on induced ISI on K, L, and M atomic shells were evaluated with an hybrid method, using simulated electron spectra and cross-sections derived from the Møller formalism. Using a biological dose equivalence of 0.05 Gy per cell ISI, relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values were calculated for each situation.RESULTS: For platinum and gadolinium, ISI occurs in far less than 0.1% of the cell, whichever is the configuration. For IUdR and BUdR, ISI occurs in between 45% to 483% of the cell. Due to spectrum degradation, about 3 times more photoelectric ISI are generated at greater than shallower depths, and 10 times more for (192)Ir compared with (60)Co or 6-MV X-rays. Photoelectric ISI are about 3 times more frequent for iodine than bromine, but electron knock-on ISI are more frequent on bromine, and at the end about the same number of ISI are generated for both elements. RBEs were found to be between 1.01 and 1.12 for clinically relevant irradiation settings.CONCLUSIONS: The mechanisms of radiosensitization for platinum and gadolinium are clearly not related to an Auger cascade. For halogenated pyrimidines, however, clinically relevant numbers of ISI are generated within each cell. For IUdR, ISI appears to be strongly tied to the photon spectra. Halogenated pyrimidines should be evaluated again clinically, but using lower energy photons like a (192)Ir implant.
12590533,2,2003,J Am Chem Soc,Ring-opening reaction of phosphorus-bridged [1]ferrocenophane via ring slippage from eta(5)- to eta(1)-Cp.,A reaction mechanism was investigated for a ring-opening reaction of RP(E)-bridged [1]ferrocenophane, where RP(E) = PhP(S) (3a), PhP (3b), and MesP (3c) (Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl). Irradiation of UV-vis light in the presence of an excess amount of P(OMe)(3) transformed 3a to [Fe(PhP(S)(eta(5)-C(5)H(4))(eta(1)-C(5)H(4)))(P(OMe)(3))(2)] (4a), in which one of the two cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings of 3a changed its coordination mode from eta(5) to eta(1) and vacant coordination sites thus formed on the iron center were occupied by two P(OMe)(3) ligands. The molecular structure of 4a was determined by X-ray analysis, in which eta(1)-Cp adopted a 1-Fe-2-P-1,3-cyclopentadiene structure. Under the same reaction conditions, 3b and 3c also gave similar ring-slipped products 4b and 4c, respectively. Photolysis of 3a using more strongly coordinating PMe(3) in place of P(OMe)(3) led to complete dissociation of a Cp ligand from the iron center to form [Fe(PhP(S)(eta(5)-C(5)H(4))(C(5)H(4)))(PMe(3))(3)] (5). The formation of the ring-slipped and -dissociated products on the photolysis of 3 strongly supports the view that photolytic ring-opening polymerization of 3 proceeds via an unprecedented Fe-Cp bond cleavage mechanism.
12569226,2,2003,Med Sci Sports Exerc,Multicomponent cross-validation of minimum weight predictions for college wrestlers.,In 1998, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) adopted a rule requiring that skinfolds (SF) or hydrostatic weighing (HW) be used to estimate minimum weight (MW) in college wrestlers.</AbstractText>: In 1998, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) adopted a rule requiring that skinfolds (SF) or hydrostatic weighing (HW) be used to estimate minimum weight (MW) in college wrestlers.PURPOSE: To cross-validate the NCAA methods for estimation of MW using a multicomponent criterion (4C).METHODS: Criterion MW was calculated from body density (BD), bone mineral content (BMC), and total body water (TBW) using the 4C equation of Lohman (1992). BMC was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), TBW by deuterium dilution, and BD by HW. Subjects were Division I athletes from the University of Wisconsin (mean +/- SD; N = 33, age = 19.5 +/- 1.3 yr, height = 177.3 +/- 7.8 cm, weight = 74.2 +/- 9.3kg).RESULTS: There was no significant difference between mean MW from HW (69.6 +/- 8.5 kg) and SF (70.1 +/- 8.3 kg) ( P = 0.113), and between mean MW from HW (69.6 +/- 8.5 kg) and 4C (69.5 +/- 8.6 kg) ( P = 0.46). A clinically small, yet significant difference was seen when comparing mean MW from SF to 4C ( P = 0.013). The regression for the relationship between 4C and HW (y = 0.994 x HW + 0.294 kg, R2 = 0.985) and 4C and SF (y = 1.019 x SF - 1.885 kg, R2 = 0.979) did not significantly deviate from the line of identity. Pure error (PE) values of 1.04 kg and 1.35 kg were found for HW and SF, respectively. The difference between the methods was plotted as a function of the 4C criterion. The regression line for HW and 4C (y = -0.009x + 0.743, r = -0.07, P = 0.69) and SF and 4C (y = -0.038x + 3.259, r = -0.27, P = 0.13) suggest that no systematic differences in the prediction were associated with the size of the criterion.CONCLUSION: These data support the NCAA methods of HW and SF to predict MW when cross-validated using a 4C criterion in this sample.
12554969,2,2003,Acta Crystallogr B,The modulated structure of Ba0.39Sr0.61Nb2O6. I. Harmonic solution.,The structure of a crystal of Sr(0.61)Ba(0.39)Nb(2)O(6) has been solved and refined as an incommensurate structure in five-dimensional superspace. The structure is tetragonal, superspace group P4bm(pp1/2,p - p1/2), unit-cell parameters a = 12.4566 (9), c = 7.8698 (6) A, modulation vectors q(1) = 0.3075 (6) (a* + b*), q(2) = 0.3075 (6) (a* - b*). The data collection was performed on a KUMA-CCD diffractometer and allowed the integration of weak first-order satellite reflections. The structure was refined from 2569 reflections to a final value of R = 0.0479. The modulation affects mainly the positions of the O atoms, which are displaced by as much as 0.5 A, and the site 4c that is occupied by Sr and Ba atoms. Only a simplified model, in which this atomic position is occupied by an effective atom Sr/Ba, could be refined from the data set. The modulation of displacement parameters has been used to account for the modulated distribution of Sr and Ba. The whole refinement uses only first-order modulation waves, but there are strong indications that for a complete solution the use of higher-order satellites and a more complicated model is necessary.

The key step involves the easy formation of 1,3-disubstituted cyclic alkenyl ether, an important framework of isochromene natural products, with a dual role Pd(II) catalyst.
14519945,1,2003,Biol Pharm Bull,Synthesis and anticonvulsant activity of novel 1-substituted-1,2-dihydro-pyridazine-3,6-diones.,The synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel 1-substituted-1,2-dihydro-pyridazine-3,6-diones (4a--l, 5a--j) as potential anticonvulsant agents are described. The compounds were tested in vivo for the anticonvulsant activity. The compound which have maximum protection against MES induced seizures is 1-[3-(2-aminophenylamino)-2-hydroxypropyl)-1,2-dihydro-pyridazine-3,6-dione 4h (ED(50)=44.7 mg x kg(-1) i.p.) 1-[2-hydroxy-3-piperazin1-yl-propyl)-1,2-dihydro-pyridazine-3,6-dione 4c (ED(50)=72 mg x kg(-1) i.p.) and 1-[2-hydroxy-3-imidazol-1-yl-propyl)-1,2-dihydro-pyridazine-3,6-dione 4d (ED(50)=79 mg x kg(-1) i.p.) were also found to have maximum protection against MES induced seizures. Whereas all these compounds failed to protect the animals from subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (Metrozol) seizure threshold test (sc-Met).
12968872,1,2003,J Org Chem,Palladium-catalyzed carbocyclization of allene-diene derivatives. Exploring different nucleophiles.,The palladium-catalyzed carbocyclization of allene-diene derivatives leading to the stereospecific formation of various 4-substituted [4.3.0] and [5.3.0] bicyclic systems is presented. Different functionalities were introduced at the C-4 position of the bicyclic systems by using a range of external nucleophiles such as carboxylic acids, alcohols, phenols, and thiophenols. In the previous protocol acetic acid was used as solvent and also served as nucleophile. In this new methodology, reactions were run in nonnucleophlic solvents such as CH(2)Cl(2) or acetone in the presence of the appropriate nucleophile, making this new protocol a more versatile tool in organic synthesis. It is noteworthy that the Pd(II)-catalyzed cyclization of cycloheptadiene-derivative 1b gave exclusively the trans-annulated bicycle 4. Depending on the nature of the nucleophile, the regioselectivity of the reaction could be tuned to afford exclusively 4b or 4c' (Scheme 1). The mechanistic pathway is discussed.
12923652,1,2003,Eur J Nutr,Validation of air-displacement plethysmography for estimation of body fat mass in healthy elderly subjects.,BACKGROUND: Air-displacement plethysmography (ADP) is a non-invasive method for body composition analysis that divides the body into fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) (= 2 compartment model, 2C). It places low demands on subject performance and is therefore most convenient in the elderly.OBJECTIVE: To validate ADP against dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and to compare it to a four-compartment model of body composition (4C; fat mass, total body water, bone mineral content and residual mass) in the elderly.METHODS: Body composition was assessed by ADP, DEXA and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in 26 healthy elderly subjects (15 women, 11 men) aged 60-82 years.RESULTS: Despite a high correlation of %FM assessed by ADP and DEXA we observed significant differences between the results of these methods for both sexes (2.5 +/-3.4%; bias +/- SD). Deviations of %FM(ADP) from %FM(DEXA) were dependent on bone mineral content (BMC(DEXA)) fraction of FFM. A low BMC(DEXA) was related to an overestimation of DEXA-derived %FM by ADP. There was a systematic bias between results from ADP and the 4C model. 76% of its variance was explained by the assumption of a fixed density of FFM. 96% of the variance in the density of FFM was explained by water content and only 4% by BMC(DEXA) of FFM. When compared to a 4C model, overestimation of %FM(ADP) increases with increasing water fraction of FFM.CONCLUSION: Although there is a tendency for overestimation of %FM(ADP),ADP is a valid method for body composition measurement in the elderly. The bias in %FM(ADP) is mainly related to water content of FFM and indicates that a correction factor for TBW may improve the accuracy of the ADP measurements in the elderly.
12890632,1,2003,Virology,Binding of ALX40-4C to APJ, a CNS-based receptor, inhibits its utilization as a co-receptor by HIV-1.,APJ, a G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor, has been shown to serve as a co-receptor for the entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and it is dramatically expressed in central nervous system (CNS)-based cells. ALX40-4C was identified as a small-molecule antagonist of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, which can specifically inhibit HIV-1 entry via this co-receptor. In this study, we demonstrated that ALX40-4C inhibited both APJ- and CXCR4/APJ-mediated cell membrane fusion in a dose-dependent manner. In competitive binding assays, (125)I-Apelin13 was replaced by ALX40-4C with an IC(50) of 2.9 microM, as compared with an IC(50) of 0.2 nM for Apelin13. Furthermore, ALX40-4C could block ligand-induced APJ internalization and signaling. ALX40-4C, as an antagonist to APJ, directly binds to and prevents use of APJ as a HIV-1 co-receptor. Thus, ALX-4C has potential utility for further elucidation of HIV-1 neuropathogenesis and therapy of HIV-1-induced encephalopathy.
12824030,1,2003,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,1,7- and 2,7-naphthyridine derivatives as potent and highly specific PDE5 inhibitors.,Novel 1,7- and 2,7-naphthyridine derivatives, designed by the introduction of nitrogen atom into the phenyl ring of previously reported 4-aryl-1-isoquinolinone derivatives, were disclosed as a new structural class of potent and specific PDE5 inhibitors. Among them, 2,7-naphthyridine 4c showed potent PDE5 inhibition (IC(50)=0.23 nM) and one of the best PDE5 specificities against PDEs1-4,6 (&gt;100,000-fold selective versus PDE1-4, 240-fold selective vs PDE6). This compound showed more potent relaxant effects on isolated rabbit corpus cavernosum (EC(30)=5.0 nM) than Sildenafil (EC(30)=8.7 nM). The compound 4c (T-0156) was selected for further biological and pharmacological evaluation of erectile dysfunction.
12762729,1,2003,J Org Chem,Highly enantiomerically enriched chlorophosphine boranes: synthesis and applications as P-chirogenic electrophilic blocks.,The stereoselective synthesis of P-chirogenic chlorophosphine boranes 4 was investigated by HCl acidolysis of the corresponding aminophosphine boranes 10. The reaction afforded the P-N bond cleavage with inversion of the configuration at the phosphorus center, leading to the chlorophosphine boranes 4 with high to excellent enantiomeric purities (80-99% ee), except in the case of the chloro-1-naphthylphenylphosphine borane 4d. Reaction conditions and workup significantly influence the enantiomeric purity of the product, with the exception of the o-anisyl- and o-tolylchlorophenylphosphine boranes, 4b and 4c, which were found to be particularly stable even after purification by chromatography on silica gel. Reaction of the chlorophosphine boranes 4 with various nucleophiles, such as carbanions, phenolates, thiophenolates, or amides, afforded the corresponding organophosphorus borane complexes via P-C, P-O, P-S, and P-N bond formation, respectively, in 34-93% yield and with up to 99% ee. This work demonstrates the importance of chlorophosphine boranes 4 as new and powerful electrophilic building blocks for the highly stereoselective synthesis of P-chirogenic organophosphorus compounds.
12702482,1,2003,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),[Comparison of two hepatitis C virus typing assays in a Tunisian population].,In patients with hepatitis C, it is necessary to determine the genotype of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) to tailor treatment schedules. HCV-positive sera from 60 chronically infected patients were analyzed by two methods: serotyping and genotyping, to evaluate the suitability of serotyping method for routine determination of HCV genotype; 47 men and 13 women were included in this study, nine were renal transplant patients and five were hemodialysis patients. Anti-HCV antibodies were detected by Elisa (HCV Ab III, Innogenetics SA) and confirmed by immunoblot assay (INNO-LIA-HCV Ab III update, Innogenetics SA). Genotyping analysis was performed by a line probe assay (Inno-LiPA-HCV, Innogenetics SA) and serotypes were determined by an Elisa-based serotyping assay (Murex HCV serotyping 1-6 HCO2, Murex SA) which detect type specific antibodies against NS4-derived epitopes. Among 60 patients positive for anti-HCV antibodies and confirmed by immunoblot assay only 90% show a strong reactivity with NS4. We found the following genotype distribution : 1b (73.3%), 4 (10%), 1a (5%), 3a (5%), 4c/4d (5%) and 1 not classified (1.7%). The most prevalent serotype was type 1 (60%) followed by serotype 6 (20%), 4 (8.3%), 2 (1.7%) and 10% were no type specific antibodies. The sensitivity of the serotyping and the genotyping assays was 90% with a total concordance of 68.3%. Thirteen samples revealed discrepant results with genotype : 1b (4), 1a (3), 3a (3), 4 (2) and 4c/4d (1). This study indicates that the serotyping assay is less specific than genotyping. However, the test is rapid, relatively easy to perform and represent a reliable alternative in laboratories that lack the specific expertise to typing the HCV by molecular methods.
12683985,1,2003,Environ Pollut,Mineralization of phenanthrene and fluoranthene in yardwaste compost.,The purpose of the study was to evaluate the potential of phenanthrene and fluoranthene biodegradation in yardwaste compost materials. These polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons were chosen for this work because they are relatively readily biodegradable and ubiquitous in the environment. Compost samples were incubated in biometers with 14C-labeled phenanthrene and the evolution of &quot;4CO2 was assessed as a measure of mineralization. The '4CO2 evolution varied widely among replicate biometers, possibly as the result of (1) uneven and patchy colonization of phenanthrene-degrading microorganisms on compost particles, and (2) non-uniform dispersion of the labeled substrate spike into the yardwaste microenvironment. Mineralization of phenanthrene reached about 40%extent of 14CO2 evolution at best before leveling off, but the maximum varied from sample to sample and could be as low as 1%after three months. Active mineralization occurred at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures. Methanol extraction was used to recover &quot;4C from biometer samples that were spiked with &quot;4C-labeled phenanthrene. Extraction for 24-48 h yielded 1-14% recovery of 14C, depending on the length of the preceding incubation. The low extraction yield and relatively low maximum mineralization(&lt;40%) indicated that residual phenanthrene was sorbed and bound within the compost matrix in the biometer. Amendment ofbiometers with 0.05% Tween 80 or addition of water did not consistently enhance the mineralization. Variability in mineralization was greatly reduced in liquid samples taken from pre-enriched compost samples. Mineralization of 14C-labeled fluoranthene was negligible in biometers but could be stimulated by pre-enrichment with salicylate or naphthalene. Pre-enrichment also accelerated the mineralization of phenanthrene.
12658771,1,2003,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Effect of A-L tonic capsule on DNA content in rat experimental hepatocarcinogenesis.,The effects of A-L tonic capsule on DNA content in rat experimental hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethylnitrosamine (DENA) were observed. The experimental rats were divided into 4 groups. With exception of group D in which the rats were only administered with DENA, the rats in the groups A, B, C were previously, simultaneously and subsequently fed with A-L tonic capsule respectively while they were administered with DENA. The DNA content of all rat livers was measured using automatic image analysis technique 20 weeks after administration of DENA. The results showed that the highest and lowest DNA contents were respectively seen in the groups D and A. There was significant difference in DNA contents between the groups A or B or C and D, and also between the groups A and B or C (both P &lt; 0.01). 4 components (4C) and &gt; or = 5C cells were predominant in the group D, while 2C cells were the minority. The number of 2C cells in the groups A, B, C was significantly higher than that in the group D, and the number of &gt; or = 5C cells in the groups A, B, C was markedly lower than that in the group D (P &lt; 0.01). Also, there was very significant difference in the number of 2C and &gt; or = 5C cells between group A and B or C (P &lt; 0.01). It was concluded that A-L tonic capsule could effectively inhibit the increase of DNA content of hepatocytes and improve the distribution of DNA content in rat hepatocarcinogenesis, especially in group A.
12612452,1,2003,Biol Pharm Bull,Antinociceptive effects of N-acyloctahydropyrido[3,2,1-ij][1,6]naphthyridine in mice: structure-activity relation study of matrine-type alkaloids part II.,N-Acyloctahydropyrido[3,2,1-ij][1,6]naphthyridines were synthesized as derivatives of matrine-type alkaloids, and the structure-activity relations were examined by the acetic acid-induced abdominal contraction test. The antinociceptive potencies of N-acyloctahydropyrido[3,2,1-ij][1,6]naphthyridines were significantly lower than those of (+)-matrine. The antinociceptive effects of N-benzyloctahydropyrido[3,2,1-ij][1,6]naphthyridines are approximately 5.6 to 6.5 times less than those of N-benzoyloctahydropyrido[3,2,1-ij][1,6]naphthyridine. These findings suggest that the amide group of matrine-type alkaloids is an essential functional group that influences antinociceptive potency. The antinociceptive effect of 4c was markedly antagonized by pretreatment with Naloxone, and that of 3c partially so.
12590544,1,2003,J Am Chem Soc,Norbornyl cations of group 14 elements.,Norbornyl cations of the group 14 elements Si --&gt; Pb have been synthesized from substituted 3-cyclopentenemethyl precursors by intramolecular addition of transient cations to the C=C double bond of the 3-cyclopentenemethyl substituent (pi-route to norbornyl cations). The norbornyl cations 4a (E = Si, R = Me), 4e (E = Si, R = Et), 4f (E = Si, R = Bu), 4g (E = Ge, R = Bu), 4h (E = Sn, R = Bu), and 4i (E = Pb, R = Et) have been identified by their characteristic NMR chemical shifts (4a,e,f, delta((29)Si) = 80-87, delta((13)C)(CH=) = 149.6-150.6; 4g, delta((13)C)(CH=) = 144.8; 4h, delta((119)Sn) = 334, delta((13)C)(CH=) = 141.5; 4i, delta((207)Pb) = 1049, delta((13)C)(CH=) = 138). The significant deshielding of the vinylic carbon atoms (Deltadelta((13)C)) relative to those of the precursor (Deltadelta((13)C) = 19.3-20.3 (4a,e,f), Deltadelta((13)C) = 14.6 (4g), Deltadelta((13)C) = 11.1 (4h), Deltadelta((13)C) approximately 8 (4i)) and the small J coupling constants between the element and the remote vinyl carbons in the case of 4h and 4i (J(CSn) = 26 Hz, J(CPb) = 16 Hz) give experimental evidence for the intramolecular interaction and the charge transfer between the positively charged element and the remote C=C double bond. The experimental results are supported by quantum mechanical calculations of structures, energies, and magnetic properties for the norbornyl cations 4a,b (E = Ge, R = Me), 4c (E = Sn, R = Me), 4d (E = Pb, R = Me), and 4e,f at the GIAO/B3LYP/6-311G(3d,p)//MP2/6-311G(d,p) (Si, Ge, C, H), SDD (Sn, Pb) level of theory. The calculated (29)Si NMR chemical shifts for the silanorbornyl cations 4a,e,f (delta((29)Si) = 77-93) agree well with experiment, and the calculated structures of the cations 4a-f reveal their bridged norbornyl cation nature and suggest also for the experimentally observed species 4a,e-i a formally 3 + 1 coordination for the element atom with the extra coordination provided by the C=C double bond. This places five carbon atoms in the close vicinity of the positively charged element atom. The group 14 element norbornyl cations 4a,e-i exhibit only negligible interactions with the aromatic solvent, and they are, depending on the nature of the element group, stable at room temperature in aromatic solvents for periods ranging from a few hours to days. In acetonitrile solution, the intramolecular interaction in the norbornyl cations 4a,e-h breaks down and nitrilium ions with the element in a tetrahedral environment are formed. In contrast, reaction of acetonitrile with the plumbyl cation 4i forms an acetonitrile complex, 10i, in which the norbornyl cation structure is preserved. The X-ray structure of 10i reveals a trigonal bipyramidal environment for the lead atom with the C=C double bond of the cyclopentenemethyl ligand and the nitrogen atom of the acetonitrile molecule in apical positions. Density functional calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G(2d,p)//(B3LYP/6-31G(d) (C, H), SDD (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb)) + DeltaZPVE level indicate that the thermodynamic stability of the group 14 norbornyl cations increases from Si to Pb. This results in a relative stabilization for the plumbanorbornyl cation 4d compared to tert-butyl cation of 52.7 kcal mol(-)(1). In contrast, the intramolecular stabilization energy E(A) of the norbornyl cations 4a-d decreases, suggesting reduced interaction between the C=C double bond and the electron-deficient element center in the plumbacation compared to the silacations. This points to a reduced electrophilicity of the plumbacation compared to its predecessors.
12542902,1,2003,J Pharm Pharmacol,Synthesis and radical scavenging of novel magnolol derivatives.,We have investigated the developdment of potential antioxidants based on magnolol, a naturally occurring biphenolic obtained from the bark of Magnolia officinalis. A series of aminomethylated derivatives of magnolol were synthesized under the aromatic Mannich reaction. In-vitro testing for diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging and chemiluminescence assays in whole cell models revealed that the pyrrolidyl-containing magnolols (2b (5,5'-diallyl-3-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)-biphenyl-2,2'-diol), 3a (5,5'-diallyl-3,3'-bis-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)-biphenyl-2,2'-diol) and 4c (5,5'-diallyl-3-(morphorin-4-ylmethyl)-3'-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)-biphenyl-2,2'-diol)) displayed promising free radical scavenging effects as compared with magnolol. The results from compound 4c indicated that the naturally occurring component was suitable to be a lead compound toward promising antioxidants.
12519058,1,2003,J Med Chem,Potential tumor-selective nitroimidazolylmethyluracil prodrug derivatives: inhibitors of the angiogenic enzyme thymidine phosphorylase.,Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) is an angiogenic growth factor and a target for anticancer drug design. Molecular modeling suggested that 2'-aminoimidazolylmethyluracils would be potent inhibitors of TP. The novel 5-halo-2-aminoimidazolylmethyluracils (4b/4c) were very potent inhibitors of E. coli TP (IC50 approximately 20 nM). Contrastingly, the corresponding 2'-nitroimidazolylmethyluracil (as bioreductively activated) prodrugs (3b/3c) were 1000-fold less active (IC50 22-24 microM). This approach may be used to selectively deliver TP inhibitors into hypoxic regions of solid tumors where TP is overexpressed.
14696252,0,2003,Tsitologiia,[Evolutionary regularities of the somatic polyploidy manifestation in salivary glands of gastropod molluscs. IV. A subclass of Pectinibranchia: Orders Hamiglossa and Toxoglossa (Neogastropoda)].,Salivary glands of 12 species of carnivorous gastropod molluscs, making the Neogastropoda group have been investigated by histochemical methods and DNA cytophotometry. We studied the anatomical and histological structure of ordinary (acinous) and accessory (tubular) salivary glands, and of unpaired glands (Leiblen's, &quot;framboisée&quot;, and poisonous). Cells of three types were distinguished: granular cells (with glycoproteid granular inclusions), mucocytes-I (with sulfatic acid mucopolysaccharides), and epithelial ciliated cells. In ordinary and accessory glands of the studied Neogastropods, polyploid cells with polyploidy levels from 4c to 16c were revealed together with diploid cells. The functional significance and phylogenetic tendencies of polyploidy manifestation in salivary glands of prosobranch gastropods are discussed.
14671335,0,2003,Acta Crystallogr C,Partial Sn-atom ordering in Sm3Ga0.80-2.48Sn4.20-2.52.,Trisamarium digallide tristannide crystallizes with a partially ordered Pu(3)Pd(5)-type structure in space group Cmcm. In a single crystal of Sm(3)Ga(1.89(4))Sn(3.11(4)), the 8g position is mostly occupied by Sn atoms (93% Sn and 7% Ga), while the 4c and 8f positions are occupied by a Ga/Sn statistical mixture. The evolution of the structure as a function of the Ga content has been studied by X-ray powder diffraction on ten Sm(3)Ga(5-x)Sn(x) samples. It is shown that the 8g position remains occupied essentially exclusively by Sn atoms within the whole homogeneity range, with x ranging from 2.52 to 4.20.
14664331,0,2003,Pharmazie,[Isomeric phenanthridines from 1,2-dihydro-5-methyl-2'-nitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,6-dicarboxylic acid esters].,Hydrolysis of the dienamine function of the dihydrobiphenyls 3 leads to a mixture of the tautomers 4A-C (NMR). The structures of the starting material 3a and the products 4cA and 4bC are confirmed by X-ray crystal analysis. The biphenyls 5 are formed by dehydrogenation of 3 with iodine, whereas 4b produced the additional iodinated compound 6. 4b reacts with manganese dioxide to yield the phenol 7a. Irradiation of the dihydrobiphenyls 3 with UV-A light gives the nitrosobiphenyls 8. In contrast, the nitrobiphenyl 7b and the lactam 10a are formed as photo products from 4c. The reduction of the nitro group of 5 with Fe/AcOH leads to the isomeric phenanthridines 10 and 11 by cyclization, whereas after reaction with Zn/NH4Cl the cyclic hydroxamic acids 12 and 13 are isolated. Compound 7a reacts with Zn/acetate buffer to yield only the hydroxamic acid 12. Ring closure takes place on treating the nitrosobiphenyls 8 with conc. hydrochloric acid, to yield the chloro-substituted hydroxamic acids 14. The half wave potentials of the dihydrobiphenyls 3 and 4 are measured by anodic oxidation using a rotating platinum electrode by means of differential pulse voltammetry. The dienamines 3 are more sensitive towards oxidation than the reference drug nifedipine; in contrast, the carba-analogues 4 are much more stable. The cyclic hydroxamic acids 13 and 14a are tested for their ability to inhibit 5-, 12- and 15-lipoxygenase. Compound 13 represents a weak inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase in human whole blood.
14632918,0,2003,J Periodontal Res,Direct evidence of collagenolysis in chronic periodontitis.,BACKGROUND: There is no previous evidence that collagenases in chronic periodontitis excessively cleave collagen fibrils.OBJECTIVES: In this study the eventual presence of neoepitopes produced in such a cleavage were looked for.METHODS: A polyclonal antibody, which recognizes collagenase-cleaved collagen type I 3/4 carboxy-terminal neoepitope (COL1-3/4C), was used in avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex staining.RESULTS: In addition, moderate staining was seen in connective tissue bordering to the sulcular and junctional epithelium, surrounding some of the fibroblasts and in some areas infiltrated by inflammatory mononuclear cells. COL1-3/4C staining in chronic periodontitis was more extensive (6.3 +/- 1.2%, n = 10) and intense than that observed in controls (1.6 +/- 0.7%, n = 10, Unpaired Student's t-test, p &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that collagenases produced by host cells contribute to periodontal tissue destruction and attachment loss.
14564060,0,2003,J Appl Genet,Karyological characterization of sugar beet gynogenetic lines cultured in vitro.,Flow cytometry was used to screen ploidy levels in 47 cultured in vitro sugar beet gynogenetic lines of various origin and age, obtained after plant regeneration from unfertilized ovules. When donor plants were diploid, the majority of regenerants were found to have cells with 1C, 2C and 4C relative DNA content (mainly haploid and diploid) and there were large differences in the rate of spontaneous in vitro chromosome doubling between individual homozygous lines. Six ovule-derived lines regenerated from fertile and sterile diploid donors of forty-five lines were solid diploids from the very early stages of their in vitro cultivation, and thus could not be classified as doubled haploids. In the case of tetraploid donor plants, the gynogenetic regenerants demonstrated 2x-ploidy level. The results obtained in chimeric plants with both haploid and diploid cells indicated the possibility to overcome mixoploidy by their re-cultivation through generative shoot tip culture. The flow cytometry method confirmed data obtained by conventional microscopic chromosome counting in dividing leaf cells and was found very useful for screening of a large number of regenerants and for characterizing the process of in vitro gynogenetic lines formation in sugar beet.

The acyl group in acyl trypsin has been shown to isomerize from trans-form (4t-trypsin) to cis-form (4c-trypsin)/from cis-form to trans-form by irradiation of UV-vis light. The deacylation rate of the cis-form (4c-trypsin) has been shown to be 18.6 times faster than that of the trans-form (4t-trypsin).
14532659,0,2003,Acta Crystallogr C,Three yttrium crotonate complexes with diimines.,The synthesis and crystal structures of three new yttrium crotonate (crot) compounds, associated with three different nitrogenous bases, namely 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 4-methyl-1,10-phenanthroline (mphen) and 2,2'-bipyridylamine (bpa), are presented. All three compounds organize as centrosymmetric dimers, to give tetra-micro-crotonato-bis[crotonato(1,10-phenanthroline)yttrium(III)] dihydrate, [Y(2)(C(4)H(5)O(2))(6)(C(12)H(8)N(2))(2)].2H(2)O or [Y(crot)(3)(phen)](2).2H(2)O, (I), tetra-micro-crotonato-bis[crotonato(4-methyl-1,10-phenanthroline)yttrium(III)] dihydrate, [Y(2)(C(4)H(5)O(2))(6)(C(13)H(10)N(2))(2)].2H(2)O or [Y(crot)(3)(mphen)](2).2H(2)O, (II), and tetra-micro-crotonato-bis[diaqua(crotonato)yttrium(III)] 2,2'-bipyridylamine tetrasolvate, [Y(2)(C(4)H(5)O(2))(6)(H(2)O)(4)].4C(10)H(9)N(3) or [Y(crot)(3)(aq)(2)](2).4(bpa), (III).

14519099,0,2003,J Mol Endocrinol,Absence of somatic mutations in natriuretic peptide receptor type A gene in human aldosterone-secreting adenomas.,Somatic mutations of genes codifying for key regulatory proteins are the cause of different types of hormone-secreting adenomas. Natriuretic peptides (NP) are the strongest inhibitors of aldosterone secretion but aldosterone-secreting adenomas (aldosteronomas) are resistant to this inhibition and have reduced binding sites for NPs. The objective of this study was to sequence the entire coding region of the NP receptor type A (NPRA, codified by the Npr1 gene) to find loss-of-function somatic mutations. Total RNA was extracted from eight aldosteronomas and cDNA was synthesized. NPRA mRNA expression was evaluated by Northern blot analysis and compared with beta-actin mRNA as the housekeeping gene. Twelve primer couples were designed on the basis of the Npr1 gene organization to amplify, by PCR, all 22 coding exons of the gene. The two strands of amplified DNAs were purified and directly sequenced by automated capillary sequencer. NPRA mRNA expression did not differ among aldosteronomas. Npr1 open reading frame sequences obtained from eight aldosteronomas did not contain any mutation. The coding sequences of all 22 exons were identical in all samples and identical to published sequences. In the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) a new length difference 3C/4C polymorphism was found at position 15 129 (three adenomas were 3C/4C and two were 3C/3C). Such a 3C/4C polymorphism was present in genomic DNA from 80 control subjects (25, 4C/4C; 40, 3C/4C; 15, 3C/3C). Mutations in the coding exons of the Npr1 gene do not appear to be a common cause of aldosteronomas. Moreover, the exons of Npr1 encoding for the translated portion of mRNA do not appear to be prone to polymorphisms. The polymorphism identified in the 3'-UTR might affect mRNA stability resulting in lower receptor synthesis, but it is not likely to confer a predisposition to the development of aldosteronomas.
14505880,0,2003,Carbohydr Res,Crystal structures of O-acetylated 2-acylamino-2-deoxy-D-galactose derivatives.,The X-ray structures of 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranoside derivatives with four different 2-(acylamino) substituents have been determined with Mo K(alpha) radiation at 123 K. The structure of the 2-acetylamino derivative and of its acyl-homologs with a 2-(propanoylamino)-, 2-(butanoylamino)-, and 2-(2-methyl-propanoylamino)-group crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2. The pyranose unit of all compounds has the usual 4C(1) shape. The different orientations of the 6-O-acetyl-groups are discussed. Conformations of the acylamino-group are compared to those found in the crystal structure of N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine.
12909777,0,2003,Acta Crystallogr C,1,4,8,11-Tetraazoniacyclotetradecane tetrakis(phenylphosphonate) dihydrate forms hydrogen-bonded sheets.,In the title compound, C(10)H(28)N(4)(4+).4C(6)H(6)O(3)P(-).2H(2)O, the cation lies across a centre of inversion in space group P2(1)/n. The two independent anions and the water molecule are linked by four O-H.O hydrogen bonds [H.O = 1.74-2.15 (3) A, O.O = 2.5482 (14)-3.0438 (16) A and O-H.O = 160-176 (2) degrees ] into sheets containing equal numbers of centrosymmetric R(6)(6)(16) and R(10)(10)(36) rings. The cation lies at the centre of the R(10)(10)(36) ring and is linked to it by eight N-H.O hydrogen bonds [H.O = 1.77-1.98 A, N.O = 2.6756 (15)-2.8168 (16) A and N-H.O = 151-169 degrees ].
12908755,0,2003,Clin Neuropathol,Recurrent and atypical meningiomas--a multiparametric study using Ki67 labelling index, AgNOR and DNA Feulgen staining.,OBJECTIVE: Histological analysis has limited value to predict the biological behavior of meningiomas. In this study, we investigated the utility of indicators of cell proliferation in the evaluation of histologically benign meningiomas.MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, 50 meningothelial meningiomas, 50 atypical meningiomas and 8 primary benign meningiomas with their recurrences were studied. For each case the Ki67 labeling index (LI), DNA ploidy and AgNOR were evaluated and the results quantitatively processed and assessed by computerized image analyzer.RESULTS: The Ki67 labelling showed a low index (11.3%) in typical meningiomas and primary meningiomas (13.6%). In contrast, it was higher in atypical (26.6%) and recurrent meningiomas (28%). Similar results were obtained for the AgNOR granule count which showed that typical and primary meningiomas had mean 1.51 - 1.49, whereas recurring meningiomas and atypical meningiomas had mean values of 1.92 and 1.98, respectively. DNA ploidy revealed in the hyperpolyploid region between 4c - 16c: 7.02% of the nuclei in primary meningiomas, 17.98% of the nuclei in recurring meningiomas and 24.63% of the nuclei in atypical meningiomas.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that evaluation of cell proliferation using Ki67 LI, DNA ploidy and AgNOr, integrated with standard histopathology, can provide better information for a correct grading of meningiomas.
12904071,0,2003,J Med Chem,Highly potent 1,4-benzothiazine derivatives as K(ATP)-channel openers.,A series of 1,4-benzothiazines, suitably functionalized at the N-4 and C-6 positions, arising from the replacement of a benzopyran-based structure of cromakalim with a 1,4-benzothiazine nucleus, has been synthesized as potassium channel openers (KCOs). Most of the tested compounds show high vasorelaxant potency that is considerably higher than that of the reference levcromakalim (LCRK). In the presence of the well-established selective K(ATP) blocker, glibenclamide, the vasorelaxing effects were antagonized in a competitive fashion, indicating the involvement of the K(ATP) channel in their pharmacological effect. Some aspects of the structure-activity relationship associated with the N-4 and C-6 substituents are discussed. The highest level of activity was achieved with a cyclopentenone ring at the N-4 position coupled with an electron-withdrawing group such as nitro, trifluoromethyl, or cyano at the C-6 position. Compounds 4c, 5c, and 6c displayed a vasorelaxant potency at least 10 000 times greater than that of LCRK, thus becoming the most potent KCOs identified to date.
12904070,0,2003,J Med Chem,Synthesis and biological evaluation of 3-alkoxy analogues of flavone-8-acetic acid.,New analogues of flavone-8-acetic acid were synthesized, bearing an alkoxy group in position 3 and different substituents on the benzene ring in position 2 of the flavone nucleus. The compounds were tested for direct cytotoxicity against four human tumor cell lines and for indirect antitumor effects by measuring their ability to enhance lytic properties of murine macrophages and human monocytes. Though direct toxicity was very low, the compounds were able to induce significant indirect toxicity. Notably, most of them (4c, 4d, 4e, 4f, 4h, 4i, 4m,4n, and 4o) showed important activity on human monocytes and could be regarded as the first flavone derivatives endowed with such activity. Particularly interesting seem to be compounds 4m and 4n, which showed IC(50) values up to 7 times higher than DMXAA, which has now completed phase I clinical trials.
12823028,0,2003,J Am Chem Soc,Synthesis and reactivity of silyl ruthenium complexes: the importance of trans effects in C-H activation, Si-C bond formation, and dehydrogenative coupling of silanes.,A series of octahedral ruthenium silyl hydride complexes, cis-(PMe(3))(4)Ru(SiR(3))H (SiR(3) = SiMe(3), 1a; SiMe(2)CH(2)SiMe(3), 1b; SiEt(3), 1c; SiMe(2)H, 1d), has been synthesized by the reaction of hydrosilanes with (PMe(3))(3)Ru(eta(2)-CH(2)PMe(2))H (5), cis-(PMe(3))(4)RuMe(2) (6), or (PMe(3))(4)RuH(2) (9). Reaction with 6 proceeds via an intermediate product, cis-(PMe(3))(4)Ru(SiR(3))Me (SiR(3) = SiMe(3), 7a; SiMe(2)CH(2)SiMe(3), 7b). Alternatively, 1 and 7 have been synthesized via a fast hydrosilane exchange with another cis-(PMe(3))(4)Ru(SiR(3))H or cis-(PMe(3))(4)Ru(SiR(3))Me, which occurs at a rate approaching the NMR time scale. Compounds 1a, 1b, 1d, and 7a adopt octahedral geometries in solution and the solid state with mutually cis silyl and hydride (or silyl and methyl) ligands. The longest Ru-P distance within a complex is always trans to Si, reflecting the strong trans influence of silicon. The aptitude of phosphine dissociation in these complexes has been probed in reactions of 1a, 1c, and 7a with PMe(3)-d(9) and CO. The dissociation is regioselective in the position trans to a silyl ligand (trans effect of Si), and the rate approaches the NMR time scale. A slower secondary process introduces PMe(3)-d(9) and CO in the other octahedral positions, most likely via nondissociative isomerization. The trans effect and trans influence in 7a are so strong that an equilibrium concentration of dissociated phosphine is detectable (approximately 5%) in solution of pure 7a. Compounds 1a-c also react with dihydrogen via regioselective dissociation of phosphine from the site trans to Si, but the final product, fac-(PMe(3))(3)Ru(SiR(3))H(3) (SiR(3) = SiMe(3), 4a; SiMe(2)CH(2)SiMe(3), 4b; SiEt(3), 4c), features hydrides cis to Si. Alternatively, 4a-c have been synthesized by photolysis of (PMe(3))(4)RuH(2) in the presence of a hydrosilane or by exchange of fac-(PMe(3))(3)Ru(SiR(3))H(3) with another HSiR(3). The reverse manifold - HH elimination from 4a and trapping with PMe(3) or PMe(3)-d(9) - is also regioselective (1a-d(9)() is predominantly produced with PMe(3)-d(9) trans to Si), but is very unfavorable. At 70 degrees C, a slower but irreversible SiH elimination also occurs and furnishes (PMe(3))(4)RuH(2). The structure of 4a exhibits a tetrahedral P(3)Si environment around the metal with the three hydrides adjacent to silicon and capping the P(2)Si faces. Although strong Si...HRu interactions are not indicated in the structure or by IR, the HSi distances (2.13-2.23(5) A) suggest some degree of nonclassical SiH bonding in the H(3)SiR(3) fragment. Thermolysis of 1a in C(6)D(6) at 45-55 degrees C leads to an intermolecular CD activation of C(6)D(6). Extensive H/D exchange into the hydride, SiMe(3), and PMe(3) ligands is observed, followed by much slower formation of cis-(PMe(3))(4)Ru(D)(Ph-d(5)). In an even slower intramolecular CH activation process, (PMe(3))(3)Ru(eta(2)-CH(2)PMe(2))H (5) is also produced. The structure of intermediates, mechanisms, and aptitudes for PMe(3) dissociation and addition/elimination of H-H, Si-H, C-Si, and C-H bonds in these systems are discussed with a special emphasis on the trans effect and trans influence of silicon and ramifications for SiC coupling catalysis.
12785729,0,2003,Arch Pharm Res,Synthesis and PGE2 inhibitory activity of 5,7-dihydroxyflavones and their O-methylated flavone analogs.,5,7-Dihydroxyflavones and their O-methylated flavone analogs were prepared and evaluated their anti-inflammatory activity to decipher the structure-activity relationships. Most of the analogs were achieved from 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone in 4 steps. 5,7-Dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone (4c) and 7-hydroxy-4',5-dimethoxyflavone (6c) were prepared following a different synthetic pathway. Among the synthetic flavones tested, 5-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavone analogs (3a-3e) showed moderate inhibitory activities of PGE2 production from LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells.
12743392,0,2003,Acta Crystallogr C,Polymeric tris(mu2)-acetone-kappa2O:O)sodium polyiodide at 120 K.,In the title compound, [Na(C(3)H(6)O)(3)](n)(I(2))(n), all non-H atoms are in special positions of the space group P6(3)/mcm, with the Na atom in 2b, the I atom in 4c, the carbonyl O atom and the C atom attached to it both in 6g, and the methyl C atom in 12k. The H atoms of the rotationally disordered methyl groups are in 24l general positions but with occupancies of 0.5, because they occur in two sets related by a crystallographic mirror plane. Infinite chains are created by face-sharing octahedral Na-coordination polyhedra, with Na-O and Na...Na distances of 2.439 (5) and 3.2237 (4) A, respectively. I atoms form infinite linear chains, in which the I-atom separation is 3.2237 (4) A.
12738182,0,2003,Food Chem Toxicol,Fate of 14C-chlorpyrifos in stored soybeans and its toxicological potential to mice.,Grains of soybeans were treated with [ethyl-1-4C]chlorpyrifos at a dose of 15 ppm and its triplet. During the 30-week storage period, the penetration and distribution of insecticide residues were studied. The amount of surface residues on stored soybeans, internal extractables and bound residues were determined. Surface residues were found to decrease with the increase in time of storage, whereas internal residues showed a gradual increase with time to reach 40-52% of applied dose after 30 weeks. Non-extractable residues showed a relatively slow but definite increase with time. The degradation products include, in addition to the parent insecticide which constitutes 50% of the total residues, the oxygen-analogue of chlorpyrifos, desethyl chlorpyrifos and 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol. Feeding mice for 90 days with a diet mixed with total internal chlorpyrifos residues in stored soybeans led to considerably inhibited plasma and red blood cells-cholinesterase activity by 78 and 46%, respectively, during the experimental period. Blood picture, liver and kidney function of treated mice were significantly affected during the feeding period.
12737581,0,2003,J Org Chem,Intramolecular [2 + 2] photocycloaddition of alkenes incorporated in a carbohydrate template. Synthesis of enantiopure bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes and -[6.3.0]undecanes.,Intramolecular [2 + 2] photocycloaddition of alkenes with a furano sugar placed between them have been investigated under both copper(I)-catalyzed and sensitized conditions. The copper(I)-catalyzed photocycloaddition of the dienes 4a, 4b, and 4c led to unexpected formation of the thermodynamically less stable cis-syn-cis 4-5-5 tricyclic adducts 5a, 5b, and 5c, respectively. The sensitized photocycloaddition of the diene 14 also gave the cis-syn-cis adduct 15 showing that the copper(I) catalyst does not have any influence on the stereochemical course through coordination with the anomeric ring oxygen of the furano sugar. The identical stereochemical course observed under both catalyzed and sensitized photoaddition reactions have been attributed to be of steric origin. Bis(dienes) 25a and 25b, which gave an intractable mixture on copper(I)-catalyzed irradiation, underwent smooth photocycloaddition in the presence of benzophenone, and the resulting 1,2-divinyl cyclobutanes underwent spontaneous [3.3]-rearrangement at room temperature to produce bicyclo[6.3.0]undecanes 30a and 30b, respectively. This investigation provides an approach for the construction of enantiopure bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes and -[6.3.0]undecanes.

Especially one of p-Cl substituted analogues (4c) completely inhibited HUVEC tube formation at 10 microM.

12716172,0,2003,Inorg Chem,Structural measure of metal-ligand covalency from the bonding in carboxylate ligands.,The data set of over 40 000 crystal structures containing the carboxylate group that has been reported to the CSD has been used to extract structural changes to the carboxylate group upon binding to different elemental centers. We find quantifiable structural changes to the carboxylate group depending on the elemental center it is interacting with. The trends follow those traditionally associated with covalency; elements exhibiting electronegativity closest to that of oxygen exhibit the largest structural change. In addition, we find the measure is extendable to transition metal systems where we observe the trends of Pauling neutrality not only are maintained but also are quantifiable; i.e., the structural change increases with oxidation state, i.e., II &lt; III &lt; IV, and decreases with an increase in coordination number, 4c &gt; 5c &gt; 6c. Further, the measure gives us a quantifiable measure of the difference between the covalencies of the long and short bonds of Cu(II) complexes. From the bond lengths of the bound carboxylate arm, we are able to derive bond orders and hence calculate the covalent character in the adjoining metal-carboxylate bonds. As such, we have a structurally derived quantification of metal-ligand covalency.

12694883,0,2003,Eur J Pharm Sci,Reversible and irreversible inhibitory activity of succinic and maleic acid derivatives on acetylcholinesterase.,Aryl succinic and maleic acid derivatives are potent inhibitors of bovine acetylcholinesterase in vitro. Succinic acid aminophenol derivatives 1b-e and 2b-d act as reversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, while maleic acid aminophenol derivatives 3b-d and 4c-e act as choline subsite-directed irreversible inhibitors, detected by dialysis in the presence of edrophonium. Linear relationships between the logarithm of the velocity of hydrolysis of acetylcholine plotted against the time of incubation at several different inhibitor concentrations were determined. The K(i) for reversible competitive inhibitors was determined. For irreversible inhibitors the K(i) for the dissociation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor complex at the beginning of the recognition process was also determined as well as the inactivation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor adduct formation k(+2) and the bimolecular inhibition constant k(i) for the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by aminophenol derivatives 3b-d and 4c-e. The conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows for both families: (a) the aromatic moiety played a critical role in the recognition of the active site; (b) in case of the reversible inhibitor, when the ester function took the place of the hydroxyl fragment, there was an important increase in the affinity; and (c) the distance between phenolic hydroxyl and nitrogen was critical because the inhibition is ortho&lt;meta&lt;para.
12683237,0,2003,Tsitologiia,[Effect of etoposide and amsacrine on mitotic progression of GM-130 and Hep-2 cell lines. The flow cytometry assay].,It has been shown that inhibitors of topoisomerase II (topo II) etoposide and amsacrine results in accumulation of GM-130 and Hep-2 cells with 4c DNA amount. The differential analysis based on flow cytometry (Zenin et al., 2001) and enabled us to discriminate cells with 4c DNA--G2, M, including metaphase and anaphase cells and cells in pseudo-G1. 1 microM etoposide evoked cell accumulation in G2 phase, while 40 microM etoposide blocked cell proliferation, which was confirmed by a complete absence of both mitotic cells and 4c DNA cell accumulation. GM-130 and Hep-2 cells that were first blocked and then washed from nocodazole, and after that treated with 50 microM etoposide or 20 microM amsacrine, were shown to enter pseudo-G1 with 4c DNA amount per cell. In the presence of nocodazole, 4 and 40 microM amsacrine evoked transition of all mitotic cells to pseudo-G1 within 1 h. 15 or 30 minutes pulse treatments of GM-130 cells with 40 microM amsacrine in the presence of nocodazole, followed by incubation in drug-free medium, resulted in the similar transition of cells to pseudo-G1.
12674238,0,2003,Med Phys,A method for fast evaluation of neutron spectra for BNCT based on in-phantom figure-of-merit calculation.,In this paper a fast method to evaluate neutron spectra for brain BNCT is developed. The method is based on an algorithm to calculate dose distribution in the brain, for which a data matrix has been taken into account, containing weighted biological doses per position per incident energy and the incident neutron spectrum to be evaluated. To build the matrix, using the MCNP 4C code, nearly monoenergetic neutrons were transported into a head model. The doses were scored and an energy-dependent function to biologically weight the doses was used. To find the beam quality, dose distribution along the beam centerline was calculated. A neutron importance function for this therapy to bilaterally treat deep-seated tumors was constructed in terms of neutron energy. Neutrons in the energy range of a few tens of kilo-electron-volts were found to produce the best dose gain, defined as dose to tumor divided by maximum dose to healthy tissue. Various neutron spectra were evaluated through this method. An accelerator-based neutron source was found to be more reliable for this therapy in terms of therapeutic gain than reactors.

Oxidation of 3a-f individually using MnO(2) in CH(2)Cl(2) or sodium hypochlorite in THF/H(2)O furnished 1,2,4-oxadiazoles 4a-f in good to excellent yields. Compounds 4a-f were also evaluated against inflammation. Except 4e, all of them reduced inflammation, however, 4c presented better antiinflammatory activity. A preliminary antimicrobial activity tests of 3a-f showed that these compounds possess activity against some microorganisms. In fact, 3c and 3f have been found to be more effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Candida albicans.
12651450,0,2003,Tree Physiol,Application of volume growth and survival graphs in the evaluation of four process-based forest growth models.,Volume growth and survival (VGS) graphs, which show volume growth rate and risk of mortality for individual trees (or tree size classes), have been proposed as a tool for assessing the validity of models that describe the development over time of tree size distributions within forest stands. We examined the utility of the VGS method in evaluating four process-based models. The performance of the models FORSKA, 4C, MORG, and PipeQual is analyzed against long-term data from a Scots pine stand in Evo, Finland, and the models FORSKA and 4C are also assessed with respect to data from a beech stand in Fabrikschleichach, Germany. Comparison of the measurement-based VGS graphs with those produced from the model-based data shows that although the models yield similar stand-level predictions, they can differ widely in their projections of individual tree growth and size distributions. Examination of the discrepancies between models and data in the context of the VGS graphs reveals several areas in which the models could be improved. We conclude that the method is useful in model evaluation, especially if used in combination with indicators of stand structure, such as the height/diameter ratio.

All the synthetic compounds (4a-j) were tested for their anti-tumor activity against eight kinds of tumor cells.RESULTS: Compounds (4a-j) are new compounds, among them, compounds 4c, 4d and 4e showed anti-tumor activity against HL-60. The inhibition of compounds 4c, 4d and 4e against HL-60 are 44%, 90% and 70% respectively, at the concentration of 10 mumol.L-1. However, the inhibition of the other kinds of anti-tumor cells are not distinctive.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that this may be one of the effective routes to improve the anti-tumor activity and reduce the toxicity of 1,4-bis(3-bromopropionyl)piperazine.
12566852,0,2003,Pharmacology,Mechanism of the protective effect of heteropolyoxotungstate against herpes simplex virus type 2.,The effects of heteropolyoxotungstate (K(7)[PTi(2)W(10)O(40)]. 6H(2)O; PM-19) on the replication of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) were examined using a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction of intracellular viral DNA established by us and also other methods. Vero cells were infected with HSV-2 strains: either the standard strain 169, or the acyclovir-resistant strain YS-4C-1. PM-19 was added at various stages during the replication of HSV-2. PM-19 strongly inhibited the synthesis of viral genomic DNA when it was added at the time of infection. The addition of PM-19 60-90 min after viral inoculation time-dependently decreased the antiviral activity and increased the relative yield of viral DNA, and the addition of PM-19 was completely ineffective at times later than 90 min. These results suggested that PM-19 inhibited viral penetration but did not affect the synthesis of viral DNA. Furthermore, PM-19 strongly inhibited a second round of infection.
12561727,0,2003,Tsitologiia,[Flow cytometric analysis of ICRF-193 influence on cell passage through mitosis].,Studying the effect of topoisomerase II (topo II) inhibitors on cell passage through mitosis seems to be important for understanding the role of this enzyme during chromosome condensation and segregation. A flow cytometric assay (Zenin et al., 2001) allowed to determine the mitotic index, and to discriminate between not only cells in G2 and M phases (including metaphase and anaphase cells), but also cells in pseudo-G1 with 4c DNA content. It is shown that topo II catalytic inhibitor ICRF-193 blocks G2-M transition in a lymphoblastoid cell line GM-130. Addition of caffeine to cells abrogated a block of their entering mitosis but not the inhibitor action. Cells entered mitosis, which was proven by the presence of chromosomes in the examined specimen, and, bypassing anaphase, appeared in pseudo-G1 with 4c DNA content. We have found that in the presence of ICRF-193 cells, GM-130 and Hep-2 lines, previously blocked by nocodazole when in mitosis and then washed, pass through metaphase, enter anaphase and leave it to pass to pseudo-G1 with the 4c DNA content. Thus, by inhibiting topo II activity ICRF-193 causes abnormal mitotic transition.
12561725,0,2003,Tsitologiia,[Morphofunctional changes in hepatocytes during the early postnatal development of rats experimentally infected with the intestinal protozoan pathogen, Cryptosporidium parvum (Coccidia, Sporozoa)].,Morphofunctional changes in hepatocytes of 10-14-day old rats were followed in norm and after experimental infection with different doses of oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum. The liver index (ratio between the liver and body masses) varied with the intensity of invasion on the background of slowing down up to the total cessation of animal growth rates, and all this obviously pointed to severe pathology. In the infected rats, some cytological indices were shifted compared to the norm: protein amount and the average number of genomes per hepatocyte were seen to increase, the normal ratio between cells with different ploidy levels being violated. The particular correlation analysis was employed to distinguish between the ontogenetic (animal growth related) and pathologic (related to the infection intensity) polyploidization and hypertrophy in hepatocytes. In 10-14-day old rats, the former is affected primarily by the increase in the share of multinuclear hepatocytes, whereas the latter is accomplished by the increase in the number of cells with polyploid nuclei (4c and 4c x 2 cells). In the heavily infected rats, the ontogenetic polyploidy was almost totally suppressed due, presumably, to their growth rate inhibition, the rise in hepatocyte ploidy resulting form the obvious pathological changes in the liver. In the infected rats, the ontogenetic hypertrophy of hepatic parenchymatous cells was not manifested, and the observed protein accumulation in hepatocytes also resulted from the pathological changes in the liver. It is obvious that changes in cell hypertrophy (protein content) may serve as a more susceptible tool that readily perceives the host's stress experienced due to the parasitic infection (cryptosporidiosis), than cell ploidy: the levels of the respective responses of these two parameters differing by 4 times. However, due to the known reversible nature of hypertrophy, it cannot be used for the aims of a long-term prediction about the future mode of liver functioning in the animal that survived cryptosporidiosis. Unlike, such a parameter as frequencies of hepatocytes with different ploidy levels is much more useful in this respect.
12558385,0,2003,J Org Chem,Shape-persistent nanosize organometallic complexes: synthesis and application in a nanofiltration membrane reactor.,Shape-persistent multi(NCN-palladium and/or -platinum) complexes having one- (5 and 6), two- (1 and 2), and three-dimensional (3 and 4) geometries were prepared in moderate to good yields. Two different approaches were used to construct the multimetallic materials: (i) the construction of the multisite ligands followed by the permetalation step and (ii) selective and mild one-pot coupling of monometallic buiding blocks to a multifunctional shape-persistent organic core molecule. The first approach was used to prepare the palladated and/or platinated tris- (2) and bis(NCN-pincer) (5) complexes, while the second approach afforded the palladated and platinated octakis- (3) and dodecakis(NCN-pincer) (4) complexes. Complexes 1-6 were subjected to nanofiltration (NF) experiments in order to investigate the influence of rigidity and geometry on the retention of these molecules by NF membranes. For this purpose, the corresponding (NCN-Pt-X)(n)() complexes (1c-4c, 5, and 6) were used since exposing these complexes to sulfur dioxide in solution resulted in the formation of bright orange complexes, allowing the use of UV/vis spectroscopy to accurately determine the concentrations of 1-6 in both retentate and permeate. Using the MPF-60 (MWCO = 400) NF-membrane, retention rates of 82.4 (6), 93.9 (1c), 98.7 (2c), 99.5 (3c), 99.6 (5), and &gt;99.9% (4c) were found, while 2c and 4c in combination with the MPF-50 (MWCO = 700) NF-membrane were retained in 97.6 and 99.9%, respectively. A clear relationship is observed between the dimensions calculated by molecular modeling and the retention rates of 1-6. The one-dimensional bis(pincer-platinum) complex 5, however, shows an unexpectedly high retention rate (99.6%) that can be due to precipitation of the complex in the membrane (clogging of the membrane) and/or to the formation of larger aggregates near the membrane. In addition, comparison of 2 and 4 with flexible nickelated G0- and G1-dendrimers with similar dimensions proved that a high degree of rigidity in the backbone of macromolecular complexes indeed leads to more efficient retentions of these multimetallic materials by NF-membranes.
12526556,0,2003,Inorg Chem,Eight- and 16-membered cyanuric-sulfanuric ring systems: C2N4S2--&gt;C2N3S ring contraction.,Eight- and 16-membered cyanuric-sulfanuric ring systems of the type Ar2C2N4S2(O)2Ar'2 (3a, Ar = 4-BrC6H4, Ar' = Ph; 3b, Ar = 4-CF3C6H4, Ar' = Ph; 3c, Ar = 4-CF3C6H4, Ar' = 4-CH3C6H4) and Ar4C4N8S4(O)4Ar'4 (4b, Ar = 4-CF3C6H4, Ar' = Ph; 4c, Ar = 4-CH3C6H4, Ar' = Ph; 4d, Ar = 4-CF3C6H4, Ar' = 4-CH3C6H4), respectively, were prepared in good yields by the reaction of the corresponding sulfur(IV) systems with m-chloroperbenzoic acid. The X-ray structures of 3b, 3c.C7H14, 4b.CH2Cl2, 4c, and the S(IV) system Ar4C4N8S4Ar'4 (2c, Ar = 4-CH3C6H4, Ar' = Ph) were determined. Upon oxidation the two oxygen atoms in 3b and 3c.C7H14 adopt endo positions leading to a twist boat conformation for the C2N4S2 ring. The 16-membered C4N8S4 rings in 4b and 4c retain a cradle conformation upon oxidation. The S-N bond distances are ca. 0.06 A shorter in all the S(VI) systems compared to those in the corresponding S(IV) rings. The thermolysis of 3b at ca. 220 degrees C occurs primarily via loss of a sulfanuric group, NS(O)Ph, to give the six-membered ring (4-CF3C6H4)2C2N3S(O)Ph (6). The structure of 6 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography.

12515522,0,2003,J Am Chem Soc,Energy transfer on the MgO surface, monitored by UV-induced H2 chemisorption.,Surface anions on edges (4-coordinated = 4C) and on corners (3-coordinated = 3C) of cubic MgO nanoparticles exhibit UV resonance absorptions around 5.5 and 4.6 eV, respectively. After monochromatic excitation of either site the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum exhibits exclusively signal components related to 3-coordinated O- radicals (O-(3C), electron hole centers), which are perfectly bleached by H(2) addition. The disappearance of the O-(3C) EPR signal components is paralleled by a depletion of the UV resonance absorption of the 3-coordinated O(2-) only and the appearance of one single band in the OH stretching region of the IR spectrum. Obviously the sites of UV excitation and subsequent UV induced surface reaction with H(2) are not the same. This may coherently be explained in terms of mobility of the exciton (O(2-)(4C)* or--after ionization--of the corresponding electron hole O-(4C) along the edge where it was created. Finally the mobile state is trapped at a corner site where the O(3C)H group is formed.
12097515,123,2002,J Neurosci,Orientation selectivity in macaque V1: diversity and laminar dependence.,We studied the steady-state orientation selectivity of single neurons in macaque primary visual cortex (V1). To analyze the data, two measures of orientation tuning selectivity, circular variance and orientation bandwidth, were computed from the tuning curves. Circular variance is a global measure of the shape of the tuning curve, whereas orientation bandwidth is a local measure of the sharpness of the tuning curve around its peak. Circular variance in V1 was distributed broadly, indicating a great diversity of orientation selectivity. This diversity was also reflected in the individual cortical layers. However, there was a tendency for neurons with high circular variance, meaning low selectivity for orientation, to be concentrated in layers 4C, 3B, and 5. The relative variation of orientation bandwidth across the cortical layers was less than for circular variance, but it showed a similar laminar dependence. Neurons with large orientation bandwidth were found predominantly in layers 4C and 3B. There was a weak correlation between orientation selectivity and the level of spontaneous activity of the neurons. We also assigned a response modulation ratio for each cell, which is a measure of the linearity of spatial summation. Cells with low modulation ratios tended to have higher circular variance and bandwidth than those with high modulation ratios. These findings suggest a revision to the classical view that nonoriented receptive fields are principally found in layer 4C and the cytochrome oxidase-rich blobs in layer 2/3. Instead, a broad distribution of tuning selectivity is found in all cortical layers, and neurons that are weakly tuned for orientation are ubiquitous in V1 cortex.
11923301,38,2002,J Biol Chem,A point mutation that confers constitutive activity to CXCR4 reveals that T140 is an inverse agonist and that AMD3100 and ALX40-4C are weak partial agonists.,CXCR4 is a G protein-coupled receptor for stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) that plays a critical role in leukocyte trafficking, metastasis of mammary carcinoma, and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 infection. To elucidate the mechanism for CXCR4 activation, a constitutively active mutant (CAM) was derived by coupling the receptor to the pheromone response pathway in yeast. Conversion of Asn-119 to Ser or Ala, but not Asp or Lys, conferred autonomous CXCR4 signaling in yeast and mammalian cells. SDF-1 induced signaling in variants with substitution of Asn-119 to Ser, Ala, or Asp, but not Lys. These variants had similar cell surface expression and binding affinity for SDF-1. CXCR4-CAMs were constitutively phosphorylated and present in cytosolic inclusions. Analysis of antagonists revealed that exposure to AMD3100 or ALX40-4C induced G protein activation by CXCR4 wild type, which was greater in the CAM, whereas T140 decreased autonomous signaling. The affinity of AMD3100 and ALX40-4C binding to CAMs was less than to wild type, providing evidence of a conformational shift. These results illustrate the importance of transmembrane helix 3 in CXCR4 signaling. Insight into the mechanism for CXCR4 antagonists will allow for the development of a new generation of agents that lack partial agonist activity that may induce toxicities, as observed for AMD3100.
12234975,32,2002,Cancer Res,Arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-peptide binds to both tumor and tumor-endothelial cells in vivo.,Targeting tumor cells or tumor vasculature by peptides is a promising strategy for delivering cytotoxic drugs for cancer therapy. The identification of efficient targeting peptides depends on the availability of informative methods for determining cellular binding specificities. Here, we have used fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) analysis in combination with an isopentane freezing method to show targeted binding of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-4C-peptide labeled with FITC, not only to endothelial cells but also to tumor cells in human breast cancer xenografts grown in nude mice. Nontumorous cells showed only background binding. This study suggests, that the RGD-4C-peptide can target tumor endothelial cells as well as tumor cells. Consequently, it should be possible to design a combination therapy approach against both targets.
12027553,32,2002,Mol Ther,Gene transfer to ovarian cancer versus normal tissues with fiber-modified adenoviruses.,Adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) displays unparalleled gene transfer efficacy to cells with high coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) expression. Unfortunately, cells isolated from clinical human cancers, both ovarian and other types, express highly variable and often low levels of CAR. Fortunately, native Ad5 tropism can be modified to circumvent CAR deficiency and to enhance infectivity. Ad5/3luc1 incorporates the serotype 3 fiber knob and binds to a receptor distinct from CAR, while the fiber of Ad5lucRGD is modified with an RGD-4C motif, allowing CAR-independent binding to integrins. We studied the liver tropism and blood clearance of these viruses after intravenous (i.v.) injection, and biodistribution after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection to tumor-bearing mice. To estimate efficacy, we assessed gene transfer to purified human primary ovarian cancer cells, and in a mouse model of ovarian cancer. Ad5/3luc1 achieved improved gene transfer over Ad5lucRGD, and both infectivity-enhanced viruses were superior to the isogenic control with an unmodified Ad5 capsid. In the presence of malignant ascites, gene transfer was improved with both Ad5/3luc1 and Ad5lucRGD. Thus, retargeting to the Ad3 receptor enhances gene transfer to clinically relevant ovarian cancer substrates, while the mouse toxicity and biodistribution profile of both fiber-modified Ad vectors is comparable to Ad5.
12466211,31,2002,Cereb Cortex,Anatomical substrates for functional columns in macaque monkey primary visual cortex.,In this review we re-examine the concept of a cortical column in macaque primary visual cortex, and consider to what extent a functionally defined column reflects any sort of anatomical entity that subdivides cortical territory. Functional studies have shown that columns relating to different response properties are mapped in cortex at different spatial scales. We suggest that these properties first emerge in mid-layer 4C through a combination of thalamic afferent inputs and local intracortical circuitry, and are then transferred to other layers in a columnar fashion, via interlaminar relays, where additional processing occurs. However, several properties are not strictly columnar since they do not appear in all cortical layers. In contrast to the functional column, an anatomically based cortical column is defined most clearly in terms of the reciprocal connections it makes, both via intra-areal lateral connections and inter-areal feedback/feedforward pathways. The column boundaries are reinforced by interplay between lateral inhibition spreading beyond the column boundary and disinhibition within the column. The anatomical column acts as a functionally tuned unit and point of information collation from laterally offset regions and feedback pathways. Thalamic inputs provide the high-contrast receptive field sizes of the column's neurons, intra-areal lateral connections provide their low contrast summation field sizes, and feedback pathways provide surround modulation of receptive fields responses.
12370375,31,2002,J Immunol,Role of STAT6 and mast cells in IL-4- and IL-13-induced alterations in murine intestinal epithelial cell function.,Gastrointestinal nematode infections generally invoke a type 2 cytokine response, characterized by the production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13. Among these cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13 exhibit a functional overlap that can be explained by the sharing of a common receptor or receptor component (IL-4Ralpha). Binding of IL-4 by either the type 1 or 2 IL-4R, or of IL-13 by the type 2 IL-4R, initiates Jak-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-4Ralpha-chain and the transcription factor, STAT6. In the present study, we investigated: 1) whether IL-13 has effects on intestinal epithelial cells similar to those observed with IL-4, and 2) whether the effects of IL-4 and IL-13 depend on STAT6 signaling and/or mast cells. BALB/c, STAT6(-/-), and mast cell-deficient W/W(v) mice or their +/+ littermates were treated with a long-lasting formulation of recombinant mouse IL-4 (IL-4C) or with IL-13 for seven days. Segments of jejunum were mounted in Ussing chambers to measure mucosal permeability; chloride secretion in response to PGE(2), histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or acetylcholine; and Na(+)-linked glucose absorption. IL-4C and IL-13 increased mucosal permeability, decreased glucose absorption, and decreased chloride secretion in response to 5-hydroxytryptamine. These effects were dependent on STAT6 signaling. Responses to PGE(2) and histamine, which were dependent on mast cells and STAT6, were enhanced by IL-4C, but not by IL-13. The effects of IL-4 and IL-13 on intestinal epithelial cell function may play a critical role in host protection against gastrointestinal nematodes.
11888888,23,2002,Cancer Res,Treatment of ovarian cancer with a tropism modified oncolytic adenovirus.,Ad5-Delta 24RGD is an adenovirus that is selectively replication competent in cells defective in the Rb/p16 pathway, such as ovarian cancer cells. The fiber of Ad5-Delta 24RGD contains an integrin binding RGD-4C motif, allowing Coxsackie adenovirus receptor-independent infection of cancer cells. Oncolysis of cell lines was similar to that of a wild-type control, and replication in primary tumor material was shown using a novel three-dimensional spheroid model. Finally, an orthotopic murine model of peritoneally disseminated ovarian cancer was used to test i.p. administration to tumor-bearing animals. Injection of the agent resulted in eradication of i.p. disease, whereas control animals expired (P &lt; 0.0001). These results suggest that Ad5-Delta 24RGD could be useful for treatment of ovarian cancer in humans.
12148528,19,2002,Plant J,Light signalling mediated by phytochrome plays an important role in cold-induced gene expression through the C-repeat/dehydration responsive element (C/DRE) in Arabidopsis thaliana.,Low temperature induces a number of genes that encode the proteins promoting tolerance to freezing, mediated by ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways in plants. The cis-acting element called C/DRE is known to respond to low temperature independently of ABA action. To investigate the signalling and network of ABA-independent pathways, the transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated containing several copies of the C/DRE derived from cor15a gene with a minimal promoter fused to a GUS reporter gene. The transgenic plants containing four copies of the C/DRE (4C/DRE-GUS) showed responsiveness to cold and drought treatments and were used for characterization of cold signalling and cross-talk. Cold-induced GUS expression was inhibited by okadaic acid at 1 nM, indicating that protein phosphatase 2A might act as a positive regulator. Light was shown to activate cold- and drought-induced GUS expression. Photo-reversibility of the GUS mRNA by red and far-red light with concomitant cold treatment suggests a role of phytochrome as a photoreceptor in mediating light signalling to activate the cold-induced gene expression through the C/DRE. Furthermore, GUS expression analysis in phyA or phyB or phyAphyB mutant backgrounds showed that phytochrome B is a primary photoreceptor responsible for the activation of cold-stress signalling in response to light. Light enhanced the induction kinetics of CBF1, 2, and 3 encoding the cognate transcription factors, and cor15a, in a consecutive manner compared to the dark condition in the cold, suggesting that the connection point between cold and light signalling mediated by phytochrome is at a higher step than the expression of CBF genes.
11853433,19,2002,J Am Chem Soc,Ketopremithramycins and ketomithramycins, four new aureolic acid-type compounds obtained upon inactivation of two genes involved in the biosynthesis of the deoxysugar moieties of the antitumor drug mithramycin by Streptomyces argillaceus, reveal novel insights into post-PKS tailoring steps of the mithramycin biosynthetic pathway.,Mithramycin is an aureolic acid-type antimicrobial and antitumor agent produced by Streptomyces argillaceus. Modifying post-polyketide synthase (PKS) tailoring enzymes involved in the production of mithramycin is an effective way of gaining further information regarding the late steps of its biosynthetic pathway. In addition, new &quot;unnatural&quot; natural products of the aureolic acid-type class are likely to be produced. The role of two such post-PKS tailoring enzymes, encoded by mtmC and mtmTIII, was investigated, and four novel aureolic acid class drugs, two premithramycin-type molecules and two mithramycin derivatives, were isolated from mutant strains constructed by insertional gene inactivation of either of these two genes. From data bank comparisons, the corresponding proteins MtmC and MtmTIII were believed to act as a C-methyltransferase involved in the production of the D-mycarose (sugar E) of mithramycin and as a ketoreductase seemingly involved in the biosynthesis of the mithramycin aglycon, respectively. However, gene inactivation and analysis of the accumulated products revealed that both genes encode enzymes participating in the biosynthesis of the D-mycarose building block. Furthermore, the inactivation of MtmC seems to affect the ketoreductase responsible for 4-ketoreduction of sugar C, a D-olivose. Instead of obtaining premithramycin and mithramycin derivatives with a modified E-sugar upon inactivation of mtmC, compounds were obtained that completely lack the E-sugar moiety and that possess an unexpected 4-ketosugar moiety instead of the D-olivose at the beginning of the lower deoxysaccharide chain. The inactivation of mtmTIII led to the accumulation of 4E-ketomithramycin, showing that this ketoreductase is responsible for the 4-ketoreduction of the D-mycarose moiety. The new compounds of the mutant strains, 4A-ketopremithramycin A2, 4A-keto-9-demethylpremithramycin A2, 4C-keto-demycarosylmithramycin, and 4E-ketomithramycin, indicate surprising substrate flexibility of post-PKS enzymes of the mithramycin biosynthetic pathway. Although the glycosyltransferase responsible for the attachment of D-mycarose cannot transfer the unmethylated sugar to the existing lower disaccharide chain, it can transfer the 4-ketoform of sugar E. In addition, the glycosyltransferase MtmGIV, which is responsible for the linkage of sugar C, is also able to transfer an activated 4-ketosugar. The oxygenase MtmOIV, normally responsible for the oxidative cleavage of the tetracyclic premithramycin B into the tricyclic immediate precursor of mithramycin, can act on a substrate analogue with a modified or even incomplete trisaccharide chain. The same is true for glycosyltransferases MtmGI and MtmGII, both of which partake in the formation and attachment of the A-B disaccharide in mithramycin.
12009947,14,2002,Bioconjug Chem,In vitro and in vivo evaluation of a Technetium-99m-labeled cyclic RGD peptide as a specific marker of alpha(V)beta(3) integrin for tumor imaging.,Three amino acids residues, Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), in vitronectin and fibronectin show affinity for alpha(V)beta(3) integrins expressed in vascular endothelial cells. That tumor growth can upregulate the expression of these integrins on tumor cells for invasion and metastasis and in tissue neovasculature suggests the potential of developing radiolabeled RGD peptides as antagonists of alpha(V)beta(3) integrins for broad spectrum tumor specific imaging. The polypeptide RGD-4C, which contains four cysteine residues for cyclization, has shown preferential localization on integrins at sites of tumor angiogenesis. Both RGD-4C and RGE (Arg-Gly-Glu)-4C (as control) were purchased and conjugated with 6-hydrazinopyridine-3-carboxylic acid (HYNIC) for 99mTc radiolabeling. After purification of the conjugated peptides by a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge with 20% methanol, both peptides were radiolabeled using tricine. For cell binding studies, both 99mTc peptides were further purified by SE HPLC. High specific radioactivity of labeled cyclized RGD/E (cyclized RGD/E will be simplified as RGD/E through out the text) of about 20 Ci/micromol was achieved. Both 99mTc complexes were stable in the labeling solution for over 24 h at room temperature. In the human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cell studies, the binding at 1 h of radiolabeled RGD/E was determined at 4 degrees C and at concentrations in the picomolar to nanomolar range. Under these conditions, cell accumulation of 99mTc in the case of RGD was as much as 16 times greater than the control RGE. As a check on specificity, 7 nM of native cyclized RGD blocked 50% of the binding of 99mTc-labeled RGD to cells. The binding percentage of 99mTc-labeled RGD to purified alpha(V)beta(3) integrin protein, as determined by SE HPLC, increased with the concentration of the integrin while 99mTc-labeled RGE showed no binding. The association constant for 99mTc-RGD was modest at 7 x 10(6) M(-)(1). In both human renal adenocarcinoma (ACHN) and human colon cancer cell line (LS174T) nude mouse tumor models, the accumulation of 99mTc-labeled RGD/E exhibited no statistical difference. In conclusion, possibly because of limited numbers of alpha(V)beta(3) integrin receptors per tumor cell and low binding affinity, radiolabeled RGD peptides may have limitations as tumor imaging agents.
12011654,13,2002,J Hypertens,The BK channel beta1 subunit gene is associated with human baroreflex and blood pressure regulation.,BACKGROUND: The baroreflex, which is important for the minute-to-minute regulation of blood pressure and heart rate, is influenced by genetic variance. Ion channels are important to baroreflex afferent and efferent function. Mice missing the beta1 subunit of the Ca2+-sensitive potassium channel (BK) are hypertensive and have a reset baroreflex. We tested the hypothesis that variants in the gene (KCNMB1) coding for the BK beta1 subunit are associated with baroreflex function.METHODS: We studied six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KCNMB1.RESULTS: Four SNPs in intron 3, exon 4a, exon 4b and exon 4c gave significant results. For instance, exon 4b SNP AA individuals had higher heart rate variability, compared to CA, or CC persons, in particular in the high-frequency range. The low-frequency range showed no association. Consistent with the heart rate variability data, homozygous AA persons had greater baroreflex slopes than CA or CC persons, also in the high-frequency range. These associations could not be shown in the low-frequency range for heart rate variability and baroreflex slopes.CONCLUSIONS: These data support the notion that variants in channel genes may be responsible for the great range in heart rate variability and baroreflex function observed in humans. Such variation may also play a role in the development of hypertension.
12479389,12,2002,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Elevation of a collagenase generated type II collagen neoepitope and proteoglycan epitopes in synovial fluid following induction of joint instability in the dog.,CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Measurement of markers of cartilage pathology in synovial fluid may provide clinical rheumatologists and osteoarthritis (OA) researchers important information for early diagnosis of OA as well as a method for monitoring disease progression and response to treatment. This study demonstrates the value of this approach in an established model of OA (cranial cruciate ligament rupture) at a point distant enough from the original surgical manipulation so as to have little to no effect on the marker concentrations.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether measurement of markers of cartilage collagen cleavage and proteoglycan turnover in synovial fluid from a canine model could be used to detect cartilage changes following the onset of joint instability during the development of OA.DESIGN: A model of joint instability that develops OA was created in 18 mature dogs using monopolar radiofrequency energy (MRFE). MRFE was arthroscopically applied to one cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) while the contralateral CCL was sham treated. The treated CCLs ruptured approximately 8 weeks (55 +/- 1.6 days) after MRFE treatment. Synovial fluid was collected at time zero prior to MRFE treatment, 4 weeks after MRFE treatment, and at 4, 8, and 16 weeks after CCL rupture. Synovial fluid concentrations of the neoepitope COL2-3/4C long (type II collagen cleavage by collagenase) and epitopes 3B3(-) (proteoglycan aggrecan sulfation) and 846 (associated with aggrecan synthesis) were analyzed.RESULTS: Compared to sham treated joints, the synovial fluid concentrations of COL2-3/4C long and 3B3(-) were significantly increased 2.2 fold and 2.9 fold, respectively, in joints with MRFE treated CCLs following CCL rupture. Concentrations of the 846 epitope in synovial fluid showed a trend toward an increase, which was not significant, after CCL rupture.CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of the collagenase-cleaved type II collagen neoepitope and 3B3(-) epitope in synovial fluid were significantly increased by 4 weeks and remained elevated for at least 16 weeks after CCL rupture. This suggests that in dogs the COL2-3/4C long neoepitope and 3B3(-) epitope are sensitive markers for changes in joint cartilage turnover in joints that are developing OA.
11902877,10,2002,J Am Chem Soc,Interactions of aziridines with nickel complexes: oxidative-addition and reductive-elimination reactions that break and make C-N bonds.,Reaction of the N-tosylaziridines (p-CH(3)C(6)H(4)SO(2))NCH(2)CHR (1a, R = H; 1b, R = Me; 1c, R = n-Bu; 1d, R = i-Pr) with (bpy)Ni(cod) (2; bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine; cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) or (bpy)NiEt(2) (3) results in elimination of cod or butane from 2 and 3, respectively, and oxidative addition of an aziridine C-N bond to give the azametallacyclobutane complexes (bpy)Ni(NTosCHRCH(2)) (4a, R = H; 4b, R = Me; 4c, R = n-Bu; 4d, R = i-Pr) as maroon solids in 50-70% isolated yields. The structure of 4b exhibits a puckered four-membered azametallacycle containing a pyramidal nitrogen and with Ni-N(1) = 1.911(5) A; the tosyl group on N and the methyl substituent on the adjacent C are disposed in an anti conformation. The monodeuterated aziridine syn-(p-CH(3)C(6)H(4)SO(2))NCHDCH-n-Bu (1e) reacts with either 2 or 3 to give (bpy)Ni[NTosCH(n-Bu)CHD] (4e) in 60-65% yield, having an anti arrangement of the methine and methylene protons in the azametallacycle, and indicates that &gt;95% inversion of stereochemistry has occurred at the methylene carbon during the oxidative-addition reaction. When the azametallacyclobutane complexes 4a-e are exposed to oxygen, oxidatively induced reductive elimination ensues, giving the free aziridines in 30-60% isolated yields. In the oxidation of 4e, the product aziridine is spectroscopically identical to its parent, 1e, indicating the elimination that forms the C-N bond also proceeds with inversion of stereochemistry (approximately 92% by (1)H NMR) at the methylene carbon.
12502843,9,2002,J Virol,Negative regulation of mitotic promoting factor by the checkpoint kinase chk1 in simian virus 40 lytic infection.,Lytic infection of African green monkey kidney (CV-1) cells by simian virus 40 (SV40) is characterized by stimulation of DNA synthesis leading to bypass of mitosis and replication of cellular and viral DNA beyond a 4C DNA content. To define mechanisms underlying the absence of mitosis, the expression levels of upstream regulatory molecules of mitosis-promoting factor (MPF) were compared in parallel synchronized cultures of SV40-infected and uninfected CV-1 cells. The DNA replication/damage checkpoint kinase Chk1 was phosphorylated in both uninfected and SV40-infected cultures arrested at G(1)/S by mimosine, consistent with checkpoint activation. Following release of uninfected cultures from G(1)/S, Chk1 phosphorylation was lost even though Chk1 protein levels were retained. In contrast, G(1)/S-released SV40-infected cultures exhibited dephosphorylation of Chk1 in S phase, followed by an increase in Chk1 phosphorylation coinciding with entry of infected cells into &gt;G(2). Inhibitors of Chk1, UCN-01 and caffeine, induced mitosis and abnormal nuclear condensation and increased the protein kinase activity of MPF in SV40-infected CV-1 cells. These results demonstrate that SV40 lytic infection triggers components of a DNA damage checkpoint pathway. In addition, chemical inhibition of Chk1 activity suggests that Chk1 contributes to the absence of mitosis during SV40 lytic infection.
12110324,9,2002,Bioorg Med Chem,Superoxide dismutase mimetics: synthesis and structure-activity relationship study of MnTBAP analogues.,Carboxylic ester and amide-substituted analogues of [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)-porphyrinato]manganese(III) chloride (MnTBAP) were synthesized and assayed as potential superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetics. The tetraester analogues 4a and 4b were found to have comparable SOD activity to the known SOD mimetic MnTBAP, while amides 4c-4e exhibited reduced SOD activity. In the substituted methyl benzoate/acid and disubstituted porphyrin series, analogues 12c, 12f, and 12m were found to have comparable to improved SOD activity relative to MnTBAP and analogues 12j, 13a, and 13d exhibited improved activity in both the SOD and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) assays relative to MnTBAP.
12428230,8,2002,Arthritis Rheum,Matrix homeostasis in aging normal human ankle cartilage.,OBJECTIVE: To study age-related (as opposed to arthritis-related) changes in collagen and proteoglycan turnover.METHODS: Macroscopically nondegenerate normal ankle cartilage obtained from 30 donors (ages 16-75 years) was processed for in situ hybridization to detect messenger RNA (mRNA) of type IIB collagen (CIIB); antibodies to the C-propeptide of type II collagen (CPII), to the type II collagen (CII) collagenase-generated cleavage neoepitope (Col2-3/4C(short)), and to the CII denaturation product (Col2-3/4m) were used for immunohistochemistry analysis and immunoassay. In addition, immunoblotting was used to detect the 4 collagenases. Assays were also performed to detect glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and the 846 epitope of aggrecan.RESULTS: There were no significant changes in CII, GAG, and the content of the 846 epitope after the age of 30 years. Both mRNA for CIIB and the CPII were present in all zones, and CPII content did not change significantly with age. While the collagenase-cleaved CII showed a trend to increase with age, the denatured collagen did not. However, the molar ratio of cleaved versus denatured collagen was positively correlated with age. All 4 collagenases were detectable in the ankle cartilage but showed no identifiable changes in content with age.CONCLUSION: Synthesis and degradation of CII is associated with the pericellular matrix and is maintained at a steady state throughout life. The contents of CII and proteoglycan did not change. There was a significant reduction in the denaturation of CII with age, relative to collagenase-mediated cleavage. These observations reveal that, in aging of the intact ankle articular cartilage, there is no evidence of molecular degenerative changes of the kind observed in osteoarthritis, thereby distinguishing aging from the osteoarthritis process.
12364575,8,2002,J Histochem Cytochem,Effects of different fixatives on beta-galactosidase activity.,beta-Galactosidase (beta-Gal) staining is widely used to demonstrate specific gene expression during evaluation of gene targets in vivo. This technique is extremely sensitive to fixation. Optimal fixation conditions are necessary to obtain the maximal beta-Gal activity. In this experiment, Carnoy's and three different aldehyde fixatives were used at different temperatures and over different time points. Kidneys from LacZ-stop-human alkaline phosphatase (ZA/P) double reporter mice were used to generate positive material for the experiment. The results show that glutaraldehyde combinative solution (LacZ) produced the most consistent and reliable results. Paraformaldehyde and formaldehyde were effective as fixatives only at 4C for a period of less than 4 hr, and Carnoy's solution destroyed beta-Gal activity.
12214673,8,2002,Drug Metab Rev,Role of human cytochrome P450 (CYP) in the metabolic activation of nitrosamine derivatives: application of genetically engineered Salmonella expressing human CYP.,The role of human cytochrome P450 (CYP) in the metabolic activation of tobacco-related N-nitrosamines was examined by Salmonella mutation test using a series of genetically engineered Salmonella typhimurium YG7108 strains each co-expressing a form of CYP (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) together with human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. Seven tobacco-related N-nitrosamines such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-nitrosopyrrolidine, N-nitrosopiperidine, N-nitrosonornicotine, N-nitrosoanabasine, and N-nitrosoanatabine were used. The CYP2A6 was found to be responsible for the mutagenic activation of essentially all tobacco-related N-nitrosamines examined. On the basis of the evidence, genetic polymorphism of the CYP2A6 gene appeared to be one of the factors determining cancer susceptibility caused by smoking. Previously, we found the whole deletion of the CYP2A6 gene (CYP2A6*4C) as a type of genetic polymorphism in Japanese. We hypothesized that individuals possessing the gene homozygous for CYP2A6*4C were incapable of activating tobacco-related N-nitrosamines and showed lower susceptibility to lung cancer induced by tobacco smoke. Thus, the relationship between the CYP2A6*4C and the susceptibility to the lung cancer was evaluated. The frequency of the CYP2A6*4C was significantly lower in the lung cancer patients than healthy volunteers, suggesting that the subjects carrying the CYP2A6*4C alleles are resistant to carcinogenesis caused by N-nitrosamines because of the poor metabolic activation capacity. Taking these results into account, CYP2A6 is an enzyme enhancing lung cancer risk.
12042667,8,2002,Pharmacogenetics,A novel mutant allele of the CYP2A6 gene (CYP2A6*11 ) found in a cancer patient who showed poor metabolic phenotype towards tegafur.,In a clinical study, a newly developed anticancer drug, TS-1 capsule, which contained tegafur (FT) and 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine, an inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, was orally administered to five gastric cancer patients (patients 1-5). The total area under the plasma FT concentration-time curve in patient 1 was four-fold higher than in other patients. Since cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) has been reported to metabolize FT to yield 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), it was postulated that the poor metabolic phenotype of patient 1 was caused by mutations of the CYP2A6 gene. Thus, alleles for the CYP2A6 genes derived from patient 1 were completely sequenced. It was found that one allele was CYP2A6*4C, which was a whole deleted allele for the human CYP2A6 gene. The other allele was a novel mutant allele (CYP2A6*11) in which thymine at nucleotide 670 was changed to cytosine. The nucleotide change caused an amino acid change from serine at residue 224 to proline. To examine whether or not the amino acid change affected CYP2A6 activity, we expressed an intact or mutant CYP2A6 together with NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase in Escherichia coli, and compared the capacity of the wild and mutant enzymes to metabolize FT to 5-FU. The Vmax value for FT metabolism by the mutant CYP2A6 was approximately one-half of the value of the intact CYP2A6, although the Km values were nearly the same. From these results, we conclude that the poor metabolic phenotype of patient 1 was caused by the existence of the two mutant alleles, CYP2A6*4C and the new variant CYP2A6*11.
11890632,8,2002,Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,Validation of skinfold thickness and hand-held impedance measurements for estimation of body fat percentage among Singaporean Chinese, Malay and Indian subjects.,Body fat percentage (BF%) was measured in 298 Singaporean Chinese, Malay and Indian men and women using a chemical four-compartment model consisting of fat, water, protein and mineral (BF%4C). In addition, weight, height, skinfold thickness and segmental impedance (from hand to hand) was measured. Body fat percentage was predicted using prediction equations from the literature (for skinfolds BF%SKFD) and using the manufacturer's software for the hand-held impedance analyser (BF%IMP). The subjects ranged in age from 18-70 years and in body mass index from 16.0 to 40.2 kg/m2. Body fat ranged from 6.5 to 53.3%. The biases for skinfold prediction (BF%4C-BF%SKFD, mean +/- SD) were -0.4+/-3.9, 2.3+/-4.1 and 3.1+/-4.2 in Chinese, Malay and Indian women, respectively, the Chinese being different from the Malays and Indians. The differences were significant from zero (P &lt; 0.05) in the Malays and Indians. For the men, the biases were 0.5+/-3.8, 0.0+/-4.8 and 0.9+/-4.0 in Chinese, Malays and Indians, respectively. These biases were not significantly different from zero and not different among the ethnic groups. The biases for hand-held impedance BF% were -0.7+/-4.5, 1.5+/-4.4 and 0.4+/-3.8 in Chinese, Malay and Indian women. These biases were not significantly different from zero but the bias in the Chinese was significantly different from the biases in the Malays and Indians. In the Chinese, Malay and Indian men, the biases of BF%IMP were 0.7+/-4.6, 1.9+/-4.8 and 2.0+/-4.4, respectively. These biases in Malay and Indian men were significantly different from zero and significantly different from the bias in Chinese men. The biases were correlated with level of body fat and age, and also with relative arm span (arm span/height) for impedance. After correction, the differences in bias among the ethnic groups disappeared. The study shows that the biases in predicted BF% differ between ethnic groups, differences that can be explained by differences in body composition and differences in body build. This information is important and should be taken into account when comparing body composition across ethnic groups using predictive methods.
11836118,8,2002,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis and aldose reductase inhibitory activity of 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinediones.,Several (Z)-5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinediones were synthesized and tested as aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs). The most active of the N-unsubstituted derivatives (2) exerted the same inhibitory activity of Sorbinil. The introduction of an acetic side chain on N-3 of the thiazolidinedione moiety led to a marked increase in lending inhibitory activity, conducting to the discovery of a very potent ARI (4c), whose activity level (IC50=0.13 microM) was in the same range of Tolrestat. Moreover, the corresponding methyl esters (3), devoid of any acidic functionality, showed appreciable inhibitory activity similar to that of the N-unsubstituted compounds. It was also found that the substitution pattern on the 5-benzylidene moiety markedly influenced the activity of N-unsubstituted 2,4-thiazolidinediones 2, compounds with substituents at the meta position being generally more effective than the para-substituted ones; however, this SAR was not evidenced in acetates 3 and acids 4.
12105916,7,2002,J Am Chem Soc,Preparation of benzyne complexes of group 10 metals by intramolecular suzuki coupling of ortho-metalated phenylboronic esters: molecular structure of the first benzyne-palladium(0) complex.,A series of nickel(II) and palladium(II) aryl complexes substituted in the ortho position of the aromatic ring by a (pinacolato)boronic ester group, [MBr[o-C(6)H(4)B(pin)]L(2)] (M = Ni, L(2) = 2PPh(3) (2a), 2PCy(3) (2b), 2PEt(3) (2c), dcpe (2d), dppe (2e), and dppb (2f); M = Pd, L(2) = 2PPh(3) (3a), 2PCy(3) (3b), and dcpe (3d)), has been prepared. Many of these complexes react readily with KO(t)Bu to form the corresponding benzyne complexes [M(eta(2)-C(6)H(4))L(2)] (M = Ni, L(2) = 2PPh(3) (4a), 2PCy(3) (4b), 2PEt(3) (4c), dcpe (4d); M = Pd, L(2) = 2PCy(3) (5b)). This reaction can be regarded as an intramolecular version of a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction, the driving force for which may be the steric interaction between the boronic ester group and the phosphine ligands present in the precursors 2 and 3. Complex 3d also reacts with KO(t)Bu, but in this case disproportionation of the initially formed eta(2)-C(6)H(4) complex (5d) leads to a 1:1 mixture of a novel dinuclear palladium(I) complex, [(dcpe)Pd(mu(2)-C(6)H(4))Pd(dcpe)] (6), and a 2,2'-biphenyldiyl complex, [Pd(2,2'-C(6)H(4)C(6)H(4))(dcpe)] (7d). Complexes 2a, 3b, 3d, 4b, 5b, 6, and 7d have been structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction; complex 5b is the first example of an isolated benzyne-palladium(0) species.
12050205,7,2002,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,An unusual phenotype of Frasier syndrome due to IVS9 +4C&gt;T mutation in the WT1 gene: predominantly male ambiguous genitalia and absence of gonadal dysgenesis.,The Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor involved in the development of the kidneys and gonads and their subsequent normal function. Mutations in the WT1 gene were identified in patients with WAGR (Wilms' tumor, aniridria, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation), Denys-Drash syndrome, and Frasier syndrome (FS). Constitutional heterozygous mutations of the WT1 gene, almost all located at intron 9, are found in patients with FS. This syndrome is characterized by female external genitalia in 46,XY patients, late renal failure, streak gonads, and high risk of gonadoblastoma development. We report a male with FS with an unusual phenotype characterized by normal penis size with perineal hypospadias, end-stage renal failure at the age of 19 yr, normal adult male serum T levels, extremely elevated gonadotropin levels, para-testicular leiomyoma, unilateral testicular germ cell tumor, bilateral gonadoblastoma, and absence of gonadal dysgenesis. Automatic sequencing identified the IVS9 +4C&gt;T mutation in the WT1 gene, which predicts a change in splice site utilization. WT1 transcript analysis showed reversal of the normal positive/negative KTS (lysine, threonine, and serine) isoform ratio, confirming the diagnosis of FS. This patient with FS presents an external genitalia of Denys-Drash syndrome, suggesting that these two syndromes are not distinct diseases but may represent two ends of a spectrum of disorders caused by alterations in WT1 gene. This case expands the spectrum of phenotypes associated with WT1 mutations, by including predominantly male ambiguous genitalia and absence of gonadal dysgenesis, extremely high gonadotropin levels, and delayed adrenarche, and presence of a para-testicular leiomyoma, bilateral gonadoblastoma, and germ cell neoplasia.
11867457,7,2002,Biophys J,Rapid transbilayer movement of spin-labeled steroids in human erythrocytes and in liposomes.,The transbilayer movement and distribution of spin-labeled analogs of the steroids androstane (SLA) and cholestane (SLC) were investigated in the human erythrocyte and in liposomes. Membranes were labeled with SLA or SLC, and the analogs in the outer leaflet were selectively reduced at 4C using 6-O-phenylascorbic acid. As shown previously, 6-O-phenylascorbic acid reduces rapidly nitroxides exposed on the outer leaflet, but its permeation of membranes is comparatively slow and thus does not interfere with the assay. From the reduction kinetics, we infer that transbilayer movement of SLA in erythrocytes is rapid at 4C with a half-time of approximately 4.3 min and that the probe distributes almost symmetrically between both halves of the plasma membrane. We have no indication that a protein-mediated transport is involved in the rapid transbilayer movement of SLA because 1) pretreatment of erythrocytes with N-ethyl maleimide affected neither flip-flop nor transbilayer distribution of SLA and 2) flip-flop of SLA was also rapid in pure lipid membranes. The transbilayer dynamics of SLC in erythrocyte membranes could not be resolved by our assay. Thus, the rate of SLC flip-flop must be on the order of, or even faster than, that of probe reduction rate on the exoplasmic leaflet (half-time approximately 0.5 min). The results are discussed with regard to the transbilayer dynamics of cholesterol.
12481411,6,2002,Mol Cancer Ther,Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a dual tumor-specific motive containing integrin-targeted plasmin-cleavable doxorubicin prodrug.,The design, synthesis, and initial biological evaluation of a doxorubicin prodrug that contains a dual tumor specific moiety, which allows enhanced tumor recognition potential, is reported. Both a tumor-specific recognition site and a tumor selective enzymatic activation sequence are incorporated in the prodrug. The first tumor-specific sequence is the bicyclic CDCRGDCFC (RGD-4C) peptide that selectively binds alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5 integrins. These integrins are highly overexpressed on invading tumor endothelial cells. The second tumor-specific sequence is a D-Ala-Phe-Lys tripeptide that is selectively recognized by the tumor-associated protease plasmin, which is involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. An aminocaproyl residue was incorporated as a spacer between the two peptide sequences, whereas a self-eliminating 4-aminobenzyl alcohol spacer was inserted between the plasmin substrate and doxorubicin. Although the prodrug showed a decreased binding affinity as compared with the unconjugated reference peptide, it was still a potent ligand for alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5 integrin receptors. The synthesized construct also possessed plasmin substrate properties as demonstrated by doxorubicin release from 1 upon incubation with plasmin. The release of doxorubicin from 1 was not complete, possibly related to low prodrug solubility. In vitro prodrug 1 showed plasmin-dependent cytotoxicity for endothelial cells and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. On the basis of these in vitro results, derivatives of 1 with improved water solubility are considered good candidates for additional development and in vivo evaluation of this dual targeting concept.
11960911,6,2002,Carcinogenesis,CYP2A6 gene deletion reduces oral cancer risk in betel quid chewers in Sri Lanka.,We investigated the relationship between inter-individual difference in CYP2A6 genotype and susceptibility to oral cancer among habitual betel quid chewers in a Sri Lanka population. A total of 286 subjects showing oral malignant or premalignant lesions and 135 control subjects with no lesions were analyzed. The frequency of homozygotes for CYP2A6*4C mutation, a gene deletion type of polymorphism, was significantly lower in the case subjects than the controls. The odds ratio (OR) of the group homozygous for the deletion was significantly lower and calculated to be 0.14 (95% CI; 0.03-0.72). In the allelic base analysis, there was also a significant decrease in the OR of the deletion allele. Our data suggest that deficient CYP2A6 activity due to genetic polymorphism reduces oral cancer risk in betel quid chewers.
12160148,5,2002,Eur J Cell Biol,Stage-dependent effects of cell-to-cell connections on in vitro induced neurogenesis.,NE-4C, a p53-deficient, immortalized neuroectodermal progenitor cell line, was used to investigate the role and importance of cellular interactions in neural commitment and differentiation. NE-4C cells give rise to neurons and astrocytes in the presence of all-trans retinoic acid, if they can establish intercellular contacts. Aggregation per se, however, was insufficient to induce large-scale neuron formation. In the absence of RA, the majority of the aggregated cells died. For neuron formation, therefore, concerted actions of RA and cellular interaction were needed. Electron microscopic and electrophysiological studies revealed that gap junctions were formed between the cells. Persistent blockage of communication via gap junctions with gap junction blockers, however, had no effects on neuron formation. If cell-to-cell connections were disrupted on the fourth day after induction, the rate of neuron production increased significantly. The contact interactions formed between already committed progenitor cells seemed to hinder the formation of novel neurons. The process resembled the phenomenon called &quot;lateral inhibition&quot; first observed in the course of neurogenesis in Drosophila. Our results indicate that NE-4C cells provide a useful model system to investigate the role of contact communication during some early steps of neurogenesis.
12142875,5,2002,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod,Invasive front in oral squamous cell carcinoma: image and flow cytometric analysis with clinicopathologic correlation.,OBJECTIVE: Pathologists have drawn attention to the invasive tumor front (ITF) in the determination of the biologic aggressiveness of oral cancer. We have attempted to discover the prognostic significance of cancer cells with abnormal DNA content at the ITF of oral squamous cell carcinoma.STUDY DESIGN: A comparative DNA analysis by means of image cytometry and flow cytometry was conducted to confirm the usefulness of image cytometry in detecting cancer cells having abnormal DNA content at the ITF. The prognostic value of cancer cells with abnormal DNA content ws examined by a multivariate analysis for 195 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.RESULTS: In the comparative DNA analysis, it was suggested that image cytometry is useful for detecting cancer cells with abnormal DNA content (4c exceeding rate [4cER]), which is associated with poor prognosis of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. In the multivariate analysis, 3 independent factors were found to significantly influence cause-specific survival. These are, in decreasing order of influence, (1) abnormal DNA content (4cER), (2) clinical stage, and (3) growth type.CONCLUSION: The presence of cancer cells with abnormal DNA content of the ITF in conjunction with clinical findings (clinical stage and growth type) can give additional useful information when selecting treatment strategies for oral cancer patients.
12036513,5,2002,Brain Res Dev Brain Res,Mosaic development of the olfactory cortex with Pax6-dependent and -independent components.,The olfactory cortex is the target area of olfactory bulb axons and is suggested to be derived from neuroepithelial progenitors of various ventricular domains during development. In the present study, we examined the development of the olfactory cortex, using the newly developed monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9-4c, which recognizes reticulon 1-A and -B. The mAb labeled neuroepithelial progenitors at the pallio-subpallial boundary (PSB) and their putative descendants in the deep layers of the olfactory cortex. In the Pax6 mutant embryo, labeling at the PSB was specifically lacking, and the number of immunopositive cells in the olfactory cortex was markedly reduced. In contrast, the guidepost neurons of olfactory bulb axons, lot cells, developed relatively normally in the superficial layer of the olfactory cortex in the mutant embryo. These guidepost neurons have been recently shown to originate in the pallium and eventually guide the initial projection of olfactory bulb axons. The olfactory bulb projection in the Pax6 mutant embryo also suggested the dualistic nature of the olfactory cortex development; the initial projection of olfactory bulb axons developed relatively normally, whereas the final projection of their collateral branches was severely defective.
11920728,5,2002,J Neurobiol,Regulated appearance of NMDA receptor subunits and channel functions during in vitro neuronal differentiation.,The schedule of NMDA receptor subunit expression and the appearance of functional NMDA-gated ion channels were investigated during the retinoic acid (RA) induced neuronal differentiation of NE-4C, a p53-deficient mouse neuroectodermal progenitor cell line. NR2A, NR2B, and NR2D subunit transcripts were present in both nondifferentiated and neuronally differentiated cultures, while NR2C subunits were expressed only transiently, during the early period of neural differentiation. Several splice variants of NR1 were detected in noninduced progenitors and in RA-induced cells, except the N1 exon containing transcripts that appeared after the fourth day of induction, when neuronal processes were already formed. NR1 and NR2A subunit proteins were detected both in nondifferentiated progenitor cells and in neurons, while the mature form of NR2B subunit protein appeared only at the time of neuronal process elongation. Despite the early presence of NR1 and NR2A subunits, NMDA-evoked responses could be detected in NE-4C neurons only after the sixth day of induction, coinciding in time with the expression of the mature NR2B subunit. The formation of functional NMDA receptors also coincided with the appearance of synapsin I and synaptophysin. The lag period between the production of the subunits and the onset of channel function suggests that subunits capable of channel formation cannot form functional NMDA receptors until a certain stage of neuronal commitment. Thus, the in vitro neurogenesis by NE-4C cells provides a suitable tool to investigate some inherent regulatory processes involved in the initial maturation of NMDA receptor complexes.
11772609,5,2002,Appl Environ Microbiol,Restriction fragment length polymorphisms detected with novel DNA probes differentiate among diverse lineages of serogroup 4 Listeria monocytogenes and identify four distinct lineages in serotype 4b.,Listeria monocytogenes of serotype 4b has been implicated in numerous outbreaks of food-borne listeriosis and in ca. 40% of sporadic cases. Strains of this serotype appear to be relatively homogeneous genetically, and molecular markers specific for distinct serotype 4b lineages have not been frequently identified. Here we show that DNA fragments derived from the putative mannitol permease locus of Listeria monocytogenes had an unexpectedly high potential to differentiate among different strains of serotype 4b when used as probes in Southern blotting of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA, yielding four distinct restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns. Strains of two epidemic-associated lineages, including the major epidemic clone implicated in several outbreaks in Europe and North America, had distinct RFLPs which differed from those of all other serotype 4b strains that we screened but which were encountered among strains of serotypes 1/2b and 3b. In addition, three serogroup 4 lineages were found to have unique RFLPs that were not encountered among any other L. monocytogenes strains. One was an unusual lineage of serotype 4b, and the other two were members of the serotype 4a and 4c group. The observed polymorphisms may reflect evolutionary relationships among lineages of L. monocytogenes and may facilitate detection and population genetic analysis of specific lineages.
12352464,4,2002,J Urol,Prostate perfusion in patients with locally advanced prostate carcinoma treated with different hyperthermia techniques.,PURPOSE: We determined prostate perfusion in 18 patients with locally advanced prostate carcinoma treated with a combination of external beam irradiation and regional (10) or interstitial (8) hyperthermia.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Perfusion values were calculated from temperature elevations due to constant applied power and from transient temperature measurements after a change in applied power. Student's t test was used for comparing perfusion values with time and in the 2 groups.RESULTS: At the start of regional hyperthermia treatment mean estimated perfusion plus or minus standard deviation was 10 +/- 8 ml./100 gm. per minute. At the end of treatment mean perfusion was increased to 14 +/- 2 ml./100 gm. per minute (p &lt;0.01). Achieved thermal parameters were a mean temperature of at least 40.3C +/- 0.6C in 90% of the prostate, 40.9C +/- 0.6C in 50% and a mean maximum temperature of 41.6C +/- 0.6C. At the end of interstitial hyperthermia treatment estimated mean perfusion was 47 +/- 5 ml./100 gm. per minute, which was significantly different compared with the end of regional hyperthermia (p &lt; 0(-7) ). Mean temperature was at least 39.4C +/- 0.9C in 90% of the prostate and 41.8C +/- 1.6C in 50%, while mean maximum temperature was 53.1C +/- 6.3C. Systemic temperature increased during regional hyperthermia up to 38.6C, whereas during interstitial hyperthermia body temperature was not elevated.CONCLUSIONS: During interstitial hyperthermia perfusion values are higher than during regional hyperthermia. Hyperthermia causes increased prostate perfusion.
12189781,4,2002,Arzneimittelforschung,Synthesis and antituberculosis activity of cycloalkylidenehydrazide and 4-aza-1-thiaspiro[4.5]decan-3-one derivatives of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.,New N2-cycloalkylidene-(6-phenyl/4-chlorophenylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazol-3-yl) acetic acid hydrazides (2a-h and 3a-b) were synthesized by reacting (6-phenyl/4-chlorophenylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazol-3-yl)acetic acid hydrazides with cyclohexanones or cyclopentanone. Furthermore, 2a-h were refluxed with thioglycolic or thiolactic acid to give 4-[[(6-phenyl/4-chlorophenylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazol-3-yl) acetyl]amino]-4-aza-1-thiaspiro[4.5]decan-3-ones (4a-h and 5a-h). The structures of the title compounds were established by spectral data (IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and EIMS (Electron Impact Mass Spectrometry)) and elemental analysis. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27294). The compounds exhibited varying degrees of inhibition in the in vitro primary screening that was conducted at a concentration of 6.25 micrograms/ml against M. tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27294) in Bactec 12B medium using the Bactec 460 radiometric system or a broth microdilution assay, the Microplate Alamar Blue Assay (MABA). Compounds 2f, 2h, 3b, 4a, 4c, 4d, 5a-e and 5h demonstrating at 1-east 90% inhibition in the primary screen were re-tested at lower concentrations against M. tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27294) to determine the actual minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using MABA. The most active compounds were found to be 4d and 5c. The structure-activity relationships of the derivatives were investigated.
12027659,4,2002,Org Lett,Liquid-phase combinatorial synthesis of alicyclic beta-lactams via Ugi four-component reaction.,[reaction: see text] Alicyclic beta-lactams were successfully synthesized via a parallel liquid-phase Ugi four-center three-component reaction (U-4C-3CR), starting from alicyclic beta-amino acids such as cis-2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid, cis-2-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid, 2,3-diexo-3-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid and some of their partially unsaturated analogues. A six-membered mixture-based combinatorial library of beta-lactams was also generated.
12007475,4,2002,Carbohydr Res,Effect of (1--&gt;3)- and (1--&gt;4)-linkages of fully sulfated polysaccharides on their anticoagulant activity.,Chemically fully sulfated polysaccharides including xylan (--&gt;4Xylbeta-(1--&gt;4)Xylbeta1--&gt;), amylose (--&gt;4Glcalpha-(1--&gt;4)Glcalpha1--&gt;), cellulose (--&gt;4Glcbeta-(1--&gt;4)Glcbeta1--&gt;), curdlan (--&gt;3Glcbeta-(1--&gt;3)Glcbeta1--&gt;) and galactan (--&gt;3Galbeta-(1--&gt;3)Galbeta1--&gt;), which have been isolated from Korean clam, were prepared, and their anticoagulant activity was investigated. The results strongly suggest that the activity might not be depending on anomeric configuration (alpha or beta) or monosaccharide species but on the glycosidic linkage, either (1--&gt;3) or (1--&gt;4). 1H NMR studies of these modified polysaccharides show that the neighboring sulfate groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions might have caused the conformational changes of each monosaccharide from 4C(1) to 1C(4). Furthermore, the effect of 6-sulfate residues on the anticoagulant activity was investigated using a specific desulfated reaction for the chemically fully sulfated polysaccharides. The 6-sulfate group is very important in determining anticoagulant activity of (1--&gt;3)-linked polysaccharides, whereas the activity is not affected by presence or absence of the 6-sulfate group in (1--&gt;4)-linked polysaccharides.
11907180,4,2002,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Pharmacological profile of a novel phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, 4-(8-benzo[1,2,5]oxadiazol-5-yl-[1,7]naphthyridin-6-yl)-benzoic acid (NVP-ABE171), a 1,7-naphthyridine derivative, with anti-inflammatory activities.,We investigated the pharmacology of a new class of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, 6,8-disubstituted 1,7-naphthyridines, by using 4-(8-benzo[1,2,5]oxadiazol-5-yl-[1,7]naphthyridin-6-yl)-benzoic acid (NVP-ABE171) as a representative compound and compared its potency with the most advanced PDE4 inhibitor, undergoing clinical trials, Ariflo [cis-4-cyano-4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl-r-1-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid)]. NVP-ABE171 inhibited the activity of phosphodiesterase 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D with respective IC(50) values of 602, 34, 1230, and 1.5 nM. Ariflo was about 40 times less potent. In human cells, NVP-ABE171 inhibited the eosinophil and neutrophil oxidative burst, the release of cytokines by T cells, and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha release from monocytes, in the nanomolar range. Ariflo presented a similar inhibition profile but was 7 to 50 times less potent. In BALB/c mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide, NVP-ABE171 inhibited the airway neutrophil influx and activation with an ED(50) in the range of 3 mg/kg. Ariflo was inactive up to a dose of 10 mg/kg. In ovalbumin sensitized Brown Norway rats, NVP-ABE171 inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced airway neutrophil influx and activation (ED(50) of 0.2 mg/kg) and the ovalbumin-induced airway eosinophil influx and activation (ED(50) of 0.1 mg/kg). Ariflo was about 100 times less potent in both models. In the ovalbumin model, NVP-ABE171 had a duration of action of more than 24 h. NVP-ABE171 is a novel PDE4 inhibitor that shows activity both in vitro on human inflammatory cells and in vivo in animal models of lung inflammation. This compound class may have potential for the treatment of airway inflammatory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.
11864355,4,2002,Clin Microbiol Infect,Inhibition of amplification of Chlamydia trachomatis plasmid DNA by the ligase chain reaction associated with female urines.,OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of inhibition of ligase chain reaction (LCR) amplification of Chlamydia trachomatis plasmid DNA in urines from pregnant and non-pregnant women, to correlate inhibitors with urinary substances through urinalysis, and to explore methods of removing inhibitors from urine. METHODS: First-void urines (FVUs) from 287 non-pregnant and 101 pregnant women (15--40 years of age) in Hamilton, Canada were tested for urinary factors by urinalysis and for C. trachomatis by LCR. A sample of each urine was 'spiked' with a positive control containing approximately one infectious unit of C. trachomatis L2 serovar. RESULTS: Complete inhibition of DNA amplification was observed in nine of 287 (3.1%) urines from non-pregnant women and in one of 101 (1%) who were pregnant. Partial inhibition (&gt; 20% reduction in signal) was observed in an additional five of 388 (1.3%) urines. Nine urines contained C. trachomatis plasmid DNA, but none of these contained inhibitors of LCR. By multivariate analysis, the only substances in urine which were significantly and independently related to LCR inhibition were nitrites. Holding the urines at 4C or minus sign70C overnight reduced the numbers which were inhibitory by approximately 50%. Diluting the urines 1:10 or extracting with phenol/chloroform removed all inhibition and retained amplifiable DNA. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that urinary inhibitors of C. trachomatis DNA amplification by LCR are minimal and appear to be related to the presence of nitrites. We anticipate that most would disappear in transit or during processing and that a positive control for every urine is not warranted, considering the added cost and work associated with duplicate testing.
12446050,3,2002,Eur J Med Chem,Synthesis and primary cytotoxicity evaluation of new 5-nitroindole-2,3-dione derivatives.,A new series of 5-nitro-1H-indole-2,3-dione-3-thiosemicarbazones (3a-k) obtained by condensation of 5-nitro-1H-indole-2,3-dione (1) with N-substituted-thiosemicarbazides (2a-k) were treated with morpholine or piperidine and formaldehyde to yield 1-morpholino/piperidinomethyl-5-nitroindole-2,3-dione-3-thiosemicarbazones (4a-m). The structures of all the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (IR, 1H-NMR, EIMS) methods. Compounds 3b, 3c, 3f, 3k, 4a, 4c, 4f and 4l chosen as prototypes were evaluated in the National Cancer Institute's 3-cell line, one dose in vitro primary cytotoxicity assay. All the compounds that passed the criteria for activity in this assay were scheduled automatically for evaluation against the full panel of 60 human tumour cell lines at a minimum of five concentrations at 10-fold dilutions. Sulphorhodamine B (SRB) protein assay was used to estimate cell stability or growth. The most active compound was found to be 1-morpholinomethyl-5-nitroindole-2,3-dione-3-N-(chlorophenyl)thiosemicarbazone (4l). This compound demonstrated the most marked effects in the National Cancer Institute's 60 human tumour cell line in vitro screen on a non-small cell lung cancer cell line (HOP-62, log(10)GI(50) value &lt;-8.00) and on leukaemia cell lines (HL-60(TB), log(10)GI(50) value -6.30; MOLT-4, log(10)GI(50) value -6.18).
12006256,3,2002,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,[Prevalence of hepatitis C virus genotypes in the area of El Ferrol (La Coruña, Spain)].,BACKGROUND: To determine the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes in the area of El Ferrol, as well as their distribution according to risk factors.METHODS: A total of 479 patients with hepatitis C were studied, including 254 with no known risk factors, 161 intravenous drug abusers (IVDA) and 64 with a history of blood transfusions. The presence of HCV RNA was studied by RT-PCR, and a reverse hybridization method (INNO-LiPA) was used for genotyping.RESULTS: Genotype distribution was as follows: 1b, 269 (56.2%); 1a, 79 (16.5%); 3a, 59 (12.3%); 4c/4d, 35 (7.3%); 1, 19 (4.0%); 2a/2c, 3 (0.6%); 4, 3 (0.6%); 2b, 2 (0.4%). In 10 patients (2.1%) genotype could not be determined. In patients with no known risk factor, the predominant genotype was 1b, detected in 191 of the 254 patients in this group (75.2%). Distribution of genotypes was more varied in the IVDA group, with the most frequent being 1a in 49 (30.4%) and 3a in 43 (26.7%). In the 64 patients who had received transfusions, 1b was predominant, detected in 54 of 64 patients (84.4%).CONCLUSIONS: The predominant HCV genotype in our area is 1b. Differences in genotype distribution were observed in the population groups studied, according to their underlying risk factors.

(S)-4c is bench-stable and has activity comparable to that of the nitrile free Lewis acid catalyst for Diels-Alder, hetero-Diels-Alder, and glyoxylate-ene reactions.
11755908,3,2002,Carbohydr Res,The saccharide-hydrazide linkage: molecular and crystal structures of the semicarbazide derivatives of D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-xylose, including a 'forbidden' conformation of the galactose derivative.,The X-ray crystal structures of the semicarbazide derivatives of D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-xylose are described. All are glycopyranosyl derivatives in the solid state. The glucose semicarbazide crystallizes as a dihydrate. Two different conformations of the galactose semicarbazide are found, one having the gg side-chain orientation unfavorable for monosaccharides having the 4C(1)-D-galacto configuration. In the two other known examples, this conformation is stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond, but in the current structure, the hydrogen bonds involving the side chain are intermolecular. In these semicarbazides the N [bond] N [bond] C[double bond] O torsional angle is approximately 180 degrees, in contrast to the angles of 0.60 and 13.9 degrees in the two solid-state conformations of 2-benzoyl-1-(alpha-D-xylopyranosyl)hydrazine [Ernholt, B. V.; Thomsen, I. B.; Lohse, A.; Plesner, I. W.; Jensen, K. B.; Hazell, R. G.; Liang, X.; Jakobsen, A.; Bols, M. Chem. Eur. J. 2000, 6, 278-287]. The water molecules and the carbonyl oxygen are heavily involved in H-bonding.
12490717,2,2002,Nucleic Acids Res,Propynyl groups in duplex DNA: stability of base pairs incorporating 7-substituted 8-aza-7-deazapurines or 5-substituted pyrimidines.,Oligonucleotides incorporating the 7-propynyl derivatives of 8-aza-7-deaza-2'-deoxyguanosine (3b) and 8-aza-7-deaza-2'-deoxyadenosine (4b) were synthesized and their duplex stability was compared with those containing the 5-propynyl derivatives of 2'-deoxycytidine (1) and 2'-deoxyuridine (2). For this purpose phosphoramidites of the 8-aza- 7-deazapurine (pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) nucleosides were prepared and employed in solid-phase synthesis. All propynyl nucleosides exert a positive effect on the DNA duplex stability because of the increased polarizability of the nucleobase and the hydrophobic character of the propynyl group. The propynyl residues introduced into the 7-position of the 8-aza-7-deazapurines are generally more stabilizing than those at the 5-position of the pyrimidine bases. The duplex stabilization of the propynyl derivative 4b was higher than for the bromo nucleoside 4c. The extraordinary stability of duplexes containing the 7-propynyl derivative of 8-aza-7- deazapurin-2,6-diamine (5b) is attributed to the formation of a third hydrogen bond, which is apparently not present in the base pair of the purin-2,6-diamine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside with dT.
12475856,2,2002,Chest,Lung damage in experimental pleurodesis induced by silver nitrate or talc: 1-year follow-up.,STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the lung damage caused by intrapleural silver nitrate (SN) with that caused by talc over a 12-month period.DESIGN: One hundred forty rabbits received an intrapleural injection of 0.5% SN or 400 mg/kg talc slurry in 2 mL saline solution. Groups of 10 rabbits were killed after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 months. The macroscopic pleurodesis, microscopic lung changes (ie, collapse, hemorrhage, and edema), and cellular infiltrates (number and proportion of cells) were graded on a scale of 0 to 4.RESULTS: The mean (+/- SEM) adhesion score after SN injection (3.3 +/- 0.1) was higher (p &lt; 0.001) than that after talc injection (2.3 +/- 0.1). The mean alveolar collapse score was greater (p &lt; 0.001) 1 month after SN injection (2.2 +/- 0.3) than after talc injection (0.2 +/- 0.1) and was similar from the second month on. The degree of parenchymal hemorrhage, by alveolar collapse score, (SN injection, 0.2 +/- 0.1; talc injection, 0.2 +/- 0.0) and edema (SN injection, 0.4 +/- 0.1; talc injection, 0.3 +/- 0.1) was minimal in both groups (p &gt; 0.05). One month after the injection, the total number of inflammatory cells was greater (p &lt; 0.001) in rabbits that had received SN injections (2.7 +/- 0.3) than in those that had received talc injections (1.2 +/- 0.1). From the second month on, cellularity decreased and became similar in both groups. The cellular profile was different, with a predominantly neutrophilic reaction after talc injection and a predominantly eosinophilic reaction after SN injection.CONCLUSIONS: Rabbits injected with intrapleural 0.5% SN had significantly higher scores for adhesions than did those that had received talc injections, with mild and reversible alveolar collapse and an eosinophilic responses, conditions showing a clear tendency to normalize with time.
12361234,2,2002,Farmaco,Synthesis and biological evaluation of 6-bromo-6-substituted penicillanic acid derivatives as beta-lactamase inhibitors.,The synthesis of a selected set of 6-bromopenicillanic acid derivatives with an additional C6 substituent is reported. All these substances were tested as inhibitors of class A and C beta-lactamase enzymes derived from Escherichia coli (TEM-1) and E. cloacae (P99). As 6-(1-hydroxyethyl) derivatives 4c and 6c were found to be weak beta-lactamase inhibitors, they were further investigated in combination with amoxicillin against a series of beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains. Some structure-activity relationships are discussed.
12189367,2,2002,Clin Pharmacol Ther,A population phenotyping study of three drug-metabolizing enzymes in Kyushu, Japan, with use of the caffeine test.,OBJECTIVE: We assessed in vivo activities of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2), N-acetyltransferase 2, and xanthine oxidase in Japanese residents of Kyushu, the southern island of Japan.METHODS: One hundred eighty-two healthy volunteers (108 men and 74 women) received a 150-mg oral dose of caffeine before they went to sleep. The concentrations of caffeine, caffeine metabolites, and uric acid in their overnight urine samples were analyzed. The CYP2A6 genotypes were determined in 66 of the 182 volunteers to assess whether they affected a metabolic ratio for CYP1A2 activity index.RESULTS: The metabolic ratio for CYP1A2 was not polymorphic, but its mean ratio was greater in smokers than in nonsmokers (P &lt;.05). Twenty subjects (11.0%) were found to be slow acetylators. Twenty subjects were determined to be putative poor metabolizers of xanthine oxidase, and the mean urinary uric acid concentration of those subjects was 53% lower than that of the other subjects (P &lt;.0001). The mean ratio for CYP1A2 obtained from 3 subjects with the CYP2A6(*)4C/CYP2A6(*)4C genotype was greater than the mean ratio from subjects with other genotypes (P &lt;.01) or that from subjects with a wild-type CYP2A6(*)1A allele (P &lt;.05).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that putative poor metabolizers of xanthine oxidase activities exist in a Japanese population and that a decreased 1,7-dimethyluric acid formation from caffeine in poor metabolizers of CYP2A6 appears to affect the metabolic ratio used for the assessment of CYP1A2 activity.
12022844,2,2002,J Am Chem Soc,Iron complexes capped with dendrimer-appended triazacyclononanes as the novel spatially encumbered models of non-heme iron proteins.,Poly(benzyl ether) dendrimers with a 1,4,7-triazacyclononane (TACN) focal core (Ln(3)TACN, 2a-4a) and nondendritic L1(3)TACN (1a), upon reaction with FeCl(2), followed by NaOAc and NH(4)PF(6), afforded mononuclear iron(II) complexes [Fe(II)(eta(2)-OAc)(Ln(3)TACN)](+) (1b-4b), which were oxidized under O(2) to form dinuclear (mu-O)(mu-OAc)(2)diiron(III) complexes (1c-4c) in 54-74% isolated yields. The formation of 1c-4c obeyed second-order kinetics with respect to 1b-4b, respectively, where the observed rate constants (k(2)) were clearly dependent on the generation number of the dendritic substituents. Photoirradiation of 1c-4c in the presence of NaOAc gave diiron(II) complexes (1d-4d), which were reoxidized to 1c-4c by O(2), following first-order kinetics with respect to 1d-4d, respectively. The crystal structure of nondendritic 1cshowed that the diiron(III) center is surrounded by an aromatic wall of the six 3,5-dimethoxybenzyl substituents, while spectroscopic profiles of dendritic 2c-4c suggested that the geometries of their diiron(III) centers are little different from that of 1c. The diiron(III) center of the largest 4c was highly robust toward alkaline hydrolysis and also insulated electrochemically.
12003546,2,2002,J Org Chem,Asymmetric synthesis of metallocenes through enantioselective addition of organolithium reagents to 6-(dimethylamino)fulvene.,Enantioselective addition of aryllithiums 2a-d (Ar = Ph (a), 2-MeC(6)H(4) (b), 2-MeOC(6)H(4) (c), 1-naphthyl (d)) to 6-(dimethylamino)fulvene (1) in the presence of (-)-sparteine in toluene at -78 degrees C generated chiral cyclopentadienyllithiums (4) substituted with an N,N-dimethylamino(aryl)methyl group, where the enantioselectivities are 51, 91, 90, and 83% for 4a, 4b, 4c, and 4d, respectively. Treatment of the chiral cyclopentadienides 4 with FeCl(2) or Fe(acac)(2) gave ferrocenes, which contain an N,N-dimethylamino(aryl)methyl side chain on both of the cyclopentadienyl rings. The enantiomeric purity of the chiral ferrocenes 7 thus obtained is 99% ee or higher for those containing a 2-MeC(6)H(4) (7b) or a 2-MeOC(6)H(4) (7c) group.
11981887,2,2002,Chemistry,Constructing terbium co-ordination polymers of 4,4'-bipyridine-N,N'-dioxide by means of diffusion solvent mixtures.,Five different co-ordination polymers of terbium(III) and the bidentate ligand 4,4'-bipyridine-N,N'-dioxide (L), [Tb(L)(CH(3)OH)(NO(3))(3)](infinity) (1), ([Tb(L)(1.5)(NO(3))(3)].CH(2)Cl(2))(infinity) (2), ([Tb(L)(1.5)(NO(3))(3)].CH(3)OH.0.8H(2)O)(infinity) (3), ([Tb(L)(1.5)(NO(3))(3)].0.4C(2)Cl(4).0.8CH(3)OH)(infinity) (4), and [Tb(L)(2)(NO(3))(3)](infinity) (5) have been synthesised by the use of different &quot;diffusion solvent mixtures&quot;, and structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography. Compound 1, with a Tb:L stoichiometry of 1:1, adopts a zig-zag chain structure, which forms three-fold interpenetrating diamondoid frameworks through interchain hydrogen bonding between co-ordinated methanol and a nitrate group on an adjacent chain. Polymers 2, 3, and 4 all have a Tb:L stoichiometry of 1:1.5, but adopt different topologies. For 2, a ladder arrangement is found and large channels which accommodate solvent CH(2)Cl(2) molecules are formed by superposition of the ladders. For 3 and 4 4.8(2) net structures are observed. The superposition of the 4.8(2) nets in 3 and 4, by disposing adjacent layers such that every octagon is positioned below a tetragon from the neighbouring layer, allows the formation of two kinds of channel, with that inside the tetragons accommodating methanol molecules. The other kind of channel, between tetragons, accommodates water molecules in the case of 3 and tetrachloroethylene molecules in the case of 4. Compound 5, with a Tb:L stoichiometry of 1:2, has a linear polymeric structure with one bridging and one terminal ligand, and forms (6,3) plane nets by means of intermolecular electrostatic interactions between N-oxide moieties. X-ray powder diffraction studies show that upon desolvation, compound 2 maintains its original ladder framework.
11980891,2,2002,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Mechanisms of myopia in Cohen syndrome mapped to chromosome 8q22.,PURPOSE: To analyze the mechanisms of myopia in Cohen syndrome (Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] no. 216550).METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 22 Finnish patients (age range, 2-57 years) with Cohen syndrome, which maps to chromosome 8q22, was undertaken to record cycloplegic refraction, keratometry (corneal power and radius of curvature), biometry (anterior chamber depth [ACD], lens thickness [LT], axial [AL] and vitreal length [VL]), and Hoffer Q-modeled lens power. These components of refraction were correlated to age and spherical equivalent (SE) at the corneal plane. Contribution to total myopia of refractive (corneal and lenticular) and axial components was modeled by multiple linear regression and by estimating the effect of deviation from population mean values.RESULTS: The mean SE in patients with Cohen syndrome older than 10 years was -9.35 D; the mean cylinder power, +1.70 D; and the mean anisometropia, 0.53 D. Relative to the emmetropic eye of a young adult, the AL and VL (mean, 23.9 and 16.6 mm, respectively) and lens power (mean, 30.30 D) were higher in 74% and 93% of patients, respectively, and the ACD (mean, 2.5 mm) was smaller and the LT (mean, 4.9 mm) and corneal power (mean, 45.63 D) higher than average in all patients. Corneal power (r = 0.513, P = 0.021) increased with age, but AL and VL (P = 0.46 and 0.54, respectively) and lens power (P = 0.89) did not correlate with age. The lens power decreased with AL (r = -0.564, P = 0.029) and tended to increase with corneal power (r = 0.475, P = 0.074). Multiple linear regression identified AL and corneal power as independent predictors of SE. Based on deviation from population means, the lens power explained 55%, corneal power 23%, and AL 22% of total myopia. ACD decreased and LT increased markedly with age, rendering angle-closure glaucoma a possibility.CONCLUSIONS: Myopia in Cohen syndrome is mainly refractive in type and is due to high corneal and lenticular power, which is otherwise rare in young patients. It may be superimposed on axial myopia, probably related to polygenic factors that determine myopia in the general population. The refractive myopia in Cohen syndrome may result from dysgenesis and atrophy of the cornea, ciliary body, and iris, which in turn cause iridial and zonular laxity and spherophakia.
11891770,2,2002,J Neurosci Res,Changes of KCl sensitivity of proliferating neural progenitors during in vitro neurogenesis.,The effects of KCl-treatment on the survival and proliferation of NE-4C self-renewing neural progenitor cells were investigated during early phases of in vitro induced neurogenesis. NE-4C cells, derived from the anterior brain vesicles of embryonic mouse (E9), divided continuously under non-inducing conditions, but acquired neuronal features within 6 days, if induced by all-trans retinoic acid (RA). During the first 2 days of induction, the cells went on proliferating and did not show signs of morphological differentiation. In this stage, the resting membrane potential of RA-induced cells adopted more negative values in comparison to non-induced ones. Despite the increased membrane polarity and K+ conductance, addition of 20-50 mM KCl failed to elicit inward Na+ currents and did not induce an increase in the intracellular Ca+ level. Long-term treatment with 25 mM KCl, on the other hand, resulted in a selective loss of cells committed to neuronal fate by both decreasing the rate of cell proliferation and increasing the rate of cell death. The data indicate that the viability and proliferation of neural progenitors are influenced by extracellular K+-level in a differentiation stage-dependent manner.
11777437,2,2002,J Org Chem,Structure of 1-(arylselanyl)naphthalenes. 2. G dependence in 8-G-1-(p-YC(6)H(4)Se)C(10)H(6).,The structures of 8-G-1-(p-YC(6)H(4)Se)C(10)H(6) (1 (G = Cl) and 2 (G = Br): Y = H (a), OMe (b), Me (c), Cl (d), Br (e), COOEt (f), and NO(2) (g)) were investigated by X-ray crystallographic analysis, NMR spectroscopy, and ab initio MO calculations. The structures of all members in 1 and 2 are concluded to be type B, which is in striking contrast to the type A structure for 4d-g (4 (g(n)), where G = H). The Se-C(i) bond of the p-YC(6)H(4)Se group in 8-G-1-(p-YC(6)H(4)Se)C(10)H(6) is almost perpendicular to the naphthyl plane in type A, and it is located on the plane in type B. The chlorine and bromine substitution at the 8-position in 1 and 2 dramatically changes the type A structure of 4 (g(n)) to type B. The nonbonded G- - -Se-C 3c-4e type interaction must contribute to stabilize the type B structure. The type B structure in 1 and 2 should also be more stabilized than the same structure in 4 by the 3c-4e type interaction: The structure of 4b is type B in the crystals and type B would be more stable for 4c and might be for 4a in solutions. Ab initio MO calculations are performed on 8-G-1-(p-YC(6)H(4)Se)C(10)H(6), 8-G-C(10)H(6)SeH-1, and models HG- - -SeH(2), where G = Cl, Br, and F, to clarify the reason for the dramatic change in the structures. The type B structure is optimized to be more stable than the type A for all species examined, which supports the observations. The energy differences between type B and type A are larger for the models than for the naphthalenes. While the superiority of the type B for the former is Br &gt; Cl &gt; F, that of the latter is Br approximately Cl &gt;/= F. These results show that the main factor of the structural change from type A to type B is the nonbonded G- - -Se-C 3c-4e interaction. The electronic effect of halogens through the naphthalene pi-framework would also contribute to some extent, although the direct comparison of the evaluated values between the naphthalene systems and the models is not so easy. Factors to stabilize the two structures of 1, 2, 4, and 8-(MeSe)-1-(p-YC(6)H(4)Se)C(10)H(6) are reexamined from a viewpoint of the nonbonded G- - -Se-C 3c-4e interaction (G dependence), together with the electronic effect of Y (Y dependence).
11759357,2,2002,AACN Clin Issues,Creating a collaborative environment to care for complex patients and families.,Today's critical care environment is increasingly complex due to technological advancements, greater intensity of interventions, and a myriad of healthcare providers. Critically ill patients and their families can feel overwhelmed with the stress of the environment in addition to the acute illness. This stress affects the patients' and families' ability to function, cope, and understand complex information. For some families, this experience precipitates distrustful relationships with care providers. The resulting impact on quality of care, staff morale, length of stay, and cost is high. The purpose of this article is to describe issues encountered by one medical center in caring for complex patients and families. A representative case outlines the types of issues the staff in the adult intensive care units faced. Use of a comprehensive problem-solving model to address concerns resulted in structured approaches to guide healthcare providers in caring for complex patients and families. The goal of these approaches was to support all parties involved in the care of complex patients, improve communication, and avoid crises that resulted from distrustful relationships and lack of skill in resolving conflict.
12392732,1,2002,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Discovery and biological characterization of capromorelin analogues with extended half-lives.,New tert-butyl, picolyl and fluorinated analogues of capromorelin (3), a short-acting growth hormone secretagogue (GHS), were prepared as part of a program to identify long-acting GHSs that increase 24-h plasma IGF-1 levels. Compounds 4c and 4d (ACD LogD values &gt;or=2.9) displayed extended plasma elimination half-lives in dogs, primarily due to high volumes of distribution, but showed weak GH secretagogue activities in rats (ED(50)s&gt;10 mg/kg). A less lipophilic derivative 4 (ACD LogD=1.6) exhibited a shorter canine half-life, but stimulated GH secretion in two animal species. Repeat oral dosing of 4 in dogs for 29 days (6 mg/kg) resulted in a significant down-regulation of the post dose GH response and a 60 and 40% increase in IGF-1 levels relative to pre-dose levels at the 8- and 24-h post dose time points. Compound 4 (CP-464709-18) has been selected as a development candidate for the treatment of frailty.
12362808,1,2002,Food Nutr Bull,Validity of deuterium oxide dilution for the measurement of body fat among Singaporeans.,Body fat percent (BF%) was measured in 108 adult Chinese, 76 Malays, and 107 Indians in Singapore by densitometry, deuterium oxide dilution (hydrometry), dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and a chemical four-compartment model (BF%4c). The hydration of the fat-free mass (FFM) was calculated. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 69 years and their body mass index ranged from 16 to 40 kg/m2. BF%4c for the various subgroups were: Chinese females (33.5 +/- 7.5%), Chinese males (24.4 +/- 6.1%), Malay females (37.8 +/- 6.3%), Malay males (26.0 +/- 7.6%), Indian females (38.2 +/- 7.0%) and Indian males (28.1 +/- 5.5%). Biases were found between BF%4c and BF% measured by 2-compartment models (hydrometry, densitometry, DXA), with systematic underestimation by DXA and densitometry. On a group level hydrometry had the lowest bias while DXA gave the highest bias. When validated against BF%4c, 2-compartment models were found to be unsuitable for accurate measures of body fat due to high biases at the individual level and the violation of assumptions of constant hydration of FFM and density FFM among the ethnic groups. On a group level the best 2-compartment model for measuring body fat was found to be hydrometry.
12126437,1,2002,J Org Chem,NA,A new method for beta-phenol annulation involving base-induced [4C + 2C] cycloaromatization of readily available 4-bis(methylthio)-3-buten-2-one with a variety of cyclic and acyclic active methylene ketones has been reported. Appropriate choice of ketones allows synthesis of diverse frameworks such as dihydroindan, tetrahydronaphthalenes, their higher homologues, dihydro/octahydrophenanthrenes, anthracene, and heteroannulated analogue in high yields with regiocontrol of phenolic functionality.
12094062,1,2002,Acta Crystallogr C,Tetrameric triphenylsilanol, (Ph(3)SiOH)(4), and the adduct (Ph(3)SiOH)(2)-dimethyl sulfoxide, both at 120 K, and the adduct (Ph(3)SiOH)(4)-1,4-dioxan at 150 K: interplay of O[bond]H...O and C[bond]H...pi(arene) interactions.,The structure of tetrameric triphenylsilanol, C(18)H(16)OSi, (I), has been re-investigated at 120 (2) K. The hydroxyl H atoms were readily located and one of the arene rings is disordered over two closely positioned sets of sites. The molecules are linked into cyclic tetramers, having approximate 4 (S(4)) symmetry, via O[bond]H...O hydrogen bonds [H...O 1.81-1.85 A, O...O 2.634 (3)-2.693 (3) A and O[bond]H...O 156-166 degrees ]. At ambient temperature, there are indications of multiple disorder of the phenyl-ring sites. In bis(triphenylsilanol) dimethyl sulfoxide solvate, 2C(18)H(16)OSi x C(2)H(6)OS, (II), the dimethyl sulfoxide component is disordered across a twofold rotation axis in C2/c, and the molecular components are linked by a single O[bond]H...O hydrogen bond [H...O 1.85 A, O...O 2.732 (2) A and O[bond]H...O 172 degrees ] into three-molecule aggregates, which are themselves linked into a single three-dimensional framework by two C[bond]H...pi(arene) interactions. In tetrakis(triphenylsilanol) 1,4-dioxan solvate, 4C(18)H(16)OSi x C(4)H(8)O(2), (III), the 1,4-dioxan component lies across an inversion centre in space group P-1 and centrosymmetric five-molecule aggregates are linked by paired C[bond]H...pi(arene) interactions to form molecular ladders.
11996832,1,2002,Carbohydr Res,Synthesis and X-ray structures of sulfate esters of fructose and its isopropylidene derivatives. Part 1: 2,3:4,5-di-O-isopropylidene-beta-D-fructopyranose 1-sulfate and 4,5-O-isopropylidene-beta-D-fructopyranose 1-sulfate.,2,3:4,5-Di-O-isopropylidene-beta-D-fructopyranose 1-sulfate have been synthesized by treatment of 2,3:4,5-di-O-isopropylidene-beta-D-fructopyranose with pyridine-sulfur trioxide complex. Direct hydrolysis of the isopropylidene group at C-4, C-5 gave 2,3-O-isopropylidene-beta-D-fructopyranose 1-sulfate. The crystal and molecular structures of ammonium (1a) and potassium (1b) salts of diisopropylidene derivative and ammonium (2) salt of monoisopropylidene derivative were determined by X-ray crystallography. Data for 1a and 1b were collected in 120 K and in 150 K for 2. All salts crystallized in P2(1)2(1)2(1) space group. There are three independent anions in asymmetric unit in 1b. Pyranose rings in the diisopropylidene derivative salts studied adopt 2S(0) twist boat conformation, whereas in the monoisopropylidene exists in a slightly distorted chair conformation (4C(1)). A staggered conformation is preferred by the sulfate group as indicated by values of C-(ester)-S-O(terminal) torsion angles: -173.2(4) degrees in 1a, 175.1(6) degrees in anion A of 1b, 170.8(6) degrees in anion C of 1b and 177.9(2) degrees in 2. However, strong interactions such as potassium-oxygen and H-bonds may affect the geometry: in anion B of 1b the value of the torsion angle is 139.4(6) degrees.
11958637,1,2002,J Agric Food Chem,Fate and kinetic modeling of reactivity of alkanesulfenic acids and thiosulfinates in model systems and onion homogenates.,The dynamic changes in thiosulfinate profiles were studied in reaction systems containing a crude onion alliinase, S-alk(en)yl-L-cysteine sulfoxide substrates (1) and preformed thiosulfinates (4). Regioisomeric excesses of one of two possible heterologous 4 species (RS(O)SR', where R does not equal R') could be manipulated under conditions where alliinase, 1, and 4 levels were varied. Regioisomeric excesses could be explained by a thiosulfinate (4)/alkanesulfenic acid (2) trapping mechanism, with the greatest control over product profile governed by the rate of 2 generation in the system. The series of reactions existing in this dynamic reaction system was kinetically modeled with reasonable fits to the experimental data. The application of the 4/2 trapping strategy to manipulate thiosulfinate and related organosulfur product profiles in diluted onion homogenates was demonstrated using exogenous MeS(O)SMe (4a), PrS(O)SPr (4c), and AllS(O)SAll (4d) as the preformed thiosulfinate.
21665661,1,2002,Am J Bot,Genetic variation in Bromus tectorum (Poaceae): differentiation in the eastern United States.,Bromus tectorum, a devastating plant invader in western North America, had entered Pennsylvania by 1790. Although rare, or extirpated, in the east until the 1850s, it was collected with increasing frequency after 1859 from Vermont to Virginia. Using enzyme electrophoresis, we analyzed 38 populations of this grass in the eastern U.S. to determine their genetic variation and structure as well as assess their relatedness to populations in the west. Genetic variation among eastern U.S. populations is low: mean number of alleles per locus (A), percent polymorphic loci per population (%P), and expected heterozygosity (H(exp)) are 1.01, 1.05%, and 0.002, respectively. No heterozygotes were detected. The eastern populations are genetically similar: mean genetic identity for all populations was 0.990 with values among population pairs ranged from 0.913 to 1.000. Thirteen populations in eastern and western North America shared Pgm-1a and Pgm-2a, while eight populations shared Mdh-2b and Mdh-3b. Other alleles detected in western North America (Got-4c, Got-4d, and Pgi-2b) were not, however, found in eastern U.S. populations. The invasion of North America by B. tectorum occurred through multiple introductions on both coasts; results from historical and genetic evidence suggest that eastern populations stem from a minimum of two introductions. The 19th century westward spread of B. tectorum from the East appears to be plausible.
11819527,1,2002,World J Gastroenterol,Stereoselective propranolol metabolism in two drug induced rat hepatic microsomes.,AIM:To study the influence of inducers BNF and PB on the stereoselective metabolism of propranolol in rat hepatic microsomes.METHODS:Phase I metabolism of propranolol was studied by using the microsomes induced by BNF and PB and the non induced microsome as the control.The enzymatic kinetic parameters of propranolol enantiomers were calculated by regression analysis of Lineweaver-Burk plots. Propranolol concentrations were assayed by HPLC.RESULTS:A RP-HPLC method was developed to determine propranolol concentration in rat hepatic microsomes. The linearity equations for R(+)propranolol and S(-) propranolol were A = 705.7C+311.2C (R = 0.9987) and a = 697.2C+311.4C (R = 0.9970) respectively. Recoveries of each enantiomer were 98.9%, 99.5%, 101.0% at 60&amp;mgr;mol/L, 120&amp;mgr;mol/L, 240&amp;mgr;mol/L respectively. At the concentration level of 120&amp;mgr;mol/L, propranolol enantiomers were metabolized at different rates in different microsomes. The concentration ratio R(+)/S(-) of control and PB induced microsomes increased with time, whereas that of microsome induced by BNF decreased. The assayed enzyme parameters were: 1. Km. Control group: R(+)30 plus minus 8, S(-)18 plus minus 5; BNF group: R(+)34 plus minus 3, S(-)39 plus minus 7; PB group: R(+)38 plus minus 17, S(-)36 plus minus 10. 2. Vmax. Control group: R(+)1.5 plus minus 0.2, S(-)2.9 plus minus 0.3; BNF group: R(+)3.8 plus minus 0.3, S(-)3.3 plus minus 0.5; PB group: R(+)0.07 plus minus 0.03, S(-)1.94 plus minus 0.07. 3. Clint. Control group: R(+)60 plus minus 3, S(-)170 plus minus 30; BNF group: R(+)111.0 plus minus 1, S(-) 84 plus minus 5; PB group: R(+)2.0 plus minus 2, S(-)56.0 plus minus 1. The enzyme parameters compared with unpaired t tests showed that no stereoselectivity was observed in enzymatic affinity of three microsomes to enantiomers and their catalytic abilities were quite different and had stereoselectivities.Compared with the control, microsome induced by BNF enhanced enzyme activity to propranolol R(+)enantiomer, and microsome induced by PB showed less enzyme activity to propranolol S(-)enantiomer which remains the same stereoselectivities as that of the control.CONCLUSION:Enzyme activity centers of the microsome were changed in composition and regioselectivity after the induction of BNF and PB, and the stereoselectivities of propranolol cytochrome P450 metabolism in rat hepatic microsomes were likely due to the stereoselectivities of the catalyzing function in enzyme.CYP1A subfamily induced by BNF exhibited pronounced contribution to propranolol metabolism with stereoselectivity to R(+)enantiomer.CYP2B subfamily induced by PB exhibited moderate contribution to propranolol metabolism, but still had the stereoselectivity of S(-)enantiomer.
11791731,1,2002,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,Regulation of cigarette smoke-induced cytochrome P4501A1 gene expression in osteogenic disorder Shionogi rat liver and in lung by large ascorbic acid dose.,The effects of a large ascorbic acid dose on cytochrome P4501A1 gene expression induced by cigarette smoke exposure was studied in Osteogenic Disorder Shionogi rats, which lack ascorbic acid biosynthesis. The rats were divided into four groups and were administered either a minimal amount (4 mg/day, 4S and 4C) or a large amount (40 mg/day, 40S and 40C) of ascorbic acid. The 4S group and 40S group were daily exposed to cigarette smoke for 2 hours, while the 4C group and 40C group were not. At the end of the 25-day experiment, the rats were killed. The cytochrome P4501A1 mRNA level both in the liver and lung was measured by a competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. When a minimal amount of ascorbic acid was administered, the cytochrome P4501A1 mRNA increased in the liver of the cigarette smoke-exposed group (4S) compared with the control group (4C). On the other hand, when a large amount of ascorbic acid was administered, this increase was not observed in the cigarette smoke-induced group (40S) in liver. On the other hand, in lung, an increased mRNA level in 4S group was not decreased by large ascorbic acid administration (40S). This is the first direct mRNA-level evidence of the effects of a large ascorbic acid dose on the gene expression stimulated by cigarette smoke.
11766274,1,2002,Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr,[Comparison of direct colony count methods and the MPN-method for quantitative detection of Listeria in model and field conditions].,In order to compare the plate count method for quantitating Listeria, as published in the &quot;Official Collection of Testing Methods&quot; in section 35 LMBG (L. 00.00-22), to an MPN-method for Listeria based on the same mediums, these two detection methods for Listeria were tested in three sets of experiments and a routine sample status evaluation. A pure broth culture of L. monocytogenes, artificially with L. monocytogenes contaminated ground meat, artificially contaminated and cold stored ground meat as well as 77 ground beef samples from Berlin retail food stores were used in the four trials. The detection limit of the MPN-method is about 66% lower than the plate count method allowing detection of a clearly greater number of Listeria-positive samples from naturally contaminated ground meat. The MPN-method yielded more Listeria spp.-positive samples (rel. 43%) and more L. monocytogenes-positive samples (rel. 21%) versus the colony count method based on the results from the field trial using ground beef samples from retail food stores in Berlin. Nevertheless the standardized colony count method is preferred over the MPN-method for routine use because of its slightly higher productivity and much smaller variation in the results. However, the MPN-method is preferable for epidemiological studies because of the significance of the lower detection level. The random sampling evaluation of ground beef from retail stores indicated that 39% of the samples were Listeria spp.-positive and 31% were L. monocytogenes-positive when using the colony count method. A total of 56% of the meat samples were found to be Listeria spp.-positive and 38% L. monocytogenes-positive when the MPN-method was used. Population levels ranged from 10 to 580 cfu/g (Listeria spp.-positive samples) and from 10 to 270 cfu/g (L. monocytogenes-positive samples) for the colony count method. The MPN-method yielded population levels of 3.6 to 930 MPN/g for Listeria spp.-positive samples and 3.6 to 150 MPN/g for L. monocytogenes-positive samples. L. monocytogenes strains isolated using the colony count method belonged to the following serovars: 1/2a (46%), 1/2b (13%), 1/2c (33%), 3b (4%) and 4c (4%). A similar serovar isolation pattern was found for L. monocytogenes-positive MPN-tubes. The most common serotype was 1/2a (43%), followed by 1/2c (32%) and 1/2b (14%). The serotypes 3c, 4b and 4c were all isolated 4% of the time.
12502269,0,2002,Genome,Fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping of Avena sativa L. cv. SunII and its monosomic lines using cloned repetitive DNA sequences.,Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) employing multiple probes was used with mitotic or meiotic chromosome spreads of Avena sativa L. cv. SunII and its monosomic lines to produce physical chromosome maps. The probes used were Avena strigosa pAs120a (which hybridizes exclusively to A-genome chromosomes), Avena murphyi pAm1 (which hybridizes exclusively to C-genome chromosomes), A. strigosa pAs121 (which hybridizes exclusively to A- and D-genome chromosomes), and the wheat rDNA probes pTa71 and pTa794. Simultaneous and sequential FISH employing two-by-two combinations of these probes allowed the unequivocal identification and genome assignation of all chromosomes. Ten pairs were found carrying intergenomic translocations: (i) between the A and C genomes (chromosome pair 5A); (ii) between the C and D genomes (pairs 1C, 2C, 4C, 10C, and 16C); and (iii) between the D and C genomes (pairs 9D, 11D, 13D, and 14D). The existence of a reciprocal intergenomic translocation (10C-14D) is also proposed. Comparing these results with those of other hexaploids, three intergenomic translocations (10C, 9D, and 14D) were found to be unique to A. sativa cv. SunII, supporting the view that 'SunII' is genetically distinct from other hexaploid Avena species and from cultivars of the A. sativa species. FISH mapping using meiotic and mitotic metaphases facilitated the genomic and chromosomal identification of the aneuploid chromosome in each monosomic line. Of the 18 analyzed, only 11 distinct monosomic lines were actually found, corresponding to 5 lines of the A genome, 2 lines of the C genome, and 4 lines of the D genome. The presence or absence of the 10C-14D interchange was also monitored in these lines.

The syntheses of the pyrophosphates (2a-2c), as precursors for 3a-4c, are also described.
12479107,0,2002,Ai Zheng,[Diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian epithelial tumor with morphometry].,BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Morphometry for diagnosis and prognosis of tumor becomes important. This study was designed to evaluate the efficiency of morphometry for diagnosis and prognosis of the patients with ovarian epithelial tumor.METHODS: A total of 110 patients with ovarian epithelial tumor were studied by three morphometrical methods (image analysis, determination of DNA content, and quantitative analysis of AgNOR). Nuclear area (NA), nuclear perimeter (NP), nuclear form factor (NFF), DNA content (DC), DNA index (DI), percentage of DNA multiploid (P &gt; 4c), and percentage of G0/G1 phases (P2c) were determined by morphometrical instrument. AgNOR was counted under light microscope.RESULTS: (1) The results in these three groups of benign, borderline, and malignant ovarian epithelial tumors: the differences of all parameters (NA, NP, NFF, DC, DI, AgNOR counts) among these groups have a extremely significant statistical difference (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.001). (2) A study on prognosis: NA, NP, and NFF between two groups of patients (survival &gt; or = 5 years and &lt; 5 years) with ovarian epithelial carcinoma have a significant difference(P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01), this means different results of image analysis indicate different survival. AgNOR counts have a close correlation with month of the survivors (r = -0.73, P &lt; 0.001). The P &gt; 4c had a relation to month of survivors (r = -0.75, P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Morphometry can provide reliable parameters for diagnosis and prognosis of the patients with different kinds of ovarian epithelial tumors.
12472241,0,2002,J Orthop Res,Excessive degradation of type II collagen in articular cartilage in equine osteochondrosis.,Articular osteochondrosis (OCD) occurs in both man and animals. The etiology remains to be determined. Studies of OCD lesions in animals may provide clues as to its pathogenesis. The aim of our study was to determine whether there was evidence for increased degradation namely proteoglycan (PG) release and type II collagen cleavage in articular cartilage harvested from OCD lesions. We examined ex vivo explants at post-mortem from equine OCD lesions and macroscopically normal site and age matched cartilage. These were cultured over a 10 day period in serum-free medium. Type II collagen cleavage was measured in articular cartilage and media using an Elisa assay to detect the COL2-3/4C(short) epitope, which is generated on cleavage of the triple helix of type II collagen by collagenases. PG release was measured by a dye-binding assay. Cumulative release of PG and COL2-3/4C(short) and their contents in cartilage at the end of the culture period were determined. In OCD lesions there was a significant increase in type II collagen cleavage by collagenase but no evidence for increase of PG degradation. These findings point to a selective increase in type II collagen cleavage by collagenases, in OCD lesions of the kind observed in osteoarthritis. Further work is needed to determine whether changes represent primary or secondary events in the pathogenesis of OCD.
12469216,0,2002,Int J Mol Med,The kinesin superfamily protein Rab6KIFL is not involved in the pathophysiology of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C.,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C (CMT4C) is an autosomal recessive peripheral neuropathy reported in several Algerian families. The gene locus of this disease has been narrowed to 5q31-33. Recently, a missense mutation in the gene for the kinesin superfamily KIF1B was reported as the cause of Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A). We suspected that Rab6KIFL, one of the kinesin superfamily proteins, might be involved in the pathophysiology of CMT4C, because Rab6KIFL gene is located in 5q31. The coding regions of the Rab6KIFL gene of genomic DNA derived from one Algerian family with CMT4C were analyzed by direct sequencing. No mutation in Rab6KIFL gene was found in this family. Further investigation is necessary to identify the causative gene for CMT4C.
12433495,0,2002,Carbohydr Res,Potential energy surfaces of carrageenan models: carrabiose, beta-(1 --&gt; 4)-linked D-galactobiose, and their sulfated derivatives.,The adiabatic conformational surfaces of several beta-linked disaccharides, which correspond to the repeating structures of carrageenans, were calculated using the MM3 force-field. The studies were carried out on the disaccharide beta-D-Galp-(1 --&gt; 4)-alpha-D-Galp and eight sulfated derivatives, as well as on carrabiose (beta-D-Galp-(1 --&gt; 4)-3,6-An-alpha-D-Galp) and five sulfated derivatives. The presence of 3,6-anhydrogalactose does not change the main features of the maps, although it increases the flexibility of the glycosidic linkage. Sulfation neither produces a striking effect on the map shape, nor a shift on the global minimum, which always remains with psi (theta(C-1'-O-4-C-4C-5)) in trans orientation, and phi (theta(O-5'-C-1'-O-4-C-4)) with a value close to -80 degrees. This effect differs from that occurring on the alpha linkage of equivalent disaccharides, for which the sulfation pattern on the beta-galactose unit shifts the global minima to different positions. A reduction in the flexibility (originated in a deepening of the global minimum well) is observed by sulfation on position 2 of the beta-D-galactose unit, and by sulfation of position 6 of the alpha-D-galactose unit (when the beta-D-galactose unit is 4-sulfated). Within the compounds containing 3,6-anhydrogalactose, the effect of sulfation is even less noticeable. The calculated low-energy regions on carrabiose derivatives agree with X-ray diffraction data on carrageenan fibers and on peracetylated carrabiose dimethyl acetal, and with NOE calculations carried out on kappa-carrabiose.
12433494,0,2002,Carbohydr Res,Crystal structure of penta-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranose with modeling of the conformation of the acetate groups.,The crystal structure of penta-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranose was determined with Mo K(alpha) radiation at 150 K to R = 0.029. The space group is P2(1)2(1)2(1), and the unit cell dimensions are, a = 8.348, b = 9.021 and c = 25.418 A. The ring has the usual 4C(1) shape and O-6 is in the tg position as frequently observed for sugars having the axial galacto configuration at C-4. Conformations of the acetate groups were compared with those from the literature. Nearly eclipsed, 'Z' conformations are found for the ester moieties, and the torsion angles for the sequence involving the ring hydrogen, carbon, alkoxy oxygen and carbonyl carbon for both 1 and related compounds are eclipsed-to-gauche. Orientations and conformations of the acetate substituents were modeled with both MM3 molecular mechanics and various levels of quantum mechanics theory. Higher levels of theory and more complete models provided better prediction of the experimental observations.
12433402,0,2002,Hear Res,Non-linear response to amplitude-modulated waves in the apical turn of the guinea pig cochlea.,Mechanical vibrations of the Hensen's cells were measured in the apical turn of the cochlea in living guinea pigs, in response to amplitude-modulated (AM) sound. The FFT of the input wave consisted of spectral components at the carrier frequency C and two sidebands (C+/-M) separated from the carrier by the modulation frequency M. The FFT of the velocity response consisted of components at: (i) the modulation frequency M, and harmonics n M; (ii) Carrier frequency C and sidebands (C+/-n M); (iii) harmonics of the carrier frequency and their side bands (2C+/-n M); (3C+/-n M); (4C+/-n M); em leader n=1,2,3, em leader,10. The carrier and the first pair of side bands were broadly tuned and nearly linear. Other components were sharply tuned and highly non-linear, suggesting a different origin. Evidence is presented that these components are generated in the non-linear stereocilia dynamics. An important function of this non-linearity is to demodulate the AM wave to extract information contained in the modulation.

Novel lactonization of 4-aryl-5-tosyloxypentanoates and 4-aryl-5-tosyloxyhexanoates concomitant with a phenyl rearrangement.,The novel lactonizations of methyl 4-aryl-5-tosyloxypentanoate 1 and 4-aryl-5-tosyloxyhexanoate 3 concomitant with a phenyl rearrangement are reported. The lactonizations were promoted by silica gel or heating in various solvents. By examining the effects of substituents of the aromatic ring on the reactivity, it was found that the reaction proceeded via a phenonium ion. This finding was supported by the stereochemical results for the lactonization of optical active 1. Silica gel-promoted lactonization of 1 gave only gamma-lactone 2, whereas that of 3 afforded gamma-lactone 4 and delta-lactone 5. These lactonizations proved to be kinetically controlled. On the other hand, when 3c was heated in CH(3)NO(2) at 70 degrees C, the highly selective formation of 4c was observed. Further detailed experiments confirmed that the thermal lactonization in CH(3)NO(2) was thermodynamically controlled.
12204609,0,2002,Carbohydr Res,Synthesis and characterization of 4,6-O-butylidene-N-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine: crystal structures of 4,6-O-butylidene-alpha-D-glucopyranose, 4,6-O-butylidene-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine and 4,6-O-butylidene-N-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine.,4,6-O-Butylidene-N-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine was synthesized and characterized using analytical, spectral and single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. 1H and 13C NMR studies showed the presence of the beta-anomer, which has also been confirmed by the crystal structure. The molecular structure of this compound showed the presence of the tridentate ONO ligation-core. Both precursors, 4,6-O-butylidene-alpha-D-glucopyranose and 4,6-O-butylidene-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine were characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction. The alpha-anomeric nature of the former and beta-anomeric nature of the latter were proposed based on 1H NMR studies and were confirmed by determining the crystal structures. In addition, the crystal structure of 4,6-O-butylidene-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine revealed the C-1-N-glycosylation. In all the three molecules, the saccharide unit exhibits a 4C(1) chair conformation. In the lattice, the molecules are connected by hydrogen-bond interactions. The conformation of 4,6-O-butylidene-N-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine is stabilized via an O-H...N intramolecular interaction, and each molecule in the lattice interacts with three neighboring molecules through hydrogen bonds of the type O-H...O and C-H...O.
12201765,0,2002,J Org Chem,Synthesis of [1,3]dithiole and spiro[1,3]dithiole thiopyran derivatives of the [1,2]dithiolo[1,4]thiazine ring system.,We report the synthesis of some new polysulfur-nitrogen heterocycles by cycloaddition reactions to readily available tricyclic condensed 1,2-dithiole-3-thiones. Thus, treatment of bis[1,2]dithiolopyrrole ketothione 1 with diacyl acetylenes gave the bis-aducts 2a-d. On the other hand, cycloaddition of bis[1,2]dithiolo[1,4]thiazine ketothione 3 with 1 equiv of acyl or diacyl acetylenes gave [1,3]dithiolylidenyl[1,2]dithiolo[1,4]thiazines 4a-f in fair to high yields. Catalysis by scandium triflate was used in the reactions that implied the less reactive dipolarophiles. Treatment of 3 with 2 equiv of DBA gave the bis-aduct 5a, and reaction of 4c with DMAD gave the mixed bis-adduct 5b. Cyclic voltammetry of selected examples showed irreversible processes that were influenced by the electrochemical activity of peripheral groups bonded to the heterocyclic system.
12152792,0,2002,Eur J Histochem,Behaviour of ribosomal genes and nucleolar domains during activation in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) root primordia: from the unsoaked quiescent state to the steady state of proliferation.,Changes in the organisation of ribosomal genes and nucleolar protein components were analysed in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L. cv Cristalina) from the time the quiescent primordia of the radical bands of nodes were stimulated to proliferate by water imbibition, until the meristematic population reached the steady state of proliferation in the growing roots. The kinetics of proliferation was evaluated by flow cytometry, and by the mitotic indexes, in roots of different lengths. All the quiescent cells were in a pre-replicative state (G0), with a 2C DNA content. During their activation process, they progressively reached the steady state of proliferation (mitotic index 7%), with rather fixed frequencies for cells with 2C (G1), 4C (G2), and values between them corresponding to cells replicating their DNA. Decondensation of the ribosomal genes was followed by FISH with probes for the major 25S and 18S rRNAs, and variations in the numbers of nucleoli were recorded in squashed cells after silver staining. The ultrastructure of nucleoli was analysed by electron microscopy, using the EDTA regressive staining for ribonucleoproteins. Quiescent nucleoli showed a clear segregation of their main components: Fibrillar Centre, Dense Fibrillar Component and Cajal's bodies while lacked any Granular Component. However the proliferating ones showed them highly intermingled, except for the Cajal's bodies. Our results revealed a high plasticity of the nucleolar domains in response to cell activation, and allowed to establish a correlation between dispersion of NORs with formation of small fibrillar centers and a nucleolus with all its domains intermingled, and the activation of cell proliferation during root sprouting.

12071321,0,2002,Braz J Biol,African dung beetle Onthophagus gazella Fabricius (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) esterase isozymes.,African beetles Onthophagus gazella from both sexes were analyzed by electrophoresis for an investigation of esterase isozymes using alpha-naphthyl propionate and methylumbelliferyl propionate as substrates. Only one of the esterases (Est. 6) reacted with one of the substrates (alpha-naphthyl propionate). Six areas of activity were found, two of them being polymorphic (Est. 3 and Est. 4). For presence of Est. 3, 337 individuals were analyzed, including descendants of 32 controlled crossings: two alleles were identified, whose frequencies are Est. 3A = 0.447 and Est. 3B = 0.553. The population is in equilibrium for this locus (qui-square = 4.18; 0.2 &gt; P &gt; 0.1). For Est. 4, 338 individuals, descendants of 32 controlled crossings, were analysed. In this case, three alleles were identified whose frequencies are: Est. 4A = 0.277; Est. 4B = 0.661; and Est. 4C = 0.062. The population is not in equilibrium for this locus (qui-square = 40.259; p &lt; 0.001). Two esterases were detected only in the pupal stage and another one in larvae. Of the 23 loci analyzed in these insects up to now, 3 are polymorphic (13%), which indicates very low variability in the population here studied.

The compounds were tested in vitro for inhibitory activity toward rat and human 5 alpha-reductase isozymes 1 and 2 at a concentration of 10 microM.

12039541,0,2002,Carbohydr Res,Synthesis of C-glycopyranosylphloroacetophenone derivatives and their anomerization facilitated by 1,3-diaxial interactions.,The reaction of 2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl fluoride, 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-alpha-D-allopyranosyl fluoride, and 2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl-alpha-L-fucopyranosyl fluoride with 2,4-di-O-benzylphloroacetophenone, in the presence of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate, afforded, respectively, the corresponding 3-C-beta-D-glycopyranosylphloroacetophenone derivatives exclusively in anomerically pure form. Alternatively, the reaction of 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-alpha-D-gulopyranosyl fluoride with 2,4-di-O-benzylphloroacetophenone afforded both the 3-C-beta-D-gulopyranosylphloroacetophenone derivative (4C(1) conformation) as the major product and the 3-C-alpha-D-gulopyranosylphloroacetophenone derivative (1C(4) conformation) as the minor product under identical conditions. Including the previously prepared C-glycosylphloroacetophenone derivatives that contain 3-C-beta-D-glucosyl, 3-C-beta-D-xylosyl, 3-C-beta-2-deoxy-D-arabino-hexosyl, 3-C-beta-D-galactosyl, 3-C-beta-L-arabinosyl, and 3-C-alpha-L-arabinosyl moieties, the conformation is dictated primarily by the preference of the bulky aromatic aglycon to orient equatorially, due to the strong repulsion of the aglycon. The anomerization is directed secondarily by the presence of 1,3-diaxial interactions in the sugar moiety.
12010042,0,2002,J Am Chem Soc,Amplification of screening sensitivity through selective destruction: theory and screening of a library of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.,A new method for identifying enzyme inhibitors is to conduct their synthesis in the presence of the targeted enzyme. Good inhibitors form in larger amounts than poorer ones because the binding either speeds up synthesis (target-accelerated synthesis) or shifts the synthesis equilibrium (dynamic combinatorial libraries). Several groups have successfully demonstrated this approach with simple systems, but application to larger libraries is challenging because of the need to accurately measure the amount of each inhibitor. In this report, we dramatically simplify this analysis by adding a reaction that destroys the unbound inhibitors. This works similar to a kinetic resolution, with the best inhibitor being the last one remaining. We demonstrate this method for a static library of several sulfonamide inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase. Four sulfonamide-containing dipeptides, EtOC-Phe(sa)-Phe (4a), EtOC-Phe(sa)-Gly (4b), EtOC-Phe(sa)-Leu (4c) and EtOC-Phe(sa)-Pro (4d), were prepared and their inhibition constants measured. These inhibitors migrated to the carbonic anhydrase compartment of a two-compartment vessel. Although higher concentrations of the better inhibitors were observed in the carbonic anhydrase compartment, the concentration differences were small (1.83:1.71:1.54:1.46:1 for 4a:4b:4c:4d:5, where 5 is a noninhibiting dipeptide EtOC-Phe-Phe). Addition of a protease rapidly cleaved the weaker inhibitors (4d and 5). Intermediate inhibitor 4c was cleaved at a slower rate, and at the end of the reaction, only 4a and 4b remained. In a separate experiment, the ratio of 4a to 4b was found to increase over time to a final ratio of nearly 4:1. This is greater than the ratio of their inhibition constants (approximately 2:1). The theoretical model predicts that these ratios would increase even further as the destruction proceeds. This removal of poorer inhibitors simplifies identification of the best inhibitor in a complex mixture.

Synthesis of pyridine and 1,3-oxazine derivatives.,Functionalized keto-enamines 6 were obtained by nucleophilic addition of enol ethers to the imine moiety of 2-azadienes derived from dehydroaspartic esters 4. Reactions of 2-azadiene 4c containing three electron-withdrawing substituents (CO(2)R) with enol ethers 5 in the presence of lithium perchlorate led to the formation of tetrahydropyridine derivatives 7 in a regio- and stereoselective fashion. 2H-[1,3]-oxazines 10 and pyridine derivatives 12 and 13 were obtained by heterocycloaddition reactions of electron-poor azadienes 4d-g containing two electron-withdrawing substituents (4-O(2)N-C(6)H(4), CO(2)R) in positions 1 and 4 with carbonyl derivatives (ethyl glyoxalate 9a and diethyl ketomalonate 9b) and the electron-deficient olefin tetracyanoethylene 11.
11904462,0,2002,Anal Cell Pathol,Topical mitomycin C and radiation induce conjunctival DNA-polyploidy.,INTRODUCTION: Atypical cell changes often occur following treatment of premalignant or malignant conjunctival neoplasias with topical mitomycin C (MMC) and/or radiation. These reactive, non-neoplastic alterations of the conjunctival epithelium can be a differential diagnostic problem. Our aim was to investigate changes in the nuclear DNA-distribution of conjunctival epithelial cells after MMC- and radiation therapy by DNA-image-cytometry.METHODS: Conjunctival brush smears were obtained from 13 patients (13 eyes) with squamous cell carcinomas and six patients (6 eyes) with conjunctival malignant melanomas in situ before, during and after treatment. The patients were treated with MMC-drops (0.02% or 0.04%) alone (n=12), with radiation therapy (n=3) or both (n=4). At first, the obtained brush smears were evaluated by cytology. Secondly, after Feulgen restaining, the DNA content of reactively changed cells was determined using the AutoCyte-QUIC-DNA workstation.RESULTS: We observed euploid DNA-polyploidy and cytomorphological changes in all patients (19/19). We considered these alterations as reactive to treatment. Four patients showed their greatest DNA-stemline at 4c and 15 patients at 8c. This effect was observed during and following MMC-drops and/or radiation and remained stable in 94% of all patients after a mean follow-up of 22.5 months (SD 15.4). In five cases image cytometry additionally demonstrated DNA-stemline aneuploidy as an evidence of tumor recurrence.CONCLUSION: Measurements of DNA-content revealed euploid polyploidisation of morphological suspicious but benign squamous cells which is the biologic correlate of well known secondary morphologic changes following topical chemotherapy and/or radiation. DNA-image-cytometry is a useful tool in the differention of euploid polyploidization as a sign of reactive cell changes following treatment and tumor recurrences.
11870795,0,2002,Lasers Surg Med,Cooling gel improves pulsed KTP laser treatment of facial telangiectasia.,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pulsed KTP lasers effectively treat facial telangiectasia without purpura production. Transient side effects following treatment include erythema, edema, and vesiculation leading to crust formation. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of an aqueous gel in reducing side effects associated with pulsed KTP laser treatment of facial telangiectasia.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with extensive facial telangiectasias were treated with a pulsed KTP laser (Versapulse, Coherent, Palo Alto, CA). The laser was used with the water cooled handpiece chilled to 4C, a 4 mm spot size, a 10-millisecond pulse duration and a fluence of 9.5 J/cm2. One side of the face was treated with the laser using the cooling handpiece alone. The other side was treated using the cooling handpiece applied to a 2-mm film of aqueous gel spread over the treatment area.RESULTS: Treatment side effects, including pain, erythema, edema, vesiculation, and crusting were scored following treatment with and without the aqueous gel. Use of the aqueous gel in conjunction with the cooling handpiece decreased the incidence and severity of pain, erythema, edema, and crusting following pulsed KTP laser treatment of facial telangiectasia. Most patients demonstrated 50-75% clearance of their telangiectasias 1 month after one treatment session, and use of the gel did not alter the treatment efficacy.CONCLUSIONS: The application of an aqueous gel during pulsed KTP laser treatment of facial telangiectasia improves treatment associated side effects without affecting vessel clearance.

11814448,0,2002,Carbohydr Res,Crystal and molecular structure of methyl 4-O-methyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--&gt;4)-beta-D-glucopyranoside.,The cellulose model compound methyl 4-O-methyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--&gt;4)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (6) was synthesised in high overall yield from methyl beta-D-cellobioside. The compound was crystallised from methanol to give colourless prisms, and the crystal structure was determined. The monoclinic space group is P2(1) with Z=2 and unit cell parameters a=6.6060 (13), b=14.074 (3), c=9.3180 (19) A, beta=108.95(3) degrees. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined to R=0.0286 for 2528 reflections. Both glucopyranoses occur in the 4C(1) chair conformation with endocyclic bond angles in the range of standard values. The relative orientation of both units described by the interglycosidic torsional angles [phi (O-5' [bond] C-1' [bond] O-4 [bond] C-4) -89.1 degrees, Phi (C-1' [bond] O-4 [bond] C-4 [bond] C-5) -152.0 degrees] is responsible for the very flat shape of the molecule and is similar to those found in other cellodextrins. Different rotamers at the exocyclic hydroxymethyl group for both units are present. The hydroxymethyl group of the terminal glucose moiety displays a gauche-trans orientation, whereas the side chain of the reducing unit occurs in a gauche-gauche conformation. The solid state (13)C NMR spectrum of compound 6 exhibits all 14 carbon resonances. By using different cross polarisation times, the resonances of the two methyl groups and C-6 carbons can easily be distinguished. Distinct differences of the C-1 and C-4 chemical shifts in the solid and liquid states are found.

They were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectrometry and X-ray crystallography (2e) which shows that the methyleneamide ligand exhibits linear (three-electron donor) geometry and behaves as a strong pi-electron acceptor. The complex (31)P[(1)H] and (1)H [NC(H)C(6)H(4)X-4] NMR patterns for the cis isomers were analyzed as ABCD and ABCDX (X part) spin systems, respectively. Complexes 1 and 2 undergo deprotonation by base to form the trans isomers of the corresponding nitrile complexes, trans-[ReCl(NCC(6)H(4)X-4)(dppe)(2)] [X = NEt(2) (3a), OMe (3b), H (3d), F (3e), or Cl (3f)] whose spectroscopic data are also presented and which on protonation give the corresponding trans isomers of the methyleneamide complexes (2).

11782181,0,2002,J Am Chem Soc,Computational assessment of the electronic structures of cyclohexa-1,2,4-triene, 1-oxacyclohexa-2,3,5-triene (3delta(2)-pyran), their benzo derivatives, and cyclohexa-1,2-diene. An experimental approach to 3delta(2)-pyran.,The six-membered cyclic allenes given in the title have been studied theoretically by means of an MR-CI approach. For all compounds, the allene structures were found to be the ground states in the gas phase. In the cases of cyclohexa-1,2-diene (1), the isobenzene 2, and the isonaphthalene 7, the most stable structures having a planar allene moiety are the diradicals 1b, 2b, and 7b, representing the transition states for the racemization of 1a, 2a, and 7a and being less stable than the latter by 14.1, 8.9, and 11.2 kcal/mol, respectively. At variance with this order, the 3delta(2)-pyran 4 and the chromene 5 have the zwitterions 4c and 5c as the most stable planar structures, which lie only 1.0 and 5.4 kcal/mol above 4a and 5a, respectively. According to the simulation of the solvent effect, 4c even becomes the ground state of 4 in THF solution. The frontier orbitals of the respective states of 2 and 4 suggest different rates and sites for the reaction with nucleophiles. For the first time, the pyran 4 has been generated and trapped. As a precursor for 4, 3-bromo-4H-pyran (9) was chosen, the synthesis of which was achieved on two routes from 4H-pyran. The treatment of 9 with potassium tert-butoxide (KOt-Bu)/18-crown-6 gave 4-tert-butoxy-4H-pyran as the only discernible product, whether styrene or furan was present, indicating the interception of 4 by KOt-Bu. Finally, the disagreement between the experiment and the theory concerning the heat of formation and the electronic nature of the isobenzene 2 is resolved by demonstrating that the experimental data can provide only an upper limit of the DeltaH(f) degrees value.
11770588,0,2002,Obstet Gynecol,Septicemia due to multiple biotypes of Escherichia coli.,BACKGROUND: Polymicrobial bacteremias with different biotypes of the same organism have not been reported as a cause of bacteremia in any patient.CASE: A 37-year-old gravida had a cesarean delivery performed after a failed vacuum extraction. On the second postoperative day, she developed a septicemia with temperature to 39.4C. Three different biotypes of Escherichia coli with different antibiotic susceptibilities were isolated from her blood. A fourth biotype was isolated from the urinary and genital tracts; therefore, the source of her bacteremia was not apparent. She was treated successfully with cefoxitin and gentamicin.CONCLUSION: Accurate selection of colonies from microbiological isolation plates allowed identification of four different E. coli biotypes (three in the blood) from a bacteremic patient. Rapid identification of antibiotic susceptibility is important in such patients.
11511509,56,2001,FASEB J,Only UCP1 can mediate adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis in the cold.,Adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis may have profound effects on energy balance and is therefore therefore is a potential mechanism for counteracting the development of obesity. The molecular basis for adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis has remained a challenge that sparked acute interest with the identification of proteins (UCP2, UCP3, etc.) with high-sequence similarity to the original uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), which is localized only in brown adipose tissue. Using UCP1-ablated mice, we examined whether any adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis could be recruited by acclimation to cold. Remarkably, by successive acclimation, the UCP1-ablated mice could be made to subsist for several weeks at 4C during which they had to constantly produce heat at four times their resting levels. Despite these extreme requirements for adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis, however, no substitution of shivering by any adaptive nonshivering thermogenic process occurred. Thus, although the existence of, for example, muscular mechanisms for adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis has recurrently been implied, we did not find any indication of such thermogenesis. Not even during prolonged and enhanced demand for extra heat production was any endogenous hormone or neurotransmitter able to recruit any UCP1-independent adaptive nonshivering thermogenic process in muscle or in any other organ, and no proteins other than UCP1-not even UCP2 or UCP3-therefore have the ability to mediate adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis in the cold.
11427601,33,2001,J Clin Microbiol,Correlations between molecular subtyping and serotyping of Listeria monocytogenes.,To define relationships between Listeria monocytogenes genetic lineages, ribotypes, and serotypes, 235 L. monocytogenes isolates were characterized by serotyping and automated EcoRI ribotyping. Genetic lineage predicted the following serovar clusters: lineage I, comprising serotypes 1/2b, 3b, 3c, and 4b; lineage II, comprising serotypes 1/2a, 1/2c, and 3a; and lineage III, comprising serotypes 4a and 4c. Some EcoRI ribotypes contained multiple serotypes; a subset of these isolates was further differentiated with PvuII ribotyping. Of the 12 resultant EcoRI-PvuII combination types, only 4 contained multiple serotypes, demonstrating the potential of ribotyping for serotype prediction.
11264369,28,2001,J Virol,Y2, the smallest of the Sendai virus C proteins, is fully capable of both counteracting the antiviral action of interferons and inhibiting viral RNA synthesis.,An open reading frame (ORF) overlapping the amino-terminal portion of the Sendai virus (SeV) P ORF in the +1 frame produces a nested set of carboxy-coterminal proteins, C', C, Y1, and Y2, which are referred to collectively as the C proteins. The C proteins are extremely versatile triple-role players; they counteract the antiviral action of interferons (IFNs), inhibit viral RNA synthesis, and are involved in virus assembly. In this study, we established HeLa cell lines stably expressing the C, Y1, and Y2 proteins individually and examined the capacities of these cells to circumvent the antiviral action of alpha/beta IFN (IFN-alpha/beta) and IFN-gamma and to inhibit viral transcription. The assay protocols included monitoring of IFN-alpha/beta-mediated signaling by interferon-stimulated response element-driven reporter gene expression and of the antiviral state induced by IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma and measurement of reporter gene expression from an SeV minigenome, as well as quantification of SeV primary transcripts. When necessary, the activities measured were carefully normalized to the expression levels of the respective C proteins in cells. The data obtained clearly indicate that the smallest protein, Y2, was as active as the C and Y1 proteins in both counteracting the antiviral action of IFNs and inhibiting viral transcription. The data further show that intracellular transexpression of either C, Y1, or Y2 rendered HeLa cells moderately or only poorly permissive for not only wild-type SeV but also 4C(-) SeV, which expressed none of the four C proteins. On the basis of these findings, the roles of SeV C proteins in the natural life cycle are discussed.
11490010,26,2001,J Immunol,The role of IL-4 in Heligmosomoides polygyrus-induced alterations in murine intestinal epithelial cell function.,IL-4 and IL-13 promote gastrointestinal worm expulsion, at least in part, through effects on nonlymphoid cells, such as intestinal epithelial cells. The role of IL-4/IL-13 in the regulation of intestinal epithelial function during Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Hp) infection was investigated in BALB/c mice infected with Hp or treated with a long-lasting formulation of recombinant mouse IL-4/alphaIL-4 complexes (IL-4C) for 7 days. Separate groups of BALB/c mice were drug-cured of initial infection and later reinfected and treated with anti-IL-4R mAb, an antagonist of IL-4 and IL-13 receptor binding, or with a control mAb. Segments of jejunum were mounted in Ussing chambers, and short circuit current responses to acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, PGE2, and glucose were determined. Although only modest changes in epithelial cell function were observed during primary Hp infection, IL-4C or a secondary Hp infection each induced more dramatic changes, including increased mucosal permeability, reduced sodium-linked glucose absorption, and increased Cl- secretory response to PGE2. Some, but not all, effects of IL-4C and Hp infection were dependent on enteric nerves. Hp-induced changes in epithelial function were attenuated or prevented by anti-IL-4R mAb. Thus, IL-4/IL-13 mediate many of the effects of Hp infection on intestinal epithelial cell function and do so both through direct effects on epithelial cells and through indirect, enteric nerve-mediated prosecretory effects. These immune system-independent effector functions of IL-4/IL-13 may be important for host protection against gastrointestinal nematodes.
11331389,24,2001,J Neurosci,Layer-specific input to distinct cell types in layer 6 of monkey primary visual cortex.,Layer 6 of monkey V1 contains a physiologically and anatomically diverse population of excitatory pyramidal neurons. Distinctive arborization patterns of axons and dendrites within the functionally specialized cortical layers define eight types of layer 6 pyramidal neurons and suggest unique information processing roles for each cell type. To address how input sources contribute to cellular function, we examined the laminar sources of functional excitatory input onto individual layer 6 pyramidal neurons using scanning laser photostimulation. We find that excitatory input sources correlate with cell type. Class I neurons with axonal arbors selectively targeting magnocellular (M) recipient layer 4Calpha receive input from M-dominated layer 4B, whereas class I neurons whose axonal arbors target parvocellular (P) recipient layer 4Cbeta receive input from P-dominated layer 2/3. Surprisingly, these neuronal types do not differ significantly in the inputs they receive directly from layers 4Calpha or 4Cbeta. Class II cells, which lack dense axonal arbors within layer 4C, receive excitatory input from layers targeted by their local axons. Specifically, type IIA cells project axons to and receive input from the deep but not superficial layers. Type IIB neurons project to and receive input from the deepest and most superficial, but not middle layers. Type IIC neurons arborize throughout the cortical layers and tend to receive inputs from all cortical layers. These observations have implications for the functional roles of different layer 6 cell types in visual information processing.
11696815,21,2001,J Urol,Characterization and functional relevance of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase isoenzymes of the human prostate.,PURPOSE: Current pharmacological concepts in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia are aimed at the static and dynamic component of the disease. Mainly alpha-blocking agents are used to reduce the adrenergic tone of prostatic myocytes, thus, increasing urine flow through the prostatic urethra by reducing urethral resistance. With the introduction of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 inhibitor sildenafil the concept of PDE inhibition has gained tremendous interest in the field of urology. We characterized PDE isoenzymes from human prostatic tissue by molecular biology and protein chemistry, and investigated the effects of various PDE inhibitors compared with standard pharmacological agents on adrenergic tension in isolated human prostatic strips.MATERIALS AND METHODS: PDE isoenzymes were characterized by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and anion exchange chromatography. Using the organ bath technique we determined the relaxing effects of the PDE inhibitors papaverine, vinpocetine (Biomol GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), erythro-9-[2-hydrox-3-nonyl]adenine hydrochloride (Tocris Cookson, Ltd., Bristol, United Kingdom) rolipram (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany), zaprinast (Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, Ltd., Dagenham, United Kingdom) and sildenafil (Pfizer, Ltd., Sandwich, United Kingdom), the adenylate cyclase activating agent forskolin (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, Ohio) and the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside on adrenergic tension in prostatic strips isolated from the transition zone.RESULTS: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed messenger RNA transcripts encoding for PDE 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 in the various anatomical regions of the human prostate, including the peripheral, central and transition zones. Except for complementary DNA encoding for PDE 1C, complementary DNA fragments encoding for PDE 1A, 1B, 2A, 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 5A, 7A, 8A, 9A and 10A were found at almost even ratios in the different histological regions of the prostate. The hydrolytic activities of PDE 4 and 5 were present in the cytosolic fraction of prostatic tissue, whereas in the particulate fraction only the hydrolytic activity of PDE 4 was detected. Adrenergic tension in prostatic strip preparations was reversed by forskolin, sodium nitroprusside, and inhibitors of PDE 4 and 5.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the presence and functional relevance of PDE isoenzymes 4 and 5 in human prostatic tissue. These studies support the possible use of inhibitors of PDE 4 and 5 for treating urinary obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia.
11545613,21,2001,Mol Ther,An adenovirus with enhanced infectivity mediates molecular chemotherapy of ovarian cancer cells and allows imaging of gene expression.,The adenovirus (Ad) is a useful vector for cancer gene therapy due to its unparalleled gene transfer efficiency to dividing and quiescent cells. Primary cancer cells, however, often have highly variable or low levels of the requisite coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR). Also, assessment of gene transfer and vector persistence has been logistically difficult in human clinical trials. We describe here two novel bicistronic adenoviral (Ad) vectors, AdTKSSTR and RGDTKSSTR, which contain the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (TK) for molecular chemotherapy and bystander effect. In addition, the viruses contain the human somatostatin receptor subtype-2 gene (SSTR2), the expression of which can be noninvasively imaged. We enhanced the infectivity of RGDTKSSTR by genetically incorporating the RGD-4C motif into the HI-loop of the fiber. This allows the virus to circumvent CAR deficiency by binding to alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(v)beta(5) integrins, which are highly expressed on most ovarian cancers. The expanded tropism of RGDTKSSTR results in increased infectivity of purified primary ovarian cancer cells and allows enhanced gene transfer in the presence of malignant ascites containing anti-Ad antibodies. RGDTKSSTR may be a useful agent for treating ovarian cancer in clinical trials.
11325988,21,2001,J Clin Microbiol,Hepatitis C virus genotyping based on 5' noncoding sequence analysis (Trugene).,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotyping of samples from 184 patients with chronic HCV infection by the Trugene 5'NC genotyping kit, based on sequence analysis of the 5' noncoding region (5' NCR), and the InnoLiPA assay was evaluated. In addition to these methods, the 184 samples were also analyzed by sequencing of part of the NS5B of the HCV genome after in-house PCR amplification, as a means of validating results obtained with the 5' NCR. The distribution of the genotypes typed by NS5B sequence analysis was as follows: 1a, 41 samples; 1b, 58 samples; 1d, 1 sample; 2a, 5 samples; 2b, 2 samples; 2c, 7 samples; 3a, 46 samples; 4a, 7 samples; 4c, 1 samples; 4e, 9 samples; 5a, 6 samples; 6a, 1 sample. The Trugene and InnoLiPA assays gave concordant results within HCV types in 100% of cases. The ability to discriminate at the subtype level was 76 and 74% for the Trugene and the InnoLiPA assays, respectively.
11297260,21,2001,Clin Cancer Res,Combined targeting of adenoviruses to integrins and epidermal growth factor receptors increases gene transfer into primary glioma cells and spheroids.,Adenoviral-mediated gene transfer is suboptimal in human glioma and limits in vivo gene therapy approaches. There is a need for targeted vectors able to enhance gene transfer into the tumor as well as to lower the viral load in the surrounding normal tissues. We evaluated primary human tumor samples by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence-activated cell sorter for expression of the Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor and other antigens with potential utility to redirect adenoviruses (Ads) to gliomas. In the majority of the samples, Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor expression was low. This correlated with inefficient gene transfer in vitro. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and alpha(v)beta5 integrins were often highly, but heterogeneously, expressed. We hypothesized that these receptors, overexpressed in tumor but not in normal brain, could serve as independent binding sites for alternative pathways of infection with targeted Ads. We examined this, using Ads that expressed the luciferase reporter gene under the cytomegalovirus promoter. Targeting to the EGFR was performed with a single-chain bispecific antibody directed against the human EGFR and against the fiber knob of the Ad. Targeting to the alpha(v) integrins was performed by insertion of an integrin-binding sequence, RGD-4C, in the HI-loop of the Ad. Increased luciferase gene transfer in primary glioma cells was observed in 8 of 13 samples with EGFR-targeting (2-11 times enhancement; median, 6) and in all of the samples with RGD-targeting (2-42 times enhancement; median, 12). Combining the two targeting motifs further enhanced the gene transfer in primary glioma cells in an additive manner (3-56 times; median, 20). The double-targeted Ads also strongly augmented gene transfer into organotypic glioma spheroids. Conversely, gene transfer into normal brain explants was reduced dramatically using Ads targeted to the tumor. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of binding multiple ligands to the adenoviral fiber knob. These vectors have a great potential for clinical use in the context of tumors that are usually heterogeneous for target antigen expression at the single-cell level.
11714389,20,2001,Arthritis Res,Suppression of murine collagen-induced arthritis by targeted apoptosis of synovial neovasculature.,Because angiogenesis plays a major role in the perpetuation of inflammatory arthritis, we explored a method for selectively targeting and destroying new synovial blood vessels. Mice with collagen-induced arthritis were injected intravenously with phage expressing an RGD motif. In addition, the RGD peptide (RGD-4C) was covalently linked to a proapoptotic heptapeptide dimer, D(KLAKLAK)2, and was systemically administered to mice with collagen-induced arthritis. A phage displaying an RGD-containing cyclic peptide (RGD-4C) that binds selectively to the alpha(v)beta3 and alpha(v)beta5 integrins accumulated in inflamed synovium but not in normal synovium. Homing of RGD-4C phage to inflamed synovium was inhibited by co-administration of soluble RGD-4C. Intravenous injections of the RGD-4C-D(KLAKLAK)2 chimeric peptide significantly decreased clinical arthritis and increased apoptosis of synovial blood vessels, whereas treatment with vehicle or uncoupled mixture of the RGD-4C and the untargeted proapoptotic peptide had no effect. Targeted apoptosis of synovial neovasculature can induce apoptosis and suppress clinical arthritis. This form of therapy has potential utility in the treatment of inflammatory arthritis.
11327857,17,2001,Biochemistry,Solution structures and integrin binding activities of an RGD peptide with two isomers.,The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence serves as the primary integrin recognition site in extracellular matrix proteins, and peptides containing this sequence can mimic the activities of the matrix proteins. Depending on the context of the RGD sequence, an RGD-containing peptide may bind to all of the RGD-directed integrins, to a few, or to only a single one. We have previously isolated from a phage-displayed peptide library a cyclic peptide that binds avidly to the alpha(v)beta3 and alpha(v)beta5 integrins but does not bind to other closely related integrins. This peptide, ACDCRGDCFCG, exists in two natural configurations depending on internal disulfide bonding. The peptide with the 1-4; 2-3 disulfide bond arrangement accounts for most of the alpha(v) integrin binding activity, whereas the 1-3; 2-4 peptide is about 10-fold less potent. Solution structure analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance reveals an entirely different presentation of the RGD motif in the two isomers of RGD-4C. These results provide new insight into the ligand recognition specificity of integrins.
11598051,15,2001,Infect Immun,Type III secretion-dependent cell cycle block caused in HeLa cells by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli O103.,Rabbit enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) O103 induces in HeLa cells an irreversible cytopathic effect characterized by the recruitment of focal adhesions, formation of stress fibers, and inhibition of cell proliferation. We have characterized the modalities of the proliferation arrest and investigated its underlying mechanisms. We found that HeLa cells that were exposed to the rabbit EPEC O103 strain E22 progressively accumulated at 4C DNA content and did not enter mitosis. A significant proportion of the cells were able to reinitiate DNA synthesis without division, leading to 8C DNA content. This cell cycle inhibition by E22 was abrogated in mutants lacking EspA, -B, and -D and was restored by transcomplementation. In contrast, intimin and Tir mutants retained the antiproliferative effect. The cell cycle arrest was not a direct consequence of the formation of stress fibers, since their disruption by toxins during exposure to E22 did not reverse the cell cycle inhibition. Likewise, the cell cycle arrest was not dependent on the early tyrosine dephosphorylation events triggered by E22 in the cells. Two key partner effectors controlling entry into mitosis were also investigated: cyclin B1 and the associated cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). Whereas cyclin B1 was not detectably affected in E22-exposed cells, Cdk1 was maintained in a tyrosine-phosphorylated inactive state and lost its affinity for p13(suc1)-agarose beads. This shows that Cdk1 is implicated in the G2/M arrest caused by EPEC strain E22.
11594685,13,2001,Antivir Chem Chemother,Inhibition of HIV infection by CXCR4 and CCR5 chemokine receptor antagonists.,The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 are used as co-receptors by the T cell-tropic (X4) and macrophage-tropic (R5) HIV-1 strains, respectively, for entering their host cells. Viral entry can be inhibited by the natural ligands for CXCR4, the CXC chemokine SDF-1 and CCR5, the CC chemokines RANTES, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta. Several peptidic compounds, T22 (an 18-mer), T134 (a 14-mer), ALX40-4C (a 9-mer) and CGP 64222 (also a 9-mer), have been identified as CXCR4 antagonists and show anti-HIV activity. Also, the HIV-1 tat protein has been described as a 'natural' CXCR4 antagonist with anti-HIV-1 activity. The most potent and specific CXCR4 antagonists are the bicyclam derivatives, which also potently block X4 HIV replication. AMD3100 has proved to be a highly specific CXCR4 antagonist, which consistently blocks the outgrowth of all X4 HIV and dual-tropic (R5/X4) variants that use CXCR4 for entering the cells (cell lines, CXCR4-transfected cell lines, lymphocytes or monocytes/ macrophages). From the bicyclam analogues, AMD3100 was selected as the clinical drug candidate, which, after initial Phase I (safety) studies, has proceeded to Phase II (efficacy) trials. The first non-peptidic compound that interacts with CCR5, and not with CXCR4, is a quaternary ammonium derivative, called TAK-779, which also has potent but variable anti-HIV activity. We believe that HIV entry/fusion inhibitors will become important new antiviral agents to combat AIDS. However, like the current clinically approved agents, they will need to be used in combinations consisting of antivirals that target other aspects of the HIV replication cycle, such as reverse transcriptase and protease, to obtain optimum therapeutic effects.
11348564,12,2001,Br J Nutr,Body fat measurement among Singaporean Chinese, Malays and Indians: a comparative study using a four-compartment model and different two-compartment models.,This cross-sectional study compared body fat percentage (BF%) obtained from a four-compartment (4C) model with BF% from hydrometry (using 2H2O), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and densitometry among the three main ethnic groups (Chinese, Malays and Indians) in Singapore, and determined the suitability of two-compartment (2C) models as surrogate methods for assessing BF% among different ethnic groups. A total of 291 subjects (108 Chinese, seventy-six Malays, 107 Indians) were selected to ensure an adequate representation of age range (18-75 years) and BMI range (16-40 kg/m2) of the general adult population, with almost equal numbers from each gender group. Body weight was measured, together with body height, total body water by 2H2O dilution, densitometry with Bodpod and bone mineral content with Hologic QDR-4500. BF% measurements with a 4C model for the subgroups were: Chinese females 33.5 (sd 7.5), Chinese males 24.4 (sd 6.1), Malay females 37.8 (sd 6.3), Malay males 26.0 (sd 7.6), Indian females 38.2 (sd 7.0), Indian males 28.1 (sd 5.5). Differences between BF% measured by the 4C and 2C models (hydrometry, DXA and densitometry) were found, with underestimation of BF% in all the ethnic-gender groups by DXA of 2.1-4.2 BF% and by densitometry of 0.5-3.2 BF%). On a group level, the differences in BF% between the 4C model and 2H2O were the lowest (0.0-1.4 BF% in the different groups), while differences between the 4C model and DXA were the highest. Differences between the 4C model and 2H2O and between the 4C model and DXA were positively correlated with the 4C model, water fraction (f(water)) of fat-free mass (FFM) and the mineral fraction (f(mineral)) of FFM, and negatively correlated with density of the FFM (D(FFM)), while the difference between 4C model and densitometry correlated with these variables negatively and positively respectively (i.e. the correlations were opposite). The largest contributors to the observed differences were f(water) and D(FFM). When validated against the reference 4C model, 2C models were found to be unsuitable for accurate measurements of BF% at the individual level, owing to the high errors and violation of assumptions of constant hydration of FFM and D(FFM) among the ethnic groups. On a group level, the best 2C model for measuring BF% among Singaporeans was found to be 2H2O.
11405645,11,2001,J Med Chem,Transformation of a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist to a kappa-agonist by transfer of a guanidinium group from the 5'- to 6'-position of naltrindole.,The importance of the indole scaffold of GNTI 3 in directing its address (5'-guanidinium group) to associate with the Glu297 residue of the kappa-opioid receptor was investigated by the synthesis and biological evaluation of its 4'- (4a), 6'- (4b), and 7'- (4c) regioisomers. The finding that only the 5'-regioisomer (GNTI) possessed potent kappa-opioid antagonist activity and high affinity at kappa-receptors illustrates the importance of the 5'-position in orienting the guanidinium group to the proper recognition locus (Glu 297) for potent kappa-antagonist activity. The discovery that the 6'-regioisomer of GNTI was a potent kappa-agonist, together with the results of site-directed mutagenesis studies that are consistent with association between the 6'-guanidinium group and Glu297, suggest that the transition from an inactive to an active state of the kappa-receptor involves a conformational change of TM6. We propose that association of the 6'-guanidinium group of 4b with Glu297 promotes axial rotational motion of transmembrane helix VI which leads to receptor activation via a conformational change of inner loop 3.
11709165,9,2001,Structure,Catalytic mechanisms and reaction intermediates along the hydrolytic pathway of a plant beta-D-glucan glucohydrolase.,BACKGROUND: Barley beta-D-glucan glucohydrolases represent family 3 glycoside hydrolases that catalyze the hydrolytic removal of nonreducing glucosyl residues from beta-D-glucans and beta-D-glucooligosaccharides. After hydrolysis is completed, glucose remains bound in the active site.RESULTS: When conduritol B epoxide and 2', 4'-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-glucopyranoside are diffused into enzyme crystals, they displace the bound glucose and form covalent glycosyl-enzyme complexes through the Odelta1 of D285, which is thereby identified as the catalytic nucleophile. A nonhydrolyzable S-glycosyl analog, 4(I), 4(III), 4(V)-S-trithiocellohexaose, also diffuses into the active site, and a S-cellobioside moiety positions itself at the -1 and +1 subsites. The glycosidic S atom of the S-cellobioside moiety forms a short contact (2.75 A) with the Oepsilon2 of E491, which is likely to be the catalytic acid/base. The glucopyranosyl residues of the S-cellobioside moiety are not distorted from the low-energy 4C(1) conformation, but the glucopyranosyl ring at the +1 subsite is rotated and translated about the linkage.CONCLUSIONS: X-ray crystallography is used to define the three key intermediates during catalysis by beta-D-glucan glucohydrolase. Before a new hydrolytic event begins, the bound product (glucose) from the previous catalytic reaction is displaced by the incoming substrate, and a new enzyme-substrate complex is formed. The second stage of the hydrolytic pathway involves glycosidic bond cleavage, which proceeds through a double-displacement reaction mechanism. The crystallographic analysis of the S-cellobioside-enzyme complex with quantum mechanical modeling suggests that the complex might mimic the oxonium intermediate rather than the enzyme-substrate complex.
11502813,9,2001,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,Relevant cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoforms in human pituitary: effect of Gs(alpha) mutations.,Both cAMP production by adenylyl cyclase and cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterases account for intracellular cAMP levels. We previously demonstrated an increased phosphodiesterase activity in GH-secreting adenomas bearing the gsp oncogene. Here we characterize both the activity and the expression of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase genes in the human pituitary and in gsp+ and gsp- GH-secreting adenomas and analyze the impact of this intracellular feedback mechanism on the levels of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation. Normal pituitary and gsp- GH-secreting adenomas showed similar phosphodiesterase activities, and 7-fold higher levels were observed in gsp+ tumors. In these tumors the increased activity was mainly owing to isobutyl-methyl-xanthine-sensitive phosphodiesterase 4 and to isobutyl-methyl-xanthine-insensitive isoforms. By semiquantitative RT-PCR, all phosphodiesterase 4 transcripts were expressed in the normal and tumoral pituitary. However, the levels of phosphodiesterase 4C and 4D messenger RNAs were significantly higher in gsp+ than in gsp- GH-secreting adenomas and normal pituitary. Expression of the thyroid-specific isobutyl-methyl-xanthine-insensitive phosphodiesterase 8B was absent in the normal pituitary but detectable in almost all GH-secreting adenomas and higher in gsp+ (P &lt; 0.02). Therefore, this study provides a characterization of phosphodiesterase expression in human pituitary and demonstrates a dramatic induction of the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases 4C and phosphodiesterases 4D and phosphodiesterases 8B in gsp+ GH-secreting adenomas. Similar levels of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation were observed in gsp- and gsp+ GH-secreting adenomas; however, phosphodiesterase blockade caused an increase in cAMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation that was significantly higher in gsp+ than in gsp- adenomas. Because cAMP-responsive element-binding protein represents the principal end point of the cAMP pathway, these results suggest that the enhanced phosphodiesterase activity may have a significant impact on the phenotypic expression of gsp mutations.
11550174,7,2001,J Comp Neurol,Effects of experimental strabismus on the architecture of macaque monkey striate cortex.,Strabismus, a misalignment of the eyes, results in a loss of binocular visual function in humans. The effects are similar in monkeys, where a loss of binocular convergence onto single cortical neurons is always found. Changes in the anatomical organization of primary visual cortex (V1) may be associated with these physiological deficits, yet few have been reported. We examined the distributions of several anatomical markers in V1 of two experimentally strabismic Macaca nemestrina monkeys. Staining patterns in tangential sections were related to the ocular dominance (OD) column structure as deduced from cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining. CO staining appears roughly normal in the superficial layers, but in layer 4C, one eye's columns were pale. Thin, dark stripes falling near OD column borders are evident in Nissl-stained sections in all layers and in immunoreactivity for calbindin, especially in layers 3 and 4B. The monoclonal antibody SMI32, which labels a neurofilament protein found in pyramidal cells, is reduced in one eye's columns and absent at OD column borders. The pale SMI32 columns are those that are dark with CO in layer 4. Gallyas staining for myelin reveals thin stripes through layers 2-5; the dark stripes fall at OD column centers. All these changes appear to be related to the loss of binocularity in cortical neurons, which has its most profound effects near OD column borders.
11375057,7,2001,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,Biological and genetic characterization of a human immunodeficiency virus strain resistant to CXCR4 antagonist T134.,The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 are considered to be potential targets for the inhibition of HIV-1 replication. We have reported that T134 and T140 inhibited X4 HIV-1 infection specifically because they acted as CXCR4 antagonists. In the present study, we have generated a T134-resistant virus (trHIV-1(NL4-3)) in a cell culture with gradually increasing concentrations of the compound. The EC(50) of T134 against trHIV-1(NL4-3) recovered after 145 passages was 15 times greater than that against wild-type HIV-1(NL4-3). This adapted virus was resistant to other CXCR4 antagonists, T140, AMD3100, and ALX40-4C, and SDF-1; from 10 to 145 times greater than that against wild-type HIV-1(NL4-3). On the other hand, T134, T140, and ALX40-4C were still active against AMD3100-resistant viruses (arHIV-1(018A)). The trHIV-1(NL4-3) contained the following mutations in the V3 loop of gp120: N269K, Q278T, R279K, A284V, F285L, V286Y, I288T, K290E, N293D, M294I, and Q296K; an insertion of T at 290; and Delta274-275 (SI). In addition, many other mutations were recognized in the V1, V2, and V4 domains. Thus, resistance to T134 may be the consequence of amino acid substitutions in the envelope glycoprotein of X4 HIV-1. The trHIV-1(NL4-3) could not utilize CCR5 as an HIV infection coreceptor, although many amino acid substitutions were recognized. The trHIV-1(NL4-3) acquired resistance to vMIP II, which could inhibit both X4 and R5 HIV-1 infection. However, neither the ligands of CCR5, RANTES, and MIP-1alpha, nor a CCR5 low molecular antagonist, TAK-779, were able to influence the infection of trHIV-1(NL4-3). Those results indicated that alternation of coreceptor usage of trHIV-1(NL4-3) was not induced.
11350661,7,2001,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,Safe use of the CXCR4 inhibitor ALX40-4C in humans.,ALX40-4C is a small peptide inhibitor of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 that can inhibit X4 strains of HIV-1. Prior to the discovery of chemokine receptors as the HIV coreceptors, ALX40-4C was used in phase I/II clinical trials to evaluate its therapeutic potential against HIV-1, making ALX40-4C the first anticoreceptor inhibitor to be tested in humans against HIV-1. Patients in the highest dose groups achieved ALX40-4C levels above the effective concentration of the drug for nearly the entire 1-month treatment period. ALX40-4C was well tolerated by 39 of 40 asymptomatic HIV-infected patients, despite the critical role of CXCR4 in normal development and hematopoiesis. No significant or consistent reductions in viral load were observed, but only 12 of the enrolled patients harbored virus types that used CXCR4. We also found that ALX40-4C interacts with the second extracellular loop of CXCR4 and inhibits infection exclusively by blocking direct virus-CXCR4 interactions.
11133666,7,2001,Biol Reprod,Quantitative analysis of spermatogenesis and apoptosis in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) reveals high rates of spermatogonial turnover and high spermatogenic efficiency.,Spermatogenesis is characterized by the succession in time and space of specific germ cell associations (stages). There can be a single stage (e.g., rodents and some macaques) or more than one stage (e.g., chimpanzee and human) per tubular cross section. We analyzed the organization of the seminiferous epithelium and quantified testicular germ cell production and apoptosis in a New World primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Tubule cross sections contained more than one stage, and the human six-stage system could be applied to marmoset spermatogenesis. Stereological (optical disector) analysis (n = 5) revealed high spermatogenic efficiency during meiosis and no loss of spermatids during spermiogenesis. The conversion of type A to type B spermatogonia was several-fold higher than that reported for other primates. Highest apoptotic rates were found for S-phase cells (20%) and 4C cells (15%) by flow cytometric analysis (n = 6 animals); histological analysis confirmed spermatogonial apoptosis. Haploid germ cell apoptosis was &lt;2%. Marmoset spermatogenesis is very efficient and involves substantial spermatogonial proliferation. The prime determinants of germ cell production in primates appear to be proliferation and survival of spermatogonia rather than the efficiency of meiotic divisions. Based on the organizational similarities, common marmosets could provide a new animal model for experimental studies of human spermatogenesis.
11528352,6,2001,Med Sci Sports Exerc,Comparison of the BOD POD with the four-compartment model in adult females.,PURPOSE: This study was designed to compare the accuracy and bias in estimates of total body density (Db) by hydrostatic weighing (HW) and the BOD POD, and percent body fat (%fat) by the BOD POD with the four-compartment model (4C model) in 42 adult females. Furthermore, the role of the aqueous and mineral fractions in the estimation of body fat by the BOD POD was examined.METHODS: Total body water was determined by isotope dilution ((2)H(2)0) and bone mineral was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Db and %fat were determined by the BOD POD and HW. The 4C model of Baumgartner was used as the criterion measure of body fat.RESULTS: HW Db (1.0352 g x cm(-3)) was not statistically different (P = 0.35) from BOD POD Db (1.0349 g x cm(-3)). The regression between Db by HW and the BOD POD significantly deviated from the line of identity (Db by HW = 0.90 x Db by BOD POD + 0.099; R(2) = 0.94). BOD POD %fat (28.8%) was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.01) than %fat by the 4C model (30.6%). The regression between %fat by the 4C model and the BOD POD significantly deviated from the line of identity (%fat by 4C model = 0.88 x %fat by BOD POD + 5.41%; R(2) = 0.92). BOD POD Db and %fat showed no bias across the range of fatness. Only the aqueous fraction of the fat-free mass (FFM) had a significant correlation with the difference in %fat between the 4C model and the BOD POD.CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the BOD POD underpredicted body fat as compared with the 4C model, and the aqueous fraction of the FFM had a significant effect on estimates of %fat by the BOD POD.
11349920,6,2001,Chemistry,Synthesis, structure, and properties of azatriangulenlenium salts.,A general synthetic route to novel nitrogen-bridged heterocyclic carbenium ions of the acridinium and triangulenium type has been developed and investigated. The synthetic method is based on nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) on the tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)carbenium ion (1) with primary amines and, by virtue of its stepwise and irreversible nature, provides a powerful tool for the preparation of a wide variety of new heterocyclic carbenium salts. Several derivatives of the three new oxygen- and/or nitrogen-bridged triangulenium salts, azadioxa- (6), diazaoxa- (7), and triazatriangulenium (4), have been synthesized and their physicochemical properties have been investigated. Crystal structures for compounds 2 b-PF6, 2 d-PF6, 4b-BF4, 4c-BF4, 6e-BF4, and 8 are reported. The different packing modes found for the triazatriagulenium salts are discussed in relation to the electrostatic and space-filling requirements of the ions. The stabilities of the cations 6a, 7b, and 4a, as expressed by their pKR+ values, have been determined in strongly basic nonaqueous solution by use of the C_ acidity function; the values obtained were 14.5, 19.4, and 23.7, respectively. This study further implied that the C_ scale in its present form is unsuitable for the precise determination of pKR+ values beyond 22.
11748291,5,2001,J Histochem Cytochem,CL316,243 and cold stress induce heterogeneous expression of UCP1 mRNA and protein in rodent brown adipocytes.,Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), the mammalian thermogenic mitochondrial protein, is found only in brown adipocytes, but its expression by immunohistochemistry is not homogeneous. Here we present evidence that the non-homogeneous pattern of immunostaining for UCP1 (referred to as the &quot;Harlequin phenomenon&quot;) is particularly evident after acute and chronic cold (4C) stimulus and after administration of a specific beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist (CL316,243). Accordingly, mRNA in situ expression confirmed the UCP1 non-homogeneous pattern of gene activation under conditions of adrenergic stimulus. Furthermore, morphometric analysis of immunogold-stained thin sections showed that UCP1-gold particle density was different among neighboring brown adipocytes with mitochondria of the same size and density. When the adrenergic stimulus was reduced in warm-acclimated animals (28C), UCP1 protein and mRNA expression was reduced and consequently the Harlequin phenomenon was barely visible. These data suggest the existence of an alternative and controlled functional recruitment of brown adipocytes in acute adrenergically stressed animals, possibly to avoid heat and metabolic damage in thermogenically active cells. Of note, the heat shock protein heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) is heterogeneously expressed in adrenergically stimulated brown adipose tissue and, specifically, cells expressing strong immunoreactivity for UCP1 also strongly express HO1.
11186131,5,2001,Pharmacogenetics,Structural characterization of a new variant of the CYP2A6 gene (CYP2A6*1B) apparently diagnosed as heterozygotes of CYP2A6*1A and CYP2A6*4C.,During the course of investigating the frequency of a CYP2A6 whole deletion-type polymorphism (CYP2A6*4C) in Japanese, an unexpectedly large population of heterozygotes for CYP2A6*4C and the wild-type (CYP2A6*1A) was found. Cloning of a cDNA encoding CYP2A6 from the liver of individuals judged as heterozygotes for CYP2A6*4C and the CYP2A6*1A was carried out to identify the causal allele(s) responsible for a possible overestimation. A clone isolated from the liver cDNA library possessed 58 bp sequences in the 3'-untranslated region, which was replaced with the corresponding region of the CYP2A7 gene. The same gene conversion existed in the genomic DNA, indicating that the replacement was not a cloning artifact. Based on the gene structure of the allele (CYP2A6*1B), this variant was thought to be one of the causal alleles responsible for overestimation of heterozygotes for CYP2A6*4C and CYP2A6* A. To investigate this further, we developed a genotyping method which could distinguish the CYP2A6*A, CYP2A6*1B and CYP2A6*4C alleles from each other. The results clearly showed that CYP2A6*1B was the sole allele responsible for the overestimation. We conclude that the new genotyping method allows determination of six genotypes of the CYP2A6 gene, simultaneously and precisely, in both Oriental and Caucasian populations.
11170632,5,2001,J Med Chem,Amino acid phosphoramidate monoesters of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine: relationship between antiviral potency and intracellular metabolism.,A series of phosphoramidate monoesters of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) bearing aliphatic amino acid methyl esters (3a, 3c, 4a, 4c, 5-7) and methyl amides (3b, 3d, 4b, 4d) was prepared and evaluated for anti-HIV-1 activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). These compounds, which showed no cytotoxicity at concentrations of 100 microM, were effective at inhibiting HIV-1 replication at concentrations of 0.08-30 microM. Since the D-phenylalanine and D-tryptophan derivatives exhibited equivalent or enhanced antiviral activity compared to their L-counterparts, there appears to be no specific stereochemical requirement for the amino acid side chain. In addition, except for the D-phenylalanine derivatives, the methyl amides had greater antiviral activity than the corresponding methyl esters. On the basis of the observed antiviral activity of AZT phosphoramidate monoesters 3a and 4a in PBMCs and CEM cells, the mechanism of action of these two compounds was investigated. AZT-MP and substantial amounts of either phosphoramidate were detected in PBMCs and CEM cells treated with either 3a or 4a. Biological mechanistic studies demonstrated that 3a and 4a affect viral replication at a stage after virus entry and preceding viral DNA integration. Quantitation of the intracellular levels of AZT-TP in PBMCs and CEM cells treated with 3a and 4a in the presence and absence of exogenous thymidine correlated the intracellular levels of AZT-TP to the antiviral activity and suggested that AZT-TP was responsible for the activity observed. In addition, the reduced toxicity of 3a and 4a toward CEM cells relative to AZT correlated with reduced levels of total phosphorylated AZT and not AZT-TP. Stable carbamate analogues of 3a and 4a were prepared and shown to inhibit the production of AZT-MP from cell-free extracts of CEM cells, further suggesting that a phosphoramidate hydrolase may be responsible for intracellular P-N bond cleavage. Taken together, these results suggest that the biological activity and intracellular metabolism of nucleoside phosphoramidate monoesters are distinct from that of phosphoramidate diesters.
11495583,4,2001,J Med Chem,Design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of a series of 3-[2-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)ethylamino]pyridazine derivatives as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.,Starting from the 3-[2-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)ethylamino]-6-phenylpyridazine 1, we performed the design, the synthesis, and the structure-activity relationships of a series of pyridazine analogues acting as AChE inhibitors. Structural modifications were achieved on four different parts of compound 1 and led to the following observations: (i) introduction of a lipophilic environment in the C-5 position of the pyridazine ring is favorable for the AChE-inhibitory activity and the AChE/BuChE selectivity; (ii) substitution and various replacements of the C-6 phenyl group are possible and led to equivalent or slightly more active derivatives; (iii) isosteric replacements or modifications of the benzylpiperidine moiety are detrimental to the activity. Among all derivatives prepared, the indenopyridazine derivative 4g was found to be the more potent inhibitor with an IC(50) of 10 nM on electric eel AChE. Compared to compound 1, this represents a 12-fold increase in potency. Moreover, 3-[2-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)ethylamino]-5-methyl-6-phenylpyridazine 4c, which showed an IC(50) of 21 nM, is 100-times more selective for human AChE (human BuChE/AChE ratio of 24) than the reference compound tacrine.
11262534,4,2001,Echocardiography,Lack of agreement between left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction determined by two-dimensional echocardiography and contrast cineangiography in postinfarction patients.,OBJECTIVE: To assess the agreement between left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF) determined by two-dimensional echocardiography (2-D echo) and by cineangiography in postinfarction patients.DESIGN: LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes indexed (EDVI and ESVI) to body surface area as well as EF were determined by both methods in all patients.SETTING: Multicenter trial conducted in five university hospitals.PATIENTS: 63 patients, 61 male, two female, mean age 55.5 +/- 10.4 years, suffering from a recent myocardial infarction. Eighty-one pairs of measurements were available.METHODS: The results of biplane 2-D echo measures, using apical four-chamber (4C) and two-chamber (2C) views were compared to those of a 30 degrees right anterior oblique cineangiography projection, using either the apical method of discs or the area-length 2-D echo method. Moreover, eyeball EF was estimated at 2-D echo and cineangiography, and was compared to the conventional methods. The agreement between results was assessed by the Bland and Altman method.RESULTS: The agreement between 2-D echo and cineangiography results was poor. Mean differences (MD) were -21.8 (EDVI, ml/m(2)), -9.5 (ESVI, ml/m(2)), and -0.9 (EF, %), respectively for 2-D echo method of discs versus cineangiography, and -23.2, -9.3, and -5.7 for area-length 2-D echo versus cineangiography. For EF (%), MD was -3.6 for eyeball cineangiography versus cineangiography, -1.3 for eyeball 2-D echo versus method of discs, and +0.30 for eyeball 2-D echo versus area-length 2-D echo, respectively. Two-dimensional echo is likely to underestimate LV volumes compared to cineangiography, especially for largest volumes. Even for EF, discrepancies are large, with a lack of agreement of 21%-25% between conventional methods, but agreement is better between eyeball EF and usual methods.CONCLUSIONS: Even with modern echocardiographic devices, agreement between 2-D echo and cineangiography-derived LV volumes and EF remains moderate, and both methods must not be considered interchangeable in clinical practice.
11689090,3,2001,J Med Chem,Methylene-gem-difluorocyclopropane analogues of nucleosides: synthesis, cyclopropene-methylenecyclopropane rearrangement, and biological activity.,Alkylation-elimination of adenine and 2-amino-6-chloropurine with gem-difluorocyclopropane dibromide 10 gave E- and Z-methylene-gem-difluorocyclopropanes 11a, 11b, 12a, and 12b and gem-difluorocyclopropenes 13a and 13b. Debenzylation of intermediates 11a, 11b, 12a, and 12b afforded E- and Z-methylenecyclopropanes 4a, 4b, 5a, and 5b. Hydrolysis of 2-amino-6-chloropurine derivatives 4b and 5b afforded guanine analogues 4c and 5c. Composition of products (except 14b) obtained from alkylation-elimination reflects thermodynamically controlled cyclopropene-methylenecyclopropene rearrangement. The E-isomer 4a was moderately active against human cytomegalovirus and along with the Z-isomer 5a was active against leukemia L1210 and solid tumors in vitro.
11606125,3,2001,J Med Chem,Synthesis and antitumor activity of conjugates of muramyldipeptide, normuramyldipeptide, and desmuramylpeptides with acridine/acridone derivatives.,The synthesis of two groups (Chart 1, types A and B) of conjugates of MDP (muramyldipeptide) and nor-MDP (normuramyldipeptide) with acridine/acridone derivatives and the synthesis of analogues of desmuramylpeptides (Chart 1, types C and D) containing acridine/ acridone derivatives have been described. In type A conjugates, the hydroxyl group at C6 of the sugar moiety was acylated with acridine/acridone N-substituted omega-aminoalkanocarboxylic acids (Scheme 1), whereas the conjugates of type B (Table 2) and three analogues of type C or D (Scheme 2) have an amide bond formed between the carboxylic group of isoglutamine and the amine function of the respective acridine/acridone derivatives. The preliminary screening data indicate that the analogues of groups A, C, and D exhibit small cytotoxic activity, whereas several analogues of type B, 4b, 4c, 4e, 4g, 4h, 4i, and 4l, exhibiting potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against a panel of human cell lines (Table 4), have been selected by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Evaluation Committee for further testing. Analogues 4b and 4h were active in the in vivo hollow fiber assay (Table 5). Analogue 3a shows an immunostimulating effect on the cytotoxic activity of the NK cells obtained from the spleen of healthy and Ab melanoma bearing animals.
11457930,3,2001,J Histochem Cytochem,Quantitative cytochemical analysis of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in living isolated hepatocytes of European flounder for rapid analysis of xenobiotic effects.,There is a great need for rapid but reliable assays to determine quantitatively effects of xenobiotics on biological systems in environmental research. Hepatocytes of European flounder are sensitive to low-dose toxic stress. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) is the major source of NADPH in cells and is therefore of major importance for NADPH-dependent xenobiotic biotransformation and defense against toxic injury. These facts prompted us to develop a sensitive cytochemical method to detect G6PDH activity in living isolated flounder hepatocytes using the tetrazolium salt method. The intact plasma membrane did not appear to be a barrier for substrate, co-enzyme, and dye molecules because the intracellular enzyme reaction started immediately when incubation medium was added and could be monitored in real time per individual cell using image analysis. The reaction was effectively stopped for end point measurements by using 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 5.3). The final reaction product, formazan, was stable in hepatocytes for at least 12 days at 4C. This is the first time that a chromogenic histochemical assay is applied to living cells. This approach provides an easy tool for large-scale screening of xenobiotic metabolism and cellular stress defense.
11411990,3,2001,Chemistry,Synthesis of ganglioside GD3 and its comparison with bovine GD3 with regard to oligodendrocyte apoptosis mitochondrial damage.,2,3-Dehydroneuraminic acid derivative 5 was transformed in five efficient steps into sialyl donor 2, which has a phenylthio group on the beta-side of the 3-position for anchimeric assistance and a diethyl phosphite residue as leaving group at the anomeric carbon. The known GM3 intermediate 10 was transformed into the 4b,4c,8c-O-unprotected acceptor 3, which was then allowed to react with 2 by using TMSOTf as catalyst and acetonitrile as solvent to afford the desired tetrasaccharide 12, which has an alpha(2-8)-linkage between two neuraminic acid residues. Removal of the phenylthio group gave intermediate 13, which was transformed into O-tetraosyl trichloroacetimidate 16 as glycosyl donor. Application of the azidosphingosine glycosylation procedure furnished GD3 (1) in high overall yield. Comparison of synthetic GD3 with bovine-brain-derived GD3 showed that there were similar effects in GD3-triggered uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration and in induction of apoptosis in oligodendrocytes.
11674672,2,2001,J Org Chem,Novel Substituent Effect on (77)Se NMR Chemical Shifts Caused by 4c-6e versus 2c-4e and 3c-4e in Naphthalene Peri Positions: Spectroscopic and Theoretical Study.,delta((8)Se) values for 1-[8-(p-YC(6)H(4)Se)C(10)H(6)]SeSe[C(10)H(6)(SeC(6)H(4)Y-p)-8']-1' (1: Y = H, OMe, Me, Cl, Br, COOEt, and NO(2)) showed a good correlation with those of 1-(MeSe)-8-(p-YC(6)H(4)Se)C(10)H(6) (2). While the delta((1)Se) values correlated well with delta((8)Se) in 2 with a positive proportionality constant of 0.252 (regular correlation), a similar correlation for 1 gave a negative proportionality constant of -0.282 (inverse correlation). To clarify the mechanism associated with the inverse correlation in 1, together with the regular correlation in 2, ab initio MO calculations, containing the GIAO magnetic shielding tensor for the Se nucleus (sigma(Se)), were performed on p-YC(6)H(4)(A)SeH- - -(B)SeH-(B)SeH- - -H(A)SeC(6)H(4)Y-p (3: model of Se(4) 4c-6e for 1) and on p-YC(6)H(4)(A)SeH- - -(B)SeH(2) (4 and 5: models of Se(2) pi type 2c-4e and (A)Se- - -(B)Se-H 3c-4e for 2, respectively) with the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis sets at B3LYP and/or HF levels. The characteristic nature of the substituent effects on atomic charges and delta(Se) values in 3 is demonstrated to be Y(delta-)&lt;--C(6)H(4)-Se(delta)(+)- - -Se(delta)(+)-Se(delta)(+)- - -Se(delta)(+)-C(6)H(4)--&gt;Y(delta-) and Y(delta-)&lt;--C(6)H(4)-Se(down)- - -Se(up)-Se(up)- - -Se(down)-C(6)H(4)--&gt;Y(delta-), respectively, (Y = electron-withdrawing) and in 5 is Y(delta-)&lt;--C(6)H(4)-Se(delta)(+)- - -Se(delta)(-)-H(delta)(+) and Y(delta-)&lt;--C(6)H(4)-Se(down)- - -Se(down)-H(down), respectively. In the case of 4, a substantial contribution through the naphthylidene group is suggested. These results indicate that the nature of the interaction between the linear four Se atoms in 1 is of the 4c-6e type and that between the two Se atoms in 2 is pi type 2c-4e and/or 3c-4e according to the conformations around the Se atoms. The observed NMR parameters are well explained by model calculations on 3-5. Plots of (4)J((1)Se,(8)Se) versus delta((8)Se) of 1 and 2 gave good correlations with negative proportionality constants, which indicates that the J values become larger as the electron density on the (8)Se atoms increases.
11672128,2,2001,J Org Chem,Retro-Ene Reactions in Acylallene Derivatives.,Allenic esters and amides 4 undergo a retro-ene reaction to vinylketene (6) and an aldehyde or imine (5) under the conditions of flash vacuum thermolysis (FVT). The same products are obtained by FVT of cyclobutenones 7 via electrocyclic ring opening to alkoxy- or aminovinylketenes 3 and 1,3-rearrangement of ketenes 3 to allenes 4. All the intermediates and products were characterized by matrix isolation IR spectroscopy, and in the case of 4c the reaction was also monitored by online mass spectrometry. A lower temperature for the retro-ene reaction of 4c, eliminating an imine, than for 4a, eliminating formaldehyde, is in agreement with a lower calculated activation barrier (167 and 181 kJ mol(-1), respectively, at the G2(MP2,SVP) level of theory). The allenic amide 11 undergoes an analogous retro-ene reaction to the (unobserved) vinylketene 13, the latter isomerizing to cyclohexenylacrolein 16 in a 1,5-H shift (calculated barrier 125 kJ mol(-1); G2 (MP2, SVP)).
11670607,2,2001,Inorg Chem,The First Platinum(IV) Complexes with Glucopyranoside Ligands. A New Coordination Mode of Carbohydrates.,
11529722,2,2001,J Org Chem,Crystal engineering using anilic acids and dipyridyl compounds through a new supramolecular synthon.,The anilic acids, 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (1a), 2,5-dibromo-3,6-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (bromanilic acid; 1b), 2,5-dichloro-3,6-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (chloranilic acid; 1c), and 2,5-dicyano-3,6-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (cyananilic acid; 1d), were cocrystallized with rigid organic ligands containing two pyridine rings, 2,4-bipyridine (2a), 4,4'-bipyridine (2b), 1,2-bis(2-pyridyl)ethylene (3a), 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene (3b), 2,2'-dipyridylacetylene (4a), 3,3'-dipyridylacetylene (4b), and 4,4'-dipyridylacetylene (4c). Fourteen complexes 5-18 were obtained as single crystals, and their crystal structures were successfully determined by X-ray analysis. All complexes except those with 2a are 1:1 and are composed of an infinite linear or zigzag tape structure, the formation of which is ascribed to intermolecular O-H...N, N(+)-H...O, or N(+)-H...O(-) hydrogen bonds or a combination of these between the anilic acids and the dipyridyl compounds. In the complexes 5 and 6, no infinite tape structure is observed although the molecular units connected by a similar hydrogen-bonding pattern are formed. For the 1:1 complexes, we have found two types of stacking arrangements, segregated stacks (7, 9, 12-15, 18) and alternated ones (8, 10, 11, 16, 17). In the complexes of 1c with the series of dipyridylacetylenes 4 (14, 15, 17), the neutral, dication, and monocaction states are formed depending on the nitrogen positions, which can be attributed to the different basicity of the pyridyl groups.
11511254,2,2001,J Org Chem,Enantioselective epoxidation with chiral MN(III)(salen) catalysts: kinetic resolution of aryl-substituted allylic alcohols.,A set of aryl-substituted allylic alcohols rac-2 has been epoxidized by chiral Mn(salen*) complexes 1 as the catalyst and iodosyl benzene (PhIO) as the oxygen source. Whereas one enantiomer of the allylic alcohol 2 is preferentially epoxidized to give the threo- or cis-epoxy alcohol 3 (up to 80% ee) as the main product (dr up to &gt;95:5), the other enantiomer of 2 is enriched (up to 53% ee). In the case of 1,1-dimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalen-2-ol (2c), the CH oxidation to the enone 4c proceeds enantioselectively and competes with the epoxidation. The absolute configurations of the allylic alcohols 2 and their epoxides 3 have been determined by chemical correlation or CD spectroscopy. The observed diastereo- and enantioselectivities in the epoxidation reactions are rationalized in terms of a beneficial interplay between the hydroxy-directing effect and the attack along the Katsuki trajectory.
11439044,2,2001,J Am Chem Soc,Unexpected selectivities in C-H activations of toluene and p-xylene at cationic platinum(II) diimine complexes. New mechanistic insight into product-determining factors.,The C-H activation of toluene and p-xylene at cationic Pt(II) diimine complexes (N-N)Pt(CH(3))(H(2)O)(+)BF(4)(-) (N-N = Ar-N=CMe-CMe=N-Ar; 1(BF(4)(-)), N(f)-N(f), Ar = 3,5-(CF(3))(2)C(6)H(3)); 2(BF(4)(-)), N'-N', Ar = 2,6-(CH(3))(2)C(6)H(3)) has been investigated. The reactions were performed at ambient temperature in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), and after complete conversion of the starting material to mixtures of Pt-aryl/Pt-benzyl complexes and methane, acetonitrile was added to trap the products as more stable acetonitrile adducts. In the reactions with toluene, the relative amounts of products resulting from aromatic C-H activation were found to decrease in the order (N-N)Pt(m-tolyl)(NCMe)(+) &gt; (N-N)Pt(p-tolyl)(NCMe)(+) &gt; (N-N)Pt(o-tolyl)(NCMe)(+) for both 1 and 2. Unlike the reaction at 1, significant amounts of the benzylic activation product (N'-N')Pt(benzyl)(NCMe)(+) were concurrently formed in the C-H activation of toluene at 2. The C-H activation of p-xylene revealed an even more remarkable difference between 1 and 2. Here, the product ratios of (N-N)Pt(xylyl)(NCMe)(+) and (N-N)Pt(p-methylbenzyl)(NCMe)(+) were found to be 90:10 and 7:93 for reactions at 1 and 2, respectively. The elimination of toluene from (N(f)-N(f))Pt(Tol)(2) species (3a-c; a, Tol = o-tolyl; b, Tol = m-tolyl; c, Tol = p-tolyl) after protonolysis with 1 equiv of HBF(4) was investigated. Most notably, protonation in neat TFE followed by addition of acetonitrile gave a 77:23 mixture of (N(f)-N(f))Pt(m-tolyl)(NCMe)(+) (4b) and (N(f)-N(f))Pt(p-tolyl)(NCMe)(+) (4c) from all three isomeric bis(tolyl) complexes 3a-c. The presence of acetonitrile during the protonation reactions resulted in considerably less isomerization. This behavior is explained by an associative mechanism for the product-determining displacement of toluene by the solvent. For the C-H activation reactions, our findings suggest the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between the isomeric intermediates (N-N)Pt(aryl)(CH(4))(+) (aryl = tolyl/benzyl from 1; xylyl/p-methylbenzyl from 2). The observed selectivities might then be explained by steric and electronic effects in the pentacoordinate transition-state structures for the solvent-induced associative elimination of methane from these intermediates.
11409637,2,2001,Cytobios,Cytophotometric estimation of in situ DNA content in several species of Araceae.,A wide variation in the in situ 4C DNA content, ranging from 15.02 pg to 54.09 pg was found in thirteen genera of the family Araceae. The obligate perennial species showed greater 4C DNA values compared with the facultative perennials and annuals. A remarkable heterogeneity in 4C nuclear DNA amounts was noted among obligate perennials. Intraspecific constancy in the amount of 4C DNA was recorded. The nuclear DNA content correlated positively with chromosome size, duration of the mitotic cycle, and annual to perennial growth forms. Despite an extensive variation in DNA content among the aroids investigated, each species was distinctly characterized by its specific nuclear DNA value, indicating its usefulness in taxonomic characterization and comparison of different aroids.
11377188,2,2001,Bioorg Med Chem,Design and synthesis of new orally active inhibitors of human neutrophil elastase.,To identify new orally active inhibitors, further modification of 1 (ONO-6818) was performed. Peptidic derivatives 4b, 4c and 4n showed more potent inhibitory activity than nonpeptidic derivatives 3a-c. As a result, a series of peptidic inhibitors, 4a-s and 5a-v, were discovered. Among these N-aryl derivatives 5a-g, 5i, 5m and 5o-v showed oral activity. Their oral activity showed good correlation with their metabolic stability. Compounds 5h and 5j-l, which were extremely metabolically unstable in hamster plasma, did not show oral activity. Oral activity was considered to be determined by a combination of at least two factors: oral absorption and metabolic stability.
11319026,2,2001,Physiol Plant,Increasing ploidy level in cell suspension cultures of Doritaenopsis by exogenous application of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid.,To clarify the causal factors for ploidy variation in plant cell culture, we attempted to alter ploidy distribution in cell cultures of a tetraploid cultivar of Doritaenopsis by changing the plant growth regulators (PGRs) in the culture medium. The original suspension cultured cells, which had been maintained in medium containing 0.1 mg l-1 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and 1 mg l-1 benzyladenine, were transferred onto various gellan gum solidified media with a single application of PGRs, and the ploidy distributions of the cells were examined using flow cytometry analysis during 3 weeks of culture. Among the PGRs tested, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid caused a drastic reduction in the 4C-cell proportion in cell cultures with an increased cell proportion of 8C or higher C-values. In the case of 2,4-D application, a reduction of cell viability was observed. A decreasing proportion was also observed in the 8C-cell population accumulated by 2,4-D treatment, following transfer back to the medium containing the standard PGR composition. These results suggest that the exogenous application of 2,4-D arrested the cell cycle at G2 phase in the Doritaenopsis cells, and the removal of 2,4-D might induce further endoreduplication or recover the mitotic cycle of the G2-arrested cells.
11245975,2,2001,Gene,The genomic basis of K(V)3.4 potassium channel mRNA diversity in mice.,K(V)3.4 belongs to the shaw subfamily of shaker-type potassium channels. It conducts fast inactivating, high threshold currents in the central nervous system and in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers. The corresponding mouse gene, Kcnc4, consists of five exons spanning a region of 20 kb. Approximately 700 bp of regulatory sequence were delineated. It is GC-rich and lacks typical TATA and CAAT motifs. Instead, seven Sp-1 and three E-box elements define putative regulatory sequences. The mouse K(V)3.4 mRNA has a size of 3639 bp, 1120 bp of which are 3' untranslated region. A transcript initiated from an alternative 5'-exon was identified by RACE and verified by genomic analysis. This isoform, designated K(V)3.4d, is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and probably results from alternative promoter usage. It encodes a channel protein with a novel N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. It lacks the conserved sequence motifs encoding the shaw-type tetramerization domain and the 'ball' peptide, which confers fast inactivation properties. Another splice variant, K(V)3.4c, is derived by exon skipping in the C-terminal region and is expressed at similar levels in brain and muscle. These data demonstrate that differential splicing and alternative transcription start sites are utilised to generate a set of K(V)3.4 variants in skeletal muscle and brain, presumably involved in the regulation of excitability.
11162505,2,2001,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Semaphorin 4C, a transmembrane semaphorin, [corrected] associates with a neurite-outgrowth-related protein, SFAP75.,Semaphorin 4C (S4C, previously called M-SemaF) was recently identified as a brain rich transmembrane member of semaphorin family of the vertebrate. In the cytoplasmic domain of S4C there is a proline-rich region suggesting that the cytoplasmic domain may play an important role in Sema4C function. In this study, we have identified the cytoplasmic domain (cd) of M-SemaF(S4C)-associating protein with a Mr of 75 kDa, named SFAP75, from mouse brain. SFAP75 turned out to be the same as the recently reported neurite-outgrowth-related protein named Norbin. Deletion mutants analyses of S4C and SFAP75 revealed that the membrane-proximal region of S4Ccd binds to the intermediate region of SFAP75. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses with anti-Sema4C and anti-SFAP75 antibodies indicated that S4C and SFAP75 were specially enriched in the brain with a similar distribution pattern to each other. These results suggest that S4C interacts with SFAP75 and plays a role in neural function in brain.
10554283,2,2001,J Agric Food Chem,Isolation of Lolicine A, Lolicine B, Lolitriol, and Lolitrem N from Lolium perenne Infected with Neotyphodium lolii and Evidence for the Natural Occurrence of 31-Epilolitrem N and 31-Epilolitrem F.,Lolicines A (1a) and B (2a), late-eluting lolitrem-like compounds, were identified in extracts of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) seed that was infected with the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium lolii. The lolicines were isolated as their 11-O-propionates (1b and 2b) and their structures determined by mass spectrometry and one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The structures of lolicines A and B were similar to those of paspaline (5a) and paspaline B (5b), compounds known to be biosynthetic precursors of several groups of more complex indole-diterpenoids, suggesting that the lolicines might be biosynthetic precursors of the lolitrem group of indole-diterpenoid neurotoxins. During purification of 1b and 2b, a third compound, lolitrem N (4c), was isolated as its propionate (4d) and identified as 35-epilolitriol. A further late-eluting compound was isolated as its acetate from the same fraction as the lolicines. This compound was found to be identical with lolitriol 10-O-acetate (4b) prepared from lolitrem B (3a). This finding confirms lolitriol (4a) as a natural constituent of endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass, and is consistent with the proposal that lolitriol is a biosynthetic precursor of lolitrems A (9), B (3a), and E (10). Detailed examination of the (1)H NMR spectra of 4b revealed the presence of 31-epilolitrem N 10-O-acetate (4f) as a naturally occurring contaminant, indicating that 31-epilolitrem N (4e) is a metabolite of endophyte-infected ryegrass. Analysis of the NMR spectra of 3a led to a reassignment of the C-19-C-21 resonances of the lolitrems, and identified 31-epilolitrem F (3c) as a natural constituent of L. perenne.
11141177,2,2001,J Exp Bot,The influence of aerated hydration seed treatment on seed longevity as assessed by the viability equations.,Aerated hydration (AH) treatments of cauliflower seeds for 12 h (12AH) and 28 h (28AH) at 20 degrees C resulted in improved or reduced storage potential of low or high vigour seeds, respectively. Seeds were stored at their initial seed moisture content (mean 5.5% mc) or at 12% mc at 10 degrees C for 12 months and at 20 degrees C for 4 months. The improved longevity of low vigour seeds was associated with increased K(i) (initial seed viability) and a reduced rate of deterioration (1/sigma) whereas the K(i) of high vigour seeds fell after 28AH and the rate of deterioration increased such that the time to lose one probit of viability decreased from 28.7 to 5.3 months at 10 degrees C and from 10.4 to 1.2 months at 20 degrees C. The improved K(i) of low vigour seeds could be explained by the reduction in the extent of deterioration after AH, as indicated by the increase in germination after cotrolled deterioration (CD), and the possible activation of metabolic repair during treatment. In contrast the reduced germination after CD of AH-treated high vigour seeds was indicative of deterioration as a result of treatment. Both high and low vigour seeds contained constitutive levels of ss-tubulin which increased during AH treatment, the increase being greater in high vigour seeds. High vigour seeds also showed an increase in the proportion of nuclear DNA present as 4C DNA, from 3% (untreated seeds) to 26% (28AH), indicative of germination advancement from the G(1) to G(2) phase of the cell cycle during treatment. This higher proportion of 4C DNA is correlated with the increased sensitivity of seeds to drying and/or storage after AH, leading to their reduced K(i) and storage potential. In contrast, there was little change in %4C in low vigour seeds. Priming in polyethylene glycol (PEG, -1.0 MPa) for 5 d or 13 d also improved the longevity of low vigour seeds stored at their initial and 12% mc at 10 degrees C for 8 months, as reflected in their laboratory and CD germination. In this case, however, the improved longevity of the low vigour seeds following 13 d priming was associated with an increase in 4C DNA from 4% (dry control) to 56% after treatment. The germination of both untreated and primed high vigour seeds remained high throughout the storage period. Increases in the rate of germination (decreased mean germination time) observed after all AH and PEG treatments were not consistently associated with an increase in the proportion of nuclei containing 4C DNA.
11741789,1,2001,Bioorg Med Chem,Clustered ergot alkaloids modulate cell-mediated cytotoxicity.,Dimers of agroclavine (1) and terguride (2), as well as a series of terguride oligomers, for example trimers (5, 6), tetramer (7), hexamer (8) and functionalized tergurides for further complex clustering were synthesized. Terguride oligomers were screened for their direct cellular toxicity on lymphoma cell lines in vitro and for their immunomodulating activities, represented by the natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity, as the most sensitive screening marker during immune responses. Dimers linked via aromatic spacer showed a high toxicity (1 microM) to lymphoma cells, which was not detected in other derivatives. In vitro and ex vivo experiments performed on mouse spleen lymphocytes in the presence of terguride oligomers demonstrated an immunosuppressive effect of dimers with aromatic spacer (4c-d) and NK cell stimulatory effect of terguride hexamer (8) and trimer with aliphatic spacer (5c). There is a considerable evidence that indolic part of molecule contributes to immunosuppressive action of terguride, which is potentiated in dimers carrying aromatic linker. This effect can be reversed by higher oligomerization of the respective alkaloids.
11738624,1,2001,Bioorg Med Chem,Synthesis of novel (2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-iso dideoxynucleosides with exocyclic methylene as potential antiviral agents.,Novel (2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-iso dideoxynucleosides with exocyclic methylene have been designed and synthesized, based on the lead BMS-200475 (3) which exhibited potent anti-HBV activity. For the synthesis of D types of (2R,4R)-nucleosides, L-xylose was converted to the key intermediate 14. The intermediate 14 was converted to the uracil derivative 4a and the cytosine derivative 4b. Compound 14 was also converted to the purine derivatives such as adenine derivative 4c, hypoxanthine derivative 4d, and guanine derivative 4e. The corresponding L types of (2S,4S)-enantiomers were more efficiently synthesized from the commercially available 1,2-isopropylidene-D-xylose (20) than the synthetic method used in the synthesis of (2R,4R)-nucleosides. The key intermediate 25 was converted to the pyrimidine analogues 5a and 5b and the purine derivatives 5c, 5d, and 5e using the similar method used in the preparation of 4c, 4d, and 4e. The synthesized final (2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-nucleosides were tested against several viruses such as HIV-1, HSV-1, HSV-2, HCMV and HBV. (2R,4R)-Adenine analogue 4c exhibited potent anti-HBV activity (EC(50)=1.5 microM in 2.2.15 cells) among compounds tested, while (2R,4R)-uracil derivative 4a was the most active against HCMV among compounds tested and (2R,4R)-adenine derivative 4c was found to be moderately active against the same virus. However, the corresponding (2S,4S)-isomers were found to be totally inactive against all tested viruses. Both (2R,4R)-adenine derivative 4c and (2S,4S)-adenine analogue 5c were totally resistant to the adenosine deaminase like iso-ddA (1). From the molecular modeling study the hydroxymethyl side chains of BMS-200475 (3) and 4c were almost overlapped, indicating that 4c may be suitable for phosphorylation by cellular kinases like the lead 3, but some discrepancy between two bases was observed, indicating why 4c is less potent against HBV than 3. It is concluded that discovery of (2R,4R)-adenine analogue 4c as potent anti-HBV agent suggested that the sugar moiety of this series can be regarded as a novel template for the development of new anti-HBV agent and oxygen atom can be acted as a bioisostere of C-OH.
24573430,1,2001,Sex Plant Reprod,Tripsacum dactyloides (Poaceae): a natural model system to study parthenogenesis.,Diplosporous apomeiosis, formation of unreduced embryo sacs primarily of the Antennaria type, followed by parthenogenetic embryo development and pseudogamy (fertilization of the central cell) describe gametophytic apomixis within the Tripsacum agamic complex. Tripsacum dactyloides (Eastern gamagrass) is a close relative of domesticated maize and was chosen as a natural model system to investigate gene expression patterns associated with parthenogenesis. The genome size of diploid sexual and polyploid apomictic T. dactyloides was estimated by flow cytometry to be 7.37 pg (2C), 14.74 pg (4C) and 22.39 pg (6C), respectively. The diploid genome size is thus approximately 1.35× larger than that of maize. The apomeiotic-pseudogamous pathway of seed formation was demonstrated at a rate of 92% by the flow cytometric seed screen (FCSS) with single mature seeds in tetraploid accessions. This number includes twin embryos which were detected in 13% of the seeds analyzed. Fertilization of unreduced egg cells (BIII hybrids) was measured in 10% of apomictic seeds. Autonomous (fertilization-independent) embryo development and fertilization-dependent endosperm formation were confirmed by pollination of tetraploid T. dactyloides with a diploid transgenic maize line carrying an actin:: β -glucuronidase (GUS) reporter construct. GUS expression was detected after pollination in the developing endosperm, but not in the embryo. In similar intraspecific crossing experiments with maize, GUS expression was detected in both the embryo and endosperm. A protocol was established for microdissection of embryo sacs and early parthenogenetic embryos of T. dactyloides. Together, these techniques provide new tools for future studies aimed at comparing gene expression patterns between sexual maize and sexual or apomictic T. dactyloides.
11674459,1,2001,J Org Chem,Improved Syntheses and Some Selective Transformations of 2,2,4,4-Tetrachloro-8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-en-3-ones.,The methyl- and alkenyl-substituted furans 1b-h react with pentachloroacetone (2) and sodium 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxide solution to form the title compounds 3b-h in good yield. With the furans 1i-m bearing an oxygen or a sulfur heteroatom in the side chain, moderate yields are obtained. Dechlorination of the [4+3] cycloadducts 3 with the Zn-Cu couple leads to the corresponding oxabicyclic ketones 4. On catalytic hydrogenation of the tetrachlorooxabicyclooctenones 3a-c hydrogenolysis of the exo-carbon-chlorine bonds occurs, leading to the endo-2,endo-4-dichloro-8-oxabicyclooctan-3-ones 8a-c. With lithium aluminum hydride and Grignard reagents, 8a and 3a form the endo-3-alcohols 12a-c and 13, respectively, the latter with uncertain configuration at C-3, in a highly stereoselective manner. The ether bridge in the dechlorinated oxabicyclooctenones 4b, 4f, and 4g can be cleaved by means of trimethylsilyl triflate/triethylamine to produce the tropones 5b, 5f, and 5g. Hydrogenation of 1,5-dimethyl-8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-en-3-one (4c), followed by Wolff-Kishner reduction, affords 1,5-dimethyl-8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane (7). m-Chloroperbenzoic acid epoxidizes the alkenyl side chain of the tetrachlorinated oxabicycles 3d, 3e, 3g, and 3h in a site-selective reaction. In contrast, from the dehalogenated oxabicyclic ketone 4g the bis(epoxide) 14 is obtained.
11672074,1,2001,J Org Chem,Absolute Rate Constants for alpha-Amide Radical Reactions.,The 1-(diethylcarbamoyl)-6,6-diphenyl-5-hexenyl radical (4a), the 1-(diethylcarbamoyl)-7,7-diphenyl-6-heptenyl radical (4b), and the 1-(diethylcarbamoyl)-1-methyl-6,6-diphenyl-5-hexenyl radical (4c) were produced from the corresponding PTOC esters (anhydrides of the carboxylic acid and N-hydroxypyridine-2-thione) by laser flash photolysis methods. The kinetics of cyclizations of radicals 4a and 4b were measured at various temperatures, and that of cyclization of 4c was measured at ambient temperature. Radicals 4a and 4b were employed as radical clocks in indirect kinetic studies to determine rate constants for reaction of secondary alpha-amide radicals with Bu(3)SnH. The calibrated tin hydride trapping reaction was then employed to determine rate constants for cyclization of the 1-(diethylcarbamoyl)-5-hexenyl radical (12). The rate constants for 5-exo cyclizations of secondary alpha-amide radicals are similar to those of their isostructural alkyl radical analogues. The rate constants for the 5-exo cyclization of tertiary alpha-amide radical 4c and the 6-exo cyclization of the secondary alpha-amide radical 4b are smaller than those of the analogous alkyl radicals and alpha-ester substituted radicals, apparently due to steric effects. The rate constants for tin hydride trapping of secondary alpha-amide radicals are similar to those for reactions with secondary alpha-ester radicals.
11597179,1,2001,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,DNA cytofluorometric analysis of chondrocytes in human articular cartilages under normal aging or arthritic conditions.,OBJECTIVE: Since most chondrocytes in articular cartilage are in the resting phase (G0) of the cell cycle, it has been difficult to investigate their cell kinetics using 3H-thymidine autoradiography, or immunohistochemistry. In the present study, DNA cytofluorometry, which is useful to analyse the cell kinetics even for such inactive cell populations as in the G0 phase, was applied to human chondrocytes of the articular cartilages under normal aging and pathologic conditions such as osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and aseptic necrosis (AN).DESIGN: The human articular cartilages for the study were obtained from autopsy and surgical materials. Fifty joints were used for the study of aging, 54 for the study of OA, 20 for studying RA, and 10 for AN study. The isolated chondrocytes were quickly prepared from fresh articular cartilages, using a combination method of enzymatic digestion with papain and collagenase, followed by mechanical cell separation by churning and homogenization.RESULTS: The DNA histograms obtained by cytofluorometry with propidium-iodide staining showed that most chondrocytes had diploid DNA content (2c) in all cartilages studied, suggesting that they were in the G0 phase. However, there were a few chondrocytes having tetraploid DNA content (4c) in the normally aged articular cartilages, and there were some cells having DNA content between 2c and 4c in the diseased cartilages. The former cells were considered to be G0-phase cells of the 4c chondrocytes, while the latter cells were considered to be in the DNA synthetic (S) phase or G2-phase of the 2c chondrocytes. The frequency of 4c chondrocytes in aged cartilage was significantly increased, compared to that in the young cartilage. In contrast to the normal cartilage, the frequency of S- and G2-phase cells, which was expressed as the S- G2 index, in diseased cartilages (OA, RA and AN) was significantly high (P&lt; 0.0001). In OA cartilage, the S-G2 index was much higher in the severe or moderate stage than in the mild stage, suggesting that the chondrocytes in clusters may actively proliferate.CONCLUSION: These results showed that in normal articular cartilages most chondrocytes are in the G0 phase, while some became 4c polyploid cells, and that these G0-phase chondrocytes had a potential to proliferate under diseased conditions.
11595220,1,2001,Carbohydr Res,Modeling of deoxy- and dideoxyaldohexopyranosyl ring puckering with MM3(92).,Extensive variations of the ring structures of three deoxyaldohexopyranoses, L-fucose, D-quinovose, and L-rhamnose, and four dideoxyaldohexopyranoses, D-digitoxose, abequose, paratose, and tyvelose, were studied by energy minimization with the molecular mechanics algorithm MM3(92). Chair conformers, 4C(1) in D-quinovose and the equivalent 1C(4) in L-fucose and L-rhamnose, overwhelmingly dominate in the three deoxyhexoses; in the D-dideoxyhexoses, 4C(1) is again dominant, but with increased amounts of 1C(4) forms in the alpha anomers of the three 3,6-dideoxyhexoses, abequose, paratose, and tyvelose and in both alpha and beta anomers of the 2,6-dideoxyhexose D-digitoxose. In general, modeled proton-proton coupling constants agreed well with experimental values. Computed anomeric ratios strongly favor the beta configuration except for D-digitoxose, which is almost equally divided between alpha and beta configurations, and L-rhamnose, where the beta configuration is somewhat favored. MM3(92) appears to overstate the prevalence of the equatorial beta anomer in all three deoxyhexoses, as earlier found with fully oxygenated aldohexopyranoses.
11588362,1,2001,Acta Crystallogr C,trans-Bis(2-amino-6-nitro-1,3-benzothiazole-N)dichloroplatinum(II) tetrakis(N,N'-dimethylformamide) solvate and tetrakis(2-amino-5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole-N4)platinum(II) hexachloroplatinate(IV) bis(N,N'-dimethylformamide) solvate.,The structures of the title compounds, [PtCl(2)(C(7)H(5)N(3)O(2)S)(2)].4C(3)H(7)NO, (I), and [Pt(C(3)H(5)N(3)S)(4)][PtCl(6)].2C(3)H(7)NO, (II), respectively, comprise square-planar Pt(II) centres. In the cation and anion of (II), the Pt atoms lie on independent inversion centres. For (I), the metal atom is N-bonded to two trans organic ligands and also bonded to two Cl atoms, whereas in (II), the Pt atom is N-bonded to four organic ligands, the charge being balanced by the presence of an additional [PtCl(6)](2-) species (from the starting material). Both structures contain dimethylformamide solvate molecules, four in the asymmetric unit of (I) and one in (II), which are involved in the hydrogen-bonding network via N-H.X and C-H.X associations.
11557051,1,2001,FEBS Lett,Methylobacillus flagellatus KT contains a novel cbo-type cytochrome oxidase.,The o-type oxidase from the methanol-grown obligate methylotroph Methylobacillus flagellatus KT has been purified to homogeneity. The complex is composed of four subunits (57, 40, 35 and 30 kDa). It contains six haems (4C:1B:1O) and one copper atom per molecule. It is proposed that the haem O-Cu(B) binuclear centre and a low-spin haem B are located in subunit I (57 kDa), two haems C reside in the cytochrome c homodimer (35 kDa), two haems C belong to the dihaem cytochrome c (30 kDa). The presented data provide evidence that cytochrome cbo is a novel representative of the haem-copper oxidase superfamily.
11516279,1,2001,J Am Chem Soc,Cationic aluminum alkyl complexes incorporating aminotroponiminate ligands.,The synthesis, structures, and reactivity of cationic aluminum complexes containing the N,N'-diisopropylaminotroponiminate ligand ((i)Pr(2)-ATI(-)) are described. The reaction of ((i)Pr(2)-ATI)AlR(2) (1a-e,g,h; R = H (a), Me (b), Et (c), Pr (d), (i)Bu (e), Cy (g), CH(2)Ph (h)) with [Ph(3)C][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] yields ((i)()Pr(2)-ATI)AlR(+) species whose fate depends on the properties of the R ligand. 1a and 1b react with 0.5 equiv of [Ph(3)C][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] to produce dinuclear monocationic complexes [([(i)Pr(2)-ATI] AlR)(2)(mu-R)][(C(6)F(5))(4)] (2a,b). The cation of 2b contains two ((i)()Pr(2)-ATI)AlMe(+) units linked by an almost linear Al-Me-Al bridge; 2a is presumed to have an analogous structure. 2b does not react further with [Ph(3)C][B(C(6)F(5))(4)]. However, 1a reacts with 1 equiv of [Ph(3)C][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] to afford ((i Pr(2)-ATI)Al(C(6)F(5))(mu-H)(2)B(C(6)F(5))(2) (3) and other products, presumably via C(6)F(5)(-) transfer and ligand redistribution of a [((i)()Pr(2)-ATI)AlH][(C(6)F(5))(4)] intermediate. 1c-e react with 1 equiv of [Ph(3)C][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] to yield stable base-free [((i)Pr(2)-ATI)AlR][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] complexes (4c-e). 4c crystallizes from chlorobenzene as 4c(ClPh).0.5PhCl, which has been characterized by X-ray crystallography. In the solid state the PhCl ligand of 4c(ClPh) is coordinated by a dative PhCl-Al bond and an ATI/Ph pi-stacking interaction. 1g,h react with [Ph(3)C][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] to yield ((i)Pr(2)-ATI)Al(R)(C(6)F(5)) (5g,h) via C(6)F(5)(-) transfer of [((i)Pr(2)-ATI)AlR][(BC(6)F(5))(4)] intermediates. 1c,h react with B(C(6)F(5))(3) to yield ((i)Pr(2)-ATI)Al(R)(C(6)F(5)) (5c,h) via C(6)F(5)(-) transfer of [((i)Pr(2)-ATI)AlR][RB(C(6)F(5))(3)] intermediates. The reaction of 4c-e with MeCN or acetone yields [((i)Pr(2)-ATI)Al(R)(L)][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] adducts (L = MeCN (8c-e), acetone (9c-e)), which undergo associative intermolecular L exchange. 9c-e undergo slow beta-H transfer to afford the dinuclear dicationic alkoxide complex [(((i)Pr(2)-ATI)Al(mu-O(i)()Pr))(2)][B(C(6)F(5))(4)](2) (10) and the corresponding olefin. 4c-e catalyze the head-to-tail dimerization of tert-butyl acetylene by an insertion/sigma-bond metathesis mechanism involving [((i)Pr(2)-ATI)Al(C=C(t)Bu)][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] (13) and [((i)Pr(2)-ATI)Al(CH=C((t)()Bu)C=C(t)Bu)][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] (14) intermediates. 13 crystallizes as the dinuclear dicationic complex [([(i Pr(2)-ATI]Al(mu-C=C(t)Bu))(2)][B(C(6)F(5))(4)](2).5PhCl from chlorobenzene. 4e catalyzes the polymerization of propylene oxide and 2a catalyzes the polymerization of methyl methacrylate. 4c,e react with ethylene-d(4) by beta-H transfer to yield [((i)Pr(2)-ATI)AlCD(2)CD(2)H][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] initially. Polyethylene is also produced in these reactions by an unidentified active species.
11505621,1,2001,Strahlenther Onkol,[Late radiation changes after small volume radiosurgery of the rat brain. Measuring local cerebral blood flow and histopathological studies].,BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to investigate late effects following stereotactic single fraction and small volume irradiation on cerebral blood flow and histologic alterations in the rat brain parenchyma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 66 Copenhagen rats, separated into eleven groups of six animals each received single doses of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 Gy using a 15 MV linear accelerator. Six rats served as controls. Two cylindrical collimators of 2 mm and 3 mm aperture were used. The diameters of the spherical 80% isodose were 3.7 and 4.7 mm, respectively (Table 1). Irradiation was applied to a predefined area in the right frontal lobe. 19 months after irradiation local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured by the autoradiographic method in one animal of each dose group between 20 and 50 Gy. 9 and 19 months after irradiation, half of the animals of each group were sacrificed for brain histology. All animals irradiated with 100 Gy were sacrificed 7 months after irradiation.RESULTS: An increase of local cerebral blood flow was measured in brain structures within the 80% isodose in animals irradiated with 50 Gy (Figure 3) compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Measurements close to necrotic areas showed a strong decrease of local cerebral blood flow (Figure 1). A volume increase of the irradiated hemisphere was seen after 19 months (Figure 2). The histologic examination after 19 months showed necrotic areas in the 30-50 Gy groups (Figure 4b) but not in the 20 Gy groups (Figure 4c). The animals who received 100 Gy demonstrated brain necrosis within 9 months after irradiation (Figure 4a). At both points in time the groups irradiated with the 3-mm collimator showed more pronounced histomorphologic and functional changes compared to the groups irradiated with the 2-mm collimator.CONCLUSION: Alterations of the local cerebral blood flow were measured as a late effect after single dose irradiation. The alterations of the local cerebral blood flow could be explained by the histomorphologic changes of the blood vessels. Using a semi-quantitative classification a dose, time and volume dependence for the endpoint radionecrosis was seen.
11505487,1,2001,Head Neck,Effects of chemotherapy on invasion and metastasis of oral cavity cancer in mice.,BACKGROUND: Using an orthotopic implantation model in which oral cancer invasion and metastasis can be reproduced, we investigated the inhibitory effects of anticancer agents on invasion and metastasis.METHODS: A highly invasive and metastatic human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line, OSC-19, was implanted into the oral floor of nude mice, and cisplatin or peplomycin was administered to the mice 7 or 14 days after implantation. The effects of each anticancer drug and different administration timings on cancer invasion and metastasis were investigated.RESULTS: Tumor size and the ratio of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells was significantly reduced. In the control group, the tumors showed grade 4C mode of invasion, whereas in the groups treated with anticancer drugs, grade 3 was observed in 77.3% of the mice, with an inhibitory effect on tumor invasion being observed. The rate of metastasis in the cervical lymph node was significantly decreased in the groups treated with the cisplatin or peplomycin on day 7 after implantation. The tumor stage progression in the metastatic lymph nodes was also inhibited.CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy is effective not only for tumor diminution but also for inhibiting invasion and metastasis. In light of these effects, administration of anticancer drugs may be clinically useful in this regard.
11474578,1,2001,Mol Med,Expression and characterization of six mutations in the protoporphyrinogen oxidase gene among Finnish variegate porphyria patients.,BACKGROUND: Variegate porphyria (VP) is an inherited disorder of heme biosynthesis that results from a partial deficiency of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX). Patients with VP may experience acute neurovisceral attacks and cutaneous photosensitivity. To date we have characterized 109 VP patients representing 19 VP families in the Finnish population of 5 million, both biochemically and clinically.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mutations were identified by direct sequencing of the patients' genomic DNA. The effect of the mutations was determined by sequencing the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) product amplified from total RNA extracted from the patients' lymphoblast cell lines and expressing the mutations in E. coli and COS-1 cells.RESULTS: Of the six mutations identified in the PPOX gene, three mutations (IVS2-2a--&gt;c, 338G--&gt;C, and 470A--&gt;4C) caused splicing defects, one produced a frameshift (78insC) and two mutations (R152C and L401F) caused amino acid substitutions. In RT-PCR, the IVS2-2a--&gt;c mutation caused a retention of a 36-bp fragment in the 3' end of intron 2, the 338G--&gt;C mutation caused an exon 4 deletion, and the 470A--&gt;C mutation caused an exon 5 deletion with retention of a 19-bp fragment of the 3' end of intron 5. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems, the PPOX activities of five mutants were decreased to 0-5% of the normal activity.CONCLUSIONS: This study describes five novel mutations and one earlier described major mutation among Finnish VP patients. All mutations produced detectable transcripts, but resulted in decreased PPOX activity confirming the causality of the mutations and the biochemical defects in these patients.
11474332,1,2001,Med Sci Sports Exerc,Use of air displacement plethysmography for estimating body fat in a four-component model.,PURPOSE: To compare measurements of body density (D(b)) obtained from air displacement plethysmography (AP) and hydrostatic weighing (HW) and to determine the accuracy of substituting D(b) via AP (D(b)-AP) for D(b) via HW (D(b)-HW) in estimating body fatness (%Fat(4C)) and the composition and density of the fat-free mass (Dffm) from a four-component model (fat, mineral, water, and protein).METHODS: D(b) was measured in 50 young adults using AP and HW. Total body water via deuterium dilution, bone mineral content via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and D(b) were used to estimate %Fat(4C).RESULTS: D(b)-AP and D(b)-HW were highly correlated (r = 0.89, SEE = 0.008 g x mL(-1)), but D(b)-AP (1.065 +/- 0.003 g x mL(-1)) was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than D(b)-HW (1.058 +/- 0.003 g x mL(-1)), resulting in a mean difference of 2.8%fat. Differences between %Fat(4C-AP) (17.8 +/- 1.2%) and %Fat(4C-HW) (19.3 +/- 1.2%) were significant (P &lt; 0.05), but the SD of the differences (2.3%) was low. When D(b)-AP was used in a four-component model in place of D(b)-HW, the calculated Dffm was significantly higher (1.109 +/- 0.002 vs 1.105 +/- 0.002 g x mL(-1)) based on a higher (P &lt; 0.05) protein fraction (22.0 +/- 0.4% vs 20.6 +/- 0.4%) and lower (P &lt; 0.05) water (71.1 +/- 0.4% vs 72.4 +/- 0.4%) and mineral fractions (7.0 +/- 0.1% vs 7.1 +/- 0.1%).CONCLUSIONS: AP yields a higher D(b) than HW and may not be a valid method for measuring D(b) or estimating %fat using densitometry. However, due to relatively small bias and low individual error, D(b)-AP is an acceptable substitute for D(b)-HW when estimating %fat with a four-component model in young adults.
11461757,1,2001,Eur J Med Chem,Pyrazolopyrimidines: synthesis, effect on histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells and cytotoxic activity.,A series of 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines (3--6) substituted at positions 1 (R(1)=Ph, H, tert-butyl and ribosetribenzoate), 4 (R(2)=chlorine, nitrogen and oxygen nucleophiles), and 6 (dimethylamino) have been synthesized and their effect on the release of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells measured. After chemical stimulation, (polymer 48/80), several compounds (i.e. 3b, 4a, 4b, 4d, 4g, 5a), produce inhibition two to three times higher (40--60%) than DSCG but this action is lower after preincubation. 4b (R(1)=Ph, R(2)=NHCH(2)Ph; 50--70% inhibition) and 5a (R(1)=H, R(2)=OMe; 50--55% inhibition) are the most active ones in both experiments. With ovoalbumin as stimulus, several pyrazolopyrimidines show inhibition similar to DSCG, the most active compounds being 6a--d (IC(50)=12--16 microM; R(1)=ribosetribenzoate, R(2)=methoxy and amino). Compounds 4e (R(1)=t-butyl, R(2)=OMe) and 4g (R(1)=t-butyl, R(2)=piperidino) are inducers of the release of histamine (60 and 150% increase). Compounds 4b and 4c showed cytotoxic activity (IC(50)=1 microg/mL) to HT-29 human colon cancer cells.
11456508,1,2001,J Am Chem Soc,Synthesis, structures, and reactivity of weakly coordinating anions with delocalized borate structure: the assessment of anion effects in metallocene polymerization catalysts.,The formation of adducts of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane with strongly coordinating anions such as CN(-) and [M(CN)(4)](2)(-) (M = Ni, Pd) is a synthetically facile route to the bulky, very weakly coordinating anions [CN[B(C(6)F(5))(3)](2)](-) and [M[CNB(C(6)F(5))(3)](4)](2-) which are isolated as stable NHMe(2)Ph(+) and CPh(3)(+) salts. The crystal structures of [CPh(3)][CN[B(C(6)F(5))(3)](2)] (1), [CPh(3)][ClB(C(6)F(5))(3)] (2), [NHMe(2)Ph](2)[Ni[CNB(C(6)F(5))(3)](4)].2Me(2)CO (4b.2Me(2)CO), [CPh(3)](2)[Ni[CNB(C(6)F(5))(3)](4)].2CH(2)Cl(2) (4c.2CH(2)Cl(2)), and [CPh(3)](2)[Pd[CNB(C(6)F(5))(3)](4)].2CH(2)Cl(2) (5c.2CH(2)Cl(2)) are reported. The CN stretching frequencies in 4 and 5 are shifted by approximately 110 cm(-1) to higher wavenumbers compared to the parent tetracyano complexes in aqueous solution, although the M-C and C-N distances show no significant change on B(C(6)F(5))(3) coordination. Zirconocene dimethyl complexes L(2)ZrMe(2) [L(2) = Cp(2), SBI = rac-Me(2)Si(Ind)(2)] react with 1, 4c or 5c in benzene solution at 20 degrees C to give the salts of binuclear methyl-bridged cations, [(L(2)ZrMe)(2)(mu-Me)][CN[B(C(6)F(5))(3)](2)] and [(L(2)ZrMe)(2)(mu-Me)](2)[M[CNB(C(6)F(5))(3)](4)]. The reactivity of these species in solution was studied in comparison with the known [[(SBI)ZrMe](2)(mu-Me)][B(C(6)F(5))(4)]. While the latter reacts with excess [CPh(3)][B(C(6)F(5))(4)] in benzene to give the mononuclear ion pair [(SBI)ZrMe(+).B(C(6)F(5))(4)(-)] in a pseudo-first-order reaction, k = 3 x 10(-4) s(-1), [(L(2)ZrMe)(2)(mu-Me)][CN[B(C(6)F(5))(3)](2)] reacts to give a mixture of L(2)ZrMe(mu-Me)B(C(6)F(5))(3) and L(2)ZrMe(mu-NC)B(C(6)F(5))(3). Recrystallization of [Cp' '(2)Zr(mu-Me)(2)AlMe(2)][CN[B(C(6)F(5))(3)](2)] affords Cp' '(2)ZrMe(mu-NC)B(C(6)F(5))(3) 6, the X-ray structure of which is reported. The stability of [(L(2)ZrMe)(2)(mu-Me)](+)X(-) decreases in the order X = [B(C(6)F(5))(4)] &gt; [M[CNB(C(6)F(5))(3)](4)] &gt; [CN[B(C(6)F(5))(3)](2)] and increases strongly with the steric bulk of L(2) = Cp(2) &lt; SBI. Activation of (SBI)ZrMe(2) by 1 in the presence of AlBu(i)(3) gives extremely active ethene polymerization catalysts. Polymerization studies at 1-7 bar monomer pressure suggest that these, and by implication most other highly active ethene polymerization catalysts, are strongly mass-transport limited. By contrast, monitoring propene polymerization activities with the systems (SBI)ZrMe(2)/1/AlBu(i)(3) and CGCTiMe(2)/1/AlBu(i)(3) at 20 degrees C as a function of catalyst concentration demonstrates that in these cases mass-transport limitation is absent up to [metal] approximately 2 x 10(-5) mol L(-1). Propene polymerization activities decrease in the order [CN[B(C(6)F(5))(3)](2)](-) &gt; [B(C(6)F(5))(4)](-) &gt; [M[CNB(C(6)F(5))(3)](4)](2-) &gt; [MeB(C(6)F(5))(3)](-), with differences in activation barriers relative to [CN[B(C(6)F(5))(3)](2)](-) of DeltaDeltaG = 1.1 (B(C(6)F(5))(4)(-)), 4.1 (Ni[CNB(C(6)F(5))(3)](4)(2-)) and 10.7-12.8 kJ mol(-)(1) (MeB(C(6)F(5))(3)(-)). The data suggest that even in the case of very bulky anions with delocalized negative charge the displacement of the anion by the monomer must be involved in the rate-limiting step.
11448039,1,2001,Chromosome Res,Characterization of a mitotic mutant of durum wheat.,An ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mitotic mutant of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum; 2n = 4x = 28) was found. We have characterized the mutant to determine the mechanism of abnormal cell division and to test for temperature effects on abnormal cell division. Stained root-tip meristems and pollen mother cells were studied with brightfield, phase contrast, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Abnormal cells included metaphase cells with a multiple of the normal complement (8x = 56, or 16x = 112), multinucleate cells, 4C, 8C, or 16C mononucleate cells, and cells exhibiting incomplete cytokinesis. The mutant had three classes of pollen mother cells: euploid with normal bivalent pairing, multiploid with bivalent pairing, and multiploid with multivalent pairing. Preprophase bands and spindles were normal in mononucleate cells. Some cells had asymmetrical phragmoplasts and phragmoplast dismantling that produced incomplete cytokinesis. Failure of cytokinesis followed by nuclear fusion were the mechanisms of abnormal cell division. To test for temperature sensitivity of the mutant, seedlings were germinated under six different temperature regimes. As germination temperature increased, the frequency of abnormal cells increased. When the mutant was crossed as the female with durum wheat, 3% of hybrids were hexaploid, indicating that functional-unreduced gametes had formed in megaspores.
11429776,1,2001,Cytometry,Growth kinetics of algal populations exsymbiotic from Paramecium bursaria by flow cytometry measurements.,BACKGROUND: The ciliate Paramecium bursaria normally exists as a green paramecium system because each animal cell carries several hundred, unicellular, green, algal cells in its cytoplasm. One of the remarkable and poorly understood pecularities of this system is the steady state in the number of algae per protozoan cell. A major point in the study of mechanisms governing the persistence of symbiont numbers is adequate understanding of the algal life cycle.METHODS: Asynchronously growing cell populations of several algal strains (SA-1, SA-3, and SA-9) exsymbiotic from P. bursaria were characterized by flow cytometry. Algal endogenous chlorophyll and DNA contents were monitored to analyze cell growth kinetics at logarithmic and stationary culture phases. Cell sorting visualized the morphology of algae corresponding to the hyperhaploid (2C and 4C) DNA peaks.RESULTS: Cell-division cycle-dependent changes in chlorophyll and DNA content distributions were most dramatic in logarithmically growing algal populations (an increase in the number of S-phase cells and cells with more chlorophyll), which are thought to be associated with accelerated DNA and chlorophyll metabolism in log-phase algal cultures. Upon reaching the stationary phase of growth, algal populations distinctly showed, in addition to one haploid (1C) DNA peak, two hyperhaploid peaks (2C and 4C) corresponding mainly to cells with two and four nuclei, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Growth characteristics of algae exsymbiotic from P. bursaria monitored by flow cytometry provide valuable information for the analysis of the algal life cycle, which is important for understanding the regulation mechanisms of symbiont numbers.
11411987,1,2001,Chemistry,Copper(II) complexes of aminocarbohydrate beta-ketoenaminic ligands: efficient catalysts in catechol oxidation.,Copper(II) complexes of tridentate dianionic beta-ketoenaminic ligands derived from differently functionalized amino-deoxyglucoses were synthesized and characterized with respect to their structural, spectroscopic, and catalytic properties. The (probably dimeric) complex [1,2-O-isopropylidene-6-N-(3-acetyl-2-oxobut-3-enyl)amino-6-deoxyglucofuranoso)copper(II) Cu(3a) was a highly efficient catalyst for the catechol-oxidase-like oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (dtbc) into 3,5-ditert-butylquinone (dtbq) by molecular oxygen (kcat=2.63s(-1)). In contrast to this magnetically &quot;normal&quot; complex Cu(3a), the analogous dinuclear complex [[Cu(2a)]2], derived from the isomeric amino sugar 5-amino-5-deoxyglucofuranose, forms six-membered chelate rings with the sugar moiety and has very strong antiferromagnetic-coupled copper atoms (resulting in a diamagnetic ground state). It has a rather insignificant activity (kcat &lt; 10(-3)s(-1)). The ligand H2 1a, derived from a (protected) 6-amino-6-deoxyglucopyranose, forms a trinuclear complex [[Cu(1a)]]2.Cu(OAc)2] in which two basic formula units are bridged by one copper acetate. This compound and the complex derived from an (isomeric) aminodeoxyglucopyranose ([Cu(4a)]: kcat approximately equals 0.03 s(-1)) show moderate activity. All complexes with a peripheral ethoxycarbonyl group instead of the acetyl substituent R2, Cu(1b)-Cu(3b) and Cu(4c), are inactive. The complexes derived from 2-hydroxocyclohexylamine, Cu(5a) and Cu(5c), which were used as models of the active complex Cu(3a), have the typical &quot;cubane-like&quot; tetranuclear structure known from many copper complexes with derivatives of saturated 2-aminoalcohols. They are inactive with respect to the activation of dioxygen.
11406754,1,2001,J Infect Chemother,Increase of R5 HIV-1 infection and CCR5 expression in T cells treated with high concentrations of CXCR4 antagonists and SDF-1.,The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 are considered to be potential targets for the inhibition of HIV-1 replication. We found that the synthetic peptides T134 and T140 (see text for full names) inhibited X4 HIV-1 infection with selectivity and low toxicity because they acted as CXCR4 antagonists. However, high concentrations of T134, T140, and ALX40-4C (see text for full name) increased the expression of CCR5 and R5 HIV-1 infection, as did stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1). In contrast to CXCR4 antagonists and SDF-1, viral monocyte inflammatory protein (vMIP) II inhibited not only anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) but also inhibited anti-CCR5 MAb binding to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and inhibited both X4 and R5 HIV-1 strains. T134, T140, ALX40-4C, and SDF-1 increased viral transcription in the treated cells. In addition, ALX40-4C and SDF-1 also increased nuclear transcription factor (NF)-kappaB. However, the mechanisms of action of T134 and T140 are different from those of clinically used anti-HIV drugs. Thus, synergistic activities were observed in the concomitant treatment with T134 and reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors. Our findings, presented here, are noteworthy in regard to the potential clinical use of these agents as drugs for the treatment of AIDS.
11397152,1,2001,J Org Chem,A new synthesis of 2-azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes.,An efficient synthesis of the 2-azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane ring system has been accomplished starting from cis-cyclobut-3-ene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride 7, which was prepared using a photochemical method. The key step of this new strategy involved a stereoselective electrophilic addition of phenylselenyl bromide to the double bond of cyclobutene dicarbamate 16 derived from 7. The subsequent ring closure of 17a in the presence of sodium hydride afforded the 2-azabicyclohexane compound 18 with a satisfying overall yield. Reductive removal of the phenylselenyl group and subsequent deprotection led rapidly to the amino derivative 4a functionalized on the carbon ring. Syntheses of the hydroxy and carboxylic derivatives 4b,c were then achieved from the intermediary disulfonamide 23. Displacement of the activated amino group by potassium acetate yielded hydroxy derivative 4b after three additional steps. Finally, oxidation of the alcohol function of 4b under Jones conditions followed by hydrogenolysis afforded the carboxylic derivative 4c, which is the first reported beta-isomer of 2,4-methanoproline 1.
11373160,1,2001,Placenta,Polyploidization in the trophoblast and uterine glandular epithelium of the endotheliochorial placenta of silver fox (Vulpes fulvus Desm.), as revealed by the DNA content.,Dynamics of genome multiplication during establishment of interrelations between trophoblast and glandular epithelium of the endometrium has been studied in the course of formation of placenta in the silver fox. During formation of the placenta, penetration of the trophoblast into the zone of the endometrial glandular epithelium and of endometrial blood vessels into the zone of expanding trophoblast occurs. The trophoblast, which gradually replaces epithelium and a part of the stroma of the endometrium, closely adjoins endometrial vessels but does not disrupt them, thereby the endotheliochorial placenta is formed. Cytophotometric measurements of the DNA content in trophoblast nuclei have shown that most of them are polyploid: predominantly 4-64c, occasionally 128c and 256c. Polyploidy of the trophoblast may be a consequence of various types of polyploidizing mitoses. Cytophotometric measurements of the DNA content in mitotic figures have revealed the presence of mitoses of diploid cells, i.e. with the DNA amount of 4c (2n), and polyploid cells, i.e. 8c (4n), and 16c (8n), therefore trophoblast cells in the silver fox placenta are able to enter mitosis up to the octaploid level. Higher degrees of polyploidy in the trophoblast cells seem to be achieved by endoreduplication. Polyploidization of the uterine glandular epithelial cells during placentation in the silver fox occurs until the level of 8c. Thus, the tissue-specific response of the uterus to the implanting embryo consists of active proliferation and polyploidization of the glandular epithelium, which may compensate formation of prominent population of decidual cells (i.e., connective tissue cells). In the endotheliochorial placenta of the silver fox the regularity is confirmed that cells of both maternal and fetal origin are, as a rule, polyploid in sites of their contact in placenta, which may be of protective significance in the contact of allogenic organisms.
11304178,1,2001,J Org Chem,Ketene reactions with the aminoxyl radical tempo: preparative, kinetic, and theoretical studies.,Tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPO, TO*) reacts with ketenes RR(1)C=C=O generated by either Wolff rearrangement or by dehydrochlorination of acyl chlorides to give products resulting from addition of one TEMPO radical to the carbonyl carbon and a second to the resulting radical. Reactions of phenylvinylketenes 4b and 4f, phenylalkynylketene 4c, and the dienylketene AcOCMe=CHCH=CHCMe=C=O (11) occur with allylic or propargylic rearrangement. Even quite reactive ketenes were generated as rather long-lived species by photochemical Wolff rearrangement in isooctane solution, characterized by IR and UV, and used for kinetic studies. The rate constants of TEMPO addition to eight different ketenes have been measured and give a qualitative correlation of log k(2)(TEMPO) = 1.10 log k(H(2)O) -3.79 with the rate constants for hydration of the same ketenes. Calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G//B3LYP/6-311G level are used to elucidate the ring opening of substituted cyclobutenones leading to vinylketenes and of 2,4-cyclohexadienone (17) forming 1,3,5-hexatrien-1-one (18).
11151363,1,2001,Inorg Chem,Insertion of CO2, CS2, and COS into iron(II)-hydride bonds.,The reactions between cis-Fe(dmpe)2H2 (dmpe = Me2PCH2CH2PMe2) (1) or cis-Fe(PP3)H2 (PP3 = P(CH2CH2PMe2)3) (2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon disulfide (CS2), and carbonyl sulfide (COS) are investigated. At 300 K, additions of CO2 (1 atm), CS2 (2 equiv), and COS (1 atm) to 1 result in the formation of a stable transformato hydride, trans-Fe(dmpe)2(OCHO)H (3a), a trans-dithioformato hydride, trans-Fe(dmpe)2(SCHS)H (4a), and a trans-thioformato hydride, trans-Fe(dmpe)2(SCHO)H (5a), respectively. When CS2 and COS are added to cis-Fe(dmpe)2H2 at 195 K, a cis-dithioformato hydride, 4b, and a cis-thioformato hydride, 5b, respectively, are observed as the initially formed products, but there is no evidence of the corresponding cis-formato hydride upon addition of CO2 to cis-Fe(dmpe)2H2. Additions of excess CO2, CS2, and COS to 1 at lower temperatures (195-240 K) result in the formation of a trans-bis(formate), trans-Fe(dmpe)2(OCHO)2 (3b), a trans-bis(dithioformate), trans-Fe(dmpe)2(SCHS)2 (4c), and a cis-bis(thioformate), cis-Fe(dmpe)2(SCHO)2 (5c), respectively. trans-Fe(dmpe)2(SCHO)2 (5d) is prepared by the addition of excess COS at 300 K. Additions of CO2 (1 atm), CS2 (0.75 equiv), and COS (1 atm) to 2 at 300 K result in the formation of a thermally stable, geometrically constrained cis-formato hydride, cis-Fe(PP3)(OCHO)H (6a), a cis-dithioformato hydride, cis-Fe(PP3)(SCHS)H (7a), and a cis-thioformato hydride, cis-Fe(PP3)(SCHO)H (8a), respectively. Additions of excess CO2 and COS to 2 yield a cis-bis(formate), cis-Fe(PP3)(OCHO)2 (6b), and a thermally stable cis-bis(thioformate), cis-Fe(PP3)(SCHO)2 (8b), respectively. All complexes are characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, with IR spectroscopy and elemental analyses confirming structures of thermally stable complexes where possible. Complexes 3b and 5a are also characterized by X-ray crystallography.
11752762,0,2001,Acta Crystallogr A,A guided simulated annealing method for crystallography.,A new optimization algorithm, the guided simulated annealing method, for use in X-ray crystallographic studies is presented. In the traditional simulated annealing method, the search for the global minimum of a cost function is only determined by the ratio of energy change to the temperature. This method designs a new quality function to guide the search for a minimum. Using a multiresolution process, the method is much more efficient in finding the global minimum than the traditional method. Results for two large molecules, isoleucinomycin (C(60)H(102)N(6)O(18)) and an alkyl calix (C(72)H(112)O(8). 4C(2)H(6)O), with different space groups are reported.
11749616,0,2001,J Org Chem,Synthesis of optically active 2-alkoxy-2H-pyran-3(6H)-ones. Their use as dienophiles in Diels-Alder cycloadditions.,Optically active 2-alkoxy-2H-pyran-3(6H)-ones (4a-d) were synthesized in one step by the tin(IV) chloride-promoted glycosylation and rearrangement of the 2-acetoxy-3,4-di-O-acetyl-D-xylal (3) prepared from D-xylose (1). The absolute configuration of the new stereocenter at C-2 was determined by chemical transformation of the dihydropyranones 4a and 4b into the known alkyl pentopyranosides (7a and 7b, respectively). Also, from (1)H NMR experiments using a chiral ytterbium shift reagent, the enantiomeric excesses for 4a (&gt;86%) and 4b (&gt;77%) were established. Enantiomerically pure 4c and 4d were obtained by reaction of 3 with chiral 2-octanol (R and S, respectively). Dihydropyranones 4a-d were employed as dienophiles in Diels-Alder cycloadditions with 2,3-dimethylbutadiene and butadiene. Under thermal conditions, only moderate yields (approximately 50%) of cycloadducts 9a-c and 10a were respectively obtained with good diastereofacial selectivity (&gt;80%). Optimized Lewis acid promoted cycloadditions led to 9a-d and 10a,c in higher yields (approximately 80%) and with higher diastereoselectivities (&gt;94%). The major products were formed by approach of the dienes from the less hindered face of the dihydropyranones, and the minor products (such as 11a) were formed by addition from the opposite side. Furthermore, cycloadduct 9a was stable in an alkaline solution, whereas 11a underwent epimerization under the same conditions.
11711284,0,2001,Bioorg Med Chem,Syntheses and biological evaluation of alkanediamines as antioxidant and hypolipidemic agents.,A new series of compounds belonging to N,N'- [bis (1-aryl-6-hydroxy-hex-2-ene-1-one-3-yl)-1,n-alkanediamines (2-5a-f) have been synthesized and evaluated for antioxidant and hypolipidemic activities. Amongst all the synthesized compounds, seven compounds namely 2c, 2e, 4c, 5b, 5c, 5e and 5f exhibit potent antioxidant activity. These compounds have also been evaluated for hypolipidemic activity.
11710043,0,2001,Biomacromolecules,Thermodynamics of conformational ordering of iota-carrageenan in KCl solutions using high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry.,Thermodynamic properties of aqueous solutions of iota-carrageenan as affected by KCl (0.15-1.2 M) or iota-carrageenan (0.5-6 mg/mL) content were studied by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry. The polysaccharide was found to undergo two consecutive cooperative conformational transitions, which can be represented by the scheme: [H2]2&lt;--&gt;2H2&lt;--&gt;4C where C is the random coil, H2 is the double helix, and [H2]2 is the double helix dimer. The first transition follows by the &quot;all or none&quot; mechanism. The profile of the second transition resembles that of a second-order phase transition. The parameter sigma (of order 1), estimated for this latter transition, suggests that the stacking effect in helices of iota-carrageenan is rather small. The cooperativity of the transition is mainly defined by the loop factor. Free energies of both transitions at 273 K were calculated as a function of salt concentration. These experimental data were found to agree with Manning's theory.
11703172,0,2001,Biochemistry (Mosc),Cationic inhibitors of serine proteinases from buckwheat seeds.,Preparations of low molecular weight protein inhibitors of serine proteinases have been obtained from buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) seeds by chromatography of seed extract on trypsin-Sepharose 4B, Mono-Q, and Mono-S ion exchangers (FPLC regime). Their molecular masses, determined by mass spectrometry, were 5203 (BWI-1c), 5347 (BWI-2c), 7760 (BWI-3c), and 6031 daltons (BWI-4c). All of the inhibitors possess high pH- and thermal stability in the pH range 2-12. In addition to trypsin, BWI-3c and BWI-4c inhibited chymotrypsin and subtilisin-like bacterial proteases. The N-terminal sequences of all of the inhibitors were determined: BWI-1c (23 residues), BWI-2c (33 residues), BWI-3c (18 residues), and BWI-4c (20 residues). In their physicochemical properties and N-terminal amino acid sequences, the buckwheat seed trypsin inhibitors BWI-3c and BWI-4c appear to belong to potato proteinase inhibitor I family.
11698147,0,2001,Neurosci Lett,Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficiency produces aberrant neurite outgrowth of rodent neuroblastoma used to model the neurological disorder Lesch Nyhan syndrome.,Lesch Nyhan syndrome (LNS) manifests in bizarre and horrific neurological symptoms, the primary cause being a deficiency of the purine salvage enzyme, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). How and why this enzyme deficiency leads to abnormal brain development is unknown. To investigate this phenomenon the present study was designed to examine if the growth of two HGPRT-deficient neuroblastomas, mouse N2aTG and rat B103-4C was different with respect to their corresponding control cell lines, N2a and B103. Data is provided showing that compared to control cell lines, HGPRT-deficient cells proliferated less and exhibited greater morphological complexity. If these abnormalities occur during neurogenesis of human HGPRT-deficient brain neurones, they could profoundly influence central nervous system development and thus, may form the aetiological basis for the symptoms of LNS.
11690646,0,2001,Biochim Biophys Acta,Cloning and sequence analysis of cDNAs encoding the heavy and light chain variable regions of an Ab2beta anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody possessing an internal image of cocaine.,We report here the cloning and sequence analysis of cDNAs encoding the variable regions of an Ab2beta anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody (K1-4c, gamma1kappa) that mimics the configuration of cocaine. The Ab2beta specifically binds to the human dopamine transporter as shown by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The sequence of the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 of K1-4c is strikingly similar to that of a monoclonal antibody (F11.2.32) specific for HIV-1 protease. Three or four amino acids in the epitope recognized by the anti-HIV-1 protease antibody are also present in the third extracellular loop of the dopamine transporter. This epitope is within the conserved region of the known transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin in Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster.
11675146,0,2001,Antiviral Res,PD0084430: a non-nucleoside inhibitor of human cytomegalovirus replication in vitro.,Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised individuals. Current therapies target viral DNA replication and accumulate mutations that yield cross-resistance among the approved drugs. A novel, non-nucleoside inhibitor of HCMV replication, PD0084430, was identified in a screening assay using the HCMV beta-galactosidase recombinant RC256. The EC(50) for PD0084430 by inhibition of beta-galactosidase production is 1+/-0.7 microM. This antiviral activity was confirmed by yield reduction and plaque reduction assays using HCMV strain AD169. The TC(50) of PD0084430 as measured by (4C)thymidine incorporation is approximately 30 microM and by XTT is approximately 90 microM. The TC(50) for inhibition of cellular proliferation is approximately 20 microM. Time of addition experiments displayed a similar drop in efficacy for both PD0084430 and GCV when added after the onset of viral DNA replication. The transcomplementation assay for viral DNA replication, using a transfected ori(Lyt) containing plasmid, confirmed that viral DNA synthesis was inhibited at the same concentrations that showed antiviral activity. Western blots showed no apparent block of immediate early or early gene expression. Two ganciclovir (GCV) resistant isolates of HCMV tested showed no cross-resistance to PD0084430. These data suggested a potentially promising novel compound that inhibited HCMV at or before viral DNA replication. However, in vivo testing in mice dosed either orally or intraperitoneally showed rapid glucuronidation on the -OH group. SAR studies on this backbone showed that the -OH group was essential for the antiviral activity in vitro.
11674170,0,2001,J Org Chem,Straightforward Construction of Fused 6,7,5-Tricarbocyclic Systems by Tandem [5 + 2]/[4 + 2] Cycloadditions.,One-pot coupling of an intramolecular thermal [5C + 2C] pyrone-alkene cycloaddition to a [4C + 2C] Diels-Alder reaction provides immediate access to 6,7,5-tricarbocyclic systems bearing a 1,4-oxa-bridge in the seven-membered carbocycle. The transformation entails the net formation of four carbon-carbon bonds and creates three new cycles and a minimum of five new stereocenters. Preliminary attempts to open the oxa-bridge by reaction of the adducts with samarium diiodide and trimethylsilyl triflate led to relatively unexpected deoxygenated and aromatized products.

11671854,0,2001,J Org Chem,A Facile Synthesis of Tetra- and Dihydronaphthalene Derivatives by Excimer Laser Photolysis of 1,2-Bis(substituted-methyl)benzenes in the Presence of Olefins and Acetylene.,o-Quinodimethane (3A) was generated effectively by excimer laser photolyses of 1,2-bis(phenoxymethyl)benzene (1-O), 1,2-bis[(phenylthio)methyl]benzene (1-S), and 1,2-bis[(phenylseleno)methyl]benzene (1-Se) in acetonitrile solutions via a two-photon process, which was followed by cycloaddition of 3A with several dienophiles-maleic anhydride (4a), dimethyl maleate (4b), dimethyl fumarate (4c), fumaronitrile (4d), and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (4e)-to give corresponding cycloadducts 5. Three kinds of excimer lasers, namely, KrF (248 nm), XeCl (308 nm), and XeF (351 nm) excimer lasers were used for the reaction. The KrF excimer laser was found to be most effective for obtaining high consumption of 1-(O, S, Se) and yield of 5; the maximum yield of the cycloadduct obtained was 48%.
11670998,0,2001,Inorg Chem,Kinetic and Mechanistic Aspects of Sulfur Recovery from Pd(2)I(2)(&amp;mgr;-S)(&amp;mgr;-dpm)(2) Using I(2) and Structures of Pd(II) Complexes with the Chelated Monosulfide of dpm.,The Pd(2)X(2)(&amp;mgr;-S)(dpm)(2) complexes (2) (X = I, Br) react with halogens to yield PdX(2)(dpm) (3) and elemental sulfur. Kinetic and mechanistic studies on the X = I system in CHCl(3) reveal that the reaction proceeds via addition of I(2) to give Pd(2)I(4)(dpm)(2) (4c), which then undergoes unimolecular decomposition to generate PdI(2)(dpm) (3c); the liberated sulfur concatenates to form elemental S(8). The addition reaction is in the stopped-flow time regime and is first-order in both 2c and I(2), with DeltaH() = 32 +/- 1 kJ mol(-)(1) and DeltaS() = -91 +/- 3 J K(-)(1) mol(-)(1). The slower decomposition reaction of 4c is first order in 4c, with DeltaH() = 80 +/-1 kJ mol(-)(1) and DeltaS() = -26 +/- 3 J K(-)(1) mol(-)(1). Byproduct PdX(2)(dpm(S)) (5) [dpm(S) = Ph(2)PCH(2)P(S)Ph(2)] also forms under some conditions via reaction of 3 with an S(n)() species (n &lt; 8). Complexes 5 (X = Cl (a), Br (b), I (c)) were also synthesized directly, and the structure of the 5c species, as well as of [Pd(dpm(S))(2)]Cl(2), were determined by X-ray analyses that reveal the envelope configuration of the five-membered chelate ring.
11670369,0,2001,Inorg Chem,Steric Modulation of Electrocatalytic Benzyl Alcohol Oxidation by [Ru(trpy)(R(2)dppi)(O)](2+) Complexes.,The complexes [Ru(trpy)(H(2)dppi)Cl](+) (1a), [Ru(trpy)(Me(2)dppi)Cl](+) (1b), and [Ru(trpy)(Cl(2)dppi)Cl](+) (1c), where trpy is 2,2',2&quot;-terpyridine, H(2)dppi is 3,6-bis(pyrid-2-yl)pyridazine, Me(2)dppi is 3,6-bis(6-methylpyrid-2-yl)pyridazine, and Cl(2)dppi is 3,6-bis(6-chloropyrid-2-yl)pyridazine, were synthesized and characterized by UV-visible and (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Compounds 1a and 1b were additionally characterized by X-ray crystallography. [Ru(trpy)(H(2)dppi)Cl](PF(6)).2CH(3)CN crystallizes in the triclinic space group, P&amp;onemacr;, with a = 8.628(1) Å, b = 14.586(2) Å, c = 14.963(2) Å, alpha = 70.857(8) degrees, beta = 77.70(1) degrees, gamma = 74.29(1) degrees, V = 1696.5(4) Å(3), and Z = 2; R(1) = 0.0739 (I &gt; 2sigma(I)) with 5920 unique reflections. [Ru(trpy)(Me(2)dppi)Cl](PF(6)).0.5(CH(3)CH(2))(2)O crystallizes in the triclinic space group P&amp;onemacr;, with a = 8.820(2) Å, b = 13.580(2) Å, c = 15.260(2) Å, alpha = 88.84(1) degrees, beta = 74.25(1) degrees, gamma = 73.27(1) degrees, V = 1681.4(5) Å(3), and Z = 2; R(1) = 0.0693 (I &gt; 2sigma(I)) with 4407 unique reflections. Reaction of 1a, 1b, and 1c with aqueous silver ion produces the corresponding aqua complexes, 2a, 2b, and 2c, which, after dissolution in acetonitrile, form the analogous acetonitrile complexes, 4a, 4b, and 4c. [Ru(trpy)(H(2)dppi)(CH(3)CN)](PF(6))(ClO(4)).2 CH(3)CN, 4a, crystallizes in the triclinic space group P&amp;onemacr;, with a = 12.376(1) Å, b = 12.835(2) Å, c = 13.029(2) Å, alpha = 109.252(9) degrees, beta = 102.766(8) degrees, gamma = 90.847(9) degrees, V = 1896.9(3) Å(3), and Z = 2; R(1) = 0.0397 (I &gt; 2sigma(I)) with 4844 unique reflections. {[Ru(trpy)(Cl(2)dppi)(CH(3)CN)](ClO(4))(2)}(2).CH(3)CN, 4c, crystallizes in the triclinic space group, P&amp;onemacr;, with a = 13.075(2) Å, b = 16.807(3) Å, c = 17.913(2) Å, alpha = 70.83(1) degrees, beta = 89.76(1) degrees, gamma = 82.44(1) degrees, V = 3682.6(1) Å(3), and Z = 2; R(1) = 0.0777 (I &gt; 2sigma(I)) with 9459 unique reflections. The redox properties of 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, and 2c were examined using cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemistry. In acetonitrile, compounds 1a, 1b, and 1c display reversible 1e(-) waves assigned to the Ru(III)/Ru(II) couple, while, in aqueous solutions, 2a, 2b, and 2c show pH-dependent, 2e(-) waves corresponding to the formation of Ru(IV)=O complexes. Second-order rate constants, k(cat), for benzyl alcohol oxidation by the Ru(IV)=O complexes were determined electrochemically, yielding values of 22(1) M(-)(1) s(-)(1) for [Ru(trpy)(H(2)dppi)(O)](2+), 9(3) M(-)(1) s(-)(1) for [Ru(trpy)(Me(2)dppi)(O)](2+), and 6(4) M(-)(1) s(-)(1) for [Ru(trpy)(Cl(2)dppi)(O)](2+). Interestingly, the Ru(IV)=O complex with the highest reduction potential ([Ru(trpy)(Cl(2)dppi)(O)](2+)) is the slowest catalyst for benzyl alcohol oxidation. The unusual driving-force dependence of the oxidation rates exhibited by these complexes can be attributed to steric effects that result from incorporating chloro or methyl groups into the 6- and 6'-positions of the dppi ligand. These data are consistent with a mechanism in which the rate-determining step involves preassociation of the substrate with the Ru(IV)=O unit.
11605655,0,2001,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo),Studies on anthracenes. 3. Synthesis, lipid peroxidation and cytotoxic evaluation of 10-substituted 1,5-dichloro-9(10H)-anthracenone derivatives.,The synthesis of a series of 1,5-dichloro-9(10H)-anthracenones bearing O-linked and N-linked substituents in the 10-position are described. Previous studies have shown that 9-acyloxy 1,5-dichloroanthracenes and 9-acyloxy 1,8-dichloroanthracenes displayed a potential cytotoxic effect. These results have encouraged us in further investigation of potential anthracenone derivatives. Therefore, a series of 10-substituted 1,8-dichloro-9(10H)-anthracenone derivatives were synthesized. These compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of human oral epidermoid carcinoma cells (KB cell line), human cervical carcinoma cells of ME 180 (GBM 8401) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, respectively. Compounds 3c and 4c of this series compare favorably in the KB cellular assay with mitoxantrone. Compound 4c showed combined inhibitory action against KB, GBM and CHO cell growth, respectively. In addition, redox property of the compounds for the inhibition of lipid peroxidation in model membranes was determined. Compounds 4b and 4d exhibited stronger antioxidant activity than ascorbic acid, (+)-alpha-tocopherol and mitoxantrone, respectively.
11600777,0,2001,Acta Crystallogr C,Conformational comparison of five follicular fluid meiosis-activating sterol-related active and inactive compounds.,The crystal structures of five follicular fluid meiosis-activating sterol-related Delta(8,14)-sterol compounds are presented. These are 4,4-dimethyl-23-phenyl-24-nor-5alpha-chola-8,14-dien-3beta-ol, C(31)H(44)O, 4,4-dimethyl-22-phenyl-23,24-dinor-5alpha-chola-8,14-dien-3beta-ol, C(30)H(42)O, (20R)-4,4-dimethyl-22-oxa-5alpha,20-cholesta-8,14,24-trien-3beta-ol, C(28)H(44)O(2), 4,4-dimethyl-23-phenyl-22-oxa-24-nor-5alpha-chola-8,14-dien-3beta-ol-water (4/1), 4C(30)H(42)O(2).H(2)O, and 4,4-dimethyl-5alpha-cholesta-8,14-dien-3-one, C(29)H(46)O. Two of the derivatives are inactive and three are active as agonists. Preliminary structure-activity relationship studies showed that the positions of the double bonds in the skeleton and the structures of the side chains are important determinants for activity. The conformations of the skeletons were compared with double-bond isomers retrieved from the Cambridge Structural Database [Allen &amp; Kennard (1993). Chem. Des. Autom. News, 8, 1, 31-37]; no significant differences were found. Thus, conformational changes induced by the double bonds are not discriminative with respect to the activity of the compounds. Comparisons of the side-chain conformations of active and inactive structures revealed that the crystal structures were not conclusive as far as correlation of conformation and activity of the side chains were concerned.
11516526,0,2001,Toxicology,Evaluation of teniposide (VM-26)-induced toxicity on mouse spermatogenesis by flow cytometry.,Alteration in the testicular weight and various germ cell populations was studied in male mice treated with different doses (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg b. wt.) of teniposide (VM-26) at various post-treatment time periods. Treatment of mice with different doses of teniposide did not significantly alter the testicular weights, irrespective of the drug dose used. Flow-cytometric analysis of germ cells of the untreated control mice testes revealed four distinct DNA peaks corresponding to elongated spermatids (HC), round spermatids (1C), spermatogonia and non-germ cells (2C) and primary spermatocytes (4C). The region between 2C and 4C peaks represents cells that are actively synthesizing DNA (S-phase cells). Treatment of mice with different doses of teniposide resulted in a significant depletion in the relative percentage of spermatogonia from day 2 to 35 post-treatment depending on the drug dose. DNA-synthesizing, i.e. S-phase, cells declined significantly at day 1 post-treatment and continued to decline up to day 70 post-treatment for all the drug doses studied, except 2 mg/kg drug dose at day 28 post-treatment. A significant decline in the relative percentage of primary spermatocytes (4C) was observed at day 7 that continued up to day 70 post-treatment depending on the drug dose. Round spermatids (1C) declined significantly at day 21 post-treatment after administration of 0.25--2.0 mg/kg VM-26. The relative percentage of elongated spermatids showed a significant decline at day 28 after 1 and 2 mg/kg drug treatment. These alterations in different germ-cell populations are reflected in the various germ-cell ratios. The 4C:2C ratio showed a significant decline at day 7 and 14 post-treatment after 1 and 2 mg/kg VM-26 treatment, while the 1C:2C ratio declined significantly at day 21 post-treatment in the mice treated with 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg of VM-26. 4C:S-phase and 1C:4C ratios increased significantly from day 1 to 70 post-treatment, depending on the drug dose. Our study demonstrates that the treatment of mice with low doses of VM-26 exerts cytotoxic effects on various germ-cell populations.
11432938,0,2001,J Exp Bot,Dormancy and proliferation in Saccharum officinarumxS. spontaneum hybrids which differ in the number of the introgressed S. spontaneum chromosomes.,Proliferating cells remain transiently blocked at different cycle compartments until specific stressors are removed or until the cells become adapted to their presence. This paper investigates the efficiency of cycle blocks in three sugarcane hybrids with the full noble cane (Saccharum officinarum) genome (2n=8x=80) but differing in the number of introgressed S. spontaneum (2n=8x=64) chromosomes. The My5514, B42231 and C236-51 cultivars possess 20, 30 and 40 additional S. spontaneum chromosomes, respectively. Flow cytometry showed that over 90% of cells were accumulated with a 2C DNA content in their dormant primordia. The presence of S. spontaneum chromosomes decreased the low stringency of the 4C block. The greater the number of these chromosomes, the lower was the number of quiescent cells with a 4C DNA content (P&lt;0.05). Shortly after stimulation of the primordia (85% relative humidity and 30 degrees C), i.e. in the 2 mm long roots, a negative correlation was found between the number of introgressed S. spontaneum chromosomes and the frequency of cells undergoing replication and mitosis. On the other hand, when roots were already proliferating under steady-state conditions (15 mm long roots) the more S. spontaneum chromosomes the cells possessed, the longer the relative time it took for all chromosomes to replicate and segregate, and the longer the relative time they spent in G(2), with the 4C DNA content. The presence of S. spontaneum chromosomes seems to be recognized by these proliferating cells as a stressor which preferentially activates checkpoint pathways operating at the second half of the cycle, but not at its onset.
11421253,0,2001,Farmaco,Glycosyl derivatives of 2-bromosugar of selected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Synthesis and QSAR data.,On the basis of molecular modeling and calculation of physicochemical SAR data we obtained new derivatives of 2-bromosugars 5a-d and 6 for widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Compounds 5a-d and 6 were synthesized as stable, crystalline compounds from the reaction of phosphoroates 1-3 with salicylic acid (4a), aspirin (4b), diclofenac (4c) and indomethacin (4d) in an aprotic solvent. The reaction took place in the presence of silver carbonate as the activator of leaving groups with high stereoselectivity and good yields. The structures of the new derivatives of 5a-d and 6 for NSAIDs were established by spectroscopic methods 1H and 13C NMR, and elemental analyses.
11409565,0,2001,Arch Dermatol Res,Relationship between DNA ploidy-related parameters and the deletions in mismatch repair genes MLH1 and MSH2 in lentigo maligna and malignant melanomas.,Defects in DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and MSH2, first described in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), have been postulated to be responsible for malignant transformation in several tumours. To date there are no data on cutaneous tumours. Using a PCR assay it was possible to identify deletions in MSH2 (exonic regions 12 and 13) in 16 of 47 lentigos maligna and in 10 of 36 malignant melanomas. Deletions in MLH1 (exonic regions 15 and 16) were found in 11 of 47 lentigos and in 15 of 36 melanomas. Comparison of DNA ploidy-related parameters between lentigos with and without exonic deletions in MSH2 and MLH1 did not show any significant differences. In contrast, melanomas positive and negative for exons 12 and 13 (MSH2) (26/36 and 10/36, respectively) differed significantly with respect to the percentages of diploid cells (P = 0.0179) and tetraploid cells (P = 0.0042). Comparison of melanomas positive and negative for exons 15 and 16 (MLH1) (21/36 and 15/36, respectively) showed significant differences in the percentage of aneuploid cells between 2c and 4c (P = 0.0141) and tetraploid cells (P = 0.0404). In summary, deletions in DNA mismatch repair proteins MSH2 and MLH1 were present both in lentigo maligna and in melanomas and correlated with DNA ploidy-related parameters in malignant melanomas.
11411861,0,2001,Eur J Histochem,Nuclear changes in pathogen-infected tomato roots.,We have investigated nuclear changes induced in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) plant roots by two different pathogens, a phytoplasma of the stolbur group and the soil-borne fungus Phytophthora nicotianae var. parasitica, using light and electron microscopy as well as flow cytometry. Our results show that both pathogens strongly influenced nuclear structure, causing pyknosis and chromatolysis, and induced variations in proportion of nuclear populations with different DNA content, increasing the 2C and decreasing the 4C nuclear populations. These latter results suggest a block of the endoreduplication process in the presynthetic phase of the host cell cycle. Moreover, in pathogen-infected roots, nuclei of the same DNA content were less fluorescent, and therefore had a lower DNA content, compared to those of controls, as confirmed by morphological analyses. Our findings suggest that different stimuli may evoke similar nuclear changes, and confirm the usefulness of flow cytometry as a tool to recognize the stress conditions related to the presence of a pathogen.
11352402,0,2001,Histochem J,DNA endoreplication in the clustered supramedullary neurons of the pufferfish Diodon holacanthus L. (osteichthyes).,DNA contents, ranging from 4C to more than 500C, were determined by a quantitative microfluorimetric assay in supramedullary neuron nuclei of the pufferfish Diodon holacanthus. The distribution of C values after ethidium bromide staining indicates an inter- and intra-individual variation in DNA contents which do not correspond to duplications of the total genome, suggesting that DNA replication is specific for particular genes (endoreplication). Moreover, the DNA content appears to be correlated with nuclear size. A relationship between the DNA amounts and the presence of AT- and GC-rich sequences has been shown. This work demonstrates, for the first time, DNA endoreplication in a specific neuronal type in vertebrates.
11313570,0,2001,Acta Crystallogr C,An ion pair uniting a gadolinium(III)-Schiff base complex and uranyl tetrachloride.,The Schiff base N-(tert-butyl)-3-methoxysalicylaldimine (LH) forms a complex with gadolinium(III) chloride, [GdCl(2)(LH)(2)(C(5)H(5)N)(2)](+), in which the two O atoms of each ligand are coordinated (the phenolic O atom being deprotonated) and the imine N atom is protonated and involved in a hydrogen bond with the phenoxide group. This complex crystallizes as an ion pair with uranyl tetrachloride, i.e. bis(bis[2-(tert-butyliminiomethyl)-6-methoxyphenolato-O,O']dichlorobis(pyridine-N)gadolinium(III)) tetrachlorodioxouranium(VI) tetrapyridine solvate [GdCl(2)(C(12)H(17)NO(2))(2)(C(5)H(5)N)(2)](2)[UCl(4)O(2)].4C(5)H(5)N.

11312731,0,2001,Inorg Chem,Syntheses of the first amine-dicarboxyboranes and their bis(methylester) and bis(N-ethylamide) derivatives.,Amine-bis(N-ethylcarbamoyl)boranes [A.BH(CONHEt)(2), 3; A = trimethylamine (Me(3)N, a), quinuclidine (Q, b), pyridine (py, f), 4-picoline (pic, g)] have been prepared after deprotonation of [amine-bis(C-hydroxy-N-ethylimidate)hydroboron(2+)] cations (2), which were formed by the hydrolysis of [amine-bis(ethylnitrilium)hydroboron(2+)]tetrafluoroborates (1). Numerous representatives of 3 [A = diethylamine (Et(2)NH, c), piperidine (pip, d), pyrrolidine (pyrr, e), 4-aminopyridine (4-NH(2)-py, h), 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP, i), imidazole (Him, j), 1-methylimidazole (Mim, k)] have been prepared by base exchange reactions from 3a. 3a-e are extremely stable in aqueous media, either acidic or alkaline, probably because of the considerable steric hindrance of possible reaction centers. However, they were transformed into amine-dicarboxyboranes [A.BH(COOH)(2), 4a-e] in acidic medium under vigorous conditions (100-130 degrees C). This transformation was accompanied by significant decomposition, probably owing to the protonation on the N atom, resulting in the rupture of the B-N bond. As an exception, 4b, where N atom in a rigid bicycle is not prone to attacks, could be isolated in very good yield. On the other hand, amine-bis(N-ethylcarbamoyl)boranes containing amines with sp(2)-hybridized N atoms (3f-k) undergo complete decomposition under similar conditions probably because of the increased hydridic character of the hydrogen adjacent to boron. Base exchange reactions starting from 4b resulted in the ammonium salts of 4c-e, h, i of composition [A.BH(COOH)(COO(-))][AH(+)], which in turn could be transformed into the diacids 4, except 4h, by protonation. As salt formation indicates, the 4 compounds are stronger acids as univalent acids than the corresponding A.BH(2)(COOH) complexes. 4a-e, i were readily esterified into amine-bis(methoxycarbonyl)boranes (5a-e, i) in methanol, employing a catalytic amount of HBr. 5a-e, i are stable in alkaline medium but are readily hydrolyzed in acidic medium. Hydrolysis of [amine-bis(C-methoxy-N-ethylimidate)hydroboron(2+)] cations did not give the corresponding bisesters 5 in alkaline, neutral, or acidic medium.
11288880,0,2001,Chemistry,Syntheses of halogenated ethenyl isocyanide chromium complexes as organometallic precursor molecules for ethenyl and ethynyl isocyanides.,The radical alkylation of tetraethylammonium pentacarbonyl(cyano)chromate 1 yielded the halogenated ethyl isocyanide complexes [(CO)5Cr(CN-CClX-CClYF)] 3 (a, X= Cl, Y= F; b, X = F, Y= F and c, X=Y= Cl). Dehalogenation of 3 using zinc in diethyl ether gave [(CO)5Cr(CN-CX=CFY)] 4. The compounds 4a, b reacted with various nucleophiles exclusively at the difluoromethylene group. The unstable phosphorane 5, which is formed on reaction of 4b with trimethylphosphane, decomposed thermally and on hydrolysis yielding pentacarbonyl(1,2-difluoroethenyl isocyanide)chromium (6). The cyano substituent can be introduced in the beta position of the isocyanide function by reaction of 4a, b with potassium cyanide, leading to the formation of [(CO)5Cr(CN-CX=CF-CN)] (7). Reactions of 4a, b with organolithium or organomagnesium compounds yielded [(CO)5Cr(CN-CX=CF-R)] (8) and [(CO)5Cr(CN-CF=CF-C...C-CF=CF-NC)Cr(CO)5] (10). The trimethylsilyl group in 8a, b, d could be removed by a solution of potassium carbonate in methanol leading to [(CO)5Cr(CN-CX=CF-Cn-H)] (11) (n=2,4). Octacarbonyldicobalt reacted with 8e under coordination of the C-C triple bond to the hexacarbonyldicobalt fragment, resulting in the cluster compound 12. The crystal and molecular structure of 8i, 11 a, b, and 12 were elucidated by X-ray crystallography. The alkenyl and alkynyl isocyanides CN-CCl=CF2 (13a), CN-CF=CF2 (13b), CN-CCl=CClF (13c), CN-CF=CFH (14), CN-CC-H (15), CN-CC-CN (16), and CN-CCl=CF-CN (17) were obtained by flash vacuum pyrolysis of 4a, 4b, 4c, 6, and 7a, respectively.
11263884,0,2001,Org Lett,Novel 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide analogue: adenosine 3',5'-cyclic boranomonophosphate.,A general procedure for the first synthesis of a 3',5'-cyclic boranomonophosphate was established. Specifically, adenosine 3',5'-cyclic boranomonophosphosphate (cyclic AMPB, 4c), a P-borane (BH(3)) analogue of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), was synthesized via a phosphite approach in good yield. The method is also applicable for syntheses of natural cAMP and its phosphorothioate analogue. The two diasteromers of cyclic AMPB 4c were separated, and their chemical structures were established via spectroscopic methods.
11241897,0,2001,Diagn Cytopathol,Relation between DNA ploidy status and the expression of the DNA-mismatch repair genes MLH1 and MSH2 in cytological specimens of melanoma lymph node and liver metastases.,DNA-mismatch repair is essential for preventing genetic instability, and its important protective role has been demonstrated in several tumors. The main aim of this study was to investigate the expression of MLH1 and MSH2 (on the RNA level) in melanoma liver and lymph node metastases, and to define the relation between DNA ploidy status and mismatch repair gene expression. MLH1 was found in 29/33 melanoma lymph node and in 5/17 melanoma liver metastases. MSH2 was present in 26/33 lymph node and 5/17 liver metastases. A comparison of MLH1 and MSH2 positive and negative melanoma metastases showed that there were highly significant differences in the percentages of diploid cells, aneuploid cells between 4c and 8c, octaploid cells, and 5c exceeding rate. This fact confirms the strong relation between the loss of DNA-mismatch repair gene expression and advanced DNA aneuploidy status in melanoma metastases.

The deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) in LNS leads to increased hypoxanthine and uric acid production. We have reported that HGPRT-deficient B103-4C neuroblastoma, a neuronal model of LNS, proliferated less and differentiated more than their HGPRT-positive B103 counterparts. Here, we sought to determine whether differences in proliferation and differentiation would occur when these cells were cultured in the presence of hypoxanthine or in a hypoxanthine-/serum-free chemically defined media (NBMN2). In media with 1% serum, hypoxanthine (50 microM) significantly increased the proliferation of both cell lines with a greater effect on B103-4C cells. In 1% serum media, hypoxanthine increased differentiation of B103 but decreased B103-4C differentiation. In NBMN2, B103 proliferated far more than B103-4C, but both cell types differentiated to the same extent. These results are interpreted to suggest that elevated levels of central nervous system (CNS) hypoxanthine as reported in LNS may affect neuronal development, and to implicate hypoxanthine and abnormal neuronal development as causative factors in the etiology of LNS.
11229748,0,2001,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Synthesis and anticonvulsant activity of novel and potent 1-aryl-7,8-methylenedioxy-1,2,3,5-tetrahydro-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-ones.,The synthesis and anticonvulsant activity of 1-aryl-7,8-methylenedioxy-1,2,3,5-tetrahydro-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-(thi)ones (4a-d) and their 3-N-alkylcarbamoyl derivatives (4e-h) are reported. The new compounds possess marked anticonvulsant properties, comparable to those of the dehydro analogues 3 and higher than that of GYKI 52466 (1). Noteworthy, compound 4c shows a longer-lasting anticonvulsant activity. Electrophysiological experiments show that derivative 4c is less effective than 1 and 3c to reduce the KA-evoked currents in cerebellar granule neurons.
11209613,0,2001,Inorg Chem,Lithium halide adducts of imidotellurium(IV) ligands: synthesis and X-ray structures of [Li(THF)2L](mu 3-I)[LiI(L)] [L = tBuNTe(mu-NtBu)2TeNtBu] and [(THF)3Li3(mu 3-I)(Te(NtBu)3)].,The reaction of the chelating ligand tBuNTe(mu-NtBu)2TeNtBu (L) with LiI in THF yields [Li(THF)2L](mu 3-I)[LiI(L)] (3). This complex is also formed by the attempted oxidation of [Li2Te(NtBu)3]2 with I2. An X-ray analysis of 3 reveals that the tellurium diimide dimer acts as a chelating ligand toward (a) [Li(THF)2]+ cations and (b) a molecule of LiI. An extended structure is formed via weak Te...I interactions [3.8296(7)-3.9632(7) A] involving both mu 3-iodide counterions and the iodine atoms of the coordinated LiI molecules. Crystal data: 3, triclinic, space group P1, a = 10.1233(9) A, b = 15.7234(14) A, c = 18.8962(17) A, alpha = 86.1567(16) degrees, beta = 84.3266(16) degrees, gamma = 82.9461(16) degrees, V = 2965.8(5) A3, Z = 2. The oxidation by air of [Li2Te(NtBu)3]2 in toluene produces the radical (Li3[Te(NtBu)3]2), which exhibits an ESR spectrum consisting of a septet of decuplets (g = 2.00506, a(14N) = 5.26 G, a(7Li) = 0.69 G). The complexes [(THF)3Li3(mu 3-X)(Te(NtBu)3)] (4a, X = Cl; 4b, X = Br; 4c, X = I) are obtained from the reaction of [Li2Te(NtBu)3]2 with lithium halides in THF.

11170533,0,2001,Inorg Chem,Oxygen atom transfer from nitrogenous ReVO reagents to diphosphines and subsequent transformations. Rhenium(III) products and reaction models.,The concerned diphosphines are Ph2P(CH2)nPPh2 (1), abbreviated PnP, and the ReVO reagents are ReOCl3L (2) and ReOCl3L' (3), where L and L' are the azopyridine and pyridine-imine ligands p-ClC6H4N=NC5H4N and p-MeC6H4N=CHC5H4N, respectively. One atom transfer from 2 to 1 has afforded Re(OPnP)Cl3L (4a, n = 1; 4b, n = 2; 4c, n = 3). Of these 4b and 4c are stable, but 4a undergoes spontaneous isomerization to Re(PlPO)Cl3L (5) in solution. Two-atom transfer studied with both 2 and 3 has afforded binuclear LCl3Re(OPnPO)ReCl3L (8a, n = 2; 8b, n = 3) and L'Cl3Re(OPnPO)ReCl3L' (9a, n = 2; 9b, n = 3) for n = 2, 3 and mononuclear Re(OP1PO)Cl3L (11) and Re(OP1PO)Cl3L' (12) for n = 1. The mixed system L'Cl3Re(OP2PO)ReCl3L (10) has been prepared from 3 and 4b. The complex Re(PPh3)Cl3L (7a) is furnished by the reaction of Re(OPPh3)Cl3L (6a) or 4b or 11 with PPh3. The species have been characterized with the help of spectral, electrochemical, and X-ray structural data. All the complexes have mer geometry except 5 and 7a, which have fac geometry. The latter is best suited for concurrent Re-N and Re-P back-bonding. Variable-temperature rate data of the reaction 4a--&gt;5 are consistent with an intramolecular strongly associative transition state (delta S++, -22.6 eu) in which the dangling phosphine function lies close to the metal. Two-atom transfer to P1P is believed to proceed via a transient binuclear intermediate which undergoes cleavage at one end due to steric crowding, affording 11 and 12. Crystal data for the complexes are as follows: 5.1.5 C6H6, empirical formula C45H39Cl4N3OP2Re, crystal system triclinic, space group P1, a = 10.034(2) A, b = 10.737(2) A, c = 20.357(4) A, alpha = 89.38(3) degrees, beta = 87.79(3) degrees, gamma = 80.22(3) degrees, V = 2159.7(7) A3, Z = 2; 7a.CH2Cl2, empirical formula C30H25Cl6N3PRe, crystal system monoclinic, space group P2(1)/n, a = 11.695(6) A, b = 17.745(7) A, c = 15.459(9) A, beta = 100.94(5) degrees, V = 3150(3) A3, Z = 4; 9a, empirical formula C52H48Cl6N4O2P2Re2, crystal system monoclinic, space group C2/c, a = 19.769(12) A, b = 12.864(6) A, c = 22.20(2) A, beta = 101.76(6) degrees, V = 5530(6) A3, Z = 4; 11, empirical formula C36H30Cl4N3O2P2Re, crystal system monoclinic, space group I2/a, a = 16.866(6) A, b = 12.583(6) A, c = 34.78(2) A, beta = 99.22(4) degrees, V = 7285(7) A3, Z = 8.
10966886,119,2000,Am J Clin Nutr,Healthy percentage body fat ranges: an approach for developing guidelines based on body mass index.,BACKGROUND: Although international interest in classifying subject health status according to adiposity is increasing, no accepted published ranges of percentage body fat currently exist. Empirically identified limits, population percentiles, and z scores have all been suggested as means of setting percentage body fat guidelines, although each has major limitations.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine a potential new approach for developing percentage body fat ranges. The approach taken was to link healthy body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization with predicted percentage body fat.DESIGN: Body fat was measured in subjects from 3 ethnic groups (white, African American, and Asian) who were screened and evaluated at 3 universities [Cambridge (United Kingdom), Columbia (United States), and Jikei (Japan)] with use of reference body-composition methods [4-compartment model (4C) at 2 laboratories and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at all 3 laboratories]. Percentage body fat prediction equations were developed based on BMI and other independent variables.RESULTS: A convenient sample of 1626 adults with BMIs &lt; or =35 was evaluated. Independent percentage body fat predictor variables in multiple regression models included 1/BMI, sex, age, and ethnic group (R: values from 0.74 to 0.92 and SEEs from 2.8 to 5.4% fat). The prediction formulas were then used to prepare provisional healthy percentage body fat ranges based on published BMI limits for underweight (&lt;18.5), overweight (&gt; or =25), and obesity (&gt; or =30).CONCLUSION: This proposed approach and initial findings provide the groundwork and stimulus for establishing international healthy body fat ranges.
10780262,39,2000,Pharmacogenetics,Eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) genes: human polymorphisms, and recommended nomenclature based on divergent evolution and chromosomal mapping.,As currently being performed with an increasing number of superfamilies, a standardized gene nomenclature system is proposed here, based on divergent evolution, using multiple alignment analysis of all 86 eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) amino-acid sequences known at this time. The ALDHs represent a superfamily of NAD(P)(+)-dependent enzymes having similar primary structures that oxidize a wide spectrum of endogenous and exogenous aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. To date, a total of 54 animal, 15 plant, 14 yeast, and three fungal ALDH genes or cDNAs have been sequenced. These ALDHs can be divided into a total of 18 families (comprising 37 subfamilies), and all nonhuman ALDH genes are named here after the established human ALDH genes, when possible. An ALDH protein from one gene family is defined as having approximately &lt; or = 40% amino-acid identity to that from another family. Two members of the same subfamily exhibit approximately &gt; or = 60% amino-acid identity and are expected to be located at the same subchromosomal site. For naming each gene, it is proposed that the root symbol 'ALDH' denoting 'aldehyde dehydrogenase' be followed by an Arabic number representing the family and, when needed, a letter designating the subfamily and an Arabic number denoting the individual gene within the subfamily; all letters are capitalized in all mammals except mouse and fruit fly, e.g. 'human ALDH3A1 (mouse, Drosophila Aldh3a1).' It is suggested that the Human Gene Nomenclature Guidelines (http://++www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/guidelines.h tml) be used for all species other than mouse and Drosophila. Following these guidelines, the gene is italicized, whereas the corresponding cDNA, mRNA, protein or enzyme activity is written with upper-case letters and without italics, e.g. 'human, mouse or Drosophila ALDH3A1 cDNA, mRNA, or activity'. If an orthologous gene between species cannot be identified with certainty, sequential naming of these genes will be carried out in chronological order as they are reported to us. In addition, 20 human ALDH variant alleles that have been reported to date are listed herein and are recommended to be given numbers (or a number plus a capital letter) following an asterisk (e.g. 'ALDH3A2*2, ALDH2*4C'). It is anticipated that this eukaryotic ALDH gene nomenclature system will be extended to include bacterial genes within the next 2 years and that this nomenclature system will require updating on a regular basis; an ALDH Web site has been established for this purpose (http://++www.uchsc.edu/sp./sp./alcdbase/a ldhcov.html) and will serve as a medium for interaction amongst colleagues in this field.
10823869,30,2000,J Virol,Versatility of the accessory C proteins of Sendai virus: contribution to virus assembly as an additional role.,The P/C mRNA of Sendai virus (SeV) encodes a nested set of accessory proteins, C', C, Y1, and Y2, referred to collectively as C proteins, using the +1 frame relative to the open reading frame of phospho (P) protein and initiation codons at different positions. The C proteins appear to be basically nonstructural proteins as they are found abundantly in infected cells but greatly underrepresented in the virions. We previously created a 4C(-) SeV, which expresses none of the four C proteins, and concluded that the C proteins are categorically nonessential gene products but greatly contribute to viral full replication and infectivity (A. Kurotani et al., Genes Cells 3:111-124, 1998). Here, we further characterized the 4C(-) virus multiplication in cultured cells. The viral protein and mRNA synthesis was enhanced with the mutant virus relative to the parental wild-type (WT) SeV. However, the viral yields were greatly reduced. In addition, the 4C(-) virions appeared to be highly anomalous in size, shape, and sedimentation profile in a sucrose gradient and exhibited the ratios of infectivity to hemagglutination units significantly lower than those of the WT. In the WT infected cells, C proteins appeared to colocalize almost perfectly with the matrix (M) proteins, pretty well with an external envelope glycoprotein (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase [HN]), and very poorly with the internal P protein. In the absence of C proteins, there was a significant delay of the incorporation of M protein and both of the envelope proteins, HN and fusion (F) proteins, into progeny virions. These results strongly suggest that the accessory and basically nonstructural C proteins are critically required in the SeV assembly process. This role of C proteins was further found to be independent of their recently discovered function to counteract the antiviral action of interferon-alpha/beta. SeV C proteins thus appear to be quite versatile.
10769248,29,2000,Cereb Cortex,Intermodal selective attention in monkeys. II: physiological mechanisms of modulation.,Of all areas studied in the accompanying study, attention effects were most consistent and well resolved in V4. In this study, to define some of the anatomical circuits and neural processes underlying the influence of attention, we examined the laminar distribution and physiology of attention effects in V4 and in two lower areas, V1 and V2. Laminar event-related potential (ERP), current source density (CSD) and multiunit activity (MUA) profiles allowed identification of processes occurring in the local ensembles, as well as their sequence and laminar distribution. These methods also permitted us to analyze the brain processes reflected in attention-sensitive components of the surface ERP. As outlined in the previous study, the first robust modulation by attention occurred in V4 during the 100-300 ms poststimulus interval. This is the time frame of the net refractoriness which follows the net local excitatory response to luminance increment. Over this interval, attention reduced CSD amplitudes and increased action potential firing rates, findings consistent with disinhibition as a mechanism for attention in V4. Similar effects were observed during the 100-300 ms time frame in V2. In V4, attention had no effect on the initial excitatory response at the depth of lamina 4, but it did produce large modulations in supragranular and deep laminae, origins of both feedforward and feedback projections. Attentional modulation in V2 was later than in V4 and concentrated in extragranular laminae, with no modulation of the initial layer 4 response. Attentional modulation in V1 was smaller and still later than that in V2 and was focused in the supragranular laminae. In this paradigm, attention did not modulate either the response in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) or the initial excitation in lamina 4C of V1. The timing of effects across areas and the laminar distribution of effects within areas indicate that attention effects are mediated by feedback projections. Moreover, our findings suggest that attention may increase the perceptual salience of stimuli by reducing stimulus-evoked refractoriness and/or inhibition in cortical ensembles. Finally, attentional modulation of transmembrane current flow in V4 produced a sustained negative deflection in the laminar ERP profile, that was manifested in the ERP over the occipital surface. This posits a mechanism for the 'selection negativity', a scalp ERP effect noted under similar experimental conditions in human subjects.
10728761,25,2000,Arthritis Rheum,Comparison of the degradation of type II collagen and proteoglycan in nasal and articular cartilages induced by interleukin-1 and the selective inhibition of type II collagen cleavage by collagenase.,OBJECTIVE: To compare interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha)-induced degradation of nasal and articular cartilages in terms of proteoglycan loss and type II collagen cleavage, denaturation, and release; to examine the temporal relationship of these changes; and to investigate the effects of an inhibitor of collagenase 2 and collagenase 3 on these catabolic processes.METHODS: Discs of mature bovine nasal and articular cartilages were cultured with or without human IL-1alpha (5 ng/ml) with or without RS102,481, a selective synthetic inhibitor of collagenase 2 and collagenase 3 (matrix metalloproteinase 8 [MMP-8] and MMP-13, respectively) but not of collagenase 1 (MMP-1). Immunoassays were used to measure collagenase-generated type II collagen cleavage neoepitope (antibody COL2-3/4C(short)) and denaturation (antibody COL2-3/4m), as well as total type II collagen content (antibody COL2-3/4m) in articular cartilage and culture media. A colorimetric assay was used to measure total proteoglycan concentration (principally of aggrecan) as sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG).RESULTS: IL-1alpha initially induced a decrease in tissue proteoglycan content in nasal cartilage. A progressive loss of proteoglycan was noted during culture in articular cartilages, irrespective of the presence of IL-1alpha. In both cartilages, proteoglycan loss was followed by IL-1alpha-induced cleavage of type II collagen by collagenase, which was often reflected by increased denaturation. The inhibitor RS102,481 had no clear effect on the reduction in proteoglycan content (measured by sGAG) and collagen denaturation in either cartilage, but at 10 nM it inhibited the enhanced cleavage of type II collagen, partially in nasal cartilage and completely in articular cartilage.CONCLUSION: IL-1alpha-induced cleavage and denaturation of type II collagen is observed in both hyaline cartilages and is secondary to proteoglycan loss. It probably involves different collagenases, since there is no evidence of a rate-limiting role for collagenase 1 in articular cartilage, unlike the case for nasal cartilage. Inhibitors of this kind may be of value in the treatment of cartilage damage in arthritis. Also, the ability to detect the release of type II collagen collagenase-generated fragments from degraded cartilage offers the potential to monitor cartilage collagen damage and its control in vivo.
10926645,21,2000,J Appl Physiol (1985),Body composition techniques and the four-compartment model in children.,The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy, precision, and bias of fat mass (FM) as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), hydrostatic weighing (HW), air-displacement plethysmography (PM) using the BOD POD body composition system and total body water (TBW) against the four-compartment (4C) model in 25 children (11.4 +/- 1.4 yr). The regression between FM by the 4C model and by DXA deviated significantly from the line of identity (FM by 4C model = 0.84 x FM by DXA + 0.95 kg; R(2) = 0.95), as did the regression between FM by 4C model and by TBW (FM by 4C model = 0. 85 x FM by TBW - 0.89 kg; R(2) = 0.98). The regression between FM by the 4C model and by HW did not significantly deviate from the line of identity (FM by 4C model = 1.09 x FM by HW + 0.94 kg; R(2) = 0. 95) and neither did the regression between FM by 4C (using density assessed by PM) and by PM (FM by 4C model = 1.03 x FM by PM + 0.88; R(2) = 0.97). DXA, HW, and TBW all showed a bias in the estimate of FM, but there was no bias for PM. In conclusion, PM was the only technique that could accurately, precisely, and without bias estimate FM in 9- to 14-yr-old children.
10786665,20,2000,Cancer Res,Identification of a geldanamycin dimer that induces the selective degradation of HER-family tyrosine kinases.,Geldanamycin (GM) is a natural antibiotic that binds Hsp90 and induces the degradation of receptor tyrosine kinases, steroid receptors, and Raf. It is a potent inhibitor of cancer cells that overexpress HER-kinases, but its effects on other important proteins may cause significant toxicity and limit its clinical use. We report the synthesis and identification of a GM dimer, GMD-4c, which had selective activity against HER-kinases. Selectivity was a function of linker length and required two intact GM moieties. GMD-4c is a potent inducer of G1 block and apoptosis of breast cancer cell lines that overexpress HER2, but does not appreciably inhibit the growth of 32D cells that lack HER-kinases. GMD-4c could be useful in the treatment of carcinomas dependent on HER-kinases.
10723007,18,2000,J Comp Neurol,Termination of the geniculocortical projection in the striate cortex of macaque monkey: a quantitative immunoelectron microscopic study.,The goal of this present study was to derive a new estimate of the synaptic contribution of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) to the subdivisions of its main recipient layer, layer 4C, of striate cortex of macaque monkey. The projection from the dLGN and its terminal boutons within layer 4C were visualized by immunodetection of the calcium binding protein, parvalbumin (PV), which is expressed in relay cells of the dLGN. The proportion of asymmetric synapses formed by PV-positive boutons within the alpha and beta sublayers of 4C was estimated by using a nonbiased stereological counting method. The proportion of asymmetric synapses contributed by the PV-positive boutons to layer 4Calpha is 8.7%; to 4Cbeta is 6.9%. Assuming all the PV-positive asymmetric synapses derive from the dLGN relay cells, this gives a ratio of dLGN synapses per neuron of 192 in layer 4Calpha and 128 in layer 4Cbeta. Thus, the recurrent excitatory input from neighboring cortical neurons must play an important part in responses of the neurons lying at the input stage of the cortical circuit.
10629632,17,2000,Anticancer Res,Membrane vesicles in ovarian cancer fluids: a new potential marker.,The rate of membrane vesicle shedding by tumor cells is probably related to their invasive capability. In order to verify whether the vesicle amount could be utilized as a marker of different pathologies, we analyzed biological fluids obtained from 33 patients with gynecological diseases. In fluids of benign serous cysts, vesicle content was extremely low; in cystoadenomas and fibromas generally it was low. On the contrary, large amounts of vesicles were found in malignant tumor fluids. Gelatin zymographies showed the presence of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in all vesicles except in those recovered from fluids of some serous cysts. A positive correlation between tumor malignancy and both vesicle-amount and vesicle-associated MMP-2 activity was noticed. We also analyzed vesicle content in ascitic fluids recovered from two carcinomas at different times during clinical treatment. In both cases, tumor progression, not monitored by Ca 125 levels, was pointed out by an increased amount of vesicles in ascites. These findings suggest that vesicle content in biological fluids could represent a new useful marker of tumor aggressiveness and tumor progression.
10882374,10,2000,J Med Chem,Synthesis and antiviral evaluation of halogenated beta-D- and -L-erythrofuranosylbenzimidazoles.,A series of 2-substituted benzimidazole D- and L-erythrofuranosyl nucleosides were synthesized and tested for activity against herpesviruses and for cytotoxicity. The D-nucleosides 2,5, 6-trichloro-1-(beta-D-erythrofuranosyl)benzimidazole (8a) and 2-bromo-5,6-dichloro-1-(beta-D-erythrofuranosyl)benzimidazole (8b) were prepared by coupling 1,2,3-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-erythrofuranose (D-6) with the appropriate benzimidazole, followed by removal of the acetyl protecting groups. The 2-isopropylamino (9), 2-cyclopropylamino (10), and 2-mercaptobenzyl (11) derivatives were synthesized by nucleophilic displacements of the C-2 chlorine in the benzimidazole moiety of 8a. The D-nucleoside 4-bromo-5, 6-dichloro-2-isopropylamino-1-(beta-D-erythrofuranosyl)benzimid azo le (17) was prepared by coupling D-6 with the appropriate benzimidazole. The L-erythrofuranosyl derivatives, 5, 6-dichloro-2-isopropylamino-1-(beta-L-erythrofuranosyl)benzimid azo le (21a), its 2-cyclopropylamino analogue (21b), and the 2-isopropylamino analogue (25), were prepared by coupling L-6 with the appropriate benzimidazole. Several of these new derivatives had very good activity against HCMV in plaque and yield reduction assays (IC(50) = 0.05-19 microM against the Towne strain of HCMV) and DNA hybridization assays. Very little activity was observed against other herpesviruses. This pattern is similar to the antiviral activity profile observed for the corresponding ribofuranosides 2,5, 6-trichloro-1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)benzimidazole (4a), its 2-bromo analogue (4b), and the 2-cyclopropylamino analogue (4c). In comparison, 8a was 15-fold more active against HCMV than 4a, and 8b was 4-fold more active against HCMV than 4b. The 5, 6-dichloro-2-isopropylamino-1-(beta-L-erythrofuranosyl)benzimid azo le (21a) was less active than 4c, which is now in clinical trials for HCMV infection. Both 8a,b had comparable HCMV activity to 4c. Mode of action studies with the D-erythrose analogues established that 8b acted by inhibition of viral DNA processing whereas 9 and 10 may act via a different mechanism. The lack of a 5'-hydroxymethyl group in all members of this series established that antiviral activity occurred without 5'-phosphorylation, a feature required for the activity of most nucleoside analogues.
10629624,10,2000,Anticancer Res,Efficacy of pamidronate in breast cancer with bone metastases: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter study.,PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of pamidronate 60 mg i.v. q 4 weeks in women with advanced breast cancer with skeletal metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 404 woman with skeletal metastases from breast cancer in Sweden and Norway were included in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Except for the study medication, other palliative treatment was chosen at the discretion of the physician. Skeletal related events, i.e. increased pain, treatment of hypercalcemia, pathologic fractures of long bones or pelvis, paralyses due to vertebral compression, palliative radiotherapy for skeletal metastases, surgery on bone and change of antitumor therapy were recorded every third month as well as a self-estimated pain-score using visual Analog Scales and analgesic consumption.RESULTS: There was a significantly increased time to progression of pain (p &lt; 0.01), to hypercalcemic events (p &lt; 0.05) as well as for the cumulative number of skeletal related events (p &lt; 0.01) in favor for the pamidronate group. No statistically significant reduction of pathologic fractures of long bones or pelvis, or pareses due to vertebral compression occurred. No statistically significant differences were found for the need of radiotherapy and surgery on bone. The pamidronate group faired better regarding performance status (p &lt; 0.05). There was a statistically not significant lower consumption of opioid analgesics in the pamidronate group (p = 0.14).CONCLUSION: Pamidronate 60 mg i.v. q 4 weeks reduces skeletal events and improves the quality of life in women with bone metastases from breast cancer.
10745216,9,2000,J Comp Neurol,Dynamic regulation of BDNF and NT-3 expression during visual system development.,Recent studies have proposed roles for neurotrophins in the formation and plasticity of ocular dominance columns as well as in the regulation of dendritic arborization in visual cortex of higher mammals. To assess potential roles for neurotrophins in these processes, we have examined the developmental expression of BDNF and NT-3 mRNA in the cat's visual system using in situ hybridization. BDNF and NT-3 mRNAs are dynamically regulated in many CNS structures during embryonic and postnatal development, and both mRNAs undergo striking developmental changes in laminar specificity and levels of expression within primary visual cortex during the critical period for ocular dominance column formation. Within visual cortex, BDNF mRNA is found in neurons in deep cortical layers (5 and 6) prior to eye opening, and in both deep and superficial layers (2 and 3) shortly afterwards. Within layer 4, the target of thalamocortical axons, BDNF mRNA is low initially and rises to high levels by the end of the critical period for ocular dominance column formation. NT-3 mRNA is first detectable in small stellate neurons at the base of layer 4 (4c) after eye opening, and levels decrease near the end of the critical period. BDNF and NT-3 mRNAs can be detected in the lateral geniculate nucleus at birth, and levels peak during the critical period. In both structures, BDNF mRNA expression is maintained into adulthood, while NT-3 is undetectable in the adult. The presence and dynamic regulation of these neurotrophins in visual structures is consistent with suggested roles for both of these neurotrophins in axonal and dendritic remodeling known to accompany the formation of ocular dominance columns.
10629660,9,2000,Anticancer Res,Tumour markers CEA, NSE, SCC, TPA and CYFRA 21.1 in resectable non-small cell lung cancer.,BACKGROUND: In the last few years, several prognostic factors have been investigated in order to identify among patients with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subsets at high risk of recurrence. In this context, the actual role of serum tumour markers is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of preoperative CEA, NSE, SCC, TPA and CYFRA 21.1 serum levels in 62 patients submitted to radical surgery for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The predicting ability of these tumour markers with respect to histological type and pathological stage was also assessed.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After informed consent was obtained, the preoperative serum concentrations of the tumour markers CEA, NSE, SCC, TPA and CYFRA 21.1 were measured by means of immunometric assays in 62 patients referred to our Institutions from January to December 1992. All patients had resectable, histologically proven NSCLC and were submitted to radical surgery. Overall survival (OS) was calculated as the time elapsed from surgery to the date of death or last clinical evaluation; the prognostic effect of the tumour markers was investigated by Cox multiple regression models.RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were male and 6 female; median age was 62 years. Thirty-four patients had a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and 28 of squamous cell carcinomas. With regard to pathological stage, 32 patients had stage I, 4 patients had stage II and 23 patients had stage IIIA disease. In this series of patients, at a median follow-up of 55 months after surgery, we found that both TPA and CYFRA 21.1 serum levels at the time of diagnosis were reliable predictors of overall survival high values of these markers being associated with worse prognosis.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in completely resected NSCLC, TPA and CYFRA 21.1 preoperative serum levels might provide a useful tool for stratifying subgroups of patients with different chances of disease recurrence after surgery.
10946896,8,2000,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,Induction of specific phosphodiesterase isoforms by constitutive activation of the cAMP pathway in autonomous thyroid adenomas.,Thyrocytes largely depend on cAMP signaling for replication and differentiation. This pathway may be constitutively activated by mutations of the TSH receptor (TSHR) and Gsalpha in autonomous thyroid adenomas (ATAs). Because steady state cAMP results from production by adenylyl cyclase and degradation by phosphodiesterases (PDEs), we evaluated PDE activity and expression in ATAs with wild-type and mutant TSHR and Gsalpha. Activating mutations of TSHR and Gsalpha were identified in 7 and 1 of 18 ATAs, respectively. No difference was observed in the cAMP content in ATAs with or without activating mutants. In the surrounding normal thyroid tissue (NTs), PDE activity was 80% isobutylmethylxanthine sensitive, with the major contribution by PDE1 and a minor contribution by PDE4. No differences were observed in PDE activities between NTs and ATAs with wild-type TSHR and Gsalpha. In contrast, in the presence of mutant TSHRs or Gsalpha, total PDE activity was higher. This increase was primarily due to PDE4 induction (917 +/- 116% over NTs), associated with a minor PDE1 increase only in ATAs with mutant TSHR. By RT-PCR, increments of PDE4D and 4C messenger ribonucleic acids were found in the ATAs with mutant TSHR or Gsalpha, whereas messenger ribonucleic acids encoding other cAMP-specific PDEs were not significantly increased. This study provides a characterization of the PDEs expressed in human thyroid and demonstrates a dramatic PDE4 induction in the ATAs bearing mutant TSHR or Gsalpha genes. The increase in cAMP-degrading activity may represent a marker of constitutive adenylyl cyclase activation and constitutes an intracellular feedback mechanism with significant impact on the phenotypic expression of the activating mutations.
10912803,8,2000,Exp Cell Res,Simian virus 40 induces multiple S phases with the majority of viral DNA replication in the G2 and second S phase in CV-1 cells.,The infection of permissive monkey kidney cells (CV-1) with simian virus 40 induces G1 growth-arrested cells into the cell cycle. After completion of the first S phase and movement into G2, mitosis was blocked and the cells entered another DNA synthesis cycle (second S phase). Growth-arrested CV-1 cells replicated significant amounts of viral DNA in the G2 phase with the majority of synthesis occurring during the second S phase. When mimosine-blocked (G1/S) infected cells were released into the cell cycle, a major portion of the viral DNA was detected in G2 with the largest accumulation in the second S phase. The total DNA produced per infected cell was 10-12C with approximately 0.5-2C of viral DNA replicated per cell. Therefore the majority of the DNA per cell was cellular, 4C from the first S phase and approximately 4-6C from the second cellular synthesis phase.
11012019,7,2000,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Oxygenated chalcones and bischalcones as potential antimalarial agents.,Oxygenated chalcones (3a,b) and bischalcones (4a-j) have been synthesized and evaluated for antimalarial activity against chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains of Plasmodium berghei in mice. Some of the screened compounds, 3a, 4c, 4e, 4f and 4i, have shown significant activity at 100 mg/kg dose against sensitive strain.
10629639,7,2000,Anticancer Res,Prognostic relevance of micro-vessel density in cancer of the urinary bladder.,Angiogenesis is an important factor in tumour growth and metastasis. Degree of angiogenesis (microvascular density-MVD) has been found to correlate with tumour progression and disease outcome in a number of different malignancies. We studied 88 patients undergoing cystectomy for transitional cell bladder cancer to determine if angiogenesis was associated with cancer specific survival. Microvessels were identified by immunostaining of endothelial cells for CD31. Active areas of angiogenesis (&quot;hot spots&quot;) were selected using low magnification. The vessel count was performed using a Chalkley point graticule. The mean of 3 counts was used for statistical analysis. The median count was 3.4. Univariate analysis revealed that higher MVD was associated with worsening prognosis (p = 0.02). When adjusted for clinical stage MVD continued to predict worsening prognosis (p = 0.02). MVD was not affected by age or sex or by previous radiotherapy. MVD was associated with the risk of patients dying following pelvic recurrence (p = 0.03) and MVD was significantly higher in patients with lymph node metastasis at surgery. In conclusion, microvessel density proved to be an independent prognostic marker in transitional cell carcinoma of bladder.
11092138,6,2000,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis and in vitro antifungal and cytotoxicity evaluation of thiazolo-4H-1,2,4-triazoles and 1,2,3-thiadiazolo-4H-1,2,4-triazoles.,The increasing clinical importance of drug-resistant fungal pathogens has lent additional urgency to microbiological and antifungal research. Various thiazolo(or 1,2,3-thiadiazolo)thiosemicarbazides (2a-2e), 3-thiono-1,4-dihydrotriazolothiazoles-(or 1,2,3-thiadiazoles) (3a-3e), their related substituted thio-4H-1,2,4-triazoles (4a-4p) and sulfones (5a-5o) were synthesized. Most of the compounds tested for antifungal activity exhibited significant effects against Cryptococcus neoofrmans and Sacchromyces cerevisiae at MIC ranges of 0.53 to 12.5 micrograms/mL, whereas their activities were moderate against Candida albicans and weak against Aspergillus fumigatus. At 10 ppm concentration, all compounds showed low toxicity on brine shrimps (higher than 80% survival), except compounds 4c and 2c. At 100 ppm concentration most of the compounds showed toxicity except compounds 2b, 2e, 3c, 3d, 3e, and 4e. Compounds 4b, 4c, and 4h showed in vitro cytotoxicity against Kbalb cell lines and compounds 4c and 4g against 143B cell lines at 0.1 mM concentration.
10629644,6,2000,Anticancer Res,Comparison of CEA, MCA, CA 15-3 and CA 27-29 in follow-up and monitoring therapeutic response in breast cancer patients.,In order to define the most useful tumor marker panel in breast cancer patients' follow-up and in monitoring treatment response, serological levels of CEA, MCA, Ca 15-3 and Ca 27-29 were evaluated in 220 patients. 180 patients had no evidence of disease (NED) after primary treatment, and 40 had metastases at first diagnosis time; in a 4 years follow-up, 30 of the NED patients relapsed, and were then included in the group of metastatic patients subjected to anticancer treatment. Overall sensitivity in metastatic patients was: CEA 40%, MCA 35%, Ca 15-3 79%, Ca 27-29 70%, with the highest percentages and mean values in liver and bone localizations. Combination of Ca 15-3 and Ca 27-29 improved sensitivity in bone lesion (85% vs 80%), in locoregional relapses only association with CEA increased sensitivity (60% vs 40%). Ca 15-3 and Ca 27-29 values increased on average 3 months before clinical diagnosis. In treated patients there was a better correlation with a clinical course of disease for Ca 15-3 and Ca 27-29 (both 81%) as compared to the other determined markers.
10629629,6,2000,Anticancer Res,The biological characteristics of chromogranin A and its role as a circulating marker in neuroendocrine tumours.,This paper reviews the biology of chromogranin A (CgA) and CgA-derived peptides and their possible role as markers for neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). NETs are neoplasms characterized by a low proliferation rate and, in some cases, a favourable prognosis. NETs often overproduce and release biologically active substances that are responsible for severe syndromes. The hormones and the biogenic amines released by biologically active NETs are currently used as biomarkers, but there is a need for sensitive markers for those NETs that are &quot;biochemically silent&quot;. Circulating CgA levels have been demonstrated to be augmented in NET patients irrespective of the presence of syndromes related to hormone overproduction. Because of the high sensitivity and specificity of CgA, this glycoprotein can be successfully used in diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of NETs. CgA blood evaluation seems of particular interest in the management of the gastroenteropancreatic tract NETs and in carcinoids.
10726756,5,2000,Electrophoresis,Analysis of the NF1 gene by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis reveals a high incidence of mutations in exon 4b.,A total of 196 unrelated patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) was screened for mutations in exons 4a-c of the NF1 gene by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified genomic DNA fragments using intron-based primers. DNA samples with abnormal TGGE band patterns were subjected to sequence analysis. Sequence alterations were identified in ten patients (5.1%): 496delGT (1), 499delTGTT (4), T528A = D176E (2), T539A = L180X (1), 540insA (1), C574T = R192X (1). Thus, a total of six different mutations was identified in exon 4b but none in exons 4a and 4c. Only the missense mutation D176E, which we assume to be a nonpathogenic polymorphism, and the 4-base pair (bp) deletion 499delTGTT have been described before. The reason for the high incidence of mutations in exon 4b is obviously a tetranucleotide tandem repeat comprising nucleotides 495-502 (TGTTTGTT) that may give rise to slipped mispairing and subsequent deletion of one repeat unit during replication. Additionally, the recurrent 4 bp deletion was found as a second hit in a malignant schwannoma of a further NF1 patient, suggesting that microlesions may be as frequent among somatic as among germline mutations. This is the first report of a systematic study of NF1 exons 4a-c in a large group of NF1 patients.
10915963,4,2000,Eur J Pharm Sci,Piperazinylalkyl prodrugs of naproxen improve in vitro skin permeation.,Novel morpholinyl (4a) and piperazinylalkyl (4b-e) esters were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for their properties as bioreversible topically administered dermal prodrugs of naproxen. These ionizable prodrugs exhibited various aqueous solubilities and lipophilicities, depending on the pH of medium. As indicated by octanol-buffer partition coefficients (logP(app)) at pH 7.4, all of the prodrugs were significantly more lipophilic (logP(app)=0.7-3.9) than naproxen (logP(app)=0.3). Furthermore, the most aqueous of the soluble prodrugs (4b-d) were only 2-3-fold less soluble in an aqueous buffer of pH 7.4 ( approximately 30-50 mM) than was naproxen ( approximately 100 mM). At a pH of 5.0, prodrugs showed a generally higher aqueous solubility and similar logP(app) values, compared to naproxen. The chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis of prodrugs at 37 degrees C was investigated in aqueous buffer solutions (pH 5.0 and 7.4) and in 80% human serum (pH 7.4), respectively. The prodrugs showed moderate chemical stability (t(1/2)=15-150 days at pH 5.0), and they were hydrolyzed enzymatically to naproxen, with half-lives ranging from 0.4 to 77 min. In permeation studies using post-mortem human skin in vitro, the flux of naproxen was 6.5 and 1.6 nmol/cm(2). h in a saturated aqueous buffer vehicle of pH 7.4 and 5.0, respectively. Among the prodrugs, two piperazinyl derivatives (4c and 4d) resulted in a 9- and 4-fold enhancement of permeation, respectively, when compared to naproxen itself at pH 7.4. 4c also resulted in a significantly (4-fold) better permeation than naproxen at pH 5.0. In conclusion, piperazinyl esters improved skin permeation of naproxen and are promising prodrugs of naproxen for topical drug delivery.
10906312,4,2000,Cereb Cortex,The connections of layer 4 subdivisions in the primary visual cortex (V1) of the owl monkey.,The primary visual cortex (V1) of primates receives signals from parallel lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) channels. These signals are utilized by the laminar and compartmental [i.e. cytochrome oxidase (CO) blob and interblob] circuitry of V1 to synthesize new output pathways appropriate for the next steps of analysis. Within this framework, this study had two objectives: (i) to analyze the con- nections between primary input and output layers and compartments of V1; and (ii) to determine differences in connection patterns that might be related to species differences in physiological properties in an effort to link specific pathways to visual functions. In this study we examined the intrinsic interlaminar connections of V1 in the owl monkey, a nocturnal New World monkey, with a special emphasis on the projections from layer 4 to layer 3. Interlaminar connections were labeled via small iontophoretic or pressure injections of tracers [horseradish peroxidase, biocytin, biotinylated dextrine amine (BDA) or cholera toxin subunit B conjugated to colloidal gold particles]. Our most significant finding was that layer 4 (4C of Brodmann) can be divided into three tiers based upon projections to the superficial layers. Specifically, we find that 4alpha (4Calpha), 4beta (4Cbeta) and 4ctr send primary projections to layers 3C (4B), 3Bbeta (4A) and 3Balpha (3B), respectively. Examination of laminar structure with Nissl staining supports a tripartite organization of layer 4. The cortical output layer above layer 3Balpha (3B) (e.g. layer 3A) does not appear to receive any direct connections from layer 4 but receives heavy input from layers 3Balpha (3B) and 3C (4B). Some connectional differences also were observed between the subdivisions of layer 3 and the infragranular layers. No consistent differences in connections were observed that distinguished CO blobs from interblobs or that could be correlated with differences in visual lifestyle (nocturnal versus diurnal) when compared with connectional data in other primates. Re-examination of data from previous studies in squirrel and macaque monkeys suggests that the tripartite organization of layer 4 and the unique projection pattern of layer 4ctr are not restricted to owl monkeys, but are common to a number of primate species.
10809958,4,2000,Immunology,Exploring the feasibility of an anti-idiotypic cocaine vaccine: analysis of the specificity of anticocaine antibodies (Ab1) capable of inducing Ab2beta anti-idiotypic antibodies.,Conventional vaccination with the cocaine molecule conjugated to a protein carrier is a new approach in the treatment of addiction. Experimentally, this strategy has been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics as well as the psychostimulant effect of a cocaine challenge. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a more stable and less controversial molecule, an anti-idiotypic antibody, which mimics the configuration of the cocaine molecule (Ab2beta), could be successfully used instead of cocaine. Two cocaine conjugates that presented different areas of the cocaine molecule to the immune system were used to produce monoclonal antibodies specific for cocaine (Ab1). Several anti-idiotypic antibodies were then produced. Four were identified as Ab2beta, or internal images of the antigen; when injected into BALB/c mice, they elicited an anticocaine response. The anticocaine response elicited by one of the four Ab2beta (K1-4c) was sufficient to significantly reduce the level of cocaine that targeted the brain following cocaine challenge, compared with the level of cocaine found in the brain of control animals immunized with irrelevant antibody. In conclusion, the possibility of an anti-idiotypic vaccine seems to be worth pursuing.
10629663,4,2000,Anticancer Res,Combined treatment with goserelin and tamoxifen in patients with advanced chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer.,The purpose of this study was to determine the response in patients with recurrent, chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer to a combination of the LHRH-analog goserelin and tamoxifen.</AbstractText>: The purpose of this study was to determine the response in patients with recurrent, chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer to a combination of the LHRH-analog goserelin and tamoxifen.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with recurrent, chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer received a combination of goserelin and tamoxifen until clinical or serological evidence of progression as measured by serum CA-125 levels. Suppression of LH, FSH and prolactin levels in this group were compared with a second group of ten patients treated with decapeptyl for the same indication.RESULTS: The combination was well tolerated. The median progression free survival amounted to five (range 2-96+) months and overall survival to eight (range 3-96+) months. One of the responding patients is still alive without progression at 8 years. With this combination the median levels of LH and FSH were markedly suppressed, to respectively 2.6% and 3.7% of baseline values. With decapeptyl the LH levels were also suppressed, but the resulting FSH levels were significantly higher. PA combination of goserelin and tamoxifen in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer can not be recommended as standard therapy, but may result in long-term survival in individual patients.
10629646,4,2000,Anticancer Res,Effects on blood coagulation of adjuvant CNF (cyclophosphamide, novantrone, 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy in stage II breast cancer patients.,We prospectively studied the alterations of coagulation during adjuvant CNF (Cyclophosphamide, Novantrone--Mitoxantrone, 5-Fluorouracil) chemotherapy in patients with stage II breast cancer. In 50 consecutive stage II breast cancer patients (pre-peri-postmenopausal), and 50 controls, serial coagulation parameters including prothrombin time (P.T.), partial thromboplastin time (P.T.T.), fibrinogen, fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (F.D.P.), protein C, protein S, antithrombin III (AT-III) and platelet count were performed. Blood samples for coagulation tests were collected at pretherapy, midtherapy (before the 3rd course), before the 6th course of chemotherapy, and 2 months after the cessation of therapy (post-therapy) of 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, Novantrone 10 mg/m2, 5-Fluorouracil 500 mg/m2). Chemotherapy was repeated every 3 weeks. None of our stage II breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant CNF chemotherapy developed thromboembolic complications. Before any treatment all the tested coagulation parameters were within the normal limits as compared to controls. No statistically significant changes of FDP were noted throughout the study. Fibrinogen, plasma protein C, protein S and AT-III were significantly decreased during chemotherapy. This decline was more evident at midtherapy. Their levels returned to the pretherapy values 2 months after the completion of chemotherapy. The P.T. was statistically shortened, while the P.T.T. showed a statistically significant prolongation during chemotherapy. In conclusion, it appears that monitoring stage II breast cancer with sophisticated coagulation tests during adjuvant CNF chemotherapy can not identify patients at high risk for thromboembolic events. These serially performed coagulation tests, could be considered as a cost-intensive monitoring and not justifiable as a screening for breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. However, the increasing number of reports of life-threatening and sometimes fatal thromboembolic events following chemotherapy or hormonochemotherapy are of great concern. Our results suggest caution when using chemotherapeutic agents in patients with other thrombosis risk factors, since a significant decrease of protein C and protein S was observed in all patients. Additional studies are required to determine the exact association between chemotherapy and/or hormonochemotherapy and thrombotic events.
11070366,3,2000,Prog Retin Eye Res,The HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope in the eye: basic science and functional implications.,The HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope is part of many cell membrane and extracellular matrix molecules. It has been implicated in cell to cell and cell to extracellular matrix adhesion, and antibodies to the HNK-1 epitope are emerging as a versatile tool in eye research. They have been used to identify a novel cell type in the human eye, the subepithelial matrix cells that reside in the inner connective tissue layer (ICTL) of the ciliary body. Although these cells resemble fibroblasts in ultrastructure, they form a distinct cell population that differs in its antigenic profile from fibroblasts of other tissues. These cells are associated with the elastic fiber system of the ICTL. Other structures in the human eye that harbor the HNK-1 epitope in a nonrandom pattern are the ciliary and iris epithelia, the zonular lamella, the lens capsule, the retina, glial cells of the optic and ciliary nerves, and scleral fibroblasts. The HNK-1 epitope in the eye appears early during embryonic development and is phylogenetically conserved, but many interspecies differences exist in its distribution. The role of the HNK-1 epitope may be to structurally stabilize the ciliary body and the retina, and to participate in zonular attachments. The HNK-1 epitope has been linked with many common eye diseases. The subepithelial matrix cells seem to be susceptible to undergo irreversible damage as a result of glaucoma, thermal injury, and tissue compression. This epitope has proved to be useful in identifying intraocular deposits of exfoliation syndrome. It can explain the adhesiveness of exfoliation material. Intraocular exfoliation material differs in HNK-1 immunoreactivity from the extraocular fibrillopathy of exfoliation syndrome and its presence in fellow eyes also argues against the concept of unilateral exfoliation syndrome. The HNK-1 epitope is found in the extracellular matrix of secondary cataract and anterior subcapsular cataract, and it may contribute to their pathogenesis. Finally, the HNK-1 epitope can be used to trace neuroepithelial derivatives of the optic vesicle in developmental anomalies and in tumors of the eye. Eventual identification of molecules that bear the HNK-1 epitope in the eye will likely shed light on many aspects of ocular physiology and pathobiology
10932274,3,2000,Neurology,Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with myelin folding and juvenile onset glaucoma.,OBJECTIVE: We describe three patients from a family with motor and sensory neuropathy accompanied by open-angle glaucoma.BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive demyelinating hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSN) include different disorders. To our knowledge, autosomal recessive HMSN has not been associated with juvenile onset glaucoma.METHODS: Sural nerve pathology of the three patients were examined, and genetic analysis of the family was performed.RESULT: - The most prominent pathologic finding was a highly unusual myelin abnormality consisting of irregular redundant loops and folding of the myelin sheath. The family survey supports autosomal recessive inheritance. The molecular analysis failed to demonstrate either linkage of the disease to MPZ gene, PMP22 gene, Cx32 gene, orEGR2 gene. Analysis did not establish linkage of the disease to the locus of CMT4A, 4B, and 4C genes.CONCLUSION: The present cases may represent a new type of HMSN accompanied by juvenile onset glaucoma.
10826166,3,2000,J Econ Entomol,Identification of ice-nucleating active Pseudomonas fluorescens strains for biological control of overwintering Colorado potato beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae).,Laboratory studies were conducted to identify ice-nucleating active bacterial strains able to elevate the supercooling point, the temperature at which freezing is initiated in body fluids, of Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), and to persist in their gut. Adult beetles fed ice-nucleating active strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. putida, or P. syringae at 10(6) or 10(3) bacterial cells per beetle had significantly elevated supercooling points, from -4.5 to -5.7 degrees C and from -5.2 to -6.6 degrees C, respectively, immediately after ingestion. In contrast, mean supercooling point of untreated control beetles was -9.2 degrees C. When sampled at 2 and 12 wk after ingestion, only beetles fed P. fluorescens F26-4C and 88-335 still had significantly elevated supercooling points, indicating that these strains of bacteria were retained. Furthermore, beetle supercooling points were comparable to those observed immediately after ingestion, suggesting that beetle gut conditions were favorable not only for colonization but also for expression of ice-nucleating activity by these two strains. The results obtained from exposure to a single, low dose of either bacterial strain also show that a minimum amount of inoculum is sufficient for establishment of the bacterium in the gut. Persistence of these bacteria in Colorado potato beetles long after ingestion was also confirmed using a polymerase chain reaction technique that detected ice-nucleating active bacteria by virtue of their ina genes. Application of these ice-nucleating active bacteria to elevate the supercooling point of this freeze-intolerant insect pest could significantly reduce their winter survival, thereby reducing local populations and, consequently, crop damage.
10814384,3,2000,Org Lett,First asymmetric synthesis of a 6-alkoxy-5,6-dihydro-1,3-oxazine: a promising enantioselective route to beta-amido aldehydes,[reaction: see text] The 1,3-oxazine route to enantiopure beta-amido aldehydes was investigated. Heterocycloaddition of the N-acyl imine 1 with (R)-O-vinylpantolactone provided the stable dihydroxazine 4c. High diastereocontrols were observed when using Yb(fod)3-catalyzed or SnCl4-mediated conditions, thus leading after quantitative hydrolysis to (R)-N-benzoyl-3-phenylpropanal with &gt;98% ee.
10782668,3,2000,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Suitably functionalised pyrimidines as potential antimycotic agents.,Various suitably functionalized pyrimidine derivatives have been synthesized to explore their potential as antimycotic agents. Some of the synthesized compounds 4c, 4d, 8a-e have shown highly significant in vitro antifungal activity against five human pathogenic fungi.
10779384,3,2000,Mol Pharmacol,Analysis of a mutation in phosphodiesterase type 4 that alters both inhibitor activity and nucleotide selectivity.,Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) is a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase that is found as four distinct genes in the mammalian genome (PDE4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D). Mutation analysis was done to identify the amino acids involved in activity and inhibitor selectivity. Mutations at Asp333 were made in HSPDE4D3 based on mutations that affect rolipram sensitivity in RNPDE4B1. The PDE4D3 Asp-Asn mutant was resistant to inhibition by rolipram as well as several other PDE4 inhibitors tested. These results suggest that this residue is near the inhibitor binding pocket in PDE4D3. Sequence comparison of PDE4 with cGMP-specific PDE proteins shows a conserved aspartic acid at position 333 in PDE4D3 and a conserved asparagine at this position in PDE enzymes that hydrolyze cGMP. Therefore, cGMP hydrolysis by PDE4D3 Asp-Asn was measured. PDE4D3 Asp-Asn hydrolyzes cGMP with kinetic constants similar to those observed for this protein with cAMP (K(m) approximately 20 microM, V(max) approximately 2 micromol AMP/min/mg recombinant protein). Under identical conditions, the K(m) value for cAMP hydrolysis by wild-type PDE4D3 is 3 microM and the V(max) value is 1 micromol AMP/min/mg recombinant protein. In addition, the PDE4D3 Asp-Ala mutant protein could hydrolyze cGMP. Finally, the analogous mutation in HSPDE4B1 (Asp413Asn) also allows hydrolysis of cGMP. These results show that this aspartic acid residue is important in inhibitor binding and nucleotide discrimination and suggest this residue is in the active site of PDE4.
10730215,3,2000,Int Rev Cytol,Some aspects of plant karyology and karyosystematics.,The significance of the 4C value (where C is the amount of DNA in the unreplicated haploid genome) in angiosperm plants is discussed. The DNA amount is a stable feature used in biosystematics. Although this parameter varies even in closely related taxa, there is no correlation between the DNA amount and the structural and functional organization of plants. The role of DNA amount, including &quot;excess&quot; DNA, in plant evolution is considered. Some rules governing the distribution of DNA amount among different plant taxa are postulated, together with the possibility of using the data in systematics, phylogeny, and solutions of problems of genetic apparatus organization and evolution. The decrease in DNA value per genome during plant evolution and the high level of species formation in taxa with large DNA values have been shown. Plant taxa with a small DNA value per genome have a high percentage and higher degree of polyploidy. The nature of the differential staining of euchromatin and heterochromatin bands of prophase and metaphase chromosomes is also discussed. Data that could explain the mechanism of heterochromatin visualization under cold pretreatment of cells are reviewed. Phenomena involved in the arrangement of chromocenters in interphase nuclei and chromosomes in metaphase during consecutive cell generations are discussed.
10629659,3,2000,Anticancer Res,Evaluation of ferritin, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in the differentiation of exudates and transudates in pleural effusions.,In an attempt to define diagnostic criteria for the differentiation of pleural exudates from transudates, we measured ferritin (FER), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in pleural effusions and blood serum in 84 consecutive patients with pleural effusions of various etiologies. Concentrations of FER, IL-8 and TNF-alpha were significantly higher in serum and pleural effusion in patients with exudates than in patients with transudates. Serum concentrations of IL-6 were not significantly increased in pleural exudate patients (9.78 +/- 17.12 fmol/L) compared to transudate patients (4.05 +/- 2.33 fmol/L), while significant differences were found between pleural exudates and transudates (p &lt; 0.001). Increased levels of FER were found in serum and pleural effusion of cancer patients in comparison to non cancer patients (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha were not significantly increased in cancer compared to non-cancer patients, while increased concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were found in pleural fluid of patients with cancer in comparison to non-cancer patients. Finally/ no statistically significant differences were found in serum and pleural TNF-alpha concentrations among patients with cancer and patients with non-cancer effusion. We conclude that FER, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha concentrations in pleural effusions are useful markers in differentiating exudates from transudates.
10629651,3,2000,Anticancer Res,Prognostic value of CYFRA 21-1, TPS and CEA in different histologic types of non-small cell lung cancer.,The prognostic value of the tumor markers CYFRA 21-1, tissue polypeptide specific antigen (TPS) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was investigated in three histologic subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer. Pretreatment serum marker levels were measured in 38 patients with adenocarcinoma (AC), in 43 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SQC) and in 35 patients with large cell carcinoma (LCC). Univariate analysis in AC showed significant lower survival of patients with elevated levels of TPS, CYFRA 21-1 and CEA. In LCC, elevated levels of TPS and CEA were found to predict lower survival, while in SQC--only TPS was a predictor. A multivariate analysis of survival identified CEA (Relative Risk-5.5; p = 0.004), CYFRA 21-1 (RR-3.4; p = 0.008) and TPS (RR-3.0; p = 0.02) as independent prognostic factors in AC. In SQC, only TPS (RR-2.3; p = 0.03) was such a factor whereas in LC--none of the markers studied retained statistical significance. Thereafter, the combinations of the two strongest prognostic factors in the AC group--CEA and CYFRA 21-1 were explored to divide this group into subsets with different prognosis. In cases where both markers were positive, the relative risk of death was 10.5 times higher as compared to cases where both markers were negative (p = 0.002).
10629637,3,2000,Anticancer Res,Serum 90K/MAC-2BP glycoprotein levels in hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis.,90K/MAC-2BP glycoprotein is a serum tumour marker, member of the scavenger receptor cysteine rich (SRCR) protein superfamily, involved in different immunological mechanisms. In the present study, we determined 90K serum levels by a sandwich enzyme immunoassay using the same monoclonal antibody in 11 chronic active hepatitis (CAH), 48 liver cirrhosis and 36 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In comparison, the same samples were also tested for AFP. According to a cut-off point of 14 micrograms/mL for the 90K, established as 100% of specificity in 50 controls, we observed increasing positivities from CAH to cirrhosis and then to HCC (27%, 50% and 78%, respectively). In cirrhotic patients 90K levels were associated with the presence of anti-HCV antibodies, but not with the degree of liver compromise. Finally, 90K sensitivity was higher than AIFP in all groups of hepatic patients. However, further investigations are needed before proposing 90K as a clinical useful tumour marker in the progression from cirrhosis to HCC.
10629627,3,2000,Anticancer Res,Deep hyperthermia with radiofrequencies in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.,Patients at advanced stage of colorectal cancer with liver metastases have been treated with deep hyperthermia alone or in combination with chemotherapy (5-FU + FA + MMC). Hyperthermia was achieved by arrangements of capacitive electrodes with a radiofrequency field of 13.56 MHz (RF-DHT). This prospective open single-arm clinical study with 80 patients suffering from liver metastases from colorectal cancer gives some first hints, that deep RF-hyperthermia alone may have a substantial beneficial effect on overall survival time of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Long lasting no-change, partial and even some complete remissions could be observed. The overall median survival time from progression of metastases or relapse was 24.5 months and survival rates at 1, 2 or 3 years from first diagnosis of metastases or progression were twice as high as expected from patients treated with chemotherapy. The combination of hyperthermia with delayed chemotherapy did not change overall survival time. These encouraging results deserve to be confirmed in randomized clinical studies.
11009370,2,2000,Org Lett,Highly enantioselective addition of diethylzinc to diphenylphosphinoyl imines under dual amino Alcohol/Halosilane mediation,Arylethylene-derived, enantiomerically pure amino alcohols have been evaluated as ligands for the dual-catalyzed (amino alcohol/halosilane) enantioselective addition of diethylzinc to diphenylphosphinoyl imines. Among them, the conformationally restricted 9-fluorenone-derived ligand 4c provides the highest enantioselectivities so far reported over a range of substrate imines.
10992381,2,2000,J Urol,Bladder cooling reflex in patients with multiple sclerosis.,PURPOSE: We describe the effect of intravesical ice water instillation in patients with multiple sclerosis and without an overactive bladder.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 131 consecutive patients with multiple sclerosis who presented with a urinary disorder we selected for study 10 men and 29 women with a mean age plus or minus standard deviation of 50 +/- 9 years who had multiple sclerosis without an overactive bladder. Nonoveractive bladder was defined as no involuntary detrusor contraction up to 400 ml. of maximum fill on routine cystometry. We performed cystometry with saline at 25 to 30C at an infusion rate of 50 and 100 ml. per minute, and with ice water at 0 to 4C at a rate of 100 ml. per minute. Ice water cystometry was considered positive when an involuntary detrusor contraction occurred before 200, and between 200 and 400 ml. of filling. Ice water cystometry was considered negative when there was no involuntary detrusor contraction during ice water filling up to 400 ml.RESULTS: Ice water cystometry enabled us to elicit involuntary detrusor contractions in 21 patients, which remained undetected by warm water cystometry at rates of 50 and 100 ml. per minute. The test was positive before 200, and between 200 and 400 ml. in 10 and 11 cases, respectively. Positive ice water cystometry was significantly associated with irritative signs or significant post-void residual urine volume.CONCLUSIONS: An involuntary detrusor contraction was not elicited by cystometry at 50 or 100 ml. per minute, implying that the afferent mechanoreceptor reflex limb via ADelta fibers is not involved. In contrast, ice water cystometry at 100 ml. per minute elicited an involuntary detrusor contraction, suggesting involvement of an afferent reflex limb via capsaicin sensitive C fibers. These involuntary detrusor contractions revealed by ice water cystometry are probably relevant to an overactive bladder. In urinary disorders such a positive test indicates a spinal lesion. In multiple sclerosis it may have pathophysiological value, indicating a spinal rather than cerebral mechanism of overactive bladder, and diagnostic value, indicating multifocal demyelination.
10860569,2,2000,Cell Biol Int,From hormone signal, via the cytoskeleton, to cell growth in single cells of tobacco.,Cultured mesophyll protoplasts of Nicotiana tabacum L. can be hormonally induced into different developmental pathways. In a medium containing auxins (NAA) and cytokinins (BAP) cells divide and eventually give rise to calli. When only auxins are present cells elongate and finally differentiate into very long tubular cells. We focused on the sequence of events leading to elongation. When cultured in a high (1 mg/l) auxin concentration elongating cells seem to pass a certain threshold and increase their nuclear DNA up to about 16C. Cells cultured in a low (0.065 mg/l) auxin concentration only have C-values up to 4C, are unable to pass this threshold and finally fail to elongate. Besides the concentration dependence of the auxin signal, the efflux of auxin seems to be necessary for elongation since addition of TIBA drastically reduces the amount of elongating cells. Concomitant with the changes in nuclear physiology, auxin-induced axiality is seen as sequential rearrangements of microtubules and actin-filaments and of cell wall cellulose microfibrils from 'randomly' arranged in spherical cells to an orientation perpendicular to the long axis of elongating cells.
10790214,2,2000,Hum Mutat,Characterization of the CYP21 gene 5' flanking region in patients affected by 21-OH deficiency.,In order to test the hypothesis that mutations in the 5' non-coding region of CYP21 gene could contribute to the various spectrum of disease presentation due to 21-OH deficiency, the 400bp nucleotide sequence upstream of the ATG codon of CYP21 gene has been characterized in 28 CAH patients who have previously been genotyped by screening for the ten most frequent CYP21 mutations. Six specific sequence variations (-4C--&gt;T, -73C--&gt;T, -295T--&gt;C, -294A--&gt;C, -283A--&gt;G, -281T--&gt;G) have been identified in this region of CYP21 gene in 3 out of 28 21-OH deficient patients for whom the coding region mutations have been previously identified. Three of these mutations, -295T--&gt;C, -294A--&gt;C, -283A--&gt;G, are apparently generated by a gene-conversion event, thus giving first evidence that this mechanism also applies to the 5' untranslated region of CYP21 gene in 21-OH deficiency. Four other sequence changes, identified at nucleotide position -279, -331, -350 and -353, could be referred to as normal since they are present also in healthy subjects. It may not be excluded that some of the newly-identified single nucleotide changes in the regulatory region could have a modulatory effect on the CYP21 gene transcriptional activity thus affecting the clinical outcome.
10745163,2,2000,Insect Biochem Mol Biol,Isoenzymes of glutathione S-transferase from the mosquito Anopheles dirus species B: the purification, partial characterization and interaction with various insecticides.,Previously we have purified and characterized a major glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, GST-4a, from the Thai mosquito Anopheles dirus B, a model mosquito for study of anopheline malaria vectors [Prapanthadara, L. Koottathep, S., Promtet, N., Hemingway, J. and Ketterman, A.J. (1996) Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 26:3, 277-285]. In this report we have purified an isoenzyme, GST-4c, which has the greatest DDT-dehydrochlorinase activity. Three additional isoenzymes, GST-4b, GST-5 and GST-6, were also partially purified and characterized for comparison. All of the Anopheles GST isoenzymes preferred 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as an electrophilic substrate. In kinetic studies with CDNB as an electrophilic substrate, the V(max) of GST-4c was 24.38 micromole/min/mg which was seven-fold less than GST-4a. The two isoenzymes also possessed different K(m)s for CDNB and glutathione. Despite being only partially pure GST-4b had nearly a four-fold greater V(max) for CDNB than GST-4c. In contrast, GST-4c possessed the greatest DDT-dehydrochlorinase specific activity among the purified insect GST isoenzymes and no activity was detected for GST-5. Seven putative GST substrates used in this study were not utilized by An. dirus GSTs, although they were capable of inhibiting CDNB conjugating activity to different extents for the different isoenzymes. Bromosulfophthalein and ethacrynic acid were the most potent inhibitors. The inhibition studies demonstrate different degrees of interaction of the An. dirus isoenzymes with various insecticides. The GSTs were inhibited more readily by organochlorines and pyrethroids than by the phosphorothioates and carbamate. In a comparison between An. dirus and previous data from An. gambiae the two anopheline species possess a similar pattern of GST isoenzymes although the individual enzymes differ significantly at the functional level. The available data suggests there may be a minimum of three GST classes in anopheline insects.
10728472,2,2000,Drugs R D,The emerging role of fusion inhibitors in HIV infection.,Fusion of HIV with its host cell requires the interaction of the viral envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp120) with the chemokine receptor CXCR4 [T cell-tropic (T-tropic) or X4 HIV strains] or CCR5 [macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) or R5 HIV strains] followed by a 'spring-loaded' action of the glycoprotein 41 (gp41) that ensures fusion of the viral and cellular lipid membranes and permits the viral nucleocapsid to enter the cell. The overall fusion process can be blocked by a number of compounds. These include siamycin analogues, SPC 3 (a synthetic peptide derived from the V3 domain of gp120), pentafuside (T 20, DP 178) [a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 127 to 162 of gp41], the betulinic acid derivative RPR 103611, TAK 779 (a low molecular weight non-peptide CCR5 antagonist) and a number of compounds (T 22, T 134, ALX40-4C, CGP64222 and AMD 3100) that are targeted at the CXCR4 receptor. In particular, the bicyclam AMD 3100 has proved highly potent and selective as a CXCR4 antagonist that blocks the infectivity of X4 HIV strains in the nanomolar concentration range. The proof-of-concept that fusion inhibitors should be able to suppress viral replication in vivo has been demonstrated with pentafuside. Pentafuside and AMD 3100 have now proceeded to phase II clinical trials.
10629661,2,2000,Anticancer Res,Serum sialic acid in malignant melanoma patients: an ROC curve analysis.,We have studied the total serum sialic acid as a possible diagnostic factor for the prognosis of patients with melanoma. The sialic acid concentration was determined in the sera of fifty melanoma patients (MP) and forty healthy persons (HP), by using an enzymatic method. We found a mean value of 67.52 +/- 17.32 mg/dl in MP and 57.11 +/- 12.98 mg/dl in HP (p &lt; 0.005). In order to check whether this test could discriminate adequately between MP and HP, a complete statistical Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. The cut-off value was 62.39 mg/dl. The area under the curve was 0.661. According to these results, the test could discriminate between both groups. However, due to the rise of sialic acid-rich acute-phase proteins in inflammatory processes, determination of total serum sialic acid would be more useful for diagnosis of melanoma stage and prognosis rather than for early detection and screening.
10629655,2,2000,Anticancer Res,MDR1 and thymidylate synthase (TS) gene expressions in advanced breast cancer: relationships to drug exposure, p53 mutations, and clinical outcome of the patients.,To characterize the biological features of advanced breast cancer associated with poor chemotherapy response and worse prognosis, sequential tumor samples obtained from 75 patients receiving primary chemotherapy were analysed for MDR1 and TS gene expression before and after treatment. MDR1 gene expression was also analysed in 36 sequential normal samples. The levels of MDR1 and TS genes expression were determined by reverse transcription-PCR method, and examined in relation to p53 gene status, and the clinical outcome of the patients. After treatment, MDR1 expression levels were significantly enhanced in tumor (p = 0.0033) and normal (p = 0.0098) samples, whereas a significant decrease in TS expression was observed (p = 0.0054). There was no significant correlation between MDR1 or TS expressions and the presence of p53 mutations (detected in 24% of the cases), chemoresponsiveness, or survival. Only p53 mutations were associated with reduced disease-free survival (p = 0.0473). These results demonstrate that MDR1 and TS gene expressions were affected by drug exposure, but not by p53 gene status. Furthermore, the increase of MDR1 gene expression in normal and tumor tissues is in favor of an induced MDR1 expression rather than of a selection of resistant tumoral clones, which can be responsible for the absence of relationship of MDR1 expression with clinical outcome of advanced breast cancer patients.
10629643,2,2000,Anticancer Res,Prognostic factors in oral squamous cell carcinoma. A review of the literature.,Despite diagnostic and therapeutic progress, the overall prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma remains poor and prognostic information is essential for the evaluation and optimal treatment of patients. The prognosis of oral carcinoma depends primarily on clinicopathological factors, that however, have showed a limited predictive value for the identification of patients with high risk of disease relapse. In recent years, the analysis of DNA ploidy, cellular proliferation and oncogenes amplification have been used in attempt to identify new prognostic indicators. The review of the literature shows that TNM stage, tumor grading evaluated at the deep invasive margins and maximal tumor thickness effect on the prognosis. Moreover, the assessment of DNA ploidy and proliferative activity can be used to obtain additional prognostic informations. In contrast, additional studies are needed to understand the prognostic value of oncogenes expression in oral carcinoma.
10629625,2,2000,Anticancer Res,Cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, vincristine, prednisone, bleomycin, etoposide (CEOP-BE) therapy for intermediate- and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.,To improve the response and decrease toxicity of the treatment non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, a prospective single-arm trial was initiated using cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, vincristine, prednisone, bleomycin, eoposide (CEOP-BE). From March 1994 to August 1997, 29 previously untreated patients with intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, stage II to IV, were included in the study. Complete remissions (CR) were observed in 26 patients. The 4-year overall survival (OS) was 71.3%, and the 4-year disease free survival (DFS) was 61.8%. Recurrences occurred in 11 of 26 patients. Seven of 11 patients with recurrences showed bone marrow or other extranodal lesions. CEOP-BE is an active and feasible regimen for most patients with intermediate- and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
10629622,2,2000,Anticancer Res,Equine sarcoid tumour treated by autogenous tumour vaccine.,Twenty-one horses with sarcoid tumours were treated by bio-immunotherapy using autogenous vaccines during 1991-1997. At operation the base of the tumour was left in the skin and autovaccines were made from extirpated tumour tissue by polymerization. The horses thus formed their own internal control group. One of 12 horses having a primary tumour, and four of 9 horses suffering recurrent tumours, prior to bio-immunotherapy, developed single recurrences. Four of these five horses suffering recurrence were treated anew, leading to remission. Disease-free intervals were longer for primary (P = 0.0005) and recurrent sarcoids (P = 0.0156) than for conventional surgery alone. Mitochondrial events seem to effect the healing.
11078197,1,2000,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,3alpha-(4-Substituted phenyl)nortropane-2beta-carboxylic acid methyl esters show selective binding at the norepinephrine transporter.,A series of 3alpha-(4-substituted)nortropane-2beta-carboxylic acid methyl esters was synthesized and evaluated for the ability to inhibit radioligand binding at the dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine transporters. 3alpha-(4-Methylphenyl)nortropane-2beta-carboxylic acid methyl ester (4c) was found to be selective and highly potent for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) relative to the dopamine and serotonin transporters.
23119725,1,2000,Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Incidence and types of post extubation complications following endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy.,This study was undertaken to study early and late post extubation complications following endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy. A total 60 patients who were admitted in Dayanand Medical College and Hospital were studied prospectively. They were divided into 3 groups and were screened with various modalities like fiberoptic laryngoscopy. Bronchoscope, X-Ray Soft Tissue Neck and CT Scan, Complications like glottic edema, vocal tears, vocal granuhmas and tracheal stenosis were seen and were accordingly managed.
10982431,1,2000,Plant Physiol,Changes in photosynthetic carbon flow in transgenic rice plants that express C4-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase from Urochloa panicoides.,A cDNA encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) of Urochloa panicoides (a PCK-type C4 plant) was expressed in rice (Oryza sativa cv Tsukinohikari) plants under the control of the promoter of a maize (Zea mays) gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase or pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase with the transit peptide of the small subunit of Rubisco. Crude extracts prepared from the green leaves of transgenic plants had high PCK activity and the newly expressed PCK was localized in chloroplasts. In labeling experiments with (14)CO(2) up to 20% of the radioactivity was incorporated into 4C compounds (malate, oxaloacetate, and aspartate) in excised leaves of transgenic plants, as compared with about 1% in excised leaves of control plants. There was a positive correlation between PCK activity and the extent of labeling of 4C compounds. When L-[4-(14)C]malate was fed to excised leaves the extent of incorporation of radioactivity into sucrose was 3-fold greater in transgenic plants than in control plants and the level of radiolabeled aspartate was significantly lower in transgenic plants. These results indicate that the ectopic expression of PCK in rice chloroplasts was able partially to change the carbon flow in mesophyll cells into a C4-like photosynthetic pathway. Such a strategy appears to provide a possible method for enhancing the photosynthetic capacity of C3 plants.
10953359,1,2000,Anticancer Res,Analysis of the DNA content in the progression of recurrent and metastatic melanomas.,Ploidy status and ploidy related parameters of 18 primary melanomas, 32 recurrences and 18 lymphatic metastases were investigated applying CAS200 image analyzer. All the tumours investigated were either suspicious for aneuploidy (Auer III) or clearly aneuploid (Auer IV). Primary melanomas differed from recurrent tumours concerning the percentage of aneuploid cells between 4c and 8c and 5c ER. Comparison of cutaneous tumours with lymphatic metastases showed a significant difference concerning the percentage of aneuploid cells between 2c and 4c. An already high aneuploidy rate in primary tumours suggests that recurrent and metastatic clones of cells are present in early stages and that aneuploidy status in primary melanomas could be regarded as one of the risk factors of recurrences and metastases.
10895065,1,2000,Oncology,Diffuse mode of tumor cell invasion and expression of mutant p53 protein but not of p21 protein are correlated with treatment failure in oral carcinomas and their metastatic foci.,Lack of control of metastatic foci is the most prevalent cause of death in patients with oral carcinomas, and it is important for tumor control to identify the factors that predispose patients to death. In the present study, we examined 225 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma and investigated the immunohistopathological characteristics of 43 tumors that led to death, comparing them with those of the non-lethal tumors. In the 43 patients, lack of control of the primary site, lymph node and distant metastatic tumors were noted in 20, 18 and 16 patients, respectively. The mode of tumor cell invasion was closely correlated with death. The diffuse invasion modes of grades 4C and 4D were observed in 15 (34.9%) of the 43 tumors with a poor outcome and in 35 (19.2%) of the 182 controlled tumors (p &lt; 0.02). The expression of p53 was highly correlated with death. Of the tumors with poor prognosis, p53 protein was expressed in 32 tumors (76.2%). However, p53 protein expression was observed in 52.7% of the tumors with good prognosis (p &lt; 0.02). In contrast, the expression of p21 protein in the well-controlled tumors (30.4%) was almost equal to that of the 43 lethal tumors (26.2%). Compared with the ratios of local recurrence, metastases and their treatment failures in the p53-negative grade 1 and 2 tumors, those in the mutant p53-positive grade 3, 4C and 4D tumors were mostly high. These results indicate that measuring p53 protein expression and evaluating the mode of tumor cell invasion are important for oral carcinoma therapy because the expression of mutant p53 protein and the diffuse modes of tumor cell invasion indicate a predisposition toward a poor prognosis.
10797445,1,2000,Cytometry,Three-color versus four-color multiparameter cell cycle analyses of primary acute myeloid leukemia samples.,Checkpoint alterations that impact cell cycle and apoptosis responses to therapeutic treatments may produce drug resistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To study these, we have developed flow cytometry assays of checkpoint function that also allow quantitation of key molecular regulators of apoptosis and cell cycle. We have used three-color (3C) assays, with FITC-labeled anti-BCL-2 and PE-labeled anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibodies, and the DNA dye 7-aminoactinomycin, to characterize primary leukemia cells identified in DNA x side light scatter (SSC) histograms. We showed that 3C assays are accurate and reproducible in analyses of leukemia cell lines and of primary AML and normal bone marrow samples (Banker et al.: Blood 89: 243-255, 1997; Banker et al.: Leukemia Res 22: 221-239, 1998; Banker et al.: Clin Cancer Res 4: 3051-3062, 1998). To further confirm the validity of our SSC leukemia cell gating and to address whether immunophenotypic AML subsets might have different biologic properties, we have now designed four-color (4C) flow assays to characterize checkpoint status in leukemic blasts specifically identified by surface immunostaining. In modeling this assay strategy, PE/Cy5-labeled anti-CD34 antibody was used to detect blasts, with FITC-labeled anti-BCL-2, PE-labeled anti-PCNA antibodies, and Hoechst 33342 (H33342) DNA dye. Four-color CD34-gated data was concordant with 3C, SSC-gated data for leukemia cell lines and for most primary AML samples with high and intermediate blast counts. BCL-2 and PCNA immunopositivity and sub-G1 apoptosis determinations were different in the CD34-gated versus SSC-gated blasts in particular samples with smaller CD34(+) subsets, suggesting that leukemia samples can contain blast subsets with different biologic properties. On the other hand, PCNA-gated cell-cycle distributions in untreated cells and G1 versus S phase cell-cycle arrests after cytosine arabinoside treatments were completely concordant in 4C and 3C assays. We conclude that both 3C and 4C assays can be used to characterize protein expression and cell-cycle drug response patterns in leukemia blasts, but that 4C assays may additionally allow discrimination of these properties in immunophenotypic leukemia subsets.
10783578,1,2000,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,[A study of anti-HIV compounds which interfere the virus entry via coreceptor CXCR4].,T22 is an anti-HIV polypeptide which was synthesized with chemical modification from the horse shoe hemocytic polypeptides, polyphemusin II as a lead compound. T22 was found to block T-tropic HIV-1 entry into target cells as a CXCR4 antagonist. We synthesized T134, a small sized analog of T22 with reduced positive charges. T134 exhibited highly potent activity and significantly less cytotoxicity when compared to T22. It was shown that bicyclam AMD3100 and ALX40-4C are antagonists of CXCR4, and vMIP II which is coded chemokine in HHV8/KSHV effects antagonistically both CXCR4 and CCR5. We examined the anti-HIV activity of these CXCR4 antagonists. All of them inhibit the binding of anti-CXCR4 antibody (12G5) to PBMC, but have no effect on the binding of anti-CCR5 antibody (2D7) except for vMIP II. vMIP II decreased the binding of both 12G5 and 2D7. In these compounds, T134 showed the most potency to anti-HIV activity. We also attempted to clarify the cross resistance between these antagonists, using HIV-1 resistant to AMD3100. T134, ALX40-4C and vMIP II are active against the AMD3100 resistant strain. This observation indicates the potential of using these the inhibitors as a new type of agent preventing HIV entry.
10780901,1,2000,J Med Chem,3-Alkylamino-4H-pyrido[2,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides structurally related to diazoxide and pinacidil as potassium channel openers acting on vascular smooth muscle cells: design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation.,A series of 3-alkylamino-4H-pyrido[2,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1, 1-dioxides structurally related to diazoxide and pinacidil were synthesized and tested as possible K(ATP) channel openers on isolated pancreatic endocrine tissue as well as on isolated vascular, intestinal, and uterine smooth muscle. In contrast to previously described 3-alkylamino-4H-pyrido[4,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1, 1-dioxides, most of the new compounds were found to be poorly active on B-cells but exhibited clear vasorelaxant properties. 3-(3, 3-Dimethyl-2-butylamino)-4H-pyrido[2,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1, 1-dioxide (4d) and 7-chloro-3-(3, 3-dimethyl-2-butylamino)-4H-pyrido[2,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1, 1-dioxide (5d), two compounds bearing the alkyl side chain of pinacidil, were found to be the most active representatives of their respective series on rat aorta rings. 3-Cycloalkylalkylamino- and 3-aralkylamino-7-chloro-4H-pyrido[2,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1, 1-dioxides also expressed myorelaxant activity on electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum and on oxytocin-induced contractions of the rat uterus. Further biological investigations ((86)Rb efflux measurements, vasodilator potency on 30 and 80 mM KCl-induced contractions in the absence and presence of glibenclamide) revealed that compounds 4d and 5d, but not compound 5f, expressed the pharmacological profile of classical K(ATP) channel openers. In conclusion, by changing the position of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring, we now have obtained a family of drugs expressing an opposite tissue selectivity. Taken as a whole, the present findings also suggest that 3-alkylamino-4H-pyrido[2,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1, 1-dioxides such as 4c, 4d, 5c, and 5d may be considered as new examples of K(ATP) channel openers expressing a pharmacological profile similar to that of pinacidil and diazoxide.
10740223,1,2000,J Neurosci Res,Dynamics of cell aggregation during in vitro neurogenesis by immortalized neuroectodermal progenitors.,Early events of in vitro neuronal development were studied by inducing neuron formation in a neuroectodermal cell line, NE-4C/A3, derived from the embryonic forebrain vesicles of p53-deficient mice. Neuronal differentiation was initiated by treating the cells with all-trans retinoic acid (RA). By the second day of RA treatment compact cell aggregates were formed. The first signs of neuronal cell fate decision were revealed inside the aggregates. To elucidate the process of aggregate formation, the dynamics of cell clustering and the migration of individual cells were investigated by a novel computer-controlled videomicroscopic system. Besides real-time observation of cell motility, the system allowed statistical analysis of large sets of data providing quantitative evaluation of cell locomotion during an early, critical phase of RA induced neuron formation. The results showed that chemoattractants did not play a principal role in cell aggregation. Retinoic acid, on the other hand, was found to cause a rapid decrease in the average migratory velocity without changing the randomness of migratory routes. The data indicated that aggregation was facilitated by increased cohesion upon incident collision of randomly encountering cells. The resulting compact cell clusters provided the structural conditions for contact communication apparently needed for the neuronal differentiation of NE-4C/A3 cells.
10736073,1,2000,Paediatr Anaesth,Propofol and pain on induction: the effect of injectate temperature in children.,A prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted to determine whether cooled intravenous propofol reduces the incidence of pain on induction of anaesthesia in children. Seventy patients aged 3-10 years, ASA I or II, were randomized to receive 1% propofol plus 0.05% lidocaine either at room temperature (20-23 degrees C) or cooled to 4C. Pain was assessed by a blinded observer using a behavioural scale. Data from 69 patients were analysed. The incidence of pain was 9/34 (26%, 95% confidence intervals 11-41%) in the room temperature injectate group and 5/35 (14%, 95% confidence intervals 3-26%) in the cold injectate group. These differences were not statistically significant (P=0.21, chi-squared test). Pain scores were similar in both groups.
10733606,1,2000,Eur J Med Chem,Butyrophenone analogues in the carbazole series as potential atypical antipsychotics: synthesis and determination of affinities at D(2), 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C) receptors.,We describe practical and efficient routes for synthesis of 2-aminomethyl-1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-4H-carbazol-4-ones using the Fischer indole synthesis or palladium-catalysed cyclization methodologies, as well as their affinities for D(2), 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors, and their activity at the 5-HT(2B) receptor. The most active compounds, 4b (QF 2003B) and 4c (QF 2004B), with a pK(i) (5-HT(2A)/D(2)) ratio of 1.28 show a potential antipsychotic profile according to Meltzer's classification.
10629657,1,2000,Anticancer Res,Second malignancies after a gastrectomy for gastric cancers: the effects of adjuvant therapies.,Second malignancy after gastrectomy has become one of the important issues in the management of gastric cancer patients. However, the effect of adjuvant therapies has never been surveyed, although there have been many reports on second malignancy after chemotherapy of other malignancies. Between 1979 and 1995, 574 patients with gastric cancer underwent gastrectomies in our department. 563 patients (98.1%) were completely followed-up, and the incidence of second malignancy after gastrectomy was assessed with special emphasis on the effect of adjuvant therapies, namely benefits versus carcinogenesis. The overall postsurgical survival rate was 62.5%, and the survival rate of patients with stage 2-4 cancer was significantly higher in the adjuvant therapy groups than in the surgery alone group. The overall incidence rate of a second malignancy was 3.20% (18/563), including 4 colorectal, 3 liver, 3 head and neck, and 8 other malignancies, and 3.90% (9/231) for the surgery alone group, 1.94% (3/155) for the chemotherapy group, 3.68% (6/163) for the chemoimmunotherapy group, and 0% (0/14) for the immunotherapy alone group. There were no statistical differences in the incidence rates between these 4 groups. The mean duration until the occurrence of second malignancy was 5.1 years for the surgery alone group, 8.6 years for the adjuvant therapy group (9.3 years for chemotherapy and 8.1 years for chemoimmunotherapy; p &lt; 0.1, surgery alone vs. adjuvant therapy). The overall mean actuarial risk of developing a second malignancy was 6% at 5 years and 18% at 10 years. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that chemotherapy decreased the risk of death due to gastric cancer (risk ratio = 0.67, p = 0.017) and the risk of a second malignancy (risk ratio = 0.52, p = 0.261). Oral fluoropyrimidines were found to be particularly effective at decreasing the risk of death due to gastric cancer (risk ratio = 0.66, p = 0.012) and a second malignancy (risk ratio = 0.38, p = 0.136). However, intravenous chemotherapy was demonstrated to have no influence on survival (risk ratio = 0.93, p = 0.692) or a second malignancy (risk ratio = 0.58, p = 0.500). There was no evidence of an increased risk for a second malignancy following adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy with oral fluoropyrimidines was suggested to contribute to the improved survival of patients with stage 2-4 gastric cancer, and to have a decreased the risk of a second malignancy.
10629654,1,2000,Anticancer Res,Chemotherapy response rates in recurrent/progressive pediatric glioma; results of a systematic review.,The optimum treatment strategy for recurrent childhood glioma is unknown. This report presents a systematic analysis of the currently available clinical data on chemotherapeutic management of this disease. A study protocol was prospectively developed outlining the objectives and methods of analysis including literature search strategy, eligibility criteria for published trials to be included, key data elements to be extracted and a plan for statistical analysis. Summary statistics were analyzed for the primary outcome variables. Data on recognized prognostic factors were recorded in order to adjust the outcome measures for these factors. A total of 27 non-randomized clinical trails were included in the analysis. Studies were stratified into 6 chemotherapy classes based on the frequency of drug used across studies. Average median response (complete + partial) across all drug categories was approximately 14% (range 10.4-23.5%). Adding patients with stable disease to complete and partial responders at least doubled average median response rates. Time to tumor progression ranged from 29.4 weeks to 49.7 weeks. The most frequently used drugs were the platinum analogs which demonstrated a mean TTP of 42.0 = /-23.4 weeks. Small sample sizes and the overall poor quality of the available data precluded definitive conclusions regarding the clinical impact of the various drug classes on the natural history of this disease.
10629649,1,2000,Anticancer Res,Breast cancer markers during normal pregnancy.,AIM: To measure MCA and CA153 concentrations in maternal serum (MS) and amniotic fluid (AF) paired samples during normal pregnancy, in order to evaluate the usefulness of these markers in monitoring pregnant patients with a history of breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum and AF MCA and CA153 values were measured in 20 pregnant women during the 1st trimester, 29 cases in the 2nd, 26 in the 3rd and 20 at parturition and compared with those of 20 healthy, age-matched, non pregnant women (controls).RESULTS: MS values of MCA increased significantly with gestational age (p &lt; 0.0001), being higher in the 3rd trimester and in labor than in control values (p &lt; 0.0001). MCA values in AF were remarkably higher than those in MS and increased significantly with advancing gestation (p &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, CA153 values in AF, which were marginally higher than in MS, did not differ significantly with the progression of pregnancy.CONCLUSIONS: Maternal serum MCA values are significantly influenced during pregnancy. Thus, this marker seems to be reliable only during early pregnancy. In contrast, CA153 remains a useful marker in monitoring pregnant breast cancer patients.
10629648,1,2000,Anticancer Res,Autoantibodies against P53 protein in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.,Cellular accumulation and conformational changes of mutant p53 could act as immunogens for auto-antibodies (auto-Abs) generation when altered p53 from tumoral cells reaches the blood stream. Our main objective was to compare the presence and clinical implications of p53-antibodies in serum with the immunohistochemical (IHC) tissue overexpression of protein p53 in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, evaluating their association with bladder cancer parameters and their prognostic value. The study comprised 59 patients with bladder cancer (group 1) and 15 healthy controls (group 2). Serum p53-Abs were measured by ELISA. Mutant p53 protein IHC overexpression was examined from paraffin embedded tissues using monoclonal DO-7 Ab. Serum p53-Abs were detected in 14/59 and IHC P53 was positive in 24/59 patients from group 1. All p53-Abs positive patients had IHC p53 positive tumors, but some patients with IHC positive immunoreactivity showed undetectable p53-Abs. None of the healthy controls had detectable p53-Abs. Titres of p53-Abs were associated with stage and grade. P53 overexpression was dependent on stage, grade, pattern of growth and focality. P53 Abs showed a significant prognostic value for disease free survival (p = 0.0059) and life expectancy (p &lt; 0.0005) and for IHQ p53 for life expectancy (p = 0.0033). Patients with positive P53 Abs showed a higher probability for a shorter survival OR = 6.38 (1.77-22.99) than those who were positive for IHQ p53 OR = 4.00 (1.31-12.8) or those who were negative for p53 Abs and/or IHQ p53. The measurement of p53 Abs in serum appeared to be a simple determination which might reflect the p53 status and might help in the selection of those bladder cancer patients with a worse prognosis.
10629647,1,2000,Anticancer Res,Cytological and immunocytochemical analysis of laterocervical lymph nodes in patients with previous thyroid carcinoma.,BACKGROUND: In the follow-up of patients with a history of thyroid carcinoma, an enlarged cervical lymph node may indicate metastatasis is underway. Various methods may be utilized in the differential diagnosis between cancer metastasis of thyroid origin and aspecific lymphoadenitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and the additional diagnostic value of immunocytochemical thyroglobulin staining on FNAB of neck nodes.METHODS: We evaluated cytologically 38 samples obtained by ultrasound-guided FNAB on laterocervical nodes from patients with a history of thyroid carcinoma. One smear for each case was selected for the immunocytochemical stain.RESULTS: Twenty-eight of those samples were adequate (16 positive for metastasis of thyroid origin and 12 negative) and 10 inadequate. Two of the cytologically positive samples from poorly differentiated neoplasia showed no reaction to thyroglobulin (Tg). In ten of the 11 cases classified as lymphoadenitis, no immunoreaction was present; in the last case, blastic-like cells showed a scanty cytoplasmic rim which was immunoreractive to Tg. Therefore, this case was reclassified as a metastatic tumor.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we would recommend that FNAB be routinely performed in the diagnostic evaluation of neck masses. If the FNAB is inconclusive, aspiration should be repeated, while immunoperoxidase stain to evidence Tg, may be an adjunctive diagnostic tool in cytologically negative cases.
10629645,1,2000,Anticancer Res,Immunomodulating therapy with rIL-2 and interferon alpha-induces in vivo expression of Bcl-2, Fas (APO-1/CD95), and Fas ligand on peripheral lymphocytes (a pilot study).,The first Phase I Trial with a combination of IL-2 and IFN-alpha was published in 1989. There are still some questions though, concerning the in vivo effects of this combination on lymphocytes. We designed a prospective pilot study to evaluate in vivo effects of low dose IL-2 and IFN-alpha combination on expression of Bcl-2, FAS (Apo-1/CD 95), Fas Ligand, IL-2 receptor (CD25), and HLA-DR on peripheral lymphocytes in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. After initiation of the immunomodulating therapy, Bcl-2 expressing lymphocytes increased significantly on day 3 (p &lt; 0.025), Fas (Apo-1/CD95) expressing lymphocyte increased significantly on day 5 (p &lt; 0.003), Fas ligand expressing lymphocytes increased significantly on day 3 (p &lt; 0.004), HLA-DR expressing lymphocytes increased significantly on day 5 (p &lt; 0.003), and IL-2 receptor (CD25) expressing cells increased significantly on day 5 (p &lt; 0.01). We conclude that immunomodulating therapy induces in vivo expression of Bcl-2, Fas (Apo-1) and Fas Ligand in lymphocytes significantly.
10629641,1,2000,Anticancer Res,Evidence for the induction of a tumour associated cell surface protease on cytologically normal epithelial cells present in the sputum of patients possessing lung tumours.,Sputum obtained from healthy subjects and patients with known lung tumours has been challenged with fluorescent probes for the presence of an active cell surface protease. The mature epithelial cells from healthy patients' sputum lacked ability to bind these fluorescent probes whilst the majority of mature epithelial cells in the tumour patients' sputum bound these probes and consequently fluoresced. This demonstrable difference in the cell surface chemistry of mature epithelial cells was linked to the presence of lung tumour cells, which also possessed this cell surface protease. The mechanism of this induced cell surface enzyme appearance is not understood.
10629640,1,2000,Anticancer Res,mdm-2 expression in human testicular germ-cell tumors and its clinical value.,BACKGROUND: In germ cell testicular tumors (GCTT) mdm-2 gene was analyzed for amplification and transcripts but not for protein. The purpose of this study is to determine whether mdm-2 protein level is aberrant in GCTT and if so, what is the relationship between mdm-2 overexpression and other disease parameters including histologic subtypes, p53 status, metastatic potential and clinical stage.METHODS: 81 testicular germ-cell tumors were screened for their mdm-2 expression at the protein levels using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot (WB) analysis.RESULTS: Of 81 GCTTs 45 (55.55%) showed mdm-2 nuclear immunoreactivity, 34 (41.97%) of which were strongly positive. The incidence of mdm-2 immunostaining was significantly higher (P = 0.0007) in non-seminomas (NSGCT) than in seminomas (SGCT). The frequency of positive tumor was higher in tumors from metastatic patients than in tumors from metastatic-free patients (P = 0.011). mdm-2 expression was detected significantly more frequently in tumors of advanced stages, i.e. IIB, IIC and III versus tumors of early stages (I and II/A) (P = 0.0098). A significant difference between the three stages of disease as to the expression of mdm-2 (chi 2 = 0.0386) could be established, namely the incidence of mdm-2 expression increased with an increase in stage. Using Westem blotting 22 (68.75%) out of 32 tumors overexpressed the mdm-2 oncoprotein of 90 kd (p90).CONCLUSIONS: mdm-2 expression as detected by immunohistochemistry may provide a reliable prognostic tool to isolate subgroups of patients with more aggressive GCTT.
10629630,1,2000,Anticancer Res,Metastatic breast cancer patients failing first-line, anthracycline-containing chemotherapy: is further therapy of benefit?,During the last 50 years median survival for metastatic breast cancer has not varied and remains 2-3.5 years. To assess the clinical benefit of salvage systemic therapy a retrospective analysis of metastatic breast cancer patients all homogeneously treated with a commonly used first-line anthacycline-containing cytotoxic regimen (FEC) was undertaken. The 140 patients in this report were among 375 entered in two consecutive multicenter randomized trials carried out from Dec. 1983 to Jan. 1990. All patients died during follow-up. Median number of salvage therapies was 3 (range 1-7). Response rate (CR and PR) was 41% with FEC and 7%, 3%, 15%, 0%, 14%, 0%, 0% in patients receiving salvage treatment line 1 to 7, respectively. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 7.5 months for FEC and 3.5, 2.5, 2.1, 1.6, 2.1, 1.1, 1.6 months at first to seventh salvage treatment, respectively. Only a very small fraction of patients receiving first-line FEC respond to subsequent palliative treatment. The advantages of salvage therapy are unclear and must be weighed against the inconvenience, cost and morbidity of treatment. After first salvage therapy, patients should be considered for randomized trials comparing systemic antineoplastic therapy with best palliative care. Endpoints of all future clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer should include measurement of quality of life and accurate, sequential measurement of symptom control.
11093578,0,2000,Membr Cell Biol,Activation of latent nucleolus organizers induced by experimental polyploidization in cells of hexaploid wheat Triticum aestivum L.,The effect of prolonged colchicine-induced polyploidization on activation of latent nucleolus-organizing regions (NOR) of chromosomes was studied in diploid meristematic cells and polyploid root cells of Triticum aestivum L. It has been shown that control diploid and tetraploid cells have maximal number of nucleoli equal to four, which corresponds to the number of nucleolar chromosomes (NC) with active (visualized by staining with AgNO3) NOR (two pairs of homologous chromosomes 1B and 6B). Treatment of wheat seedlings with colchicine for 30 h results in following changes in polyploid cells: (1) impregnation of NOR with silver is observed on homologues of either chromosomes 1A or 5D in all tetraploid metaphase plates (4n, 2x, 4c), which is indicative of the NOR activation on this chromosome in pre-mitotic polyploid interphase; (2) In tetraploid metaphase, NOR in all four homologues of activated chromosomes or in only two of them may be stained; (3) maximal number of nucleoli in tetraploid nuclei is increased till 12, which confirms activation of transcription of additional rRNA gene clusters in polyploids; (4) activation of the rRNA gene expression is induced by the cell polyploidization rather than by colchicine, since in the colchicine-treated diploid cells both maximal number of nucleoli and the number of metaphase chromosomes with active NOR is not changed as compared with control. The obtained data allow us to suggest that structural &quot;separation&quot; of NC in polyploid nuclei stimulates activation of latent NOR.
11092194,0,2000,Microbios,Comparison of several ELISA tests for detecting the presence of IgG and IgM against herpes simplex viruses.,Four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays designated test 1 (ETI-HSVK-G 1/2); test 2 (ETI-HSVK-M 1/2); test 3 (ETI-HSVK-G 2), and test 4 (BioElisa HSV2 IgG) were studied to evaluate different stages of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Samples (50 sera and 14 cerebrospinal fluid) were included in four groups. Group 1 consisted of samples from patients with primary HSV infections; group 2 comprised samples from patients with recurrent HSV infections; group 3 were samples nonreactive to HSV; and group 4 were samples from patients with infections by other herpes viruses (4a, chickenpox; 4b, herpes zoster; and 4c, infectious mononucleosis by Epstein-Barr virus). The percentages of agreement between tests 1 and 2 were 100 and 72.1%, respectively. The total diagnostic values of tests 1 and 2 were: 100 and 50% sensitivity, respectively; and 100 and 89% specificity, respectively. Few positive results for HSV-2 infection were found, and so, tests 3 and 4 were not evaluated. The results of tests 3 and 4 for a chickenpox patient, and a herpes zoster patient were not in agreement.
11092135,0,2000,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis of a series of 3-cyanopropionamides and 4-imino-gamma-butyrolactams and evaluation of their function as modulators of multidrug resistance.,The synthesis of the 3-cyanopropionamides 3a and 3b, of the 2,2-dimethyl-3-cyanopropionamides 4a-4c and of the 4-imino-gamma-butyrolactams 5a and 5b (cyclic functional isomers of 3-cyanopropionamides) is described. The amides 3a and 3b were obtained by aminolysis of the corresponding acid chlorides, which are accessible via hydrolysis of the ethyl esters to the acids. This methodology was not used for the synthesis of the amides 4a-4c owing to steric hindrance to hydrolysis in the corresponding ethyl esters. These nonreactive esters, accessible by alkylation of 1-cyano carbanions with ethyl bromodimethylacetate, could be directly converted into the amides 4a-4c by aminolysis with the lithium amide of 3,4-dimethoxy-N-methylphenethylamine. Instead of open-chain amides, the lactams 5a and 5b are obtained when the lithium amide of 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine (i.e., of a primary rather than secondary amine) is used for the aminolysis. The synthesized compounds were tested for their ability to decrease the resistance to vincristine in a multidrug-resistant subline of murine leukemic lymphoblasts that are 300-fold resistant to the antiproliferative drug. The amides 4a and 4c, and lactam 5a, all of which have a highly branched carbon backbone, were active. Lactam 5a reduced the vincristine resistance by 90% at a 2-microM concentration.
11077681,0,2000,Tsitologiia,[Genome multiplication in the trophoblasts and glandular epithelium of endometrium during embryo implantation and placentation of silver fox].,Dynamics of genome multiplication during establishment of interrelations between the trophoblast and the glandular epithelium of endometrium was studied in the course of placenta formation in the silver fox. Endometrium response on the embryo implantation exhibits some features of inflammation. In the course of placenta formation the trophoblast gains access to the endometrial glandular epithelium zone, while the endometrial blood vessels grow the other way into the expanding trophoblast zone. The trophoblast gradually replaces the whole epithelium and part of the stroma of the endometrium, closely adjoining the endometrial vessels but not disrupting them. Cytophometric DNA measurements in the trophoblast nuclei have shown that most of the nuclei are polyploid: predominantly 4c-64c, occasionally 128c and 256c. Polyploidy of the trophoblast may result from various types of polyploidizing mitoses. Cytophotometric DNA measurements in mitotic figures have revealed mitoses with DNA amounts equal to 4c (2n), 8c (4n), and 16c (8n), which indicates that trophoblast cells in the silver fox placenta are able to enter mitosis prior to the octaploid level. Higher degrees of polyploidy in the trophoblast cells may be achieved presumably by endoreduplication. In the silver fox polyploidization of uterine grandular epithelial cells during placentation occurs until the level of 8c. Thus, the tissue-specific response of the uterus to the implanting embryo is an active proliferation and polyploidization of the glandular epithelium, rather than formation of a population of polyploid decidual cells (i.e. connective tissue cells). Using the silver fox endotheliochorial placenta as an example, a regularity has been confirmed that cells of both maternal and fetal origin are polyploid in sites of their contact in placenta, which might be of protective significance in the contact of allogenic organisms.
11042594,0,2000,J Comp Neurol,AMPA receptor subunit expression in trigeminal neurons during postnatal development.,Trigeminal motoneurons (Mo5) and mesencephalic trigeminal neurons (Me5) are important constituents of the neural circuitry responsible for jaw movements. Non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors are a critical component of the brainstem circuitry responsible for reflex and centrally activated jaw movements; however, little is known about the expression of these receptors in neonatal oral-motor circuitry. Receptor immunohistochemistry using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against GluR1, GluR2/3/4c, and GluR4, respectively, and a monoclonal antibody directed against the GluR2 subunit, were used in rats at postnatal day (P)1, P3, P5, P10, P19-21, P32-35, and P60 to describe the expression of the alpha-amino-d-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor in Mo5 and Me5 neurons. In Mo5, immunoreactivity was noted for all antibodies throughout the time frame sampled. Neurons in caudal portions of Me5 displayed immunoreactivity to each antibody except at P60 when GluR2 immunoreactivity was absent. Neurons located in rostral Me5 displayed GluR2/3/4c and GluR4 immunoreactivity throughout the time frame, GluR1 immunoreactivity emerged at P3 and a transient expression of GluR2 expression was observed between P10 and P32-35. The lack of labeling of some neurons in both regions, coupled with differences in temporal expression, suggests that there are differences in the AMPA receptor phenotype within and between Mo5 and Me5 during postnatal development. Differences in AMPA subunit composition suggest a complex role for AMPA-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission in brainstem circuits controlling jaw movements.

Dehalogenation of 4a-d using zinc in diethylether/acetic acid gives 5a-d, respectively. A multinuclear NMR study revealed the 1H-, 13C- and 15N-NMR data of 1a and 1c. Molecular spectroscopic data of 1c were determined by high resolution infrared spectroscopy. The by-products of the pyrolysis are the E and Z isomers of the halogenated ethenyl isocyanides H(Cl)C=CCl-NC (6a) and H3C(Cl)C=CCl-NC (6c) which have been characterized by IR, MS and NMR spectroscopy.

11003541,0,2000,Appl Radiat Isot,Digital pulse processing: new possibilities in nuclear spectroscopy,Digital pulse processing is a signal processing technique in which detector (preamplifier output) signals are directly digitized and processed to extract quantities of interest. This approach has several significant advantages compared to traditional analog signal shaping. First, analyses can be developed which take pulse-by-pulse differences into account, as in making ballistic deficit compensations. Second, transient induced charge signals, which deposit no net charge on an electrode, can be analyzed to give, for example, information on the position of interaction within the detector. Third, deadtimes from transient overload signals are greatly reduced, from tens of micros to hundreds of ns. Fourth, signals are easily captured, so that more complex analyses can be postponed until the source event has been deemed &quot;interesting&quot;. Fifth, signal capture and processing may easily be based on coincidence criteria between different detectors or different parts of the same detector. XIAs recently introduced CAMAC module, the DGF-4C, provides many of these features for four input channels, including two levels of digital processing and a FIFO for signal capture for each signal channel. The first level of digital processing is &quot;immediate&quot;, taking place in a gate array at the 40 MHz digitization rate, and implements pulse detection, pileup inspection, trapezoidal energy filtering, and control of an external 25.6 micros long FIFO. The second level of digital processing is provided by a digital signal processor (DSP), where more complex algorithms can be implemented. To illustrate digital pulse processing's possibilities, we describe the application of the DGF-4C to a series of experiments. The first, for which the DGF was originally developed, involves locating gamma-ray interaction sites within large segmented Ge detectors. The goal of this work is to attain spatial resolutions of order 2 mm sigma within 70 mm x 90 mm detectors. We show how pulse shape analysis allows ballistic deficit to be significantly reduced in these detectors. A second experiment involves studying exotic nuclei by observing their 1 MeV direct proton decays following implantation in a Si crossed stripe detector at 35 MeV. Whereas the implantation paralyzes analog electronics for almost 10 micros, the DGF allows the study of decay times as short as 1 micros. Initial energy and time resolution results are presented. Finally, we show how the DGF's precise timing and coincidence capabilities lead to significant experimental simplifications in dealing with phoswich detectors, low background counting work, and trace Pb detection by coincident photon detection.

10963061,0,2000,Xenobiotica,Intestinal absorption and excretion of troglitazone sulphate, a major biliary metabolite of troglitazone.,1. Deconjugation by sulphate transfer and intestinal absorption of troglitazone sulphate (M1), the major metabolite of a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drug, troglitazone, were studied in the male F344 rat using 14C-troglitazone, 4C-M1 and 35S-M1. 2. Some part of M1, produced in the liver and excreted mostly in the bile, was deconjugated in the intestine to the parent compound, troglitazone, by arylsulphate sulphotransferase originated from intestinal flora. However, deconjugation of M1 was not catalyzed by arylsulphatases. Caecal injection of M1 led to the appearance of troglitazone and M1 in plasma. 3. Biliary excretion mostly as M1, and, following absorption, as M1 and troglitazone after deconjugation, were indicated as the basis for the enterohepatic circulation of troglitazone. 4. Enterohepatic circulation may prolong the pharmacological effects of troglitazone.
10928092,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Prognostic significance of newly defined ploidy related parameters in melanoma.,5c exceeding rate is the parameter, most frequently showing prognostic impact. The CAS200 image analyzer makes possible the measurement of additional parameters defining single subfractions of cells, as for example the ratios of diploid, aneuploid, tetraploid, octaploid and 16-ploid cells. The main objective of this study was to define the prognostic significance of these new parameters in 106 primary melanomas with known survival time. 29 out of 106 melanomas were euploid. 77 out of 106 showed an aneuploid histogram. Multivariate analysis with Cox regression demonstrated that the percentage of aneuploid cells between 2c and 4c and the percentage of aneuploid cells between 4c and 8c, but not 5c exceeding rate, were able to influence survival time.
10927232,0,2000,Acta Crystallogr A,A multisolution method of phase determination by combined maximization of entropy and likelihood. VI. The use of error-correcting codes as a source of phase permutation and their application to the phase problem in powder, electron and macromolecular crystallography.,The use of error-correcting codes as a source of efficient designs of phase permutation schemes is described. Three codes are used, all taken from the Bricogne BUSTER program [Bricogne (1993). Acta Cryst. D49, 37-60]: the Hamming [7, 4, 3], the Nordström-Robinson (16, 256, 6) and the Golay [24, 12, 8] or its punctured [23, 12, 7] form. These are used in a maximum-entropy-likelihood phasing environment to carry out phase permutation of basis-set reflections instead of the usual quadrant permutation or magic integer approaches. The use of codes in this way inevitably introduces some errors in the phase choices, but for most structures this is not significant especially when the gain in sampling efficiency is considered. For example, the Golay [24, 14, 8] allows the permutation of 24 centric phases in such a way that only 4096 phase sets are produced instead of 2(24) = 16777216, and one of these sets has, at most, only four wrong phases. The method is successfully applied to three powder diffraction data sets of increasing complexity, and with increasing degrees of overlap {Mg(3)BN(3), Sigma-2 ([Si(64)O(128)].4C(10)H(17)N) and the NU-3 zeolite}, a sparse electron diffraction data set for buckminsterfullerene, C(60), and the small protein molecule crambin at 3 Å resolution where 42 reflections are phased with a Uweighted mean phase error of 58.5 degrees.
10926218,0,2000,Chemistry,Rigidified calixarenes bearing four carbamoylmethylphosphineoxide or carbamoylmethylphosphoryl functions at the wide rim,Conformationally rigidified tetraCMPO derivatives have been prepared from calix[4]arene bis(crown ether) 4a in which adjacent oxygens are bridged at the narrow rim by two diethylene glycol links. Acylation of the tetraamine 4c with the CMPO-active ester 5b gave the tetraphosphine oxide 6a, while the tetraphosphinate 6b and the tetraphosphonate 6c were obtained by Arbuzov reaction of tetrabromoacetamido derivative 7 with PhP(OEt)2 or P(OEt)3. The extraction ability of these CMPO derivatives was checked for selected lanthanides and actinides and compared with the analogous compounds 1b, 10b and 10d derived from calix[4]arene tetrapentyl ether. All rigidified bis(crown ether) ligands are more effective extractants than their pentyl ether counterparts and require only 1/10 of the concentration (cL= 10 4M) to obtain the same distribution coefficients, while with CMPO itself a 2,000-fold concentration is necessary. This could be a consequence of a better preorganisation of the ligating functions owing to the rigidity which on the other hand did not change the observed selectivity for americium (DAm/DEu=9-19) and for light lanthanides over heavy ones. NMR relaxivity titration curves show that the complex of Gd3+ with ligand 6a is highly oligomerised in anhydrous acetonitrile over a large range of ligand:metal concentration ratios. Nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) profiles also showed that large oligomers were formed, and their mean tumbling times were deduced from the Solomon-Bloembergen-Morgan equations. The NMR spectra of dia- and paramagnetic lanthanide complexes with 6a agreed with the presence of two conformers with an elongated calix[4]arene skeleton in which the distances between opposite methylene groups are different. Contrary to what was observed with ligand 2a, the addition of nitrate ions does not labilize the metal complexes, presumably because of the rigidification effect of the ether bridges. Single-crystal X-ray structures were obtained for the active ester 5b and for diphenylphosphorylacetic acid 5a.
10925119,0,2000,Urology,Relationship between flow cytometric DNA ploidy and nuclear grade with endocrine dysfunction in adrenal cortical adenomas.,OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship among the DNA ploidy, histopathologic features, and clinical syndrome in adrenal cortical adenomas, because the cells often show variability in nuclear size and configuration.METHODS: Our study included 44 adenomas associated with primary aldosteronism and 23 adenomas associated with Cushing syndrome. Normal adrenal glands from patients with renal carcinoma served as the controls. Paraffin-embedded tissues were examined for DNA content by flow cytometry. The mean percentage of G(2)/M (4C%) of the control samples was 3.8%. Tetraploid was represented by a histogram with both a 4C peak greater than 9% (mean + 2.4 SD of control samples) and a small 8C peak.RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis revealed diploidy in 30, tetraploidy in 27, and aneuploidy in 8 of the 67 adenomas; 2 adenomas could not be classified. All 17 normal adrenal glands showed diploidy. A significant relationship was noted between DNA ploidy and the clinical syndrome (ie, a larger proportion of adenomas with primary aldosteronism had a tetraploid DNA histogram compared with adenomas with Cushing syndrome, P &lt;0. 0001). Adenomas with primary aldosteronism had a significantly higher nuclear grade (III or IV) than did tumors with Cushing syndrome (P = 0.033). A significant relationship was also observed between DNA ploidy and nuclear grade in 57 euploid tumors, with tetraploid tumors often showing the highest nuclear grade (P = 0. 037).CONCLUSIONS: Our results have demonstrated that adrenal cortical adenomas associated with primary aldosteronism often reveal severe nuclear pleomorphism, indicating that nuclear pleomorphism might be due to a tetraploid stemline.
10920530,0,2000,Boll Chim Farm,New indole, aminoindole and pyranoindole derivatives with anti-inflammatory activity.,6-Methoxy-1-methyl-2,3-diphenyl indol-5-carboxaldehyde (2) was demethylated to give the 6-hydroxy derivative (3) which was cyclized to the pyrano[3,2-f]indole derivatives (4a-d) by the action of ethyl acetoacetate, diethyl malonate, malononitrile, ethyl cyanoacetate. When 4c was boiled in acetic acid, it gave 4d. Reduction of 4c by sodium borohydride yielded the orthoaminonitrile (5). Friedel Craft's acetylation of 1b yielded the 5-acetyl derivative (6), which reacted with hydrazine hydrate, o-toluidine and o-aminophenol to afford (7a-c). Demethylation of (1b) yielded the hydroxyl derivative (8), which differs from compound (9) obtained by demethylation of 6-methoxy-2,3-diphenyl-indole (1a). Friedel Craft's acetylation of 9 gave the 7-acetyl compound (10) which yielded the hydrazone (11). The reaction of primary aromatic amines, (i.e. p-nitroaniline, p-anisidine and p-bromo aniline) with 6-methoxy-1-methyl-2,3-diphenyl-indol-5-carboxaldehyde (2) gave the Schiff bases (12a-c). The latter compounds were reduced by sodium borohydride to yield the corresponding Mannich bases (13a-c). Treatment of 12a-c with thioglycolic acid led to the thiazolidin-4-one-derivatives (14a-c). When (12a-c) reacted with cyanoacetamide, the amino group was replaced by the active methylene to form the cyano compound (15). The structure was confirmed by reacting the carboxaldehyde (2) with cyanoacetamide to yield (15). Pharmacological screening was has been carried out to test the anti-inflammatory activity, ulcerogenecity, effect on the isolated rabbit intestine and the antispasmodic activity.
10886264,0,2000,Clin Physiol,Brozek two-compartment model under-estimates body fat in black female athletes.,The purpose of this study was to compare percentage body fat (%BF) values of black female athletes calculated using the Heymsfield four-compartment (4C), Brozek two-compartment (2C) and Schutte models. Eleven collegiate athletes underwent total body water (TBW) assessment, hydrostatic weighing (HW) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Repeated-measures ANOVA determined that the 4C model yielded %BF values (16.2 +/- 1.5%) that were higher than the Brozek model (13.6 +/- 1.7%) but similar to the Schutte model (16.7 +/- 1.6%). The fat-free mass density of the athletes (1.109 +/- 0. 002 kg l-1) was significantly higher than the value 1.1 kg l-1 assumed by the 2C model. We conclude that in lean black female athletes, the Brozek 2C model under-estimates %BF, and that, if only HW is available, the Schutte model should be used to estimate %BF.
10897636,0,2000,Pol Merkur Lekarski,[Epidemiology and clinical course of HCV infection in children and adolescents with chronic renal failure].,The aim of the study was to evaluate epidemiology and clinical course of HCV infection in children and adolescents with end-stage renal disease. The study involved 70 patients, aged 1-25 years, 31 M, 39 F: group of 40 dialysed (27 HD, 13 CAPD) and 30 patients suffering from different chronic renal disease as a control group. Anti-HCV antibodies were assayed by EIA 3rd gene (Abbott Diagnostic) and were sought by LIATEK HCV 3rd gene. HCv RNA was detected and measured by a standardised HCV RNA PCR assay (Amplicor Roche). HCV genotypes were identified by InnoLIPA (Innogenetics). HCV infection was diagnosed in 20 (50%) dialysed and in 3 (10%) non-dialysed patients. None of the HCV infected patients presented the clinical symptoms of hepatitis; the mild activity of ALT was observed in 8 cases only. HCV viremia was relatively low: 365 x 103 copies/mL in PD and 110,9 x 103 copies/mL in HD patients. 3 genotypes of HCV were identified: 1a, 1b and 4c/4d. In 3 cases liver biopsy was performed, no cirrhosis was diagnosed.

10839179,0,2000,Chemistry,Which electron count rules are needed for four-center three-dimensional aromaticity?,A series of charged and neutral four-center n-electron (4c-ne, n = 1-4) molecules based on the adamantane framework, but which include combinations of boron, nitrogen, and phosphorus atoms at bridgehead positions, were studied computationally at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of density functional theory (DFT). The three-dimensional aromaticity, observed earlier for the 1,3,5,7-bisdehydroadamantane dication (1), is found to be general for 4c-2e electron systems. The degree of electron delocalization, evaluated by energetic, geometric, and various magnetic criteria, is quite independent of the molecular symmetry (point groups vary from Td to Cs), the degeneracy of the orbitals, the molecular charges, and the nature of the atoms participating in the delocalized bonding. Although the multiple positive (e.g., in 1 and some of the heteroatom systems) and multiple negative charges are strongly repulsive, the rigid adamantane frameworks help hold the bridgehead atoms within bonding distances with the fewer available electrons. The corresponding 4c-1e doublets are approximately half as aromatic as the 4c-2e singlets based on the same criteria. However, the three-electron systems may either adopt distorted but still four-center delocalized structures, or alternative 3c-2e two-dimensional arrangements in which the fourth bridgehead atom is more distant. There is no need to derive special rules for each point group for 4c-ne systems. Although the three-dimensional stabilization is computed to be quite appreciable, ranging between 10 and 50 kcalmol(-1), this delocalization energy is generally not sufficient to overcome distortion due to strain in higher homologues of 1 and in analogous noncage systems. Among the various 4c-2e homoadamantanedehydro dications studied, only the 1,8-dehydrohomoadamandiyl-3,6-dication forms a three-dimensional aromatic system.
10830896,0,2000,Microbiol Res,Larval susceptibility of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), to Bacillus thuringiensis H serovars isolated in Japan.,A total of 1700 Japanese strains of Bacillus thuringiensis, belonging to at least 47 H serogroups, were examined for insecticidal activity against larvae of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. The high-level toxicity was associated with 612 isolates (36.0%). Of these, 608 isolates (99.3%) fell into 13 H serogroups belonging to the low-numbered H serotypes, H1-H10. Conversely, most isolates belonging to the high-numbered serotypes (&gt;H10) had little or no larvicidal activity; only one isolate of the serovar japonensis H23 was active. P xylostella larvae were susceptible to 89.8% of the serovar morrisoni H8a:8b strains and 85.7% of galleriae H5a:5b strains. High values of 60-80% were also obtained in six serovars (thuringiensis H1, alesti H3a:3c, kurstaki H3a:3b:3c, kenyae H4a:4c, aizawai H7, and tolworhi H9), while relatively low values of &lt;60% in two other common serovars, sotto H4a:4b and darmstadiensis H10a:10b. Five selected isolates, belonging to H serovars other than kurstaki and aizawai, were 10-60 times less toxic than the reference strain HD-1 (serovar kurstaki). Parasporal inclusion proteins of these strains were immunologically unrelated to those of the strain HD-1 and the aizawai type strain.
10825748,0,2000,Radiat Res,The relative biological effectiveness of low doses of 14 MeV neutrons in steady-state murine spermatogenesis as determined by flow cytometry.,The relative biological effectiveness of 14 MeV neutrons in the low-dose range &lt; or =1 Gy has been determined in differentiating and differentiated spermatogonia. Male NMRI mice were exposed to single doses of 2 cGy to 3 Gy of (60)Co gamma rays or neutrons. The ratios of testicular S-phase cells, 4c primary spermatocytes, and elongated spermatids were quantified by DNA flow cytometry 2 to 70 days after irradiation and were found to decrease. Histological samples and testis weight were analyzed in parallel. Doses of 2-5 cGy neutrons and 10-50 cGy gamma rays significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased the proportions of S-phase cells, spermatocytes and elongated spermatids at 4, 14 and 28 days postirradiation. For S-phase cells, the biphasic shape of the cell survival curves was described with a D(50) of 5 cGy neutrons. The D(50) for (60)Co gamma rays and the relative biological effectiveness could not be determined. The relative biological effectiveness of neutrons at 50% reductions of testis weight, primary spermatocytes, and elongated spermatids were 2.5, 10.0 and 6.1, respectively. This in vivo assay is interesting because of its sensitivity at dose ranges that are relevant for exposures in the environment, the workplace and radiotherapy.
10824165,0,2000,Chirality,Practical stereoselective synthesis of (2,3,4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[b]azepin-5-yl)acetic acid.,Highly enantioselective asymmetric hydrogenation of readily accessible olefins, (E)- and (Z)-[1-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-1,2,3, 4-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[b]azepin-5-ylidene]acetic acid (4a and 4b, respectively) and [1-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-2, 3-dihydro-1H-benzo[b]azepin-5-yl]acetic acid (4c), is presented as an efficient and straightforward route to (R)-[1-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-2,3,4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[b]azepin-5-yl]acetic acid [(R)-1] which is a key intermediate for the synthesis of non-peptide AVP V2-agonist. Hydrogenation of carboxylic acid 4c gave (R)-1 in quantitative yield and 85% ee using Ru(OAc)2[(S)-H8-BINAP], a Ru(II) complex of a partially hydrogenated BINAP (H8-BINAP), as a catalyst. When (R)-1 of 76% ee was transformed into the corresponding isopropylamide 6, pure enantiomer (R)-6 was obtained in 75% yield by recrystallization from MeOH.
10795820,0,2000,Carbohydr Res,An efficient access to protected disialylated glycohexaosyl threonine present on the leukosialin of activated T-lymphocytes.,The total synthesis of the threonine-linked core 2 class disialylated hexasaccharide in a completely protected form was accomplished for the first time.

For the introduction of the amino acid, the azide group was used to temporarily mask the amino group of GalNAc so as to obtain an alpha-glycosidic linkage without participation from the C-2 substituent. The threonine was attached to the sugar unit at the monosaccharide stage to avoid loss of oligosaccharide at a later stage. The Fmoc and allyl ester protected amino acid at the reducing end facilitates efficient glycopeptide synthesis on solid-phase support.
10752118,0,2000,Tsitologiia,[Mitotic activity, ploidy and ultrastructure of cardiomyocytes from human embryo and fetuses].,There is an evidence that mitotic activity of human cardiomyocytes in late fetal and early postnatal ontogenesis is very low. But little is known of the division of human cardiomyocytes at earlier stages of development. In this study mitotic activity of ventricular and atrial human cardiomyocytes of 4-8-week-old embryos and 17-32-week-old fetuses has been studied. On these stages the mitotic index is relatively low to reduce moderately within the 1st to the 3rd trimester of pregnancy from 1.4 to 0.7%. These findings are consistent with the data on cell ploidy demonstrating the presence of relatively small share of myocytes with 3c and 4c DNA in ventricles of 6-8-week-old embryos and 12-22-week-old fetuses. The share of such cells in the 1st and 2nd trimesters of pregnancy varies from 19 to 24% and from 8 to 18%, respectively. Cells with 3c and 4c DNA are most likely to be in mitotic cycle. This assumption is supported by electron microscope pictures showing all phases of typical mitosis. Cyclic changes of myofibrillar ultrastructure during mitosis of prenatal human cardiomyocytes are the same as during mitosis of low differentiated myocytes in mouse and rat hearts. These results suggest that in prenatal human cardiomyogenesis the level of myocyte differentiation and the cell number increase at slow rate.
10743001,0,2000,Rev Neurol,[The genetics of type 1 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the hereditary focal neuropathies and the hereditary distal motor neuropathies].,INTRODUCTION: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTD) or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy shows great genetic heterogeneity. The type 1 (CMT-1) or demyelinating form and the type 2 (CMT-2) or neuronal form are two clinically and genetically distinct forms.DEVELOPMENT: Apart from the above mentioned motor and sensory forms, there is another type of neuropathy in which the clinical and neurophysiological involvement is exclusively motor and is known as distal spinal atrophy or hereditary distal motor neuropathy (HDMN), which is a syndrome to be included among the CMTD. The CMT-1 is the most prevalent form and the best understood from the genetic point of view. At least four genes have been reported to be involved: the gene for 22 kDa peripheral myelin protein (PMP-22), situated on the 17p11.2 chromosome (locus CMT-1A); the gene for myelin 0 protein situated on chromosome 1q23 (locus CMT-1B); the gene for conexine 32 (Cx32), found on chromosome Xq13 (locus CMT-X) and the gene EGR2 found on chromosome 10q21.1-q22.1. The genes PMP-22 and PO are related to autosomal dominant forms, the gene Cx32 is transmitted linked to chromosome X and transmission of gene EGR2 has been shown in both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms. In the demyelinating forms with autosomal recessive inheritance, positive linkage has been found on four different loci: 8q21.1 (CMT-4A), 11q23 (CMT-4B), 5q23-33 (CMT-4C) and 8q24 in a form related to deafness (CMT-Lom). Two loci have been identified for the autosomal dominant forms of the HDMN. A large family initially and predominantly of the upper limbs is mapped on chromosome 7p (HDMN-V) and another with the classical phenotype mapped on chromosome 12q24. In the familial neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies in most families, deletion of the locus CMT-1A was found, and in rare cases mutation precisely of the PMP-22 gene. In familial amyotrophic neuralgia, genetic molecular analysis has shown linkage with markers on the chromosome 17q24-25.

Conformations of the compounds 3a, 7a, and their per-O-acetyl derivatives 4,5-di-O-acetyl-6-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-D-erythro-hexono-1,6-lactam (3b) and 2,4,5-tri-O-acetyl-6-amino-3,6-dideoxy-D-xylo-hexono-1,6-lactam (7b) in solutions were deduced from the analysis of NMR spectra using a modified Karplus equation and compared with the results of circular dichroism measurement of lactams 3a and 7a. Conformation 4C(1,N) was revealed for solid lactams 3a and 7a and for lactams 7a and 7b in solution, while lactams 3a and 3b in solution exist in the approximately 1:1 equilibrium of the conformers 4C(1,N) and (1,N)C4.
10705240,0,2000,Oncology,Risk factors of metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinomas.,Lymph node and distant metastasis were comparatively studied in 225 oral carcinomas, and factors predisposing toward metastasis were investigated using clinical and immunohistopathological approaches. Neither the sites of tumors nor T-stage was correlated with either type of metastasis. Tumor cell differentiation was weakly correlated with lymph node metastasis, and stromal reaction (the degree of cell infiltration) did not differ greatly between metastasis-positive and negative tumors, although natural killer (NK) activities were correlated with lymph node metastasis. However, the mode of tumor cell invasion was closely associated with both lymph node and distant metastases. In grade 4C and 4D tumors, distant and lymph node metastases were observed in 8 (16%) and 31 (62%) cases, respectively, while of 68 grade 1 and 2 tumors, distant metastasis was not observed in any, and lymph node metastasis occurred in only 15 (22. 1%). In addition, the expression of p53 protein was correlated with lymph node metastasis; of 70 tumors without p53 protein expression, 23 (32.9%) revealed lymph node metastasis, while it occurred in 54 out of 96 tumors positive for p53 protein. However, p53 protein expression was not associated with distant metastasis, and p24 protein, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, did not show any relationship with either type of metastasis. These results indicate that lymph node metastasis is correlated with multiple factors in the host and tumor cells, but distant metastasis is only correlated with the mode of tumor cell invasion, suggesting that the former can be highly accurately predicted by invasion mode, p53 protein expression and NK activity.
10697537,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Relevance of ploidy related parameters for prognosis in malignant fibrous histiocytomas.,Ploidy associated parameters were determined in 161 malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFH) by DNA image cytometry. The rate of euploid cases in MFH with histopathological grade I was 42%, grade II 16% and grade III 6%. Univariate analyses showed that cases with a low percentage of diploid cells (&lt; 40%) and cases with high rates of aneuploid cells between 4c and 8c (&gt; 9%), octaploid cells (&gt; 0%) and 16-ploid cells (&gt; 0%), high 2.5c (&gt; 60%) and 5c (&gt; 16%) exceeding rates and cases with high DNA indices of the first (&gt; 1.08) and the second (&gt; 3.78) peak had significantly reduced survival rates. Multivariate analyses with Cox regression demonstrated that in addition to grade, only the percentage of aneuploid cells between 4c and 8c, the 5c exceeding rate and the DNA index of the first peak had independent prognostic impact. It was concluded that besides ploidy status and grading, ploidy associated parameters are suited for prediction of survival in MFH.
10682907,0,2000,J Drug Target,Synthesis and characterization of aromatic ring-based cationic lipids for gene delivery in vitro and in vivo.,A new series of cationic lipids has been synthesized for gene delivery using 3,5-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol as the backbone and starting material. Using CMV driven expression system and luciferase gene as a reporter, we demonstrated that the transfection activity of these new lipids when formulated with Tween 80 as co-lipid is comparable to that of DOTAP, one of the most commonly used cationic lipids for transfection. Among the four different cell lines tested including murine melanoma BL-6 cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells, HepG2 and HeLa cells, the highest transgene expression was seen in 293 cells. Results from in vivo experiments using mice as an animal model show that these cationic lipids preferentially transfect the cells in the lung upon tail vein administration. The cationic lipid, N,N,N-trimethyl-N-[3,5-bis(tetradecyloxy)benzyl] ammonium bromide 4c(di-C14:0) with two 14-hydrocarbon chains exhibits the best transfection activity. These results suggest that these new aromatic ring-based cationic lipids are useful transfection reagents for both in vitro and in vivo gene transfer studies.

N-(1-cyanoalkyl)-N-hydroxyureas.,Nineteen N-(1-cyanoalkyl)-N-hydroxyureas comprising aliphatic (3a-i, 4a, b, and 5a) and aromatic (3j-n, 4c, 5b) compounds were prepared, fourteen of them for the first time, and tested for antithrombotic (p.o. administration to rats, 60 mg/kg) effects. The N-(1-cyanocyclohexyl)-N-hydroxy-N'-phenylurea (3j) was most potent and inhibited laser-induced (35 mW, 50 ms) thrombus formation in arterioles by 21% and that in venules by 15%. The compounds form nitric oxide in vitro by the addition of a Fe3(+)-porphyrin complex and an oxygen donor. Moreover, the most active compound 3j in vivo exhibits the highest NO formation in vitro. Furthermore, it was shown that the cyano group is essential for the desired activities and NO formation. These results suggest that the title compounds act as NO donors.

The antinociceptive activity of the compounds, determined by the mouse tail-flick test, showed that the introduction of a hydroxy substituent in position 5 of the isoquinoline nucleus generated compounds 4c and 5c, which were as potent as codeine. Conformational analysis and superimposition of energy minima conformers of the compounds on phenazocine revealed that the main proposed opioid pharmacophores were well matched.
10634092,0,2000,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Synthesis and pharmacology of new dithiocarbamic acid esters derived from phenothiazine and diphenylamine.,2-Methylthio-10-[(N,N-disubstituted-thiocarbamoylthio)acetyl]- phenothiazines (4a-g) and N-(3-methylthiophenyl)-N-[(N,N-disubstituted- thiocarbamoylthio)acetyl]phenylamines (5a-g) were synthesized by subsequent treatment of 2-methylthio- 10-chloroacetylphenothiazines (1) and N-(3-methylthiophenyl)-N-chloroacetylphenylamine (2) with potassium salts of N,N-disubstituted dithiocarbamic acid derivatives (3a-i). The structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, EIMS) methods. The antihistaminic and anticholinergic activities of 4a, 4c, 4e-g, 5a-c, 5e, and 5 g were evaluated in comparison with H1-receptor antagonist mepyramine and nonselective cholinergic antagonist atropine. In the first series of experiments, the cumulative concentration-response curves to histamine (10(-8)-10(-4) M) and acetylcholine (10(-8)-10(-4) M) were constructed in seperate fundus strips. The test compounds exhibited marked antihistaminic activity at 10(-6) M concentration but compounds did not influence acetylcholine induced contractions. Concentration-related experiments carried out on 4 g and 5 g revealed that a moderate antihistaminic activity was present at 10(-7) M concentration of the compounds and became strong at higher concentrations. In the second series of experiments, the cumulative concentration-response curve to histamine (10(-9)-10(-4) M) was constructed in guinea-pig ileum segments. Maximal responses were obtained by 10(-6)-3 x 10(-6) M concentrations of histamine in ileum segments. Similar inhibitions of histamine contractions were also obtained with the test compounds. Their inhibitory effectiveness was evaluated by comparing the pA2 values.
10629662,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Differentiation-dependent expression of growth regulatory cytokines and their receptors in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.,Cytokines, such as IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha are capable of affecting keratinocyte proliferation in the microenvironment of the tumor. Their elevated expression along with high levels of their receptor mRNAs was determined by a semiquantitative reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method in biopsies of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas that were established as histologically well or moderately differentiated. In contrast, tumors with poor differentiation exhibited low levels of these growth suppressive factors, although levels of their receptors were elevated. In fact, expression of these growth suppressive cytokines highly correlated with the histological status of tumors suggesting a role of these agents in growth regulation of those tumors. Apparently, growth signaling in these tumors differs in the availability of either the ligand or the receptor.
10629658,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Tc-99m MDP scintimammography in palpable and nonpalpable breast lesions: comparison with mammographic probability of malignancy.,We evaluated the contribution of Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) scintimammography (MDP-SMM) to the diagnosis of breast cancer in 96 patients with 109 (52 palpable, 57 nonpalpable) breast lesions and compared them with mammography. Mammographic classification of the lesions were done as probably malignant (29), indeterminate (29) and probably benign (51). There were 23 malignant and 86 benign lesions. MDP-SMM successfully detected 16 of 23 (70%) breast cancers. Twelve of the 13 palpable and 4 of the 10 nonpalpable cancers showed Tc-99m MDP accumulation. Eight of the 86 (9%) benign breast lesions showed Tc-99m MDP accumulation (false positives). In the mammographically indeterminate group, MDP-SMM changed 22 of the 24 false positives into true negatives and showed 2 false negatives. In the 35 lesions detected in dense breasts, 10 of the 13 false positives were changed into true negatives and showed 1 false negative. As a conclusion, combined use of MDP-SMM with mammography seems to be useful in cases with mammographically indeterminate breast lesions and dense breasts and may help to preclude unnecessary breast biopsies.
10629656,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Adjuvant high-dose chemotherapy with epirubicin and ifosfamide in nodal positive breast cancer.,INTRODUCTION: Morbidity and mortality, disease-free- and overall survival were analysed in an adjuvant high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) study with ifosfamide and epirubicin for high-risk (&gt; or = 10 positive lymph nodes) breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 21 patients (pts) were treated with 4 cycles of ViEC (vindesine, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) as standard chemotherapy. After the second cycle, CD34+ stem cells were mobilised with G-CSF. HDCT consisted of epirubicin 100 mg/m2 on days (-5)-(-4) before stem-cell rescue and ifosfamide 5000 mg/m2 on days (-5)-(-2).RESULTS: No therapy-related deaths occurred. Mucositis WHO grade III/IV in 52% and neutropenic fever in 81% were the most relevant toxicities. Nausea and vomiting WHO grades III/IV were found in 62.2%. The median duration of leucopenia grade IV was 7 days (range: 4-11) with a median time to platelet recovery &gt; 50,000/microliter of 6 days (range: 4-11). After a median follow-up time of 21 months (range: 12-49 months), six of 21 pts (28.6%) relapsed. Two patients died 12 and 18 months after initial diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant HDCT with epirubicin and ifosfamide is safe and shows good tolerability for high-risk breast cancer.
10629653,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Multiwavelength videomicrofluorometric study of cytotoxic properties of a marine peptide, didemnin B, using adriamycin as reference compound.,Didemnin B (DB), a marine natural product, has very encouraging biological activity in vitro (Antineoplastic, immunosuppressive, antiviral). To learn more about its intracellular effects and targets, videomicrofluorometry on single living cells and a protocol of multiple labeling: Hoechst 342 for nuclear DNA, Rhodamine 123 for mitochondria and Nile Red for plasma membrane, have been used. DB behaves differently from Adriamycin, inducing at its IC50 dose of (20 nM) an accumulation of the CEM-WT lymphoblasts in the S phase of the cell cycle while we observed a 50% decrease of the mitochondrial labeling by R123, showing a decrease of the mitochondrial energetic state. Cytostatic dose of DB (250 nM) confirms these observations. However the treatment with a dose reported as apoptotic (1000 nM) induces a much faster effect (corresponding to that of 72 hours at the IC50 dose), 24 hours incubation induced a drastic decrease of nuclear DNA content as well as of the mitochondria energetic state. The evolution of NAD(P)H cellular content exhibited an increase that seems to indicate that the decrease of mitochondrial energetic state was dependent on inhibition of the mitochondrial activity due to an effect of DB at the mitochondrial level, either direct or mediated. Furthermore, the decrease of mitochondrial labeling appears as a very early event in the mechanisms leading to apoptosis.
10629652,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Treatment of refractory metastatic breast cancer with 5-fluorouracil plus levofolinic acid as continuous venous infusion: a phase II study.,Effective palliation of metastatic breast carcinoma (MBC) after the failure of front-line chemotherapy for advanced disease, often based on the use of anthracyclines and taxanes, is quite difficult to achieve due to the development of dominant neoplastic cellular clones highly resistant to further therapy. Therefore the therapeutic index of second and third line chemotherapeutic treatments is usually quite low. Thirty patients with MBC with progressive disease after anthracycline-based chemotherapy as first line therapy were treated with l-FA 100 mg/m2/day and 5FU 1000 mg/m2/day ad continuous venous infusion for 96 hours every 4 weeks. Most patients (60%) had multiple sites of disease at entry and had visceral lesions as the dominant site of disease. Twenty-eight patients were evaluated for objective response: two patients had clinically progressive disease before restaging after the third cycle of chemotherapy. These patients were considered progressive disease since all patients were included in an intent-to-treat analysis. Nine patients achieved partial response for an overall response rate of 30% (intent-to-treat analysis) with a median duration of 9.5+ months (range 4.0/14.0 months), and disease stability was obtained in 10 cases (33%) with a median duration of 5.5 months (5-11). Progressive disease was recorded in 9 patients. After a median follow-up of 11 months, the overall median survival time of the whole series of patients was 14.0+ months. Objective responses were recorded both at visceral and bone sites. Chemotherapeutic treatment was generally quite well tolerated. No toxic deaths were recorded. Among gastrointestinal side-effects grade 3 stomatitis was noted in 30% of patients, and grade 3 diarrhea in 10% of cases. Grade 3-4 leukopenia was observed in 23% of patients, but significant episodes of febrile neutropenia were limited (2 patients). Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was seen only occasionally in 1 patient. Grade 1 anemia was recorded in 10% of patients. Hand-foot syndrome was noted in 2 patients (7%). Cardiotoxicity was minimal. The combination of 5FU and high-dose I-FA given as 96 hour continuous venous infusion was active, at least in terms of the overall response rate, against anthracycline refractory metastatic breast carcinoma. These results compare favourably with bolus 5FU/FA or other salvage regimens in terms of antineoplastic activity, and is well tolerated both subjectively and objectively by most patients.
10629650,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Induction chemotherapy in non small cell lung cancer stage IIIa-b and IV and second-line treatment.,This study investigates the treatment management and survival of inoperable advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The objective was to treat all patients with induction chemotherapy and then to stratify them for surgery, radiotherapy, second-line chemotherapy or supportive treatment. Of the 359 patients enrolled in the study, 336 fulfilled the study criteria and were classified as follows: 90 stage IIIa, 135 stage IIIb and 111 stage IV. Histological types included 131 squamous cell, 123 adenocarcinomas, 53 undifferentiated non-small, 15 large cell, 3 adenosquamous, 3 bronchoalveolar and 8 unclassified. For all patients induction therapy involved Cisplatin (CDDP) combined chemotherapy and 84% of the patients were also treated with Vindesine and Epirubicin. The mean number of courses was 4 (minimum 2, maximum 11). The result of induction therapy was 49% complete and partial for at least 8 weeks; with minor response included, the total response rate was 67.6%. Fourteen patients (4.16%) achieved analytically complete response, 151 (45%) partial response and 62 (18.5%) minor response. The second-line treatment implemented was as follows: surgical excision, 22 patients (Group A); radiotherapy, 106 patients (Group B); chemotherapy, 91 patients (Group C) and supportive treatment, 117 patients (Group D). Median survival in months was 72 (range 5-120+), 12 (range 2-118), 15 (range 3-48) and 7 (range 3-120) for Groups A-D respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in survival in Group A patients (p &lt; 0.001) but no difference was observed between Groups B and C. Group D patients had significantly lower survival than the other three groups. In conclusion, induction chemotherapy renders a reasonably high response rate in operable NSCLC patients and second-line radiotherapy treatment is not superior to second-line chemotherapy.
10629642,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Prevention of nausea and vomiting (N&amp;V) in cancer patients receiving high-dose cisplatin. Assessment of the potential antiemetic activity of transdermal fentanyl (TTS-F) compared to standard antiemetic treatment in acute and delayed N&amp;V: first clinical report.,A single-institution, prospective, open crossover study was performed to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of transdermal fentanyl (TTS-F) vs intravenous (i.v.) ondansetron (OND), both combined with i.v. DEX, in the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting (N&amp;V), and TTS-F vs metoclopramide (M), both combined with intramuscular (i.m.) DEX, in the prevention of delayed N&amp;V in patients with advanced stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma receiving high-dose (&gt; or = 100 mg/m2) cisplatin. This is the first report on the clinical use of TTS-F in this setting.</AbstractText>: A single-institution, prospective, open crossover study was performed to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of transdermal fentanyl (TTS-F) vs intravenous (i.v.) ondansetron (OND), both combined with i.v. DEX, in the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting (N&amp;V), and TTS-F vs metoclopramide (M), both combined with intramuscular (i.m.) DEX, in the prevention of delayed N&amp;V in patients with advanced stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma receiving high-dose (&gt; or = 100 mg/m2) cisplatin. This is the first report on the clinical use of TTS-F in this setting.PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients were adequately informed of the study characteristics and gave their written informed consent before study entry. The antiemetic treatment for acute N&amp;V consisted of A) OND 8 mg plus DEX 20 mg (i.v.) or B) TTS-F 75 micrograms/h plus DEX 20 mg i.v. For prevention of delayed N&amp;V, patients receiving TTS-F for acute N&amp;V were given TTS-F at the same dosage (75 micrograms/h) on days 2-5, whereas patients receiving OND for acute N&amp;V were treated with M 20 mg orally every 6 h on days 2-5, starting 24 h after CDDP. All patients received DEX 8 mg i.m. every 12 h on days 2 and 3, 4 mg i.m. every 12 h on days 4 and 5, starting 24 h after CDDP. From November 1997 to April 1998, 15 consecutive patients entered the study and were assigned to one of the two alternative treatments for acute N&amp;V. All of them were evaluable. Twelve patients were evaluable for delayed N&amp;V. Seven patients were assigned to Group 1 starting with treatment A (OND + DEX) and 8 patients were assigned to Group 2 starting with treatment B (TTS-F + DEX). In the prevention of acute N&amp;V, the overall efficacy of OND + DEX was statistically significantly higher than that of TTS-F + DEX in achieving Complete Response (CR) and Major Efficacy (ME = CR + Major Response, MaR). As for delayed N&amp;V, the overall efficacy of M + DEX, both in achieving CR and ME, although higher, was statistically not significantly different from that of TTS-F + DEX. Unfortunately, due to the small number of patients included in the study, the sophisticated criteria for evaluating response in antiemetic research, such as the persistence of efficacy, the response after crossing-over, did not make it possible for us to draw additional conclusions, although the trend was in favor of &quot;standard&quot; treatments, particularly in acute N&amp;V. The 'response to treatment A (OND + DEX) in the prevention of acute N&amp;V was in the same range as the response to treatment A (M + DEX) for delayed N&amp;V. The response to treatment B (TTS-F) for acute N&amp;V was lower than the response to the same treatment for delayed N&amp;V. The TTS-F treatment was well-tolerated with no significant side-effects including the well-known opioid-related symptoms. Our study confirms that the currently available standard antiemetic treatments both for acute and delayed N&amp;V must be considered by far the most effective ones for clinical use.
10629638,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Spontaneous evolution of human papillomavirus infection in the uterine cervix.,BACKGROUND: Little is known about the natural history and the malignant potential of low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Cervical cancer remains the second most frequent cause of death in women across the world. Epidemiologic and molecular studies have shown that human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with cervical carcinogenesis. In this prospective study we examined the behavior of low-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions associated with HPV infection over a 6-year period.MATERIAL AND METHODS: During 1992, women with Papanicolaou smears reporting koilocytotic atypia (HPV effect) with or without grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (HPV +/- CINI, low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, LgSIL), along with colposcopic impression of LgSIL were included to the study. Between 1992 and 1998 all women underwent repeat Papanicolaou smears, colposcopic evaluation and HPV DNA testing every six months. HPV typing of cervical scrapes was done by PCR.RESULTS: A total of 330 women completed at least 6 years of follow up. Among women with high-risk HPV types (16/18), the presence of dysplasia (grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) was significantly correlated with the progression of the lesion; 29% of cases with HPV + CINI (15 out of 75) progressed to more severe lesions versus only 9% of cases with HPV infection (18 out of 225), P &lt; 0.001, chi-square test. The incidence of histologically confirmed progressive lesions was significantly greater in women with mild dysplasia (18 out of 75, 24%) compared to women without dysplasia (13 out of 255, 5%), P &lt; 0.001, chi-square test.CONCLUSIONS: In our study HPV typing was not predictive of the evolution of low-grade intraepithelial lesions associated with HPV infection. Standard cytologic screening and colposcopy are the most effective means of monitoring low-grade lesions.
10629636,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of cathepsin D and pS2 in breast disease; results from a prospective study.,The cytosol values of estrogen-regulated proteins cathepsin D and pS2 were evaluated in 166 patients with breast diseases by a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Our aim was to compare their diagnostic accuracy and to define optimal cut-off levels for the cytosol values of these proteins in breast cancer (n = 133). The preoperative mean cytosol cathepsin D values in the breast cancer group were higher than in patients with benign breast disease (p &lt; 0.001). The correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) between Cathepsin D and pS2 measurements was 0.286 (p &lt; 0.001) in breast cancer patients. The ROC analysis indicated that the cathepsin D test was more sensitive than the pS2 test at all specificity levels, and the cathepsin D test reached considerably high sensitivity (86%) at the specificity level of 80%. According to present study, it would seem optimal to use the cut-off level of 33.0 pmol/mg for cathepsin D analysis and the level of 31.0 ng/mg for pS2 in breast cancer. In conclusion, the results of ROC curve analysis suggest that the cathepsin D test has advantage over pS2 because of its higher sensitivity in breast cancer.
10629635,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Docetaxel is effective in the treatment of metastatic endometrial cancer.,BACKGROUND: Systemic treatment of endometrial carcinoma with distant metastases is currently performed, inter alia, with anthracyclines, platinum, paclitaxel, if osfamid or progestins. This is the first report presenting experience in treatment of metastatic endometrial carcinoma with docetaxel.CASE REPORT: A 69-year-old women with adenocarcinoma of the endometrium was treated with primary combined radiotherapy. Two years later disseminated bilateral pulmonary metastases were detected and the patient was submitted to chemotherapy with epirubicin. After three cycles of chemotherapy with epirubicin examinations revealed metastatic progression. Thus, chemotherapy was changed to docetaxel.RESULTS: After three cycles of chemotherapy with docetaxel examinations revealed remission of the described pulmonary metastases more than 50%. A further three cycles of chemotherapy with docetaxel lead to continuing shrinkage of the detectable metastases to less than 25% of the original size. Because of various side effects, like increasing fatigue and asthenia, uncomfortable acral paresthesia and allergic skin reactions, the patient refused to continue chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: We conclude that docetaxel may be an active agent in patients with metastatic endometrial cancer, but care should be taken to minimize side-effects.
10629634,0,2000,Anticancer Res,NA,Human tumor cells have markedly elevated activity of enzymes of the purine and pyrimidine de novo and salvage pathways. Our therapy protocol is based on these findings. Different antimetabolites (MTX, 5-FU, dFdC, AZT) were administered to hit key enzymes. Vindesine and ifosfamide were aimed to block macromolecules. Repair mechanisms were impaired by hydroxyurea and topotecan. DNA transcription was blocked by actinomycin. IFNs (alpha, gamma) and IL-2 served as immuno-modulators. 47 patients (age 61.5 years, Karnowsky score 85%) were treated in an out-patient-setting. Median number of cycles was 3. General toxicity was low. Leucocytes, platelets, and monocytes were significantly reduced during therapy, but returned to normal on day 29. Lymphocyte subtypes did not show significant changes. 3 complete clinical responses, 22 partial responses, 9 progressive diseases were observed. CR occurred in 1/4 patients with kidney, in 1/1 with bladder, and in 1/5 with breast cancer.
10629633,0,2000,Anticancer Res,The impact of 5-FU-based bolus chemotherapy on survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.,BACKGROUND: An analysis was performed to evaluate whether bolus chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) improves survival for patients with advanced colorectal cancer (ACC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two groups of patients were selected from a database which included all patients with colorectal cancer treated in our hospital since 1984. The first group consisted of all patients with irresectable metastases diagnosed between January 1984 and December 1989, who had a performance status of 0 or 1, and were younger than 76 years old. The second group consisted of all patients with irresectable metastases--younger than 76 years old and with a performance status of 0 or 1--who were started on chemotherapy between January 1994 and December 1997. In the first period chemotherapy was never given and in the second period chemotherapy was given to all motivated patients. None of the patients had received a previous metastasectomy or isolated liver perfusion. For chemotherapy, age, location of the metastases, type of surgical intervention for the primary tumor, Hemoglobin, Lactate Dehydrogenase and Carcinoembryonic Antigen concentration we evaluated the relationship with survival. Variables which showed a significant relation with survival in the univariant analysis (logrank test, p &lt; 0.05) were entered into a proportional hazards regression analysis.RESULTS: In the univariant analysis chemotherapy and location of metastases showed a significant relation with survival. The median survival was 11 months for patients who had received chemotherapy and 8 months for untreated patients (p = 0.009). Chemotherapy and location of metastases both retained their significance in a proportional hazards regression analysis.CONCLUSION: In our study group chemotherapy added 3 months to the median life expectancy for patients with ACC.
10629631,0,2000,Anticancer Res,TP53 mutations do not correlate with locoregional recurrence in stage I tongue carcinomas.,BACKGROUND: The abrogation of the TP53 gene is considered to play a central role in the development of human cancers. Exons 5-8 harbor mutations most frequently, mainly of the missense type, resulting in accumulation of the p53 protein. The importance of these alterations as prognostic factors, are issues of controversy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients suffering from stage I tongue carcinoma had been treated with a local surgical excision of the tumor. Seventeen patients had developed a local recurrence in the tongue or cervical (regional) metastases while 17 patients, matched for age and gender to the former group, had no recurring disease within follow-up. Protein p53 was detected through immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis using antibody CM1. Exons 5-8 of the TP53 gene were amplified through the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The presence of mutations analyzed by CDGE (Constant Denaturant Gel Electrophoresis) and detected mutations were subjected to sequencing.RESULTS: 20 out of 34 tumors (59%) showed mutated TP53, 18 tumors were IHC p53 positive, but the correlation between CDGE and IHC was only 56%. Sequencing of the gene was possible in 8 cases.CONCLUSIONS: Neither the presence of mutations nor immunostaining had any impact on the risk of recurrence expressed as life-table analysis of time to recurrence.
10629628,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Angiostatin fragments in urine from patients with malignant disease.,Angiostatin, a family of fragments originating from the NH2-terminal portion of plasminogen, has been described as a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. In order to examine to what extent angiostatin can be detected in cancer patients, urine was collected from 117 patients with different types of malignancies and subjected to Western blot analysis, utilizing antibodies raised against &quot;kringles&quot; 1-3 in plasminogen. A heterogeneous mixture of fragments was observed, with patterns that also varied between patients. Angiostatin fragments were quantified by densitometric scanning. The concentrations were 27 +/- 75 (SD) micrograms L-1 (range, 1-565 micrograms L-1) in urine from cancer patients, as compared to 3 +/- 2 (SD) micrograms L-1 (range, 1-10 micrograms L-1) in urine from healthy individuals. Thirty-three patients (28%) had elevated levels using a cut off level at 15 micrograms L-1 (clearly above the highest level obtained among control subjects). NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of purified angiostatin fragments from one patient showed a heterogeneous pattern, but were consistent with the region between the preactivation peptide in plasminogen and &quot;kringle&quot; 1, as expected. Several of the patients with urinary angiostatin showed signs of poor kidney function. We conclude that angiostatin can be detected in urine from cancer patients, but at present, the clinical significance of this finding is unclear.
10629626,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Expression of Fas ligand in newly diagnosed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Immunocytochemistry was used to analyze the expression of the Fas ligand (FasL) in sixty-four children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). FasL expression was detected in 55 of 64 children (86%). Children with newly diagnosed ALL and FasL expression exhibited longer relapse-free and overall survival times under chemotherapy than did patients who did not express the Fas ligand. These data suggest that Fas/FasL mediated signaling may play a general role in the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs.
10629623,0,2000,Anticancer Res,Radiotherapy in the symptomatic treatment of the oncological patients.,This paper presents an overview on the palliative use of radiotherapy in the treatment of cancer patients. The aim of symptomatic treatment is to improve the patient's quality of life through the control of local symptoms, without serious disturbance of the life style. Radiotherapy can control many symptoms like metastasis bone pain hematological disorders and other.
