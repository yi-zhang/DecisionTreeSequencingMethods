A novel microfluidic biochip for HBV genotyping has been fabricated, for the first time, integrating loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), line probes assay (LiPA) and giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors. Coupling LAMP with LiPA in microfluidic chip shortened reaction time substantially, and combining LAMP with GMR sensor enabled limit of detection to attain 10 copies mL(-1) target HBV DNA molecules in 1 h. Furthermore, the independent designed GMR sensors and microfluidic chip can decrease manufacturing cost and patient's test-cost, and facilitate GMR detector repeating use for signal detection. In addition, the detection system has a lower background signal owing to application of superparamagnetic nanoclusters. And it can be expected to use for multiple target molecules synchronous detection in microfluidic chip based on a characteristic of stationary reaction temperature of LAMP. In conclusion, the neoteric detecting system is well suitable for quick genotyping diagnosis of clinical HBV and other homothetic biomolecule detection in biological and medical fields."

Induction of HO-1 is a beneficial response to tissue injury in diverse animal models of diseases including acute kidney injury. In vitro analysis has shown that the human HO-1 gene is transcriptionally regulated by changes in chromatin conformation, but whether such control occurs in vivo is not known. To enable such an analysis, we generated transgenic mice, harboring an 87-kb bacterial artificial chromosome expressing human HO-1 mRNA and protein and bred these mice with HO-1 knockout mice to generate humanized BAC transgenic mice. This successfully rescued the phenotype of the knockout mice including reduced birth rates, tissue iron overload, splenomegaly, anemia, leukocytosis, dendritic cell abnormalities, and survival after acute kidney injury induced by rhabdomyolysis or cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Transcription factors such as USF1/2, JunB, Sp1, and CTCF were found to associate with regulatory regions of the human HO-1 gene in the kidney following rhabdomyolysis. Chromosome conformation capture and ChIP-loop assays confirmed this in the formation of chromatin looping in vivo. Thus, these bacterial artificial chromosome humanized HO-1 mice are a valuable model to study the human HO-1 gene, providing insight to the in vivo architecture of the gene in acute kidney injury and other diseases."

This review is aimed to summarize some of the most commonly used techniques to determine DNA-protein interactions. In vitro techniques such as footprinting assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, southwestern blotting, yeast one-hybrid assay, phage display and proximity ligation assay have been discussed. The highly versatile in vivo techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation and its variants, DNA adenine methyl transferase identification as well as 3C and chip-loop assay have also been summarized. In addition, some in silico tools have been reviewed to provide computational basis for determining DNA-protein interactions. Biophysical techniques like fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques, FRET-FLIM, circular dichroism, atomic force microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, surface plasmon resonance, etc. have also been highlighted."

Briefly, chromatin is fixed with formaldehyde in vivo to cross-link interacting sites, digested with a restriction enzyme and ligated at a low DNA concentration so that ligation between cross-linked fragments is favored over ligation between random fragments. Ligation products are then analyzed and quantified by PCR. So far, semi-quantitative PCR methods were widely used to estimate the ligation frequencies. However, it is often important to estimate the ligation frequencies more precisely which is only possible by using the real-time PCR. At the same time, it is equally necessary to monitor the specificity of PCR amplification. That is why the real-time PCR with TaqMan probes is becoming more and more popular in 3C studies. In this chapter, we describe the general protocol for 3C analysis with the subsequent estimation of ligation frequencies by using the real-time PCR technology with TaqMan probes. We discuss in details all steps of the experimental procedure paying special attention to weak points and possible ways to solve the problems. A special attention is also paid to the problems in interpretation of the results and necessary control experiments. Besides, in theory, we consider other approaches to analysis of the ligation products used in frames of the so-called 4C and 5C methods. The recently developed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-loop assay representing a combination of 3C and ChIP is also discussed."

Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology allows us to analyze the folding of chromatin in the native cellular state at a resolution beyond that provided by current microscopy techniques. It has been used, for example, to demonstrate that regulatory DNA elements communicate with distant target genes through direct physical interactions that loop out the intervening chromatin fiber. Here we discuss the intricacies of 3C and new 3C-based methods including the 4C, 5C and ChIP-loop assay."
