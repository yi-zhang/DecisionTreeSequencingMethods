On the basis of 16S ribosomal RNA nucleotide sequence homology and subsequent phylogenetic tree analysis, the strain PUW5 was identified as Pseudomonas putida. A bioactive metabolite was extracted and purified using silica gel column chromatography and preparative HPLC. Characterization of metabolite was done by employing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectroscopy (MS). On the basis of spectroscopic data, the metabolite was structurally elucidated as 5-methyl phenazine-1-carboxylic acid betaine (MPCAB). The MPCAB exhibits selective cytotoxicity towards lung (A549) and breast (MDA MB-231) cancer cell lines in dose-dependent manner with IC50 value of 488.7±2.52 nM and 458.6±2.48 nM respectively. The MPCAB exhibited inhibition of cell viability, DNA synthesis, induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. The docking and interaction studies confirmed the binding potential of MPCAB with Bcl-2 than Bcl-xL and Bcl-w proteins. These results strongly suggest that the MPCAB induces apoptosis in A549 and MDA MB-231 cancer cells through mitochondrial intrinsic pathway via activation of caspase-3 and down regulation of Bcl-2 protein."

For extravasation and transendothelial migration metastatic cells interact first with endothelial cells. Yet the role of endothelial cells during the process of metastasis formation and extravasation is still unclear, and the interaction between metastatic and endothelial cells during transendothelial migration is poorly understood. Since tumor cells are well known to express TGF-β, and the compact endothelial layer undergoes a series of changes during metastatic extravasation (cell contact disruption, cytoskeletal reorganization, enhanced contractility), we hypothesized that an EndMT may be necessary for metastatic extravasation. We demonstrate that primary cultured rat brain endothelial cells (BEC) undergo EndMT upon TGF-β1 treatment, characterized by the loss of tight and adherens junction proteins, expression of fibronectin, β1-integrin, calponin and α-smooth muscle actin (SMA). B16/F10 cell line conditioned and activated medium (ACM) had similar effects: claudin-5 down-regulation, fibronectin and SMA expression. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling during B16/F10 ACM stimulation using SB-431542 maintained claudin-5 levels and mitigated fibronectin and SMA expression. B16/F10 ACM stimulation of BECs led to phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. SB-431542 prevented SMA up-regulation upon stimulation of BECs with A2058, MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 ACM as well. Moreover, B16/F10 ACM caused a reduction in transendothelial electrical resistance, enhanced the number of melanoma cells adhering to and transmigrating through the endothelial layer, in a TGF-β-dependent manner. These effects were not confined to BECs: HUVECs showed TGF-β-dependent SMA expression when stimulated with breast cancer cell line ACM. Our results indicate that an EndMT may be necessary for metastatic transendothelial migration, and this transition may be one of the potential mechanisms occurring during the complex phenomenon known as metastatic extravasation."

As it concerns adiponectin, there are not univocal results regarding its role in breast cancer occurrence and progression. Here, we demonstrate that in animals injected with human estrogen receptor (ER)-α-negative MDA-MB-231 cells pretreated with adiponectin (1 and 5 µg/ml), a significant reduction (60 and 40%, respectively) in tumor volume is observed, whereas an increased tumor growth (54 and 109%, respectively) is evidenced in the animals receiving human ER-α-positive MCF-7 cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 (CD1) mRNA and protein levels are decreased in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas they are up-regulated in ER-α-positive cells by adiponectin. These findings fit with the opposite effects of adiponectin on CD1 promoter: 0.44- and 0.34-fold decrease in MDA-MB-231 cells and 0.63- and 0.95-fold increase in MCF-7 cells, treated with 1 and 5 µg/ml, respectively. Functional studies indicate that these effects are mediated by the specific protein 1 motif located in the CD1 promoter. In the absence of ER-α, the adiponectin-mediated down-regulation of CD1 involves the recruitment of corepressors. In the presence of ER-α, the adiponectin-induced expression of CD1 requires the involvement of an activator complex. In conclusion, we propose that a possible mechanism through which adiponectin differently affects breast cancer growth is the opposite modulation of CD1 levels accordingly to ER-α expression."

CDC-like kinases (CLKs) and serine-arginine protein kinases (SRPKs) are components of the splicing machinery that are crucial for exon selection. The discovery of small molecule inhibitors against these kinases is of significant value, not only to delineate the molecular mechanisms of splicing, but also to identify potential therapeutic opportunities. Here we describe a series of small molecules that inhibit CLKs and SRPKs and thereby modulate pre-mRNA splicing. Treatment with these small molecules (Cpd-1, Cpd-2, or Cpd-3) significantly reduced the levels of endogenous phosphorylated SR proteins and caused enlargement of nuclear speckles in MDA-MB-468 cells. Additionally, the compounds resulted in splicing alterations of RPS6KB1 (S6K), and subsequent depletion of S6K protein. Interestingly, the activity of compounds selective for CLKs was well correlated with the activity for modulating S6K splicing as well as growth inhibition of cancer cells. A comprehensive mRNA sequencing approach revealed that the inhibitors induced splicing alterations and protein depletion for multiple genes, including those involved in growth and survival pathways such as S6K, EGFR, EIF3D, and PARP. Fluorescence pulse-chase labeling analyses demonstrated that isoforms with premature termination codons generated after treatment with the CLK inhibitors were degraded much faster than canonical mRNAs. Taken together, these results suggest that CLK inhibitors exhibit growth suppression and apoptosis induction through splicing alterations in genes involved in growth and survival. These small molecule inhibitors may be valuable tools for elucidating the molecular machinery of splicing and for the potential development of a novel class of antitumor agents."

SAFB proteins also have an internal RNA-recognition motif but little is known about the RNA-binding properties of SAFB1 or SAFB2. We utilised crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) coupled with high-throughput sequencing to enable a transcriptome-wide mapping of SAFB1 protein-RNA interactions in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Analysis of crosslinking frequency mapped to transcript regions revealed that SAFB1 binds to coding and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). The highest proportion of SAFB1 crosslink sites mapped to ncRNAs, followed by intergenic regions, open reading frames (ORFs), introns, and 3' or 5' untranslated regions (UTR). Furthermore, we reveal that SAFB1 binds directly to RNA and its binding is particularly enriched at purine-rich sequences not dissimilar to the RNA-binding motifs for SR proteins. Using RNAi, we also show, for the first time, that single depletion of either SAFB1 or SAFB2 leads to an increase in expression of the other SAFB protein in both MCF-7 and MDA-MD231 breast cancer cells."

They recognize the same DNA sequence but fulfil distinct functions: Oct-1 is ubiquitous and regulates a variety of genes while Oct-2 is restricted to B-cells and neurones. Here we examine the interplay and regulatory mechanisms of these factors to control the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, NOS2). Using two breast cancer cell lines as a comparative model, we found that MCF-7 express iNOS upon cytokine stimulation while MDA-MB-231 do not. Oct-1 is present in both cell lines but MDA-MB-231also express high levels of Oct-2. Manipulation of Oct-2 expression in these cell lines demonstrates that it is directly responsible for the repression of iNOS in MDA-MB-231. In MCF-7 cells Oct-1 binds the iNOS promoter, recruits RNA PolII and triggers initiation of transcription. In MDA-MB-231 cells, both Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind the iNOS promoter, forming a higher-order complex which fails to recruit RNA PolII, and as a consequence iNOS transcription does not proceed. Unravelling the mechanisms of transcription factor activity is paramount to the understanding of gene expression patterns that determine cell behaviour."

Expression of LOX is elevated in many human cancers, including breast cancer. LOX expression correlates with the level of tissue hypoxia, and it is known to play a critical role in breast cancer metastasis. The goal of the present study was to target LOX with (1) molecular probe fluorescent labeling to visualize LOX in vitro and (2) a radiolabeled peptide to target LOX in vivo in three different preclinical models of breast cancer.METHODS: Gene expression of all five members of the LOX family was analyzed at the transcript level via microarray analysis using tissue biopsy samples from 176 patients with breast cancer. An oligopeptide sequence (GGGDPKGGGGG) was selected as a substrate-based, LOX-targeting structure. The peptide was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for confocal microscopy experiments with the murine breast cancer cell line EMT-6. In vivo molecular imaging experiments were performed using a C-terminal amidated peptide, GGGDPKGGGGG, labeled with a short-lived positron emitter, fluorine-18 ((18)F), for positron emission tomography (PET) in three different breast cancer models: EMT6, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. The PET experiments were carried out in the presence or absence of β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an irreversible inhibitor of LOX.RESULTS: Immunostaining experiments using a LOX-specific antibody on EMT-6 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions confirmed the elevation of LOX expression in these cells. An FITC-labeled oligopeptide, FITC-Ava-GGGDPKGGGGG-NH2, was found to be localized in different cellular compartments under these conditions. After injection of [(18)F]fluorobenzoate-GGGDPKGGGGG-NH2, radioactivity uptake was visible in all three breast cancer models in vivo. Tumor uptake was reduced by predosing the animals with 2 mg of BAPN 4 h or 24 h before injection of the radiotracer.CONCLUSIONS: The present data support further investigation into the development of LOX-binding radiolabeled peptides as molecular probes for molecular imaging of LOX expression in cancer."

However, studies on the characteristics and functions of Tpxs in Helicoverpa armigera are lacking. In this study, a novel 2-Cys Tpx gene from H. armigera (HaTpx) was identified. Sequence analysis revealed that HaTpx is highly conserved and shares two catalysis regions (VCP) with other insect species. HaTpx mRNA was found to be expressed in an age-dependent manner and was ubiquitous in all tissues examined. Hormone treatment showed that the expression of HaTpx is clearly induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone but repressed by Juvenile hormone. Additionally, extreme temperature, ultraviolet light, mechanical injury, Escherichia coli, Metarhizium anisopliae, nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) infection, and H2O2 treatment markedly induced HaTpx gene expression. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in hemocytes and MDA concentrations in the hemolymph after NPV infection were evaluated, and the results indicated that NPV infection causes excessive ROS generation. After knockdown of HaTpx by RNA interference, the expression of three antioxidant genes (Cu/ZnSOD, Trx, and TrxR) was increased, whereas two antioxidant genes (CAT and GPX) showed decreased expression. Moreover, the susceptibility of H. armigera to NPV infection increased after HaTpx knockdown. These results indicated that HaTpx contributes to the susceptibility of H. armigera to NPV, and the results also provide a theoretical basis for a novel strategy for developing new chemicals and microbial pesticides that target HaTpx gene for controlling H. armigera."

The MIC90 (minimum inhibitory concentration) values of purified protein against A. fumigatus (the major pathogenic species) were found to be comparable with standard drugs i.e. 3.90 µg/mL, 3.90 µg/mL and 1.25 µg/disc via microbroth dilution assay (MDA), percentage spore germination inhibition (PSGI) and disc diffusion assay (DDA) respectively. Toxicity results confirmed that it causes no haemolysis against human RBCs up to a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL as compared to Amphotericin B (conventional antifungal drug) that causes hundred percent haemolysis at a concentration of 37.50 µg/mL. The purified protein demonstrated a molecular mass of 28 kDa on SDS-PAGE which was further authenticated by MALDI-TOF. Proteomic and bioinformatics studies deciphered its significant homology (72 %) with chain A-D-ribose binding protein (cluster 2 sugar binding periplasmic proteins; sequence homologues of transcription regulatory proteins) from E. coli. Single dimensional page analysis of A. fumigatus proteins with due effect of EAF (at MIC50) revealed the inhibition of two major proteins; a heat shock protein 70-Hsp70 (68 kDa); having role in protein folding and functioning andphenylanalyl-t RNA synthetase PodG subunit protein (74 kDa); involved in growth polarity in fungi. Scanning electron microscopic studies depicted homologous results. We suggest that EAF most likely belongs to a new group of proteins with potent antifungal characteristics, negligible toxicity and targeting vital proteins of fungal metabolism."

The mechanisms of neurodegeneration associated with the accumulation of Htt aggregates still remains unclear.OBJECTIVES: To determine oxidative stress biomarkers in HD patients and their relationship with clinical, demographic and neuroimaging parameters.DESIGN AND METHODS: Fourteen patients and 39 controls paired by age and sex participated in this study. Oxidative damage was assayed in blood by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidative protein products (AOPPs). Antioxidant status was determined by activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), reduced glutathione (GSH), protein thiols and total antioxidant capacity (FRAP). The Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and neuroimaging studies were also employed.RESULTS: MDA, AOPP and GPx were significantly increased in HD patients with respect to the control group, while GR activity was decreased. FRAP correlated with age of disease onset, AOPP with motor severity (UHDRS score), age of patients and age of disease onset. Caudate atrophy was associated with lower plasma concentrations of GSH.CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to a redox imbalance in HD patients. GR activity could be a potential biomarker for symptom onset in asymptomatic gene carriers, while plasmatic GSH could be useful in monitoring the progression of neurodegeneration - as an expression of caudate atrophy - during the course of the disease."

Recent studies suggest histone H1 phosphorylation may be useful as a clinical biomarker of breast and other cancers due to its ability to recognize proliferative cell populations. Although monitoring a single phosphorylated H1 residue is adequate to stratify high-grade breast tumors, expanding our knowledge of how H1 is phosphorylated through the cell cycle is paramount to understanding its role in carcinogenesis. H1 analysis by bottom-up MS is challenging due to the presence of highly homologous sequence variants expressed by most cells. These highly basic proteins are difficult to analyze by LC-MS/MS due to the small, hydrophilic nature of peptides produced by tryptic digestion. Although bottom-up methods permit identification of several H1 phosphorylation events, these peptides are not useful for observing the combinatorial PTM patterns on the protein of interest. To complement the information provided by bottom-up MS, we utilized a top-down MS/MS workflow to permit identification and quantitation of H1 proteoforms related to the progression of breast cells through the cell cycle. Histones H1.2 and H1.4 were observed in MDA-MB- 231 metastatic breast cells, whereas an additional histone variant, histone H1.3, was identified only in non-neoplastic MCF-10A cells. Progressive phosphorylation of histone H1.4 was identified in both cell lines at mitosis (M phase). Phosphorylation occurred first at S172 followed successively by S187, T18, T146 and T154. Notably, phosphorylation at S173 of histone H1.2 and S172, S187, T18, T146 and T154 of H1.4 significantly increases during M phase relative to S phase, suggesting that these events are cell cycle-dependent and may serve as markers for proliferation. Finally, we report the observation of the H1.2 SNP variant A18V in MCF-10A cells."

Different patterns of exon usage have been observed when comparing normal tissue to cancers, suggesting that variant transcripts may play a role in the tumor phenotype.METHODS: Ribonucleic acid-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from breast cancer samples was used to identify an intronic start variant transcript of Acyl-CoA oxidase 2, ACOX2 (ACOX2-i9). Difference in expression between Estrogen Receptor (ER) positive and ER negative patients was assessed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the findings validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset (BRCA). ACOX2-i9 expression was also assessed in cell lines using both quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Knock down by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and colony formation assays were used to determine whether ACOX2-i9 expression would influence cellular fitness. The effect of ACOX2-i9 expression on patient survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier survival function, and association to clinical parameters was analyzed using a Fisher exact test.RESULTS: The expression and translation of ACOX2-i9 into a 25 kDa protein was demonstrated in HepG2 cells as well as in several breast cancer cell lines. shRNA knock down of the ACOX2-i9 variant resulted in decreased cell viability of T47D and MDA-MB 436 cells. Moreover, expression of ACOX2-i9 was shown to be estrogen regulated, being induced by propyl pyrazoletriol and inhibited by tamoxifen and fulvestrant in ER+ T47D and Mcf-7 cells, but not in the ER- MDA-MB 436 cell line. This variant transcript showed expression predominantly in ER-positive breast tumors as assessed in our initial set of 53 breast cancers and further validated in 87 tumor/normal pairs from the TCGA breast cancer dataset, and expression was associated with better outcome in ER positive patients.CONCLUSIONS: ACOX2-i9 is specifically enriched in ER+ breast cancers where expression of the variant is associated with improved outcome. These data identify variant ACOX2 as a potential novel therapeutic biomarker in ER+ breast tumors."

Gal-3BP can induce galectin-mediated tumor cell aggregation to increase the survival of cancer cells in the bloodstream during the metastatic process. However, the galectin interacting with Gal-3BP and its binding specificity has not been identified and structurally elucidated, mainly due to the limitation of mass spectrometry in glycan sequencing. To understand the role of Gal-3BP, we here used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with specific exoglycosidase reactions to determine the sequences of N-glycans on Gal-3BP from MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, especially the sequences with terminal sialylation and fucosylation, and addition of LacNAc repeat structures. The N-glycans from both strains are complex type with terminal α2,3-sialidic acid and core fucose linkages, with additional α1,2- and α1,3 fucose linkages found in MCF-7 cells. Compared with that from MCF-7, the Gal-3BP from MDA-MB-231 cells had fewer tetra-antennary structures, only α1,6-linked core fucoses, and more LacNAc repeat structures; the MDA-MB-231 cells had no surface galectin-3 but used surface galectin-1 for interaction with Gal-3BP to form large oligomers and cell aggregates. This study elucidates the specificity of Gal-3BP interacting with galectin-1 and the role of Gal-3BP in cancer cell aggregation and metastasis."

We previously demonstrated that CIB1 is necessary for cancer cell survival and proliferation via regulation of two oncogenic signaling pathways, RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT. Because these pathways are often upregulated in TNBC, we hypothesized that CIB1 may play a broader role in TNBC cell survival and tumor growth. Methods utilized include inducible RNAi depletion of CIB1 in vitro and in vivo, immunoblotting, clonogenic assay, flow cytometry, RNA-sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. CIB1 depletion resulted in significant cell death in 8 of 11 TNBC cell lines tested. Analysis of components related to PI3K-AKT and RAF-MEK-ERK signaling revealed that elevated AKT activation status and low PTEN expression were key predictors of sensitivity to CIB1 depletion. Furthermore, CIB1 knockdown caused dramatic shrinkage of MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors in vivo. RNA sequence analysis also showed that CIB1 depletion in TNBC cells activates gene programs associated with decreased proliferation and increased cell death. CIB1 expression levels per se did not predict TNBC susceptibility to CIB1 depletion, and CIB1 mRNA expression levels did not associate with TNBC patient survival. Our data are consistent with the emerging concept of non-oncogene addiction, where a large subset of TNBCs depend on CIB1 for cell survival and tumor growth, independent of CIB1 expression levels. Our data establish CIB1 as a novel therapeutic target for TNBC."

To date, the amplification bias, amplification uniformity and reproducibility of the three major single cell whole genome amplification methods (GenomePlex WGA4, MDA and MALBAC) have not been systematically investigated using mammalian cells. In this study, we amplified genomic DNA from individual hippocampal neurons using three single-cell DNA amplification methods, and sequenced them at shallow depth. We then systematically evaluated the GC-bias, reproducibility, and copy number variations among individual neurons. Our results showed that single-cell genome sequencing results obtained from the MALBAC and WGA4 methods are highly reproducible and have a high success rate. The MALBAC displays significant biases towards high GC content. We then attempted to correct the GC bias issue by developing a bioinformatics pipeline, which allows us to call CNVs in single cell sequencing data, and chromosome level and sub-chromosomal level CNVs among individual neurons can be detected. We also proposed a metric to determine the CNV detection limits. Overall, MALBAC and WGA4 have better performance than MDA in detecting CNVs."

However, its toxic effects on myocardium are confirmed as major limit of utilization. PPAR-α is highly expressed in the heart, and its activation leads to an increased cardiac fatty acid oxidation and cardiomyocyte necrosis. This study was performed to adjust the hypothesis that PPAR-α receptor inhibition protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction in mice. Male Balb/c mice were used in this study. Left atria were isolated, and their contractility was measured in response to electrical field stimulation in a standard organ bath. PPAR-α activity was measured using specific PPAR-α antibody in an ELISA-based system coated with double-strand DNA containing PPAR-α response element sequence. Moreover, cardiac MDA and TNF-α levels were measured by ELISA method. Following incubation with doxorubicin (35 µM), a significant reduction in atrial contractility was observed (P &lt; 0.001). Pretreatment of animals with a selective PPAR-α antagonist, GW6471, significantly improved doxorubicin-induced atrial dysfunction (P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, pretreatment of the mice with a non-selective cannabinoid agonist, WIN55212-2, significantly decreased PPAR-α activity in cardiac tissue, subsequently leading to significant improvement in doxorubicin-induced atrial dysfunction (P &lt; 0.001). Also, GW6471 and WIN significantly reduced cardiac MDA and TNF-α levels compared with animals receiving doxorubicin (P &lt; 0.001). The study showed that inhibition of PPAR-α is associated with protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in mice, and cannabinoids can potentiate the protection by PPAR-α blockade. Moreover, PPAR-α may be considered as a target to prevent cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin in patients undergoing chemotherapy."

Various reports have suggested that multiple pathways are involved in HIF-1α induction and that the molecular mechanisms regulating HIF-1α-induced chemoresistance are still not fully understood. Here, we report that anterior gradient 2 (AGR2), a proposed breast cancer biomarker, is an essential regulator in hypoxia-induced doxorubicin resistance through the binding and stabilization of HIF-1α. Our results show that knockdown of AGR2 in MCF-7 cells leads to the suppression of HIF-1α-induced doxorubicin resistance, whereas elevated levels of AGR2 in MDA-MB-231 cells enhance HIF-1α-induced doxorubicin resistance. AGR2 expression, in turn, is upregulated by the hypoxic induction of HIF-1α at both translational and transcriptional levels via a hypoxia-responsive region from -937 to -912 bp on the AGR2 promoter sequence. By specific binding to HIF-1α, the increased level of intracellular AGR2 stabilizes HIF-1α and delays its proteasomal degradation. Finally, we found that AGR2-stabilized HIF-1α escalates multiple drug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) mRNA levels and limits doxorubicin intake of MCF-7 cells, whereas MCF-7/ADR, a doxorubicin resistant cell line with deficient AGR2 and HIF-1α, acquires wild-type MDR1 overexpression. Our findings, for the first time, describe AGR2 as an important regulator in chemical hypoxia-induced doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer cells, providing a possible explanation for the variable levels of chemoresistance in breast cancers and further validating AGR2 as a potential anti-breast cancer therapeutic target."

The DESeq package was used to screen the differentially expressed transcripts. A total of 229 genes with a significantly differential expression in MDA-MB-435 cells as compared with MCF-7 cells were obtained. Annotation of the biological functions of these genes through the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7 demonstrated that the 229 differentially expressed genes were mainly implicated in the biological functions related to cell adhesion and motion, antigen processing and presentation (via MHC class II), hormone response, extracellular structure organization, tissue remodeling, and cell proliferation regulation. Analysis of the individual genes demonstrated that MDA-MB-435 cells exhibited a higher tendency to metastasis and antigen processing and presentation, and lower ability to hormone response.

To acquire MT1-MMP specific binding peptides, we first analyzed MMPs sequences to find the divergent and specific sequence of MT1-MMP by bioinformatics approach, then set the specific sequence as the sense peptide target and designed antisense peptide library. Finally, by means of molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and in vitro cell assays, we screened the antisense peptide library against MT1-MMP and further studied the obtained specific peptides. Here, we identified the divergent and specific sequence of AYIREGHE (Named MT1-loop) located in MT1-MMP loop by multiple sequence alignment and established the antisense peptides library with capacity of 1 536 sequences. After two rounds of virtual screening, we obtained five antisense peptides with Rerankscores in the top for further screening. They all interacted with MT1-MMP, and docked well at the active site composed of MT1-loop sequence. Analysis of the affinities of these five antisense peptides to other MMPs (MMP1-3, MMP7-13, MMP14 HPX, MMP16) revealed that the peptide FVTFPYIR was more specific to MT1-MMP. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that the peptide FVTFPYIR might affect the stability of MT1-MMP and thus have effects on its activities. Meanwhile, the peptide FVTFPYIR could specifically inhibit the growth of MG63 and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells both of which expressed MT1-MMP. The work provides a new insight and way for the development of antitumor lead peptides targeting MT1-MMP."

Very early during the DNA damage signalling process, the histone isoform H2AX is phosphorylated to form γH2AX. With the aim of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of DSBs, we synthesized a (89)Zr-labelled anti-γH2AX antibody, modified with the cell-penetrating peptide, TAT, which includes a nuclear localization sequence.METHODS: (89)Zr-anti-γH2AX-TAT was synthesized using EDC/NHS chemistry for TAT peptide linkage. Desferrioxamine conjugation allowed labelling with (89)Zr. Uptake and retention of (89)Zr-anti-γH2AX-TAT was evaluated in the breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB-468 in vitro or as xenografts in athymic mice. External beam irradiation was used to induce DSBs and expression of γH2AX. Since (89)Zr emits ionizing radiation, detailed radiobiological measurements were included to ensure (89)Zr-anti-γH2AX-TAT itself does not cause any additional DSBs.RESULTS: Uptake of (89)Zr-anti-γH2AX-TAT was similar to previous results using (111)In-anti-γH2AX-TAT. Retention of (89)Zr-anti-γH2AX-TAT was eightfold higher at 1 h post irradiation, in cells expressing γH2AX, compared to non-irradiated cells or to non-specific IgG control. PET imaging of mice showed higher uptake of (89)Zr-anti-γH2AX-TAT in irradiated xenografts, compared to non-irradiated or non-specific controls (12.1 ± 1.6 vs 5.2 ± 1.9 and 5.1 ± 0.8 %ID/g, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001). The mean absorbed dose to the nucleus of cells taking up (89)Zr-anti-γH2AX-TAT was twofold lower compared to (111)In-anti-γH2AX-TAT. Additional exposure of neither irradiated nor non-irradiated cells nor tissues to (89)Zr-anti-γH2AX-TAT resulted in any significant changes in the number of observable DNA DSBs, γH2AX foci or clonogenic survival.CONCLUSION: (89)Zr-anti-γH2AX-TAT allows PET imaging of DNA DSBs in a tumour xenograft mouse model."

Overexpression of RhoC-GTPases (RhoC) in breast cancer has been implicated in poor disease prognosis due to increased cancer cells invasion, migration, and motility, which warranted its consideration as a therapeutic target for inhibiting breast cancer metastasis. Using silencing RNA (siRNA) molecules to knockdown RhoC expression is a promising approach to inhibit breast cancer metastases. However, transforming anti-RhoC siRNA molecules into a viable therapy remains a challenge due to the lack of a biocompatible carrier that can selectively deliver the RNA cargo into breast cancer cells. We report the use of a degradable, pH-sensitive, β-cyclodextrin (βCD)-based polymeric carrier that condenses anti-RhoC siRNA forming &quot;smart&quot; particles. These smart anti-RhoC particles were efficiently internalized, successfully escaped the endosome, and delivered the RNA cargo into the cytoplasm of SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Our results show that anti-RhoC particles used at a low N/P ratio of 2.5/1 suppressed RhoC protein levels by 100% and 90% in SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Further, anti-RhoC particles inhibited the invasion, motility, and migration of SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cells by 40-47%, 57-60%, and 61.5-73%, respectively. Smart particles encapsulating the scrambled siRNA sequence did not affect RhoC protein expression or the invasion, motility, and migration of SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cells, which indicate the biocompatibility of the polymeric carrier and selectivity of the observed RhoC knockdown. These results collectively indicate the therapeutic potential of smart anti-RhoC particles in arresting the metastatic spread of breast cancer cells."

This DNA sequence translates to a polyglutamine repeat in the protein product, leading to mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein aggregation. The aggregation of mHTT is inhibited in vitro and in vivo by the TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC) chaperonin. Recently, a novel complex comprised of a single type of TRiC subunit has been reported to inhibit mHTT aggregation. Specifically, the purified CCT5 homo-oligomer complex, when compared with TRiC, has a similar structure, ATP use, and substrate refolding activity, and, importantly, it also inhibits mHTT aggregation. Using an aggregation suppression assay and cryoelectron tomography coupled with a novel computational classification method, we uncover the interactions between the synthetic CCT5 complex (∼1 MDa) and aggregates of mutant huntingtin exon 1 containing 46 glutamines (mHTTQ46-Ex1). We find that, in a similar fashion to TRiC, synthetic CCT5 complex caps mHTT fibrils at their tips and encapsulates mHTT oligomers, providing a structural description of the inhibition of mHTTQ46-Ex1 by CCT5 complex and a shared mechanism of mHTT inhibition between TRiC chaperonin and the CCT5 complex: cap and contain."

Cancer cells rarely undergo a full conversion to the mesenchymal phenotype, and instead adopt positions along the epithelial-mesenchymal axis, a propensity we refer to as epithelial mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). EMP is associated with increased risk of metastasis in breast cancer and consequent poor prognosis. Drivers towards the mesenchymal state in malignant cells include growth factor stimulation or exposure to hypoxic conditions.METHODS: We have examined EMP in two cell line models of breast cancer: the PMC42 system (PMC42-ET and PMC42-LA sublines) and MDA-MB-468 cells. Transition to a mesenchymal phenotype was induced across all three cell lines using epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, and in MDA-MB-468 cells by hypoxia. We used RNA sequencing to identify gene expression changes that occur as cells transition to a more-mesenchymal phenotype, and identified the cell signalling pathways regulated across these experimental systems. We then used inhibitors to modulate signalling through these pathways, verifying the conclusions of our transcriptomic analysis.RESULTS: We found that EGF and hypoxia both drive MDA-MB-468 cells to phenotypically similar mesenchymal states. Comparing the transcriptional response to EGF and hypoxia, we have identified differences in the cellular signalling pathways that mediate, and are influenced by, EMT. Significant differences were observed for a number of important cellular signalling components previously implicated in EMT, such as HBEGF and VEGFA. We have shown that EGF- and hypoxia-induced transitions respond differently to treatment with chemical inhibitors (presented individually and in combinations) in these breast cancer cells. Unexpectedly, MDA-MB-468 cells grown under hypoxic growth conditions became even more mesenchymal following exposure to certain kinase inhibitors that prevent growth-factor induced EMT, including the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the AKT1/2/3 inhibitor AZD5363.CONCLUSIONS: While resulting in a common phenotype, EGF and hypoxia induced subtly different signalling systems in breast cancer cells. Our findings have important implications for the use of kinase inhibitor-based therapeutic interventions in breast cancers, where these heterogeneous signalling landscapes will influence the therapeutic response."

Two out of six stable cancer cell lines did not exhibit any senescence-associated-β-Galactosidase-positive cells. Interestingly, four cell lines had small sub-populations of senescent cells (single SA-β-Gal-positive cells).CONCLUSION: Primary neoplastic cells from different types of cancer (prostate, breast, colon cancer) appear to be senescent in vitro.

However, the performance of the current state of the art WGA methods has not been evaluated for sequencing. Using low template DNA (15 pg) and single cells, we showed that the two PCR-based WGA systems SurePlex and MALBAC are superior to the REPLI-g WGA multiple displacement amplification (MDA) system in terms of consistent and reproducible genome coverage and sequence bias across the 24 chromosomes, allowing better normalization of test to reference sequencing data. When copy number variation sequencing (CNV-Seq) was applied to single cell WGA products derived by either SurePlex or MALBAC amplification, we showed that known disease CNVs in the range of 3-15 Mb could be reliably and accurately detected at the correct genomic positions.

Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), composing of α1 and β1 subunit, is the receptor for NO. Using radioimmunoassay, we discovered that activation of sGC by treatment with bradykinin or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is impaired in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as compared to normal breast epithelial 184A1 cells. The 184A1 cells expressed both sGC α1 and sGCβ1 mRNAs. However, levels of sGCβ1 mRNAs were relatively lower in MCF-7 cells while both mRNA of sGC subunits were absent in MDA-MB-231 cells. Treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) increased mRNA levels of both sGCα1 and sGCβ1 in MDA-MB-231 cells but only sGCβ1 mRNAs in MCF-7 cells. The 5-aza-dC treatment increased the SNP-induced cGMP production in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, but not in 184A1 cells. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that the promoter of sGCα1 in MDA-MB-231 cells and promoter of sGCβ1 in MCF-7 cells were methylated. Promoter hypermethylation of sGCα1 and sGCβ1 was found in 1 out of 10 breast cancer patients. Over-expression of both sGC subunits in MDA-MB-231 cells induced apoptosis and growth inhibition in vitro as well as reduced tumor incidence and tumor growth rate of MDA-MB-231 xenografts in nude mice. Elevation of sGC reduced protein abundance of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Cdc2, Cdc25A, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, Cdk6, c-Myc, and Skp2 while increased protein expression of p53.

Analysis of single-cell DNA libraries generated by different technologies revealed universal features of the genome coverage bias predominantly generated at the amplicon level (1-10 kb). The magnitude of coverage bias can be accurately calibrated from low-pass sequencing (∼0.1 × ) to predict the depth-of-coverage yield of single-cell DNA libraries sequenced at arbitrary depths. We further provide a benchmark comparison of single-cell libraries generated by multi-strand displacement amplification (MDA) and multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC).

For extravasation and transendothelial migration metastatic cells interact first with endothelial cells. Yet the role of endothelial cells during the process of metastasis formation and extravasation is still unclear, and the interaction between metastatic and endothelial cells during transendothelial migration is poorly understood. Since tumor cells are well known to express TGF-β, and the compact endothelial layer undergoes a series of changes during metastatic extravasation (cell contact disruption, cytoskeletal reorganization, enhanced contractility), we hypothesized that an EndMT may be necessary for metastatic extravasation. We demonstrate that primary cultured rat brain endothelial cells (BEC) undergo EndMT upon TGF-β1 treatment, characterized by the loss of tight and adherens junction proteins, expression of fibronectin, β1-integrin, calponin and α-smooth muscle actin (SMA). B16/F10 cell line conditioned and activated medium (ACM) had similar effects: claudin-5 down-regulation, fibronectin and SMA expression. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling during B16/F10 ACM stimulation using SB-431542 maintained claudin-5 levels and mitigated fibronectin and SMA expression. B16/F10 ACM stimulation of BECs led to phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. SB-431542 prevented SMA up-regulation upon stimulation of BECs with A2058, MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 ACM as well. Moreover, B16/F10 ACM caused a reduction in transendothelial electrical resistance, enhanced the number of melanoma cells adhering to and transmigrating through the endothelial layer, in a TGF-β-dependent manner. These effects were not confined to BECs: HUVECs showed TGF-β-dependent SMA expression when stimulated with breast cancer cell line ACM. Our results indicate that an EndMT may be necessary for metastatic transendothelial migration, and this transition may be one of the potential mechanisms occurring during the complex phenomenon known as metastatic extravasation."

To delineate the architecture and functional interactions of the MBD2-NuRD complex, we previously solved the structures of MBD2 bound to methylated DNA and a coiled-coil interaction between MBD2 and p66α that recruits the CHD4 nucleosome remodeling protein to the complex. The work presented here identifies novel structural and functional features of a previously uncharacterized domain of MBD2 (MBD2IDR). Biophysical analyses show that the MBD2IDR is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). However, despite this inherent disorder, MBD2IDR increases the overall binding affinity of MBD2 for methylated DNA. MBD2IDR also recruits the histone deacetylase core components (RbAp48, HDAC2 and MTA2) of NuRD through a critical contact region requiring two contiguous amino acid residues, Arg(286) and Leu(287). Mutating these residues abrogates interaction of MBD2 with the histone deacetylase core and impairs the ability of MBD2 to repress the methylated tumor suppressor gene PRSS8 in MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. These findings expand our knowledge of the multi-dimensional interactions of the MBD2-NuRD complex that govern its function."

Our fractionation data highlight the underappreciated biology that missense mtp53 proteins R273H, R280K, and L194F are tightly associated with chromatin. Using SILAC coupled to tandem MS, we identified that R273H mtp53 expression in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells up- and down-regulated multiple proteins and metabolic pathways. Here we provide the data set obtained from sequencing 73,154 peptide pairs that then corresponded to 3,010 proteins detected under reciprocal labeling conditions. Importantly, the high impact regulated targets included the previously identified transcriptionally regulated mevalonate pathway proteins but also identified two new levels of mtp53 protein regulation for nontranscriptional targets. Interestingly, mtp53 depletion profoundly influenced poly(ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) localization, with increased cytoplasmic and decreased chromatin-associated protein. An enzymatic PARP shift occurred with high mtp53 expression, resulting in increased poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins in the nucleus. Mtp53 increased the level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and minichromosome maintenance 4 (MCM4) proteins without changing the amount of pcna and mcm4 transcripts. Pathway enrichment analysis ranked the DNA replication pathway above the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as a R273H mtp53 activated proteomic target.

This paper offers a method for embedding cells in alginate microspheres and performing multiple serial operations on the isolated cells. Rhodobacter sphaeroides cells were diluted in alginate polymer and sprayed into microdroplets using a fingertip aerosol sprayer. The encapsulated cells were lysed and subjected either to conventional PCR, or whole genome amplification using either multiple displacement amplification (MDA) or a two-step PCR protocol. Microscopic examination after PCR showed that the lumen of the occupied microspheres contained fluorescently stained DNA product, but multiple displacement amplification with phi29 produced only a small number of polymerase colonies. The 2-step WGA protocol was successful in generating fluorescent material, and quantitative PCR from DNA extracted from aliquots of microspheres suggested that the copy number inside the microspheres was amplified up to 3 orders of magnitude. Microspheres containing fluorescent material were sorted by a dilution series and screened with a fluorescent plate reader to identify single microspheres. The DNA was extracted from individual isolates, re-amplified with full-length sequencing adapters, and then a single isolate was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. After filtering the reads, the only sequences that collectively matched a genome in the NCBI nucleotide database belonged to R. sphaeroides. This demonstrated that sequencing-ready DNA could be generated from the contents of a single microsphere without culturing. However, the 2-step WGA strategy showed limitations in terms of low genome coverage and an uneven frequency distribution of reads across the genome.

Dysregulation of miRNAs has been associated with initiation and progression of oncogenesis in humans. The abnormal expression of CDC25B phosphatases detected in a number of tumors implies that their dysregulation is involved in malignant transformation. Using miRNA target prediction software, we found that miR-211 could target the 3'UTR sequence of CDC25B. To shed light on their roles of miR-211 in breast cancer, the expression of miR-211 was examined by real-time RT-PCR in breast cancer and normal tissues. MiR-211 is significantly downregulated in breast cancer. MiR-211 re-expression suppressed cell growth, cell cycle, migration, and invasion in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB231. Luciferase expression from a reporter vector containing the CDC25B -3'UTR was decreased when this construct was transfected with miR-211. The over-expression of miR-211 suppressed the endogenous CDC25B protein level in TNBC cells. For the first time, we demonstrate that miRNA-211 is a direct negative regulator of CDC25B expression in TNBC cells, alters other related target proteins CCNB1 and FOXM1, and then inhibits breast cancer cells growth, migration, and invasion and lead G2/M arrest.

We demonstrated that ORF2 is required for Cry65Aa1 expression and crystallization by function as a C-terminal crystallization domain. The orf2 sequence is also required for Cry65Aa expression, because orf2 transcripts have a stabilizing effect on cry65Aa1 transcripts.

To date, few studies have rigorously examined sequence bias that might result from WGA and next-generation sequencing of nonmodel taxa. To address this knowledge deficit, we use multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and double-digest RAD sequencing on the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) to quantify bias in genome coverage and SNP calls when compared to raw genomic DNA (gDNA). We focus our efforts in providing baseline estimates of potential bias by following manufacturer's recommendations for starting DNA quantities (&gt;100 ng). Our results are strongly suggestive that MDA enrichment does not introduce systematic bias to genome characterization. SNP calling between samples when genotyping both de-novo and with a reference genome are highly congruent (&gt;98%) when specifying a minimum threshold of 20X stack depth to call genotypes. Relative genome coverage is also similar between MDA and gDNA, and allelic dropout is not observed. SNP concordance varies based on coverage threshold, with 95% concordance reached at ~12X coverage genotyping de-novo and ~7X coverage genotyping with the reference genome.

Antibodies to Drosophila kettin cross-reacted to bands at ∼500 and ∼700 kDa, but also to bands at ∼1.6 and ∼2.1 MDa, that had not been previously observed in insect flight muscles. Mass spectrometry identified the 2.1 MDa protein as a product of the Sallimus (sls) gene. Analysis of the gene sequence showed that all 4 putative Sallimus and kettin isoforms could be explained as products of alternative splicing of the single sls gene. Both projectin and sallimus isoforms were expressed to higher levels in ventrally located DLM1 subunits, primarily responsible for active work production, as compared to dorsally located subunits, which may act as damped springs. The different expression levels of the 2 projectin isoforms and 4 sallimus/kettin isoforms may be adaptations to the specific requirements of individual muscle subunits."

The sensing system is simply composed of two probes with CP attached to the surface of gold electrode and methylene blue (MB)-labeled SP free in the detecting solution. Two duplexes are formed with the target DNA, an E. coli lac Z gene sequence, hybridizing with two ends of CP and SP separately. This structure can position the MB labels near to the electrode surface, thereby resulting in the change of detecting current. The proposed sensor exhibits a high sensitivity with a detection limit of ∼30 fM for target DNA and good mismatch discrimination ability (MDA). This method can also be applied to the construction of other sensors for the analysis of similar designated pathogenic bacteria gene sequence (PBGS)."

The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI), representing the number of codons effective for human expression, was much improved (0.79 for hNIS, 0.97 for opt-hNIS). Both wild-type (hNIS) and optimized human NIS (opt-hNIS) were cloned into pcDNA3.1 and pMSCV vectors for transfection. Various cancer cell lines such as thyroid (TPC-1, FRO, B-CPAP), breast (MDA-MB-231), liver (Hep3B), cervical (HeLa), and glioma (U87MG) were transfected with pcDNA3.1/hNIS or pcDNA3.1/opt-hNIS. 125I uptake by opt-hNIS-expressing cells was 1.6~2.1 times higher than uptake by wild-type hNIS-expressing cells. Stable cell lines were also established by retroviral transduction using pMSCV/hNIS or pMSCV/opt-hNIS, revealing higher NIS protein levels and 125I uptake in opt-hNIS-expressing cells than in hNIS-expressing cells. Moreover, scintigraphic images from cell plates and mouse xenografts showed stronger signals from opt-hNIS-expressing cells than hNIS-expressing cells, and radioactivity uptake by opt-hNIS-expressing tumors was 2.3-fold greater than that by hNIS-expressing tumors. To test the efficacy of radioiodine therapy, mouse xenograft models were established with cancer cells expressing hNIS or opt-hNIS. 131I treatment reduced tumor sizes of hNIS- and opt-hNIS-expressing tumors to 0.57- and 0.27- fold, respectively, compared to their sizes before therapy, suggesting an improved therapeutic effect of opt-hNIS. In summary, this study shows that codon optimization strongly increases hNIS protein levels and radioiodine uptake, thus supporting opt-hNIS as a more sensitive reporter and efficient therapeutic gene."

The aim of the present study is to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that correlate with TNBC chemoresistance.METHODS: In this study, we conducted miRNAs profile comparison between triple-negative breast cancer (TNBCs) and normal breast tissues by microRNA array. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was utilized to confirm the specific deregulated miRNAs change trend. We used starBase 2.1 and GOrilla to predict the potential targets of the specific miRNAs. Cells viability and apoptosis assays were employed to determine the effect of alteration of the specific miRNAs in TNBC cells on the chemosensitivity.RESULTS: We identified 11 specific deregulated miRNAs, including 5 up-regulated miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-21-3p, miR-181a-5p, miR-181b-5p, and miR-183-5p) and 6 down-regulated miRNAs (miR-10b-5p, miR-451a, miR-125b-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-195-5p and miR-130a-3p). Thereafter, this result was confirmed by qRT-PCR. We predicted the potential targets of the candidate miRNAs and found that they are involved in cancer-associated pathways. For the first time, we found that miR-130a-3p and miR-451a were down-regulated in TNBC. 9 of the 11 specific deregulated miRNAs were found to be associated with chemoresistance. In vitro assays, we found that up-regulation of either miR-130a-3p or miR-451a in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly changed the cells sensitivity to doxorubicin. The results suggest that TNBC chemotherapy might be affected by a cluster of miRNAs.CONCLUSION: The abnormal expression miRNAs in TNBC are mainly chemoresistance related. This might be part of reason that TNBC likely to evade from chemotherapy resulting in early relapse and high risk of death. To alter their expression status might be a potential therapeutic strategy to improve the outcome of chemotherapy for TNBC patients."

Recent reports describing localization of NuRD provide new insights that question previous models on NuRD action, but are not in complete agreement. Here, we provide location analysis of endogenous MBD3, a component of NuRD complex, in two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) using two independent genomic techniques: DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) and ChIP-seq. We observed concordance of the resulting genomic localization, suggesting that these studies are converging on a robust map for NuRD in the cancer cell genome. MBD3 preferentially associated with CpG rich promoters marked by H3K4me3 and showed cell-type specific localization across gene bodies, peaking around the transcription start site. A subset of sites bound by MBD3 was enriched in H3K27ac and was in physical proximity to promoters in three-dimensional space, suggesting function as enhancers. MBD3 enrichment was also noted at promoters modified by H3K27me3. Functional analysis of chromatin indicated that MBD3 regulates nucleosome occupancy near promoters and in gene bodies. These data suggest that MBD3, and by extension the NuRD complex, may have multiple roles in fine tuning expression for both active and silent genes, representing an important step in defining regulatory mechanisms by which NuRD complex controls chromatin structure and modification status."

Underlying these investigations is the assumption that metagenome sequence data accurately estimates the census of microbial populations. Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) of microbial community DNA is often used in cases where it is difficult to obtain enough DNA for sequencing; however, MDA can result in amplification biases that may impact subsequent estimates of population census from metagenome data. Some have posited that pooling replicate MDA reactions negates these biases and restores the accuracy of population analyses. This assumption has not been empirically tested.RESULTS: Using mock viral communities, we examined the influence of pooling on population-scale analyses. In pooled and single reaction MDA treatments, sequence coverage of viral populations was highly variable and coverage patterns across viral genomes were nearly identical, indicating that initial priming biases were reproducible and that pooling did not alleviate biases. In contrast, control unamplified sequence libraries showed relatively even coverage across phage genomes.CONCLUSIONS: MDA should be avoided for metagenomic investigations that require quantitative estimates of microbial taxa and gene functional groups. While MDA is an indispensable technique in applications such as single-cell genomics, amplification biases cannot be overcome by combining replicate MDA reactions. Alternative library preparation techniques should be utilized for quantitative microbial ecology studies utilizing metagenomic sequencing approaches."

Patients positive for these biomarkers are eligible for specific therapies such as endocrine treatment in the event of ER and PgR positivity, and the monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, in the case of HER2-positive patients. Patients who are negative for these three biomarkers, the so-called triple negatives, however, derive little benefit from such therapies and are associated with a worse prognosis. Deregulation of the protein serine/threonine phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) and its regulatory subunits is a common event in breast cancer, providing a possible target for therapy.METHODS: The data portal, cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics was used to investigate the incidence of conditions that are associated with low phosphatase activity. Four (4) adherent human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T and BT-20 were cultured to assess their viability when exposed to various dosages of rapamycin or FTY720. In addition, RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesised to amplify the coding sequence of PPP2CA. Amplification was followed by high-resolution melting to identify variations.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The sequence of PPP2CA was found to be conserved across a diverse panel of solid tumour and haematological cell lines, suggesting that low expression of PPP2CA and differential binding of inhibitory PPP2CA regulators are the main mechanisms of PP2A deregulation. Interestingly, the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics shows that PP2A is deregulated in 59.6% of basal breast tumours. Viability assays performed to determine the sensitivity of a panel of breast cancer cell lines to FTY720, a PP2A activator, indicated that cell lines associated with ER loss are sensitive to lower doses of FTY720. The subset of patients with suppressed PP2A activity is potentially eligible for treatment using therapies which target the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, such as phosphatase activators."

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that NMDA receptor subunit gene expression is altered in cortex and hippocampus of OKA induced memory impairment. Therefore in the present study, we checked the effect of OKA (ICV) on NMDA receptor regulation and synapse function. The memory function anomalies and synaptosomal calcium ion (Ca(2+)) level were increased in OKA treated rats brain; which was further protected by MK801 (0.05mg/kg. i.p) treatment daily for 13days. To elucidate the involvement of NMDA receptor, we estimated NR1, NR2A and NR2B (subunits) expression in rat brain. Results showed that expression of NR1 and NR2B were significantly increased, but expression of NR2A had no significant change in OKA treated rat brain. We also observed decrease in synapsin-1 mRNA and protein expression which indicates synapse dysfunction. In addition, we detected an increase in MDA and nitrite levels and a decrease in GSH level in synapse preparation which indicates synapse altered redox stress. Moreover, neuronal loss was also confirmed by nissl staining in periventricular cortex and hippocampus. Altered level of oxidative stress markers along with neuronal loss confirmed neurotoxicity. Further, MK801 treatment restored the level of NR1, NR2B and synapsin-1 expression, and protected from neuronal loss and synapse redox stress. In conclusion, Okadaic acid (OKA) induced expression of NR1 and NR2B deteriorates synapse function in rat brain which was confirmed by the neuroprotective effect of MK801."

We examined the extent to which the actual community structure is reliably revealed and factors contributing to bias. One widely used [multiple displacement amplification (MDA)] and one new primer-free method [primase-based whole genome amplification (pWGA)] were compared using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method as control. Pyrosequencing of an environmental sample and principal component analysis revealed that MDA impacted community profiles more strongly than pWGA and indicated that this related to species GC content, although an influence of DNA integrity could not be excluded. Subsequently, biases by species GC content, DNA integrity and fragment size were separately analysed using defined mixtures of DNA from various species. We found significantly less amplification of species with the highest GC content for MDA-based templates and, to a lesser extent, for pWGA. DNA fragmentation also interfered severely: species with more fragmented DNA were less amplified with MDA and pWGA. pWGA was unable to amplify low molecular weight DNA (&lt; 1.5 kb), whereas MDA was inefficient. We conclude that pWGA is the most promising method for characterization of microbial communities in low-biomass environments and for currently planned astrobiological missions to Mars."

The ikaite columns of SW Greenland are permanently cold (4-6°C) and alkaline (above pH 10), and the microorganisms living there and their enzymes are adapted to these conditions. Since only a small fraction of the total microbial diversity can be cultured in the laboratory, a combined approach involving functional screening of a strain collection and a metagenomic library was undertaken for discovery of novel enzymes from the ikaite columns.RESULTS: A strain collection with 322 cultured isolates was screened for enzymatic activities identifying a large number of enzyme producers, with a high re-discovery rate to previously characterized strains. A functional expression library established in Escherichia coli identified a number of novel cold-active enzymes. Both α-amylases and β-galactosidases were characterized in more detail with respect to temperature and pH profiles and one of the β-galactosidases, BGalI17E2, was able to hydrolyze lactose at 5°C. A metagenome sequence of the expression library indicated that the majority of enzymatic activities were not detected by functional expression. Phylogenetic analysis showed that different bacterial communities were targeted with the culture dependent and independent approaches and revealed the bias of multiple displacement amplification (MDA) of DNA isolated from complex microbial communities.CONCLUSIONS: Many cold- and/or alkaline-active enzymes of industrial relevance were identified in the culture based approach and the majority of the enzyme-producing isolates were closely related to previously characterized strains. The function-based metagenomic approach, on the other hand, identified several enzymes (β-galactosidases, α-amylases and a phosphatase) with low homology to known sequences that were easily expressed in the production host E. coli. The β-galactosidase BGalI17E2 was able to hydrolyze lactose at low temperature, suggesting a possibly use in the dairy industry for this enzyme. The two different approaches complemented each other by targeting different microbial communities, highlighting the usefulness of combining methods for bioprospecting. Finally, we document here that ikaite columns constitute an important source of cold- and/or alkaline-active enzymes with industrial application potential."

The present studies demonstrate that silencing expression of the MUC1-C oncoprotein inhibits growth of luminal MCF-7 and HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 breast cancer cells as mammospheres. We also show that triple-negative MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells are dependent on MUC1-C for growth as mammospheres and tumor xenografts. Similar results were obtained when MUC1-C function was inhibited by expression of a MUC1-C(CQCAQA) mutant. Moreover, treatment with the MUC1-C inhibitor GO-203, a cell penetrating peptide that binds to the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain and blocks MUC1-C function, confirmed the importance of this target for self-renewal. The mechanistic basis for these findings is supported by the demonstration that MUC1-C activates NF-κB, occupies the IL-8 promoter with NF-κB, and induces IL-8 transcription. MUC1-C also induces NF-κB-dependent expression of the IL-8 receptor, CXCR1. In concert with these results, targeting MUC1-C with GO-203 suppresses IL-8/CXCR1 expression and disrupts the formation of established mammospheres. Our findings indicate that MUC1-C contributes to the self-renewal of breast cancer cells by activating the NF-κBIL-8/CXCR1 pathway and that targeting MUC1-C represents a potential approach for the treatment of this population."

However, the effect of thioridazine on tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) sensitization has not yet been studied. Here, we investigated the ability of thioridazine to sensitize TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Combined treatment with thioridazine and TRAIL markedly induced apoptosis in various human carcinoma cells, including renal carcinoma (Caki, ACHN, and A498), breast carcinoma (MDA-MB231), and glioma (U251MG) cells, but not in normal mouse kidney cells (TMCK-1) and human normal mesangial cells. We found that thioridazine downregulated c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 expression at the post-translational level via an increase in proteasome activity. The overexpression of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 overcame thioridazine plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We further observed that thioridazine inhibited the Akt signaling pathway. In contrast, although other phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin) sensitized TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 expressions were not altered. Furthermore, thioridazine increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Caki cells, and ROS scavengers (N-acetylcysteine, glutathione ethyl ester, and trolox) inhibited thioridazine plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis, as well as Akt inhibition and the downregulation of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1.

We observed the overexpression of adiponectin gene with different titers on atherosclerosis (AS) models of high-fat apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We divided 48 male ApoE-/- mice into 4 groups: control group, high-fat diet group, low adiponectin group, and high adiponectin group. The low and high adiponectin group mice were treated with recombinant adenovirus expressing mice adiponectin (Ad-APN) with low-dose adiponectin 1.0×108 p.f.u. and high-dose adiponectin 5.0×108 p.f.u. via the tail every 2 weeks and given a high-fat diet for the last 8 weeks. On the 14th day after injection, blood samples were obtained from the vena cava.RESULTS: Along with increased serum adiponectin, serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased (P&lt;0.05) and concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was decreased (P&lt;0.05). Levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were decreased, especially TC and LDL-C (P&lt;0.05). A real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction test was used to analyze levels of mRNA expression for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and adiponectin in the aorta. Along with increased adiponectin, the mRNA expression of eNOS in the aorta was increased significantly (P&lt;0.05). The lesion formation in the aortic sinus was inhibited by 25% and 31% in the low-APN group and high-APN group, respectively (P&lt;0.05). Along with the increase of adiponectin doses, the damage of atherosclerosis gradually eased. However, the differences between the low-APN group and high-APN group had no statistical significance.CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin may protect the aorta from atherosclerosis injury by reducing oxidative stress, reducing lesion formation size in the aortic root and reducing TC, TG, and LDL-C in serum. The molecular mechanism may involve preservation of SOD, reducing MDA in serum, and increasing eNOS and adiponectin mRNA expression in the aorta."

In the present study, we demonstrated that NDRG2 overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells down-regulated the expression of Snail, a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin and a key regulator of EMT, as well as the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), an oncogenic transcription factor that is activated in many human malignancies including breast cancer. In addition, we confirmed that the expression of Snail and phospho-STAT3 was recovered when NDRG2 was knocked down by siRNA in MCF7 cells in which NDRG2 is endogenously expressed. Interestingly, MDA-MB-231-NDRG2 cells showed remarkably decreased Snail expression after treatment with JSI-124 (also known as cucurbitacin I) or Stattic, STAT3 inhibitors, compared to MDA-MB-231-mock cells. Moreover, STAT3 activation by EGF treatment induced higher Snail expression, and NDRG2 overexpression resulted in the inhibition of Snail expression in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated by EGF in the absence or presence of STAT3 inhibitor. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with STAT3 inhibitor led to a moderate decrease in wound healing and migration capacity, whereas STAT3 inhibitor treatment of MDA-MB-231-NDRG2 cells resulted in a significant attenuation of migration in both resting and EGF-stimulated cells.

However, both methods employ multiple displacement amplification (MDA) to ensure suitable quantities of plasmid DNA for high-throughput sequencing. This study demonstrates that MDA greatly favors smaller circular DNA elements (&lt;10 Kbp), which, in turn, leads to stark underrepresentation of upper size range plasmids (&gt;10 Kbp). Throughout the study, we used two model plasmids, a 4.4 Kbp cloning vector (pBR322), and a 56 Kbp conjugative plasmid (pKJK10), to represent lower- and upper plasmid size ranges, respectively. Subjecting a mixture of these plasmids to the overall isolation protocol revealed a 34-fold over-amplification of pBR322 after MDA. To address this bias, we propose the addition of an electroelution step that separates different plasmid size ranges prior to MDA in order to reduce size-dependent competition during incubation. Subsequent analyses of metamobilome data from wastewater spiked with the model plasmids showed in silica recovery of pKJK10 to be very poor with the established method and a 1,300-fold overrepresentation of pBR322. Conversely, complete recovery of pKJK10 was enabled with the new modified protocol although considerable care must be taken during electroelution to minimize cross-contamination between samples. For further validation, non-spiked wastewater metamobilomes were mapped to more than 2,500 known plasmid genomes. This displayed an overall recovery of plasmids well into the upper size range (median size: 30 kilobases) with the modified protocol. Analysis of de novo assembled metamobilome data also suggested distinctly better recovery of larger plasmids, as gene functions associated with these plasmids, such as conjugation, was exclusively encoded in the data output generated through the modified protocol. Thus, with the suggested modification, access to a large uncharacterized pool of accessory elements that reside on medium-to-large plasmids has been improved."

Vigorous growth of transgenic tobacco was observed at the early development stages, resulting in plant height and fresh weight were significantly larger than those of the non-transgenic tobacco under Cd2+ stress. These results demonstrated that the expression of the exogenous TaMT3 gene increased the ability of ROS cleaning-up, indicating a stronger tolerance to Cd2+ stress."

Here, a drought-induced HD-Zip I gene, Zmhdz10, was isolated from maize and characterized for its role in stress responses. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that expression of Zmhdz10 was also induced by salt stress and ABA. Transient expression of Zmhdz10-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in onion cells showed a nuclear localization of Zmhdz10. Yeast hybrid assays demonstrated that Zmhdz10 has transactivation and DNA-binding activity in yeast cells. Overexpression of Zmhdz10 in rice led to enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses and increased sensitivity to ABA. Moreover, Zmhdz10 transgenic plants had lower relative electrolyte leakage (REL), lower malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased proline content relative to wild-type plants under stress conditions, which may contribute to enhanced stress tolerance. Zmhdz10 transgenic Arabidopsis plants also exhibited enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses that was concomitant with altered expression of stress/ABA-responsive genes, including Δ1-Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase 1 (P5CS1), Responsive to dehydration 22 (RD22), Responsive to dehydration 29B (RD29B) and ABA-insensitive 1 (ABI1). Taken together, these results suggest that Zmhdz10 functions as a transcriptional regulator that can positively regulate drought and salt tolerance in plants through an ABA-dependent signaling pathway."

Here we report that the expression of a WRKY transcription factor WRKY46 is rapidly induced by drought, salt and oxidative stresses. T-DNA insertion of WRKY46 leads to more sensitivity to drought and salt stress, whereas overexpression of WRKY46 (OV46) results in hypersensitivity in soil-grown plants, with a higher water loss rate, but with increased tolerance on the sealed agar plates. Stomatal closing in the OV46 line is insensitive to ABA because of a reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the guard cells. We further find that WRKY46 is expressed in guard cells, where its expression is not affected by dehydration, and is involved in light-dependent stomatal opening. Microarray analysis reveals that WRKY46 regulates a set of genes involved in cellular osmoprotection and redox homeostasis under dehydration stress, which is confirmed by ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in stressed seedlings. Moreover, WRKY46 modulates light-dependent starch metabolism in guard cells via regulating QUA-QUINE STARCH (QQS) gene expression. Taken together, we demonstrate that WRKY46 plays dual roles in regulating plant responses to drought and salt stress and light-dependent stomatal opening in guard cells."

Previous work used a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2 and 9)-cleavable sequence in the ACPP to target contrast agents for tumor imaging and fluorescence-guided surgery. To improve specificity and sensitivity for MMP-2, an integrin α(v)β(3)-binding domain, cyclic-RGD, was covalently linked to the ACPP. This co-targeting strategy relies on the interaction of MMP-2 with integrin α(v)β(3), which are known to associate via the hemopexin domain of MMP-2. In U87MG glioblastoma cells in culture, dual targeting greatly improved ACPP uptake compared with either MMP or integrin α(v)β(3) targeting alone. In vivo, dual-targeted ACPP treatment resulted in tumor contrast of 7.8 ± 1.6, a 10-fold higher tumor fluorescence compared with the negative control peptide, and increased probe penetration into the core of MDA-MB-231 tumors. This platform also significantly improved efficacy of the chemotherapeutic monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) in both MDA-MB-231 orthotopic human and syngeneic Py230 murine breast tumors. Treatment with cyclic-RGD-PLGC(Me)AG-MMAE-ACPP resulted in complete tumor regression in one quarter of MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice, compared with no survival in the control groups. This rational mechanism for amplified delivery of imaging and potent chemotherapeutic agents avoids the use of antibodies and may be of considerable generality."

The megasynthase is a 2-MDa trimeric complex composed of three unique homodimers assembled from the gene products DEBS1, DEBS2, and DEBS3, which are housed within the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Each homodimer contains two clusters of catalytically independent enzymatic domains, each referred to as a module, which catalyzes one round of polyketide chain extension and modification. Modules are named sequentially to indicate the order in which they are utilized during synthesis of 6-deoxyerythronolide B. We report small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses of a whole module and a bimodule from DEBS, as well as a set of domains for which high-resolution structures are available. In all cases, the solution state was probed under previously established conditions ensuring that each protein is catalytically active. SAXS data are consistent with atomic-resolution structures of DEBS fragments. Therefore, we used the available high-resolution structures of DEBS domains to model the architectures of the larger protein assemblies using rigid-body refinement. Our data support a model in which the third module of DEBS forms a disc-shaped structure capable of caging the acyl carrier protein domain proximal to each active site. The molecular envelope of DEBS3 is a thin elongated ellipsoid, and the results of rigid-body modeling suggest that modules 5 and 6 stack collinearly along the 2-fold axis of symmetry."

MT189 is a new derivative of MT119, a previously reported colchicine site-binding antitubulin agent. In this study, MT189 was demonstrated to retain the property of MT119 in disrupting microtubulin via binding to the colchicine site, causing mitotic arrest and inducing apoptosis, and to display 8.7-fold enhanced proliferative inhibition in a panel of cancer cells. MT189 was shown to elicit in vivo anticancer effects on MDA-MB-231 xenografts in nude mice, and the tumor growth was suppressed by 35.9% over 14 days. MT189 led to degradation of MCL-1, a member of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein family. Its overexpression reduced but its silenced expression increased the apoptotic induction followed by the treatment with MT189. Moreover, the treatment with MT189 caused activation of the MEKK1/TAK1-MKK4-JNK signaling pathway. The activated JNK resulted in phosphorylation of MCL-1, which facilitated its ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Our results show that MT189 inhibits microtubulin polymerization by binding to the colchicine site. Relief of apoptotic suppression by MCL-1 degradation together with mitotic arrest contributes to the anticancer activity of MT189."

We sought to select miRNAs that were responsive to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the H9c2 rat cardiomyocyte cell line. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) demonstrated that the expression of miR-181a in H2O2-treated H9c2 cells was markedly upregulated. The downregulation of miR-181a significantly inhibited H2O2-induced cellular apoptosis, ROS production, the increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, the disruption of mitochondrial structure, and the activation of key signaling proteins in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Our results suggest that miR-181a plays an important role in regulating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in cardiomyocytes challenged with oxidative stress.

Further, 3-BrPA induces the generation of reactive oxygen species in MDA-MB-231 cells, leading to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that caspase-independent apoptosis may be induced by the generation of reactive oxygen species.

The results of Mcl-1 knockdown indicate that Mcl-1 plays an important role in 3-BrPA-induced apoptosis. Further, the upregulation of Mcl-1 expression in 3-BrPA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells significantly increases cell viability. In addition, 3-BrPA treatment resulted in the downregulation of p-Akt, suggesting that 3-BrPA may downregulate Mcl-1 through the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt pathway.

In the undifferentiated stage, P-iPSCs expressed pluripotency markers as ES cells did, indicating that protein-based reprogramming was stable and authentic. While both stem cell types were differentiated to the terminally-matured mDA neurons, P-iPSCs showed higher DA neuron-specific markers' expression than ES cells. To investigate the mechanism of the superior induction capacity of DA neurons observed in P-iPSCs compared to ES cells, we analyzed histone modifications by genome-wide ChIP sequencing analysis and their corresponding microarray results between two cell types. We found that Wnt signaling was up-regulated, while SFRP1, a counter-acting molecule of Wnt, was more suppressed in P-iPSCs than in mESCs. In PD rat model, transplantation of neural precursor cells derived from both cell types showed improved function.

Numerous mRNAs, including Cox-2, show altered expression and/or alternative exon usage (AEU) in α3β1-deficient cells. AEU included patterns predicted to render an mRNA susceptible to degradation, such as 3'-UTR variations or retention of elements that target an mRNA for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). PCR-based analysis of α3β1-deficient cells confirmed changes in Cox-2 mRNA that might target it for NMD, including retention of an intron that harbors premature termination codons and changes within the 3'-UTR. Moreover, Cox-2 mRNA has reduced stability in α3β1-deficient cells, which is partially reversed by knockdown of the essential NMD factor UPF1.

It contains multiple conserved chromatin-associated domains, including three PHD fingers of unknown function. Here, we show that the first and third, but not the second, PHD fingers of KDM5B possess histone binding activities. The PHD1 finger is highly specific for unmodified histone H3 (H3K4me0), whereas the PHD3 finger shows preference for the trimethylated histone mark H3K4me3. RNA-seq analysis indicates that KDM5B functions as a transcriptional repressor for genes involved in inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. Biochemical analysis reveals that KDM5B associates with components of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex and may cooperate with the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) in gene repression. KDM5B is downregulated in triple-negative breast cancer relative to estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. Overexpression of KDM5B in the MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells suppresses cell migration and invasion, and the PHD1-H3K4me0 interaction is essential for inhibiting migration.

Three of the 5 known members of the human RecQ family are genetically linked with cancer susceptibility syndromes, but the association of the most abundant human RecQ homolog, RECQ1, with cellular transformation is yet unclear. RECQ1 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, indicating oncogenic functions. Here, we assessed genome-wide changes in gene expression upon knockdown of RECQ1 in HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells. Pathway analysis suggested that RECQ1 enhances the expression of multiple genes that play key roles in cell migration, invasion, and metastasis, including EZR, ITGA2, ITGA3, ITGB4, SMAD3, and TGFBR2. Consistent with these results, silencing RECQ1 significantly reduced cell migration and invasion. In comparison to genome-wide annotated promoter regions, the promoters of genes downregulated upon RECQ1 silencing were significantly enriched for a potential G4 DNA forming sequence motif. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated binding of RECQ1 to the G4 motifs in the promoters of select genes downregulated upon RECQ1 silencing. In breast cancer patients, the expression of a subset of RECQ1-activated genes positively correlated with RECQ1 expression. Moreover, high RECQ1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer.

The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB231 were used in this study. siRNAs were employed to silence myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). A small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, ABT-737, was used to target anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Apoptosis was identified by FITC Annexin V, PI staining and Western blot analysis. The sensitivity to ionizing radiation and ABT-737 were measured by clonogenic assays. The effect of radiation and ABT-737 was also tested in a MCF-7 xenograft mouse model. Our data demonstrate that the combination of ABT-737 and radiation-induced apoptosis had an inhibitory effect on breast cancer cell proliferation.

Thus, we performed in vitro studies to evaluate anti-cancer properties of ginger leaf and then elucidate the potential mechanisms involved.METHODS: Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. ATF3 expression level was evaluated by Western blot or RT-PCR and ATF3 transcriptional activity was determined using a dual-luciferase assay kit after the transfection of ATF3 promoter constructs. In addition, ATF3-dependent apoptosis was evaluated by Western blot after ATF3 knockdown using ATF3 siRNA.RESULTS: Exposure of GL to human colorectal cancer cells (HCT116, SW480 and LoVo cells) reduced the cell viability and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, GL reduced cell viability in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and HepG-2 cells. ATF3 knockdown attenuated GL-mediated apoptosis. GL increased activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) expressions in both protein and mRNA level and activated ATF3 promoter activity, indicating transcriptional activation of ATF3 gene by GL. In addition, our data showed that GL-responsible sites might be between -318 and -85 region of the ATF3 promoter.

However, cancer cell has a series of protective mechanisms to resist ROS damage. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activates antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated gene expression involved in cellular protection against oxidative stress. As the Nrf2 repressor, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1) sequesters Nrf2 in cytoplasm to block Nrf2 nuclear translocation. In the present study, administration of MDA-7/IL-24 by means of tumor-selective replicating adenovirus (ZD55-IL-24) was used to investigate whether ZD55-IL-24 could attenuate Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response in cancer cell. We found that ZD55-IL-24 effectively strengthened the association between Nrf2 and Keap1 to restrict Nrf2 nuclear translocation, thereby inhibiting ARE-dependent transcriptional response. To evaluate the detailed mechanism underlying the suppression of ZD55-IL-24 on Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response, we further tested three different mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in A549 and HeLa cells transfected by ZD55-IL-24. Our data showed that ZD55-IL-24 inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal pathway but activated p38 and c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) signal pathways to exert the tumor-specific apoptosis. Moreover, ERK pathway inhibitor U0126 prevented Nrf2 phosphorylation at Ser40 to retard Nrf2 nuclear translocation, thus decreasing antioxidant gene transcription. In contrast, p38 pathway inhibitor SB203580 obviously promoted the dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1 to promote antioxidant gene transcription. However, JNK pathway had no effect on Nrf2 subcellular localization or the association of Nrf2 with Keap1. Conclusively, our results indicate that ZD55-IL-24 inhibits Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response not only by activating p38 signal pathway to potentiate the association of Nrf2 and Keap1 but also by suppressing ERK signal pathway to postpone Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Given the 'dark' side of Nrf2 on carcinoma cell survival and chemoresistance, our study provides a novel explanation about MDA-7/IL-24-induced cancer-specific apoptosis and therapeutic sensitization through suppression of the cytoprotective system."

Compared to transgenic strains, the germination rate, emerging rate of cotyledons and root length of wild plants were significantly lower under NaCl treatments, while the inhibitory effect was significantly severe in T-DNA insertion mutant strains. At germination stage, it was mainly osmotic stress when treated with NaCl. Relative to wild plants, overexpression strains maintained a higher K(+), K(+)/Na(+), chlorophyll and proline content, and lower Na(+) and MDA content. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of stress related marker genes KIN1, RD29B and RD22 increased more significantly in transgenic strains by salt stress. Overexpression of AtZFP1 also enhanced oxidative and osmotic stress tolerance which was determined by measuring the expression of a set of antioxidant genes, osmotic stress genes and ion transport protein genes such as SOS1, AtP5CS1 and AtGSTU5.

Importantly, we identified a detailed molecular mechanism of MDA-MB-231 cell migration controlled via physical interaction between MRTF-A and STAT3, which synergistically promote the transactivity of the migration marker Myl-9 and Cyr-61 by CArG box binding. Interestingly, the two signaling pathways RhoA-MRTF-A and JAK-STAT3 across talk to regulate MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Our data thus provide important and novel insights into the roles of MRTF-A and STAT3 in regulating MDA-MB-231 cell migration."

In this study, we coupled functional metagenomics and DNA stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP) using multiple plant-derived carbon substrates and diverse soils to characterize active soil bacterial communities and their glycoside hydrolase genes, which have value for industrial applications. We incubated samples from three disparate Canadian soils (tundra, temperate rainforest, and agricultural) with five native carbon ((12)C) or stable-isotope-labeled ((13)C) carbohydrates (glucose, cellobiose, xylose, arabinose, and cellulose). Indicator species analysis revealed high specificity and fidelity for many uncultured and unclassified bacterial taxa in the heavy DNA for all soils and substrates. Among characterized taxa, Actinomycetales (Salinibacterium), Rhizobiales (Devosia), Rhodospirillales (Telmatospirillum), and Caulobacterales (Phenylobacterium and Asticcacaulis) were bacterial indicator species for the heavy substrates and soils tested. Both Actinomycetales and Caulobacterales (Phenylobacterium) were associated with metabolism of cellulose, and Alphaproteobacteria were associated with the metabolism of arabinose; members of the order Rhizobiales were strongly associated with the metabolism of xylose. Annotated metagenomic data suggested diverse glycoside hydrolase gene representation within the pooled heavy DNA. By screening 2,876 cloned fragments derived from the (13)C-labeled DNA isolated from soils incubated with cellulose, we demonstrate the power of combining DNA-SIP, multiple-displacement amplification (MDA), and functional metagenomics by efficiently isolating multiple clones with activity on carboxymethyl cellulose and fluorogenic proxy substrates for carbohydrate-active enzymes. Importance: The ability to identify genes based on function, instead of sequence homology, allows the discovery of genes that would not be identified through sequence alone. This is arguably the most powerful application of metagenomics for the recovery of novel genes and a natural partner of the stable-isotope-probing approach for targeting active-yet-uncultured microorganisms. We expanded on previous efforts to combine stable-isotope probing and metagenomics, enriching microorganisms from multiple soils that were active in degrading plant-derived carbohydrates, followed by construction of a cellulose-based metagenomic library and recovery of glycoside hydrolases through functional metagenomics. The major advance of our study was the discovery of active-yet-uncultivated soil microorganisms and enrichment of their glycoside hydrolases. We recovered positive cosmid clones in a higher frequency than would be expected with direct metagenomic analysis of soil DNA. This study has generated an invaluable metagenomic resource that future research will exploit for genetic and enzymatic potential."

Recent studies have indicated that the miRNAs comprising the miR-23b/27b/24 cluster might influence tumor metastasis, although the precise nature of this regulation remains unclear. Here, expression of the miR-23b/27b/24 cluster is found to correlate with metastatic potential in mouse and human breast cancer cell lines and is elevated in metastatic lung lesions in human breast cancer patients. Ectopic expression of the miRNAs in the weakly metastatic mouse 4TO7 mammary tumor cell line had no effect on proliferation or morphology of tumor cells in vitro but was found to increase lung metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis. Furthermore, gene expression profiling analysis of miRNA overexpressing 4TO7 cells revealed the direct targeting of prosaposin (PSAP), which encodes a secreted protein found to be inversely correlated with metastatic progression in human breast cancer patients. Importantly, ectopic expression of PSAP was able to suppress the metastatic phenotype in highly metastatic 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 SCP28 cells, as well as in cells ectopically expressing miR-23b/27b/24. These findings support a metastasis-promoting function of the miR-23b/27b/24 cluster of miRNAs, which functions in part through the direct inhibition of PSAP."

Garlic was found to lower the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the serum of rats in a diabetic model. We examined the effect of an aqueous garlic extract (AGE) on the ACE activity, cholestasis-induced liver fibrosis, and associated renal dysfunction in comparison with the effect of the standard drug enalapril. Both AGE and enalapril were administered orally for six weeks starting from the third day after bile duct ligation (BDL). BDL significantly increased the serum activities of liver enzymes, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, an indicator of liver cell death, serum total bilirubin (TB) level, liver myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) content. BDL was associated with elevation of serum urea and creatinine levels indicating renal dysfunction. BDL also caused an increase in the transcript levels of the genes coding for tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1), and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), a collagenase, in liver tissues. A significant decrease in hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) was observed in BDL rats, while serum ACE activity was increased. Both AGE and enalapril counteracted all these deleterious changes, with the exception that only AGE reduced the MPO activity. These findings suggest that AGE possesses hepato- and renoprotective properties, similar to enalapril, probably by modulating the levels of proteins such as TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1 and MMP-13, and involving a reduction of ACE and of oxidative stress."

The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6) is an essential Wnt co-receptor for Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We found that rottlerin, a natural plant polyphenol, suppressed LRP6 expression and phosphorylation, and inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of rottlerin on LRP6 expression/phosphorylation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling were confirmed in human prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cells. Mechanistically, rottlerin promoted LRP6 degradation, but had no effects on LRP6 transcriptional activity. In addition, rottlerin-mediated LRP6 down-regulation was unrelated to activation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Importantly, we also found that rottlerin inhibited mTORC1 signaling in prostate and breast cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated that rottlerin was able to suppress the expression of cyclin D1 and survivin, two targets of both Wnt/β-catenin and mTORC1 signaling, in prostate and breast cancer cells, and displayed remarkable anticancer activity with IC(50) values between 0.7 and 1.7 μM for prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cells. The IC(50) values are comparable to those shown to suppress the activities of Wnt/β-catenin and mTORC1 signaling in prostate and breast cancer cells. Our data indicate that rottlerin is a novel LRP6 inhibitor and suppresses both Wnt/β-catenin and mTORC1 signaling in prostate and breast cancer cells, and that LRP6 represents a potential therapeutic target for cancers."

Our gel filtration studies revealed significant heterogeneity in the size and composition of isolated MARS complexes. By targeting the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases subunit, which was found exclusively in the complete 1 MDa complex, we were able to directly visualize MARS particles in the electron microscope. Image analyses of the negative stain data revealed the observed heterogeneity and instability of these complexes to be driven by the intrinsic flexibility of the domain arrangements within the MARS complex.

Recently, it has been reported that TPGS acts as an anti-cancer agent alone or synergistically with chemotherapeutic drugs and increases the efficacy of nanoparticle formulations. In this study, we investigated the antitumor efficacy and the molecular mechanism of action of TPGS in breast cancer cell lines. Our results show that TPGS can induce G1/S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) but not in &quot;normal&quot; (non-tumorigenic) immortalized cells (MCF-10A and MCF-12F). An investigation of the molecular mechanism of action of TPGS reveals that induction of G1/S phase cell cycle arrest is associated with upregulation of P21 and P27Kip1 proteins. Induction of apoptosis by TPGS involves the inhibition of phospho-AKT and the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Survivin and Bcl-2. Interestingly, our results also suggest that TPGS induces both caspase -dependent and -independent apoptotic signaling pathways and that this vitamin E derivative is selectively cytotoxic in breast cancer cell lines. When compared to the Survivin inhibitor YM155, TPGS was shown to be more selective for cancer cell growth inhibition. Overall our results suggest that TPGS may not only be useful as a carrier molecule for drug delivery, but may also exert intrinsic therapeutic effects suggesting that it may promote a synergistic interaction with formulated chemotherapeutic drugs."

In the present study, a comparative pathway-based transcriptome analysis was applied in epithelial-like MCF-7 and triple negative mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells exposed to different concentrations of WA which can be detected systemically in in vivo experiments. Whereas WA treatment demonstrated attenuation of multiple cancer hallmarks, the withanolide analogue Withanone (WN) did not exert any of the described effects at comparable concentrations. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that WA targets specific cancer processes related to cell death, cell cycle and proliferation, which could be functionally validated by flow cytometry and real-time cell proliferation assays. WA also strongly decreased MDA-MB-231 invasion as determined by single-cell collagen invasion assay. This was further supported by decreased gene expression of extracellular matrix-degrading proteases (uPA, PLAT, ADAM8), cell adhesion molecules (integrins, laminins), pro-inflammatory mediators of the metastasis-promoting tumor microenvironment (TNFSF12, IL6, ANGPTL2, CSF1R) and concomitant increased expression of the validated breast cancer metastasis suppressor gene (BRMS1). In line with the transcriptional changes, nanomolar concentrations of WA significantly decreased protein levels and corresponding activity of uPA in MDA-MB-231 cell supernatant, further supporting its anti-metastatic properties. Finally, hierarchical clustering analysis of 84 chromatin writer-reader-eraser enzymes revealed that WA treatment of invasive mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cells reprogrammed their transcription levels more similarly towards the pattern observed in non-invasive MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, taking into account that sub-cytotoxic concentrations of WA target multiple metastatic effectors in therapy-resistant triple negative breast cancer, WA-based therapeutic strategies targeting the uPA pathway hold promise for further (pre)clinical development to defeat aggressive metastatic breast cancer."

In this study, we examined the role of malondialdehyde (MDA), an important oxidative stress epitope of oxLDL, in mediating coronary endothelial cytotoxicity.RESULTS: Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) were treated with oxLDL in the presence or absence of antibody against MDA (anti-MDA) or apoB100 (anti-apoB100). In HCAECs treated with oxLDL (100 μg/ml) alone, DNA synthesis, cell viability, and expression of prosurvival fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) were significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.01 vs phosphate buffered saline-treated cells). These inhibitory effects of oxLDL were significantly attenuated in HCAECs cotreated with anti-MDA (0.15 μg/ml; P &lt; 0.05 vs oxLDL-treated cells), but not in those cotreated with anti-apoB100. When we tested the effects of a panel of signal transduction modifiers on the signal transduction pathways of MDA in oxLDL-treated HCAECs, we found that MDA-induced cytotoxicity was mediated partly through the Akt pathway. Using a reporter gene assay, we identified an oxLDL-response element in the FGF2 promoter that was responsible for the transcriptional repression of FGF2 by oxLDL. The results of bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing showed that in HCAECs treated with oxLDL, the GC-rich promoter of FGF2 was heavily methylated at cytosine residues, whereas cotreatment with anti-MDA markedly reduced oxLDL-induced FGF2 promoter methylation.CONCLUSION: OxLDL disrupts the growth and survival of HCAECs through an MDA-dependent pathway involving methylation of the FGF2 promoter and repression of FGF2 transcription. This novel epigenetic mechanism of oxLDL may underlie its atherogenicity in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease."

In the present study, we demonstrate that green tea polyphenols (GTP) and its major constituent, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) mediate epigenetic induction of TIMP-3 levels and play a key role in suppressing invasiveness and gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in breast cancer cells. Treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with 20 µM EGCG and 10 µg/mL GTP for 72 h significantly induces TIMP-3 mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, investigations into the molecular mechanism revealed that TIMP-3 repression in breast cancer cells is mediated by epigenetic silencing mechanism(s) involving increased activity of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), independent of promoter DNA hypermethylation. Treatment of breast cancer cells with GTP and EGCG significantly reduced EZH2 and class I HDAC protein levels. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of TIMP-3 was found to be associated with decreased EZH2 localization and H3K27 trimethylation enrichment at the TIMP-3 promoter with a concomitant increase in histone H3K9/18 acetylation. Our findings highlight TIMP-3 induction as a key epigenetic event modulated by GTPs in restoring the MMP:TIMP balance to delay breast cancer progression and invasion."

An extended case-control study revealed a tenfold enrichment for this mutation in BC patients carrying the 5382insC allele of BRCA1, the major founder mutation in the Russian population, compared to wild-type BRCA1 BC cases [6/117 (5.1%) vs. 8/1578 (0.5%), p = 0.0002]. In mammary tumors (n = 60), the mRNA expression of GPRC5A significantly correlated with that of BRCA1 (p = 0.00018). In addition, the amount of GPRC5A transcript was significantly lower in BC obtained from BRCA1 mutation carriers (n = 17) compared to noncarriers (n = 93) (p = 0.026). Accordingly, a siRNA-mediated knockdown of either BRCA1 or GPRC5A in the MDA-MB-231 human BC cell line reduced expression of GPRC5A or BRCA1, respectively. Knockdown of GPRC5A also attenuated radiation-induced BRCA1- and RAD51-containing nuclear DNA repair foci.

Although many studies have demonstrated the cytotoxic effects of ZEN, the mechanisms by which ZEN mediates its cytotoxic effects appear to differ according to cell type and route of exposure. Meantime, the available information on the neurotoxic effects of ZEN is very much limited. In the present study we evaluated the role of oxidative stress in ZEN mediated neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and investigated the possible underlying mechanism. ZEN induced ROS formation and elevated levels of MDA, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increase in DNA damage in a dose dependent manner as assessed by COMET assay and agarose gel electrophoresis. However, there was no DNA damage by plasmid breakage assay at 6, 12 and 24h time points. DAPI staining showed apoptotic nuclei at 12 and 24h. Further, ZEN treated SH-SY5Y cells showed a marked suppressive effect on the neuronal gene expression. Use of an antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reversed the toxin-induced generation of ROS and also attenuated loss of MMP. Collectively, these results suggest that ROS is the main upstream signal leading to increased ZEN mediated neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells."

Notably, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) expression status plays a critical role in breast cancer progression and the clinical development of PARP1 inhibitors to treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer has advanced rapidly. However, dynamic crosstalk between BRCA1 and PARP1 remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that: (i) BRCA1 inactivation events (mutation, promoter methylation, or knockdown) were accompanied by increased PARP1 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels, and a subsequent increase in NAD-dependent PARP1 activity in MDA-MB-231 and primary breast cancer cells; (ii) the overexpression of BRCA1 resulted in decreased PARP1 and NAD levels, and a subsequent impairment in NAD-dependent PARP1 activity in MDA-MB-231 and primary breast cancer cells; and (iii) intracellular NAD levels were largely responsible for regulating PARP1 activity in breast cancer cells, and NAD levels were positively correlated with PARP1 activity in human breast cancer specimens (R = 0.647, P &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, the high efficiency of PARP1 triggered by BRCA1 inactivation may further inhibit BRCA1 transcription by NAD depletion. These results highlight a novel interaction between BRCA1 and PARP1, which may be beneficial for the dynamic balance between BRCA1 and PARP1-related biologic processes, especially for maintaining stable DNA repair ability.

A typical Cys2/His2-type (C2H2-type) zinc finger gene GmZF1 from soybean was isolated and was composed of 172 amino acids containing two conserved C2H2-type zinc finger domains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that GmZF1 was clustered on the same branch with six C2H2-type ZFPs from dicotyledonous plants excepting for GsZFP1, and distinguished those from monocotyledon species. The GmZF1 protein was localized at the nucleus, and has specific binding activity with EP1S core sequence, and nucleotide mutation in the core sequence of EPSPS promoter changed the binding ability between GmZF1 protein and core DNA element, implying that two amino acid residues, G and C boxed in core sequence TGACAGTGTCA possibly play positive regulation role in recognizing DNA-binding sites in GmZF1 proteins. High accumulation of GmZF1 mRNA induced by exogenous ABA suggested that GmZF1 was involved in an ABA-dependent signal transduction pathway. Over-expression of GmZF1 significantly improved the contents of proline and soluble sugar and decreased the MDA contents in the transgenic lines exposed to cold stress, indicating that transgenic Arabidopsis carrying GmZF1 gene have adaptive mechanisms to cold stress. Over-expression of GmZF1 also increased the expression of cold-regulated cor6.6 gene by probably recognizing protein-DNA binding sites, suggesting that GmZF1 from soybean could enhance the tolerance of Arabidopsis to cold stress by regulating expression of cold-regulation gene in the transgenic Arabidopsis."

These activities involve processes such as regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. While lactoferrin has been shown to exert its function by activating different transduction pathways, delta-lactoferrin has been proven to act as a transcription factor. Like many tumor suppressors, these two proteins are under-expressed in several types of cancer, particularly in breast cancer.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to compare the differential effects of the re-introduction of lactoferrin isoforms in breast cancer cells we chose the cancerous mammary gland MDA-MB-231 cell line as a model. We produced a cell line stably expressing delta-lactoferrin. We also treated these cells with fresh purified human breast lactoferrin. We performed two quantitative proteomic studies in parallel using SILAC coupled to mass spectrometry in order to compare the effects of different doses of the two lactoferrin isoforms. The proteome of untreated, delta-lactoferrin expressing and human lactoferrin treated MDA-MB-231 cells were compared. Overall, around 5300 proteins were identified and quantified using the in-house developed MFPaQ software. Among these, expression was increased by 1.5-fold or more for around 300 proteins in delta-lactoferrin expressing cells and 190 proteins in lactoferrin treated cells. At the same time, about 200 and 40 proteins were found to be downregulated (0-0.7-fold) in response to delta-lactoferrin and lactoferrin, respectively.SIGNIFICANCE: Re-introduction of delta-lactoferrin and lactoferrin expression in MDA-MB-231 mainly leads to modifications of protein profiles involved in processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, the ubiquitin pathway, translation and mRNA quality control. Moreover, this study identified new target genes of delta-lactoferrin transcriptional activity such as SelH, GTF2F2 and UBE2E1."

In this study, this question was addressed by overexpressing STC-1 in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and examining the resultant phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of STC-1 enhanced invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and promoted their lung metastasis in vivo, while having no effect on proliferation, adhesion, or proteinase activity. The addition of soluble STC-1 to MDA-MB-231 cultures resulted in the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, suggesting a mechanistic basis for the observed increases in cell motility and metastasis. Taken together, it was indicated that secreted STC-1 promotes metastatic potential of breast cancer cells via activation of PI3K/AKT."

Previous reports have correlated the level of UEV1A expression with tumorigenesis; however, the detailed molecular events leading to tumors particularly breast cancer and metastasis are unclear. This study is to investigate roles of different UEV1 splicing variants, and its close homolog MMS2, in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis in breast cancer cells.METHODS: We experimentally manipulated the UEV1 and MMS2 levels in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and monitored their effects on cell invasion and migration, as well as tumor formation and metastasis in xenograft mice. The underlying molecular mechanisms leading to metastasis were also examined.RESULTS: It was found that overexpression of UEV1A alone, but not UEV1C or MMS2, is sufficient to induce cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. This process is mediated by NF-κB activation and requires functional Ubc13. Our experimental data establish that among NF-κB target genes, UEV1A-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) expression plays a critical role in cell invasion and metastasis. Interestingly, experimental depletion of UEV1 in MDA-MB-231 cells reduces MMP1 expression and prevents tumor formation and metastasis in a xenograft mouse model, while overexpression of MMP1 overrides the metastasis effects in UEV1-depleted cells.CONCLUSIONS: These results identify UEV1A as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of metastasic breast cancers."

Earlier, we have published the isolation and characterisation of an A-2-type SbDREB2A TF from an extreme halophyte Salicornia brachiata. The SbDREB2A protein lacks potential proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S) and threonine (T) (PEST) sequence which is known to act as signal peptide for protein degradation. In this study, SbDREB2A TF was over-expressed in tobacco plants without any modification in polypeptide sequence. Transgenic plants showed better seed germination and growth characteristics in both hyperionic and hyperosmotic stresses. Transgenic plants exhibited higher water content, membrane stability and less electrolyte leakage in stress conditions. The transgenic plants accumulated less Na(+) and higher K(+) than wildtype (WT) plants. The transgenic plants revealed higher chlorophyll content, water use efficiency (WUE) and net photosynthesis rate. Transgenics exhibited higher level of proline and low amount of MDA and H2O2 under stress conditions. The real-time PCR of transgenics showed higher expression of downstream heat shock genes (Hsp18, Hsp26 and Hsp70), TFs (AP2 domain containing TF, HSF2 and ZFP), signalling components (PLC3 and Ca (2+) /calmodulin) and dehydrins (ERD10B, ERD10D and LEA5) under different abiotic stress treatments."

Herein, we probed the miRNA expression profile of novel AA and CA derived prostate cancer cell lines. We found a unique miRNA signature associated with AA cell lines, independent of tumor status. Evaluation of the most differentially expressed miRNAs showed that miR-132, miR-367b, miR-410, and miR-152 were decreased in more aggressive cells, and this was reversed after treatment of the cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Sequencing of the miR-152 promoter confirmed that it was highly methylated. Ectopic expression of miR-152 resulted in decreased growth, migration, and invasion. Informatics analysis of a large patient cohort showed that decreased miR-152 expression correlated with increased metastasis and a decrease in biochemical recurrence free survival. Analysis of 39 prostate cancer tissues with matched controls (20 AA and 19 CA), showed that 50% of AA patients had statistically significant lower miR-152 expression compared to only 35% of CA patients. Ectopic expression of miR-152 in LNCaP, PC-3, and MDA-PCa-2b cells down-regulated DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) through direct binding in the DNMT1 3'UTR. There appeared to be a reciprocal regulatory relationship of miR-152/DNMT1 expression, as cells treated with siRNA DNMT1 caused miR-152 to be re-expressed in all cell lines. In summary, these results demonstrate that epigenetic regulation of miR-152/DNMT1 may play an important role in multiple events that contribute to the aggressiveness of PCa tumors, with an emphasis on AA PCa patients ."

In the present study, a full-length cDNA sequence of a MYB gene, designated as SpMYB, was isolated from tomato. SpMYB encodes the R2R3-type protein consisting of 328 amino acids. The expression level of SpMYB was strongly induced by fungal pathogens. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing SpMYB had an enhanced salt and drought stress tolerance compared with wild-type plants, and showed significantly improved resistance to Alternaria alternate. Further analysis revealed that transgenic tobaccos exhibited less accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and more accumulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) after inoculation with A. alternate. Meanwhile, changes in some photosynthetic parameters, such as photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr) and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) were also found in the transgenic tobaccos. Furthermore, transgenic tobaccos constitutively accumulated higher levels of pathogenesis-related (PR) gene transcripts, such as PR1 and PR2. The results suggested that the tomato SpMYB transcription factor plays an important role in responses to abiotic and biotic stress."

Herein, we present safety and efficacy results from a virulent BRSV challenge of calves with MDA, which were immunized with one of three vaccine candidates that allow serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA): an SH gene-deleted recombinant BRSV (ΔSHrBRSV), and two subunit (SU) formulations based on HRSV-P, -M2-1, and -N recombinant proteins displaying BRSV-F and -G epitopes, adjuvanted by either oil emulsion (Montanide ISA71VG, SUMont) or immunostimulating complex matrices (AbISCO-300, SUAbis). Whereas all control animals developed severe respiratory disease and shed high levels of virus following BRSV challenge, ΔSHrBRSV-immunized calves demonstrated almost complete clinical and virological protection five weeks after a single intranasal vaccination. Although mucosal vaccination with ΔSHrBRSV failed to induce a detectable immunological response, there was a rapid and strong anamnestic mucosal BRSV-specific IgA, virus neutralizing antibody and local T cell response following challenge with virulent BRSV. Calves immunized twice intramuscularly, three weeks apart with SUMont were also well protected two weeks after boost. The protection was not as pronounced as that in ΔSHrBRSV-immunized animals, but superior to those immunized twice subcutaneously three weeks apart with SUAbis. Antibody responses induced by the subunit vaccines were non-neutralizing and not directed against BRSV F or G proteins. When formulated as SUMont but not as SUAbis, the HRSV N, P and M2-1 proteins induced strong systemic cross-protective cell-mediated immune responses detectable already after priming. ΔSHrBRSV and SUMont are two promising DIVA-compatible vaccines, apparently inducing protection by different immune responses that were influenced by vaccine-composition, immunization route and regimen."

It showed 80-90% homology at the nucleotide and 85-95% homology at the amino acid level with other VPPases. The gene was introduced into expression vector pCAMBIA1301 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter and transformed into Agrobacterium tumifaciens strain LBA4404 to infect embryogenic calli of finger millet (Eleusine coracana). Successful transfer of SbVPPase was confirmed by a GUS histochemical assay and PCR analysis. Both, controls and transgenic plants were subjected to 100 and 200mM NaCl and certain biochemical and physiological parameters were studied. Relative water content (RWC), plant height, leaf expansion, finger length and width and grain weight were severely reduced (50-70%), and the flowering period was delayed by 20% in control plants compared to transgenic plants under salinity stress. With increasing salt stress, the proline and chlorophyll contents as well as the enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) increased by 25-100% in transgenics, while malondialdehyde (MDA) showed a 2-4-fold decrease. The increased activities of antioxidant enzymes and the reduction in the MDA content suggest efficient scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in transgenics and, as a consequence, probably alleviation of salt stress. Also, the leaf tissues of the transgenics accumulated 1.5-2.5-fold higher Na(+) and 0.4-0.8-fold higher K(+) levels. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that overexpression of SbVPPase in transgenic finger millet enhances the plant's performance under salt stress."

Primary MSCs as well as a MSC line (SCP-1) were cocultured with primary breast cancer cells, MCF-7, MDA-MB231 breast carcinoma or MCF-10A non-malignant breast epithelial cells or their conditioned medium. In addition, the frequency of circulating clonogenic hematopoietic progenitors was determined in 78 patients with breast cancer and compared with healthy controls. Gene expression analysis of SCP-1 cells cultured with MCF-7 medium revealed CXCL12 (SDF-1) as one of the most significantly downregulated genes. Supernatant from both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 reduced the CXCL12 promoter activity in SCP-1 cells to 77% and 47%, respectively. Moreover, the CXCL12 mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced. As functional consequence of lower CXCL12 levels, we detected a decreased trans-well migration of HSPCs towards MSC/tumor cell cocultures or conditioned medium. The specificity of this effect was confirmed by blocking studies with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. Downregulation of SP1 and increased miR-23a levels in MSCs after contact with tumor cell medium as well as enhanced TGFβ1 expression were identified as potential molecular regulators of CXCL12 activity in MSCs. Moreover, we observed a significantly higher frequency of circulating colony-forming hematopoietic progenitors in patients with breast cancer compared with healthy controls. Our in vitro results propose a potential new mechanism by which disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow may interfere with hematopoiesis by modulating CXCL12 in protected niches."

Although, dioscin is already known to induce cell death in variety cancer cells, the molecular basis for dioscin-induced cell death was not definitely known in cancer cells. In this study, we found that dioscin treatment induced cell death in dose-dependent manner in breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and T47D cells. Dioscin decreased expressions of Bcl-2 and cIAP-1 proteins, which were down-regulated at the transcriptional level. Conversely, Mcl-1 protein level was down-regulated by facilitating ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated Mcl-1 degradation in dioscin-treated cells. Pretreatment with z-VAD fails to attenuate dioscin-induced cell death as well as caspase-mediated events such as cleavages of procaspase-3 and PARP. In addition, dioscin treatment increased the population of annexin V positive cells and induced DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) was released from the mitochondria and translocated to the nucleus. Suppression in AIF expression by siRNA reduced dioscin-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells.

DP has characteristics similar to persistent organic pollutants. However, no toxicity data of DP on terrestrial invertebrate are available. In this study, earthworms Eisenia fetida were exposed to 0.1, 1, 10, and 50mg/kg DP for 14 days. Lethality, oxidative stress and damage, neurotoxicity, and transcriptomic profiles of E. fetida were assessed on day 7 and day 14 of exposure. Results showed that the acute toxicity of DP was very low. However, DP exposure induced an increase in the oxidative stress markers malonaldehyde (MDA) and 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and altered acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities. High throughput sequencing-based transcriptomic analysis showed that DP exposure significantly altered gene expression and pathways related to antioxidant enzymes, stress responses, neurological dysfunctions, calcium binding, and signal transduction. The results from different toxicological endpoints indicate that DP toxicity on the earthworm is primarily through oxidative damage and neurotoxicity. Based on these results, we deduce that changes in oxidative stress and neurotoxicity might be the primary mechanisms of DP toxicity. This study provides insight into the toxicological effects of DP on earthworm model, and may be useful for risk assessment of DP on soil ecosystems."

In humans, TXA(2) signals through the TPα and TPβ isoforms of the T prostanoid receptor, two structurally related receptors transcriptionally regulated by distinct promoters, Prm1 and Prm3, respectively, within the TP gene. Focusing on TPα, the current study investigated its expression and transcriptional regulation through Prm1 in prostate and breast cancers. Expression of TPα correlated with increasing prostate and breast tissue tumor grade while the TXA(2) mimetic U46619 promoted both proliferation and migration of the respective prostate (PC3) and breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231) derived-carcinoma cell lines. Through 5' deletional and genetic reporter analyses, several functional upstream repressor regions (URRs) were identified within Prm1 in PC3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells while site-directed mutagenesis identified the tumor suppressors Wilms' tumor (WT)1 and hypermethylated in cancer (HIC) 1 as the trans-acting factors regulating those repressor regions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies confirmed that WT1 binds in vivo to multiple GC-enriched WT1 cis-elements within the URRs of Prm1 in PC3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, ChIP analyses established that HIC1 binds in vivo to the HIC1((b))cis-element within Prm1 in PC3 and MCF-7 cells but not in the MDA-MB-231 carcinoma line.

Oestrogen receptor α (ERα), which plays an essential role in breast cancer development, can be transcriptionally activated in a ligand-independent manner. In this study, we investigated the effect of leptin on CYP1B1 expression and its mechanism in breast cancer cells. Leptin induced CYP1B1 protein, messenger RNA expression and promoter activity in ERα-positive MCF-7 cells but not in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, leptin increased 4-hydroxyoestradiol in MCF-7 cells. Also, ERα knockdown by siRNA significantly blocked the induction of CYP1B1 expression by leptin, indicating that leptin induced CYP1B1 expression via an ERα-dependent mechanism. Transient transfection with CYP1B1 deletion promoter constructs revealed that the oestrogen response element (ERE) plays important role in the up-regulation of CYP1B1 by leptin. Furthermore, leptin stimulated phosphorylation of ERα at serine residues 118 and 167 and increased ERE-luciferase activity, indicating that leptin induced CYP1B1 expression by ERα activation. Finally, we found that leptin activated ERK and Akt signalling pathways, which are upstream kinases related to ERα phosphorylation induced by leptin.

In previous studies, we constructed a Glycine soja transcriptional profile, and identified three PPCK genes (GsPPCK1, GsPPCK2 and GsPPCK3) as potential alkali stress responsive genes. In this study, we confirmed the induced expression of GsPPCK3 under alkali stress and investigated its tissue expression specificity by using quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Then we ectopically expressed GsPPCK3 in Medicago sativa and found that GsPPCK3 overexpression improved plant alkali tolerance, as evidenced by lower levels of relative ion leakage and MDA content and higher levels of chlorophyll content and root activity. In this respect, we further co-transformed the GsPPCK3 and SCMRP genes into alfalfa, and demonstrated the increased alkali tolerance of GsPPCK3-SCMRP transgenic lines. Further investigation revealed that GsPPCK3-SCMRP co-overexpression promoted the PEPC activity, net photosynthetic rate and citric acid content of transgenic alfalfa under alkali stress. Moreover, we also observed the up-regulated expression of PEPC, CS (citrate synthase), H(+)-ATPase and NADP-ME genes in GsPPCK3-SCMRP transgenic alfalfa under alkali stress. As expected, we demonstrated that GsPPCK3-SCMRP transgenic lines displayed higher methionine content than wild type alfalfa.

AR activity inhibits breast growth and has pleiotropic actions in breast cancer that are subtype-dependent. Expression of AR splice variants (ARVs) and their role in prostate carcinogenesis has been elucidated in recent studies. We hypothesised that ARVs are also expressed in breast cancers and other hormone sensitive tissues. Herein, the expression of five previously identified ARV transcripts with documented transcriptional capacity (AR-V1, -V3, -V4, -V7, and -V9) was examined in 6 breast (MFM223, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-231, ZR75.1, MCF-7, T47D), two prostate (VCaP, LNCaP), and one liver (HepG2) cancer cell lines, a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293), and a panel of RNAs representing 21 different human tissues.

Phage-displayed peptides were evaluated for ERBB2 and cancer cell binding affinity and specificity in vitro, and one peptide was radiolabeled with (111)In-DOTA and biodistribution and SPECT imaging properties were compared to the first generation peptide, (111)In-DOTA-KCCYSL.RESULTS: In vivo phage display selected two peptides, 1-D03 (MEGPSKCCYSLALSH) and 3-G03 (SGTKSKCCYSLRRSS), with higher breast carcinoma cell specificity and similar ErbB2 affinity (236 and 289 nM, respectively) to the first generation peptide.

However, their functions in regulating abiotic stress tolerance are still not fully understood. In this study, we characterized the functions of an ERF gene from Tamarix hispida, ThERF1, which can negatively regulate abiotic stress tolerance. The expression of ThERF1 was induced by salinity, PEG-simulated drought and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. ThERF1 can specifically bind to GCC-box and DRE motifs. Overexpression of ThERF1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed inhibited seed germination, and decreased fresh weight gain and root growth compared with wild-type (WT) plants. In addition, the transcript levels of several superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) genes in transgenic plants were significantly inhibited compared with in WT plants, resulting in decreased SOD and POD activities in transgenic plants under salt and drought stress conditions. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and cell membrane damage in ThERF1-transformed plants were all highly increased relative to WT plants. Our results suggest that ThERF1 negatively regulates abiotic stress tolerance by strongly inhibiting the expression of SOD and POD genes, leading to decreased ROS-scavenging ability."

The strains exhibited similar carbon utilization but differed in N utilization and their response to the metabolic inhibitors. Methylophilus sp. was less tolerant to salt stress and it viability declined to one tenth within 4 h of incubation in 2M NaCI due to membrane damage and leakage of the intracellular electrolytes as evident from malondiaaldehyde (MDA) assay. In 200 mM NaCI, they exhibited increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity while in 500 mM NaCI, enzyme activities declined in Methylophilus sp. and increased in Methylobacterium sp.

Here, we report that the DNA damage response (DDR) protein hRAD9 contributes to induction of senescence and inhibition of EMT. Our data show that hRAD9 is frequently downregulated in breast and lung cancers. Loss of hRAD9 expression is associated with tumor stage in breast and lung cancers, as well as with acquisition of an invasive phenotype. Ectopic hRAD9 expression in highly invasive cancer cell lines, H1299 and MDA-MB 231, with low endogenous hRAD9 induced senescence by upregulation of nuclear p21, independent of the p53 status. Ectopic expression of hRAD9 also significantly attenuated cellular migration and invasion in vitro and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model in vivo. In contrast, silencing hRAD9 in lower invasive cancer cell lines, A549 and MCF7, with high endogenous hRAD9 dramatically increased their migration and invasion abilities, and simultaneously activated EMT. Knockdown of hRAD9 increased, whereas ectopic expression of hRAD9 decreased, the expression of Slug. Moreover, hRAD9 directly bound to the promoter region of slug gene and repressed its transcriptional activity. Taken together, these results suggest that hRAD9 is a potential tumor suppressor in breast and lung cancers and that it is likely to function by upregulating p21 and inhibiting Slug to regulate tumorigenesis."

In this study, we describe a new mechanism by which EMILIN2 attenuates tumour cell viability. Based on sequence homology with the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of the Frizzled receptors, we hypothesized that EMILIN2 could affect Wnt signalling activation and demonstrate direct interaction with the Wnt1 ligand. This physical binding leads to decreased LRP6 phosphorylation and to the down-modulation of β-catenin, TAZ and their target genes. As a consequence, EMILIN2 negatively affects the viability, migration and tumourigenic potential of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in a number of two- and three-dimensional in vitro assays. EMILIN2 does not modulate Wnt signalling downstream of the Wnt-Frizzled interaction, since it does not affect the activation of the pathway following treatment with the GSK3 inhibitors LiCl and CHIR99021. The interaction with Wnt1 and the subsequent biological effects require the presence of the EMI domain, as there is no effect with a deletion mutant lacking this domain. Moreover, in vivo experiments show that the ectopic expression of EMILIN2, as well as treatment with the recombinant protein, significantly reduce tumour growth and dissemination of cancer cells in nude mice. Accordingly, the tumour samples are characterized by a significant down-regulation of the Wnt signalling pathway. Altogether, these findings provide further evidence of the complex regulations governed by EMILIN2 in the tumour microenvironment, and they identify a key extracellular regulator of the Wnt signalling pathway."

Given that bone metastases are characterised by exacerbated osteoclast activity as well, we tested this therapy in mice intracardiacally injected with the osteotropic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Treatment with cyclicCHAD significantly decreased cachexia and incidence of bone metastases, and induced a trend of reduction of visceral metastasis volume, while in orthotopically injected mice cyclicCHAD reduced tumour volume. In vitro studies showed its ability to impair tumour cell motility and invasion, suggesting a direct effect not only on osteoclasts but also on the tumour cell phenotype. Interestingly, when administered together with a suboptimal, poorly effective, dose of doxorubicin (DXR), cyclicCHAD improved survival and reduced visceral metastases volume to a level similar to that of the optimal dose of DXR alone. Taken together, these preclinical data suggest that cyclicCHAD is a new inhibitor of bone metastases, with an appreciable direct effect also on tumour growth and a synergistic activity in combination with low dose chemotherapy, underscoring an important translational impact."

And a recent study has confirmed that lidocaine exerts a demethylation effect and regulates the proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines. To recognize a potential anti-tumor effect of lidocaine, we evaluated the DNA demethylation by lidocaine in human breast cancer lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and determined the influence of demethylation on the toxicity to these cells of cisplatin, which is a commonly utilized anti-tumor agent for breast cancer. Results demonstrated that lidocaine promoted a significant global genomic demethylation, and particularly in the promoters of tumor suppressive genes (TSGs), RARβ2 and RASSF1A. Further, the lidocaine treatment increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis and enhanced cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. The combined treatment with both lidocaine and cisplatin promoted a significantly higher level of MCF-7 cell apoptosis than singular lidocaine or cisplatin treatment. Moreover, the abrogation of RARβ2 or RASSF1A expression inhibited such apoptosis. In conclusion, the present study confirms the demethylation effect of lidocaine in breast cancer cells, and found that the demethylation of RARβ2 and RASSF1A sensitized the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in breast cancer cells."

Thiamine, commonly known as vitamin B1, is one of critical cofactors for energy metabolic enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase. Here we report a novel role of miR-155 in cancer metabolism through the up-regulation of thiamine in breast cancer cells. A bioinformatic analysis of miRNA array and metabolite-profiling data from NCI-60 cancer cell panel revealed thiamine as a metabolite positively correlated with the miR-155 expression level. We confirmed it in MCF7, MDA-MB-436 and two human primary breast cancer cells by showing reduced thiamine levels upon a knock-down of miR-155. To understand how the miR-155 controls thiamine level, a set of key molecules for thiamine homeostasis were further analyzed after the knockdown of miR-155. The results showed the expression of two thiamine transporter genes (SLC19A2, SLC25A19) as well as thiamine pyrophosphokinase-1 (TPK1) were decreased in both RNA and protein level in miR-155 dependent manner. Finally, we confirm the finding by showing a positive correlation between miR-155 and thiamine level in 71 triple negative breast tumors.

Proteins make a connection within the interdomain connector loop of PCNA, and much of the regulation is a result of the inherent competition for this docking site. If this target region of PCNA is modified, the DNA replication and repair process in cancer cells is potentially altered. Exploitation of this cancer-associated region has implications for targeted breast cancer therapy. In the present communication, we characterize a novel peptide (caPeptide) that has been synthesized to mimic the sequence identified as critical to the cancer-associated isoform of PCNA. This peptide is delivered into cells using a nine-arginine linking mechanism, and the resulting peptide (R9-cc-caPeptide) exhibits cytotoxicity in a triple-negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-436, while having less of an effect on the normal counterparts (MCF10A and primary breast epithelial cells). The novel peptide was then evaluated for cytotoxicity using various in vivo techniques, including ATP activity assays, flow cytometry, and clonogenetic assays. This cytotoxicity has been observed in other breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and HCC1937) and other forms of cancer (pancreatic and lymphoma). R9-cc-caPeptide has also been shown to block the association of PCNA with chromatin. Alanine scanning of the peptide sequence, combined with preliminary in silico modeling, gives insight to the disruptive ability and the molecular mechanism of action of the therapeutic peptide in vivo."

P. aeruginosa is motile via single polar flagellum made up of polymerized flagellin proteins. It is a serious nosocomial pathogen causing UTIs. Predisposing factors include instrumentation and catheterization which enhance colonization with P. aeruginosa, leading to ascending infection. Hence for a newer, safer and effective approach, the present study focussed on the prophylaxis using bacterial flagellin, isolated and purified (PCR sequencing and MALDI-TOF) from P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain, which triggers immune response [both non-specific and specific (active and passive)] as defense against infection. Administration of flagellin 'b' via intraperitoneal route enhanced the clearance of homologous as well as heterologous bacteria (P. aeruginosa uroisolate carrying flagellin 'a') in renal tissue, decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reverted structural integrity of renal tissue to near normal in female LACA mice. Immunization suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)] and activated humoral immune response. Anti-flagellin antibodies (quantified by ELISA) helped in the clearance of bacterial load by opsonophagocytosis. Adoptive transfer of antisera also protected mice from PAO1 challenge, indicating protective role of antibodies. In conclusion, this is the first report that describes flagellin as a potential prophylactic agent which downregulates inflammation and curbs UTIs."

In human breast cancer tissue, we detected a significant increase in CerS4 and CerS6 mRNA in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cancer tissue. To clarify the molecular mechanism of this upregulation, we cloned CerS2, -4, -5 and CerS6 promoter and 3'-UTR fragments into luciferase reporter gene plasmids and determined luciferase activity in MCF-7 (ERα/β) and MDA-MB-231 (ERβ) cells after 17β-estradiol treatment. Only the activities of CerS4 and CerS5 promoter Luc constructs, as well as CerS2- and CerS5-3'-UTR Luc constructs increased after estradiol treatment in MCF-7 cells, and this could be inhibited by the anti-estrogen fulvestrant. Co-transfection with the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) also enhanced CerS2, CerS4 and CerS6 promoter activity whereas CerS5 promoter activity was inhibited in both cell lines. Promoter deletion and mutation constructs from CerS4 and CerS5 promoters revealed that estradiol and GPER1 mediate their effects on both promoters by activating AP-1, most likely through dimerization of c-Jun and c-Fos. At least we could show, that cell proliferation induced by estradiol could be blocked by co-treatment with Fumonisin B1, indicating that upregulation of CerS in breast cancer cells by estrogen is important for cell proliferation and possibly tumor development. In conclusion, our data highlight transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms regulating CerS expression in human cells which provide the basis for further studies investigating the regulation of CerS expression and ceramide synthesis after diverse stimuli in physiological and pathophysiological processess."

So far, only a few NAC genes have been identified to mediate cell death. In this study, we identified a novel NAC gene from canola (Brassica napus L.), BnaNAC103 which induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and cell death in Nicotianabenthamiana leaves. We found that BnaNAC103 responded to multiple signalings, including cold, salicylic acid (SA) and a fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. BnaNAC103 is located in the nucleus. Expression of full-length BnaNAC103, but not either the N-terminal NAC domain or C-terminal regulatory domain, was identified to induce hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death when expressed in N. benthamiana. The cell death triggered by BnaNAC103 is preceded by accumulation of ROS, with diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining supporting this. Moreover, quantification of ion leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) of leaf discs indicates significant cell membrane breakage and lipid peroxidation induced by BnaNAC103 expression.

Some plant-derived lignans are established in cancer therapy, e.g. the semisynthetic epipodophyllotoxins etoposide and teniposide. Their activity is, unfortunately, hampered by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein. Here, we investigated the bisphenolic honokiol derived from Magnolia officinalis. P-glycoprotein-overexpressing CEM/ADR5000 cells were not cross-resistant to honokiol, but MDA-MB-231 BRCP cells transfected with another ABC-transporter, BCRP, revealed 3-fold resistance. Further drug resistance mechanisms analyzed study was the tumor suppressor TP53 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). HCT116 p53(-/-) did not reveal resistance to honokiol, and EGFR-transfected U87.MG EGFR cells were collateral sensitive compared to wild-type cells (degree of resistance: 0.34). To gain insight into possible modes of collateral sensitivity, we performed in silico molecular docking studies of honokiol to EGFR and EGFR-related downstream signal proteins. Honokiol bound with comparable binding energies to EGFR (-7.30 ± 0.01 kcal/mol) as the control drugs erlotinib (-7.50 ± 0.30 kcal/mol) and gefitinib (-8.30 ± 0.10 kcal/mol). Similar binding affinities of AKT, MEK1, MEK2, STAT3 and mTOR were calculated for honokiol (range from -9.0 ± 0.01 to 7.40 ± 0.01 kcal/mol) compared to corresponding control inhibitor compounds for these signal transducers. This indicates that collateral sensitivity of EGFR-transfectant cells towards honokiol may be due to binding to EGFR and downstream signal transducers.

Physiological analyses indicated that transgenic lines had higher plant survival rates, seed germination rates, and leaf proline content and lower water loss rates (WLR) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. MaASR-overexpressing lines also showed smaller leaves and reduced sensitivity to ABA. Further, microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation-based sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis revealed that MaASR participates in regulating photosynthesis, respiration, carbohydrate and phytohormone metabolism, and signal transduction to confer plants with enhanced drought stress tolerance. Direct interactions of MaASR with promoters for the hexose transporter and Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) genes were confirmed by electrophoresis mobility shift array (EMSA) analysis.

The traditional Chinese formula Salvia-Nelumbinis naturalis (SNN) is effectively applied to improve the symptoms of nonalcoholic simple fatty liver (NAFL) patients. Previous studies have confirmed that SNN could reduce the liver lipid deposition and serum transaminases of NAFL experimental models. This study aims to determine whether SNN is effective for murine NASH model and investigate the underlying pharmacological mechanisms.METHODS: C57BL/6 J mice were fed with methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for six weeks to induce NASH. Simultaneously, SNN or saline was intragastrically administered daily to the mice in the SNN or model group, respectively. A standard diet was given to the control mice. Serum biochemical indices and tumor necrosis factor-α were measured. Liver histopathology was observed, and the contents of triglycerides and lipid peroxide malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver homogenates were evaluated. The hepatic expression and/or activation of genes associated with inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress were determined by quantitative RT-PCR or Western blot analysis.RESULTS: The prominent liver steatosis displayed in the NASH model was prevented by SNN. The liver injury of NASH mice was obviously manifested by the increased levels of serum transaminases and bilirubin, as well as the lobular inflammation, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, and upregulated apoptosis in liver tissues. SNN administration improved the aforementioned pathological changes. The increased hepatic levels of MDA and cytochrome P450 2E1 of the model confirmed the unregulated balance of oxidative stress. The hepatic expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and its target genes decreased, whereas c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation in the model mice increased. Treating the mice with SNN significantly improved oxidative stress-related harmful factors.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that SNN can protect the liver from severe steatosis and damage induced by MCD diet, which suggests the potential use of SNN on the treatment of NASH patient. The results also indicate that improving the hepatic antioxidant capability of the liver may contribute to the underlying hepatoprotective mechanism."

Knockdown of ATF-3 expression in MDA-MB231 cells also decreased cell migration, and the expression levels of invasive and metastatic genes such as MMP-13 and Runx2 were found to be decreased in these cells.

ABT-737 alone had no effect on apoptosis, but cafestol markedly enhanced ABT-737-mediated apoptosis in Mcl-1-overexpressed Caki cells, human glioma U251MG cells, and human breast carcinoma MDA-MB231 cells. By contrast, co-treatment with ABT-737 and cafestol did not induce apoptosis in normal human skin fibroblast. Furthermore, combined treatment with cafestol and ABT-737 markedly reduced tumor growth compared with either drug alone in xenograft models. We found that cafestol inhibited Mcl-1 protein expression, which is important for ABT-737 resistance, through promotion of protein degradation. Moreover, cafestol increased Bim expression, and siRNA-mediated suppression of Bim expression reduced the apoptosis induced by cafestol plus ABT-737.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) stimulates PTHrP production in part through the transcription factor Gli2, which is regulated independent of the Hedgehog signaling pathway in osteolytic cancer cells. However, inhibition of TGF-β in vivo does not fully inhibit tumor growth in bone or tumor-induced bone destruction, suggesting other pathways are involved. While Wnt signaling regulates Gli2 in development, the role of Wnt signaling in bone metastasis is unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether Wnt signaling regulates Gli2 expression in tumor cells that induce bone destruction. We report here that Wnt activation by β-catenin/T cell factor 4 (TCF4) over-expression or lithium chloride (LiCl) treatment increased Gli2 and PTHrP expression in osteolytic cancer cells. This was mediated through the TCF and Smad binding sites within the Gli2 promoter as determined by promoter mutation studies, suggesting cross-talk between TGF-β and Wnt signaling. Culture of tumor cells on substrates with bone-like rigidity increased Gli2 and PTHrP production, enhanced autocrine Wnt activity and led to an increase in the TCF/Wnt signaling reporter (TOPFlash), enriched β-catenin nuclear accumulation, and elevated Wnt-related genes by PCR-array. Stromal cells serve as an additional paracrine source of Wnt ligands and enhanced Gli2 and PTHrP mRNA levels in MDA-MB-231 and RWGT2 cells in vitro and promoted tumor-induced bone destruction in vivo in a β-catenin/Wnt3a-dependent mechanism. These data indicate that a combination of matrix rigidity and stromal-secreted factors stimulate Gli2 and PTHrP through Wnt signaling in osteolytic breast cancer cells, and there is significant cross-talk between the Wnt and TGF-β signaling pathways. This suggests that the Wnt signaling pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting tumor cell response to the bone microenvironment and at the very least should be considered in clinical regimens targeting TGF-β signaling."

Next, we detected expression of miR-99a in the SP cells compared to non-SP cells using real-time PCR, and explored effects of miR-99a on the CSC phenotype of the breast cancer cells, including sphere formation, self-renewal, tumourigenicity and cell migratory capability.RESULTS: We found that expression of miR-99a was down-regulated in the SP cells compared to non-SP cells. Restoration of expression of miR-99a inhibited cell migration and invasion, reduced sphere formation of breast SP cells in vitro, and suppressed tumour growth in vivo.

Further, quantitative RT-PCR and western blot assays identified that overexpression of miR-99a suppressed expression of mTOR and its downstream gene, HIF-1α.CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data suggest that miR-99a reversed the breast cancer malignant CSC phenotype, probably by targeting the mTOR signalling pathway."

In this study, we aimed to explore the function of GINS2 in BC. The association between GINS2 transcript level and the clinical outcome of BC patients were estimated using Kaplan-Meier plots, multivariate cox regression analysis, forest plots, and receiver operating characteristics curves. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore the mechanisms underlying the effects of the GINS2 transcript. High GINS2 transcript level was correlated with poor relapse free survival (log-rank P ≤ 0.001 in six cohorts; forest plot: total n = 1,420, total RR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.45-2.03; multivariate cox regression analysis: n = 906, HR 2.36, 95% CI 1.88-2.97), and distant metastasis free survival (log-rank P &lt; 0.01 in 3 cohorts; forest plot: total n = 691, total RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.36-2.67; multivariate cox regression analysis: n = 442, HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.70-3.47). BC patients with higher GINS2 transcript levels showed poorer tamoxifen efficacy in a dose-dependent manner. GINS2 expression was significantly downregulated under mutated p53-depleted condition in MDA-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells, upregulated in mammary cancer stem cells (MaCSCs) (P = 0.003), and correlated with upregulated genes in mammary stem cells (GSEA: P &lt; 0.01). Our study, for the first time, demonstrates that GINS2 is an independent prognostic marker and is associated with lung metastasis, histological grade, and endocrine therapy resistance in BC patients, which may attribute to mutant p53 and MaCSCs."

Nevertheless, its biological function in breast cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that the expression level of miR-874 is down-regulated in breast cancer in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues. The overexpression of miR-874 is able to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Using a bioinformatics method, we further show that CDK9 is a direct target of miR-874 and that its protein level is negatively regulated by miR-874. Therefore, the data reported in this manuscript demonstrate that miR-874 is an important regulator in breast cancer and imply that the miR-874/CDK9 axis has potential as a therapeutic target for breast cancer."

They act as negative regulators of gene expression and play a pivotal role in regulating apoptosis and cell proliferation. Studies have shown that miRNAs interact with p53 by regulating the activity and function of p53 through direct repression or its regulators. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an evolutionary conserved check point protein kinase that plays a major effect in the control of cell division via protein synthesis regulation. mTOR regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation and inactivation of 4E-BP1 and through phosphorylation and activation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). These two downstream effectors of mTOR control cell growth and metabolism. In mammals, mTOR protein kinase is the central node in the nutrient and growth factor signaling and p53 plays a critical role in sensing genotoxic stress. Activation of p53 inhibits mTOR activity, which in turn regulates its downstream targets providing a cross talk among both the signaling machinery. MicroRNA-15 and 16 belong to a common precursor family and are highly conserved. Deletion or downregulation of these two microRNAs has been shown to accelerate cell division by modulating the expression of the genes involved in controlling cell cycle progression. These microRNAs may function as tumor suppressors and act on the downstream targets of p53 signaling pathway. To have a better insight of the role of miR-15/16 in regulating the cross talk of p53 and mTOR, we performed an in depth study in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by performing a gain-of-function analysis with lentiviral plasmids expressing microRNA-15 and 16.METHODS: The effect of individual microRNAs on RPS6KB1 was examined by using 3'-UTR clones via luciferase based assays. The cell cycle effects were observed by flow-cytometric analysis. Reverse transcription PCR was used to explore the expression of mTOR and RPS6KB1 in cells transfected with miR-15/16.RESULTS: Overexpression of miR-15/16 led to inhibition of cell proliferation causing G1 cell cycle arrest as well as caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. Forced expression of miR-15/16 might lead to decrease in mRNA level of RPS6KB1, mTOR. The effect was a complete reversal after treatment with anti-miRs against miR-15/16 proving the specificity of the expression. In addition, the dual luciferase reporter assays indicated a clear decrease in luciferase gene expression in cells transfected with lentiviral based miR-15 and 16 plasmids indicating that miR-15/16 directly targets RPS6KB1 through its 3'-UTR binding. Further, these microRNAs also inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) by targeting key proteins such as Twist1 and EZH2 clearly demonstrating its crucial role in controlling cell proliferation.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that exogenous microRNA-15/16 can target RPS6KB1, control cell proliferation and cause apoptosis in caspase-dependent manner even in the absence of functional p53."

Although P-REX1 is essentially undetectable in normal human mammary epithelial tissue, this Rac-GEF is markedly upregulated in human breast carcinomas, particularly of the luminal subtype. The mechanisms underlying P-REX1 upregulation in breast cancer are unknown. Toward the goal of dissecting the mechanistic basis of P-REX1 overexpression in breast cancer, in this study we focused on the analysis of methylation of the PREX1 gene promoter.METHODS: To determine the methylation status of the PREX1 promoter region, we used bisulfite genomic sequencing and pyrosequencing approaches. Re-expression studies in cell lines were carried out by treatment of breast cancer cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine. PREX1 gene methylation in different human breast cancer subtypes was analyzed from the TCGA database.RESULTS: We found that the human PREX1 gene promoter has a CpG island located between -1.2 kb and +1.4 kb, and that DNA methylation in this region inversely correlates with P-REX1 expression in human breast cancer cell lines. A comprehensive analysis of human breast cancer cell lines and tumors revealed significant hypomethylation of the PREX1 promoter in ER-positive, luminal subtype, whereas hypermethylation occurs in basal-like breast cancer. Treatment of normal MCF-10A or basal-like cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine in combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A restores P-REX1 levels to those observed in luminal breast cancer cell lines, suggesting that aberrant expression of P-REX1 in luminal breast cancer is a consequence of PREX1 promoter demethylation. Unlike PREX1, the pro-metastatic Rho/Rac-GEF, VAV3, is not regulated by methylation. Notably, PREX1 gene promoter hypomethylation is a prognostic marker of poor patient survival.CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified for the first time gene promoter hypomethylation as a distinctive subtype-specific mechanism for controlling the expression of a key regulator of Rac-mediated motility and metastasis in breast cancer."

The same trend was shown by the competition dialysis, change in fluorescence steady state intensity, stabilization against thermal denaturation, increase in the specific viscosity and perturbations in circular dichroism spectra. Among the polynucleotides, poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly(dG).poly(dC) showed positive cooperativity where as poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) and poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) showed non cooperative binding. Isothermal calorimetric data on the other hand showed enthalpy driven exothermic binding with a hydrophobic contribution to the binding Gibbs energy with poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC), and poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) where as harmalol with poly(dA).poly(dT) showed entropy driven endothermic binding and with poly(dG).poly(dC) it was reported to be entropy driven exothermic binding. The study also tested the in vitro chemotherapeutic potential of harmalol in HeLa, MDA-MB-231, A549, and HepG2 cell line by MTT assay.SIGNIFICANCE: Studies unequivocally established that harmalol binds strongly with hetero GC polymer by mechanism of intercalation where the alkaloid resists complete overlap to the DNA base pairs inside the intercalation cavity and showed maximum cytotoxicity on HepG2 with IC50 value of 14 µM. The results contribute to the understanding of binding, specificity, energetic, cytotoxicity and docking of harmalol-DNA complexation that will guide synthetic efforts of medicinal chemists for developing better therapeutic agents."

In addition, CS1 showed potential anti-multidrug resistance capabilities. kDNA decatenation, DNA relaxation and cleavage complex assays indicated that CS1 acted as a nonintercalating topoisomerase IIα (Topo IIα) inhibitor by stabilizing the DNA-Topo IIα cleavage complex. CS1 also induced DNA breaks in MDA-MB-231 cells evidenced by comet tails and the accumulation of γH2AX foci. The ability of CS1 in inducing DNA breaks mediated by Topo II resulted in G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis.

Current methodologies for the quantification of regional DNA methylation (i.e., the average methylation over a region of DNA in the genome) are largely affected by comprehensive DNA sequencing methodologies which tend to be expensive, tedious, and time-consuming for many applications. Herein, we report an alternative DNA methylation detection method referred to as &quot;Methylsorb&quot;, which is based on the inherent affinity of DNA bases to the gold surface (i.e., the trend of the affinity interactions is adenine &gt; cytosine ≥ guanine &gt; thymine).1 Since the degree of gold-DNA affinity interaction is highly sequence dependent, it provides a new capability to detect DNA methylation by simply monitoring the relative adsorption of bisulfite treated DNA sequences onto a gold chip. Because the selective physical adsorption of DNA fragments to gold enable a direct read-out of regional DNA methylation, the current requirement for DNA sequencing is obviated. To demonstrate the utility of this method, we present data on the regional methylation status of two CpG clusters located in the EN1 and MIR200B genes in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The methylation status of these regions was obtained from the change in relative mass on gold surface with respect to relative adsorption of an unmethylated DNA source and this was detected using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in a label-free and real-time manner. We anticipate that the simplicity of this method, combined with the high level of accuracy for identifying the methylation status of cytosines in DNA, could find broad application in biology and diagnostics."

Its selective modulation is thought to alter the cancer-specific gene regulatory networks. Pyrrole-imidazole polyamides (PIPs) are a class of small DNA binders that can be designed to target any destined DNA sequence. Herein, we report a sequence-specific pyrrole-imidazole polyamide, PIP1, which can target specific base pairs of the REL/ELK1 binding site in the EVI1 minimal promoter. The designed PIP1 significantly inhibited EVI1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Whole-transcriptome analysis confirmed that PIP1 affected a fraction of EVI1-mediated gene regulation. In vitro assays suggested that this polyamide can also effectively inhibit breast cancer cell migration. Taken together, these results suggest that EVI1-targeted PIP1 is an effective transcriptional regulator in cancer cells."

While the mechanisms driving its overexpression in tumorigenic processes are unknown, it is regulated by the AP-1 transcriptional complex in diverse situations. The AP-1 component Fra-1 being overexpressed in aggressive breast cancers, we have addressed its role in the overexpression of Plau in the highly metastatic breast cancer model cell line MDA-MB231 using ChIP, pharmacological and RNAi approaches. Plau transcription appears controlled by 2 AP-1 enhancers located -1.9 (ABR-1.9) and -4.1 kb (ABR-4.1) upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of the uPA-coding mRNA, Plau-001, that bind Fra-1. Surprisingly, RNA Pol II is not recruited only at the Plau-001 TSS but also upstream in the ABR-1.9 and ABR-4.1 region. Most Pol II molecules transcribe short and unstable RNAs while tracking down toward the TSS, where there are converted into Plau-001 mRNA-productive species. Moreover, a minority of Pol II molecules transcribes a low abundance mRNA of unknown function called Plau-004 from the ABR-1.9 domain, whose expression is tempered by Fra-1. Thus, we unveil a heretofore-unsuspected transcriptional complexity at Plau in a reference metastatic breast cancer cell line with pleiotropic effects for Fra-1, providing novel information on AP-1 transcriptional action."

CaPeptide induction combined with treatment of sublethal doses of cisplatin resulted in a marked increase in death of the cisplatin-resistant MDA-MB-231 cell line.

Selective degeneration of A9 neurons occurs in Parkinson's disease (PD) while abnormal function of A10 cells has been linked to schizophrenia, attention deficit and addiction. The molecular basis that underlies selective vulnerability of A9 and A10 neurons is presently unknown.RESULTS: By taking advantage of transgenic labeling, laser capture microdissection coupled to nano Cap-Analysis of Gene Expression (nanoCAGE) technology on isolated A9 and A10 cells, we found that a subset of Olfactory Receptors (OR)s is expressed in mDA neurons. Gene expression analysis was integrated with the FANTOM5 Helicos CAGE sequencing datasets, showing the presence of these ORs in selected tissues and brain areas outside of the olfactory epithelium. OR expression in the mesencephalon was validated by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. By screening 16 potential ligands on 5 mDA ORs recombinantly expressed in an heterologous in vitro system, we identified carvone enantiomers as agonists at Olfr287 and able to evoke an intracellular Ca2+ increase in solitary mDA neurons. ORs were found expressed in human SN and down-regulated in PD post mortem brains.CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that mDA neurons express ORs and respond to odor-like molecules providing new opportunities for pharmacological intervention in disease."

To date, multiple extracellular stimuli and transcription factors have been shown to regulate EMT. Many of them are not druggable and therefore it is necessary to identify targets, which can be inhibited using small molecules to prevent metastasis. Recently, we identified the ganglioside GD2 as a novel breast cancer stem cell marker. Moreover, we found that GD3 synthase (GD3S)--an enzyme involved in GD2 biosynthesis--is critical for GD2 production and could serve as a potential druggable target for inhibiting tumor initiation and metastasis. Indeed, there is a small molecule known as triptolide that has been shown to inhibit GD3S function. Accordingly, in this manuscript, we demonstrate that the inhibition of GD3S using small hairpin RNA or triptolide compromises the initiation and maintenance of EMT instigated by various signaling pathways, including Snail, Twist and transforming growth factor-β1 as well as the mesenchymal characteristics of claudin-low breast cancer cell lines (SUM159 and MDA-MB-231). Moreover, GD3S is necessary for wound healing, migration, invasion and stem cell properties in vitro. Most importantly, inhibition of GD3S in vivo prevents metastasis in experimental as well as in spontaneous syngeneic wild-type mouse models. We also demonstrate that the transcription factor FOXC2, a central downstream effector of several EMT pathways, directly regulates GD3S expression by binding to its promoter. In clinical specimens, the expression of GD3S correlates with poor prognosis in triple-negative human breast tumors. Moreover, GD3S expression correlates with activation of the c-Met signaling pathway leading to increased stem cell properties and metastatic competence. Collectively, these findings suggest that the GD3S-c-Met axis could serve as an effective target for the treatment of metastatic breast cancers."

The resultant fusion protein was highly expressed by lactose induction in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) in a 7-l bioreactor and bound to a chitin affinity column. After washing the impurities, the Ssp DnaB intein mediated on-column self-cleavage was easily triggered by shifting pH and temperature to allow the native lunasin released.

Herein, we overexpressed and silenced Oct4 expression in two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and 4T1, separately. Our data showed that ectopic overexpression of Oct4 suppressed cell migration and invasion in vitro and the formation of metastatic lung nodules in vivo. Conversely, Oct4 downregulation increased the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we identified Rnd1 as the downstream target of Oct4 by ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, which was significantly downregulated upon Oct4 overexpression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed the binding of Oct4 to the promoter region of Rnd1 by ectopic overexpression of Oct4. Dual luciferase assays indicated that Oct4 overexpression suppressed transcriptional activity of the Rnd1 promoter. Moreover, overexpression of Rnd1 partially rescued the inhibitory effects of Oct4 on the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Overexpression of Rnd1 counteracted the influence of Oct4 on the formation of cell adhesion and lamellipodia, which implied a potential underlying mechanism involving Rnd1. In addition, we also found that overexpression of Oct4 led to an elevation of E-cadherin expression, even in 4T1 cells that possess a relatively high basal level of E-cadherin. Rnd1 overexpression impaired the promoting effects of Oct4 on E-cadherin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results suggest that Oct4 affects the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through Rnd1-mediated effects that influence cell motility and E-cadherin expression."

Long-range PCR (LR-PCR) represents the gold standard approach for PKD1 genetic analysis. However, a major issue with this approach is that it requires large quantities of genomic DNA (gDNA) material limiting its application primarily to DNA extracted from blood. In this study, we have developed a whole genome amplification (WGA)-based genotyping assay for PKD1 and PKD2, and examined whether this approach can be applied to biosamples with low DNA yield, including blood, buccal cells and urine. DNA samples were amplified by multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and a high-fidelity DNA polymerase followed by LR-PCR and exon-specific amplifications of PKD1 and PKD2 respectively, and Sanger sequencing. This method has generated large amounts of DNA with high average product length (&gt;10 kb), which were uniformly amplified across all sequences assessed. When compared to the gDNA direct sequencing method for six ADPKD samples, a total of 89 variants were detected including all 86 variations previously reported, in addition to three new variations, including one pathogenic mutation not previously detected by the standard gDNA-based analysis. We have further applied WGA to ADPKD mutation analysis of low DNA-yield specimens, successfully detecting all 63 gene variations. Compared to the gDNA method the WGA-based assay had a sensitivity and specificity of 100%.

The damage is also caused by direct ionization of biomolecules. The type of radiation injuries is dependent on the absorbed radiation dose. Sub-lethal IR dose produces more of DNA base damages, whereas higher doses produce more DNA single strand break (SSBs), and double strand breaks (DSBs). The Nrf2-ARE pathway is an important oxidative stress regulating pathway. The DNA DSBs repair regulated by MRN complex, immunomodulation and inflammation regulated by HMGB1 and various types of cytokines are some of the key pathways which interact with each other in a complex manner and modify the radiation response. Because the majority of radiation damage is via oxidative stress, it is essential to gain in depth understanding of the mechanisms of Nrf2-ARE pathway and understand its interactions with MRN complex, HMGB1 and cytokines to increase our understanding on the radiation responses. Such information is of tremendous help in development of medical radiation countermeasures, radioprotective drugs and therapeutics.

The selected aptamers were subjected to flow cytometry and laser confocal fluorescence microscopy to evaluate their binding affinity and selectivity. The aptamer LXL-1 with the highest abundance in the enriched library demonstrated a low K(d) value and excellent selectivity for the recognition of the metastatic breast cancer cells. Tissue imaging results showed that truncated aptamer sequence LXL-1-A was highly specific to the corresponding tumor tissue and displayed 76% detection rate against breast cancer tissue with metastasis in regional lymph nodes. Therefore, on the basis of its excellent targeting properties and functional versatility, LXL-1-A holds great potential to be used as a molecular imaging probe for the detection of breast cancer metastasis. Our result clearly demonstrates that metastatic-cell-based SELEX can be used to generate DNA ligands specifically recognizing metastatic cancer cells, which is of great significance for metastatic cancer diagnosis and treatment."

This limitation is usually overcome by the enrichment of such samples with whole genome amplification (WGA), mostly by multiple displacement amplification (MDA) based on φ29 polymerase. However, this technique can be biased by the GC content of the sample and is prone to the development of chimeras as well as contamination during enrichment, which contributes to undesired noise during sequence data analysis, and also hampers the proper functional and/or taxonomic assignments. An alternative to MDA is direct DNA sequencing (DS), which represents the theoretical gold standard in genome sequencing. In this work, we explore the possibility of sequencing the genome of Escherichia coli fs 24 from the minimum number of DNA molecules required for pyrosequencing, according to the notion of one-bead-one-molecule. Using an optimized protocol for DS, we constructed a shotgun library containing the minimum number of DNA molecules needed to fill a selected region of a picotiterplate. We gathered most of the reference genome extension with uniform coverage. We compared the DS method with MDA applied to the same amount of starting DNA. As expected, MDA yielded a sparse and biased read distribution, with a very high amount of unassigned and unspecific DNA amplifications. The optimized DS protocol allows unbiased sequencing to be performed from samples with a very small amount of DNA."

In this study, we identified a canine ortholog of the human mda-7/IL-24 gene located within a cluster of IL-10 family members on chromosome 7. The full-length mRNA sequence of canine mda-7 was determined, which encodes a 186-amino acid protein that has 66% similarity to human MDA-7/IL-24. Canine MDA-7 is constitutively expressed in cultured normal canine epidermal keratinocytes (NCEKs), and its expression levels are increased after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. In cultured NCEKs, the canine mda-7 pre-mRNA is differentially spliced, via exon skipping and alternate 5'-splice donor sites, to yield five splice variants (canine mda-7sv1, canine mda-7sv2, canine mda-7sv3, canine mda-7sv4 and canine mda-7sv5) that encode four protein isoforms of the canine MDA-7 protein. These protein isoforms have a conserved N-terminus (signal peptide sequence) and are dissimilar in amino acid sequences at their C-terminus. Canine MDA-7 is not expressed in primary canine tumor samples, and most tumor derived cancer cell lines tested, like its human counterpart. Unlike human MDA-7/IL-24, canine mda-7 mRNA is not expressed in unstimulated or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), concanavalin A (ConA) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Furthermore, in-silico analysis revealed that canonical canine MDA-7 has a potential 28 amino acid signal peptide sequence that can target it for active secretion. This data suggests that canine mda-7 is indeed an ortholog of human mda-7/IL-24, its protein product has high amino acid similarity to human MDA-7/IL-24 protein and it may possess similar biological properties to human MDA-7/IL-24, but its expression pattern is more restricted than its human ortholog."

SNS-032 is a potent and selective inhibitor of Cdk2, Cdk7 and Cdk9 and has emerged in clinical trials. Here, we examined the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells in the presence of SNS-032 and observed a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation in both cell lines. SNS-032 had a direct apoptosis-inducing effect through both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in breast cancer cells as shown by a dose-dependent increase in Annexin V-positive cells and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick?end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, as well as activation of caspase-8, -9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). At the molecular level, SNS-032 induced a marked dephosphorylation of serine 2 and 5 of RNA polymerase (RNA Pol) II and blocked RNA synthesis. Consistent with the inherently rapid turnover rates of their transcripts and proteins, the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) were rapidly reduced on exposure to SNS-032. Our results also indicated that SNS-032 suppressed the growth of breast cancer xenografts in mice. These data demonstrate that the use of SNS-032 may be a rational and novel therapeutic strategy for human breast cancer and warrants further clinical investigation."

This mutant exhibited spontaneous disease-like lesions in the absence of pathogen attack at the beginning of the tillering stage. Moreover, at the booting stage, lmes1 mutants exhibited a significantly increased MDA but decreased chlorophyll content, soluble protein content and photosynthetic rate in the leaves, which are indicative of an early senescence phenotype. The lmes1 mutant was significantly more resistant than 93-11 against rice bacterial blight infection, which was consistent with a marked increase in the expression of three resistance-related genes. Here, we employed a map-based cloning approach to finely map the lmes1 gene. In an initial mapping with 94 F2 individuals derived from a cross between the lmes1 mutant and Nipponbare, the lmes1 gene was located in a 10.6-cM region on the telomere of the long arm of chromosome 7 using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. To finely map lmes1, we derived two F2 populations with 940 individuals from two crosses between the lmes1 mutant and two japonica rice varieties, Nipponbare and 02428. Finally, the lmes1 gene was mapped to an 88-kb region between two newly developed inDel markers, Zl-3 and Zl-22, which harbored 15 ORFs."

The precursors of both lebecin subunits contain a 23-amino acid residue signal peptide and the mature α and β subunits are composed of 129 and 131 amino acids, respectively. Lebecin is shown to be a potent inhibitor of MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cells proliferation. Furthermore, lebecin dose-dependently inhibited the integrin-mediated attachment of these cells to different adhesion substrata. This novel C-type lectin also completely blocked MDA-MB231 cells migration towards fibronectin and fibrinogen in haptotaxis assays."

The rats in the model group were injected with the complete Freund's adjuvant plus homologous antigen of submandibular gland (0.2 mL mixture) into bilateral posterior paw metatarsus. The body mass, water intake, submandibular gland index, spleen index, and histological changes of the glands were observed 30 days after inflammation was induced.

Routine semen analysis was performed according to World Health Organization (WHO, 1999) guidelines. MDA levels of the seminal plasma and spermatozoa were measured by TBARS method. A long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used for the analysis of multiple large-scale mtDNA deletions based in two areas of mtDNA. The results showed that mean concentration of MDA in seminal plasma (nmol/ml) and spermatozoa (nmol/10 x 10(6) sperm) of AT men was higher than in normozoospermic patients, but the differences were not statistically significant. The products of PCR analysis showed multiple deletions of approximately 4.7, 4.8, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4-kb in mtDNA of the spermatozoa in both AT and control groups. Multiple deletions were also observed in 64% of AT patients and 44% of the control group. Moreover, MDA level of the spermatozoa in deleted mtDNA samples group was significantly higher than in non-deleted mtDNA group (p = 0.01).

A 151 nucleotide sequence found in the HIF1A 5'-UTR is sufficient for significant translational up-regulation. On the other hand, the 3'-UTR of HIF1A has been implicated in mRNA degradation. In the non-metastatic breast cancer cell line MCF7, the 3'-UTR-dependent down-regulatory machinery predominates over the 5'-UTR-dependent up-regulation of HIF1A. However, 5'-UTR-dependent up-regulation is dominant among metastatic cell lines (MDA-MB453, U87MG). It is therefore likely that the predominance of 5'-UTR-dependent translational enhancement of HIF1A is critical for the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. PTBP-1, but not HuR, is a candidate RNA binding protein for the translational control of HIF1A."

Instead of identifying targets, this paper proposed an innovative approach, namely impact significance analysis, to study the correlation between mature sequence, expression across patient samples or time and global function on cell cycle signaling of miRNAs. With three distinct types of data: The Cancer Genome Atlas miRNA expression data for 354 human breast cancer specimens, microarray of 266 miRNAs in mouse Embryonic Stem cells (ESCs), and Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) transfected by 776 miRNAs in MDA-MB-231 cell line, we linked the expression and function of miRNAs by their mature sequence and discovered systematically that the similarity of miRNA expression enhances the similarity of miRNA function, which indicates the miRNA expression can be used as a supplementary factor to predict miRNA function. The results also show that both seed region and 3' portion are associated with miRNA expression levels across human breast cancer specimens and in ESCs; miRNAs with similar seed tend to have similar 3' portion. And we discussed that the impact of 3' portion, including nucleotides 13-16, is not significant for miRNA function. These results provide novel insights to understand the correlation between miRNA sequence, expression and function. They can be applied to improve the prediction algorithm and the impact significance analysis can also be implemented to similar analysis for other small RNAs such as siRNAs."

Probes were labeled with (99m)Tc by ligand exchange. The radiochemical purity of these (99m)Tc-labeled probes was determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Cellular uptake, retention, binding specificity, and stability of the probes were studied either in vitro or in vivo. Biodistribution and radionuclide imaging were performed in BALB/c nude mice bearing SKOV3 (EGFR-positive) or MDA-MB-435S (EGFR-negative) carcinoma xenografts, respectively.RESULTS: The average labeling efficiencies of (99m)Tc-EGFR-PNA and (99m)Tc-CTL-PNA were 98.80% ± 1.14% and 98.63% ± 1.36% (mean ± SD, n = 6), respectively, within 6 h at room temperature, and the radiochemical purity of the probes was higher than 95%. (99m)Tc-EGFR-PNA was highly stable in normal saline and fresh human serum at 37°C in vitro and in urine and plasma samples of nude mice after 2-3 h of injection. Cellular uptake and retention ratios of (99m)Tc-EGFR-PNA in SKOV3 cells were higher than those of (99m)Tc-CTL-PNA and the EGFR-negative control. Meanwhile, EGFR mRNA binding (99m)Tc-EGFR-PNA was blocked with an excess of unlabeled EGFR-PNA in SKOV3 cell lines. The biodistribution study demonstrated accumulation of (99m)Tc-EGFR-PNA primarily in the SKOV3 xenografts and in EGFR-expressing organs. Radionuclide imaging demonstrated clear localization of (99m)Tc-EGFR-PNA in the SKOV3 xenografts shortly after injection but not in (99m)Tc-CTL-PNA and the EGFR-negative control.CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-EGFR-PNA has the potential for imaging EGFR mRNA overexpression in tumors."

The pGLV-EGFP-shRNA lentiviral vector was established by gene recombination technology and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The lentiviral vector and the packaging vector were used to cotransfect the HEK293T cells to obtain the lentivirus against LAMP2A mRNA, and the titer of the virus was determined. The constructed shRNA lentivirus was applied to infect human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, and then the cells were screened with puromycin for two weeks. The inhibitive efficacy of the shRNA on the LAMP2A protein was determined by Western blotting. After the breast cancer cell line with a low expression of LAMP2A was treated with three different concentrations of paclitaxel (1, 10, 100 nmol/L), MTT assay was performed to observe the difference in the proliferation ability between the control group and the low LAMP2A expression groups.RESULTS: DNA sequencing revealed that the recombinant lentiviral plasmid was correctly constructed with the virus titer reaching 2×10(8); TU/mL.

Recently attention has been paid to a potential role for SIPA1 in cancer metastasis; however, the underlying mechanism of how changes in SIPA1 levels may lead to increased metastasis remains poorly understood. In this study, we showed that SIPA1 was mainly localized to the nuclei in highly invasive breast cancer tumor tissue and MDA-MB-231 cells. Knockdown of SIPA1 in MDA-MB-231 altered cell morphology and cell proliferation ability. Furthermore, this study is the first to establish that nuclear SIPA1 can interact with the integrin β1 promoter and activate its transcription; this interaction appears to be important for SIPA1-dependent MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion and invasion. We also demonstrated that the phosphorylation of FAK, Akt and the expression of MMP9, downstream signaling molecules of integrin β1, were decreased upon SIPA1 knockdown, and MDA-MB-231 cell invasion was impaired. Taken together, these results suggest nuclear SIPA1 contributes to breast cancer cell invasion through the regulation of integrin β1 signaling."

Moreover, despite advances in antineoplastic therapies, induction of tumor cell death without off-target cytotoxicity remains a challenge. However, recent developments in localized radiotherapy and gene therapy have provided an opportunity to explore the potential for these strategies to be additive for the induction of cell death in tumor cells. Here, a novel adenoviral shuttle vector containing the proapoptotic gene Smac under the control of the ionizing radiation (IR)-induced Egr1 promoter was constructed. Following the transient transfection of the construct into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell lines, acute and abundant expression of Smac was observed in response to IR treatment. Further analysis confirmed that the induction of Smac expression resulted in a decrease in cell viability, a slower rate of cell growth, a higher level of apoptosis and altered cell cycle progression. Using a clonogenic assay, IR-induced Smac expression was also found to significantly sensitize Smac-expressing cells to radiation-induced cell death. Taken together, these data suggest that Smac expression driven by the Egr1 promoter has the potential to serve as a radiotherapy-dependent gene therapy agent."

In this study, we demonstrated the involvement of the GSTO1 gene from A. cerana cerana in the oxidative stress response and further investigated the effects of three cysteine residues of GSTO1 protein on this response. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed that AccGSTO1 was highly expressed in larvae and foragers, primarily in the midgut, epidermis, and flight muscles. The AccGSTO1 mRNA was significantly induced by cold and heat at 1 h and 3 h. The TBA (2-Thiobarbituric acid) method indicated that cold or heat resulted in MDA accumulation, but silencing of AccGSTO1 by RNAi in honeybees increased the concentration of MDA. RNAi also increased the temperature sensitivity of honeybees and markedly reduced their survival. Disc diffusion assay indicated that overexpression of AccGSTO1 in E. coli caused the resistance to long-term oxidative stress. Furthermore, AccGSTO1 was active in an in vitro DNA protection assay. Mutations in Cys-28, Cys-70, and Cys-124 affected the catalytic activity and antioxidant activity of AccGSTO1. The predicted three-dimensional structure of AccGSTO1 was also influenced by the replacement of these cysteine residues.

It has been shown to be involved in cell adhesion and motility which are critical functions for cancerous cells to disseminate. The present study aimed to examine the expression of CMG2 in breast cancer and its implication in the disease progression.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Breast primary tumours and background tissues were collected immediately after surgery and stored at -80 °C with approval by the local ethics committee, and written consent obtained from patients. The expression of CMG2 in 127 breast cancer tumour samples and 34 normal mammary tissues was determined using real-time PCR. Knockdown and over-expression in breast cancer cells were established using constructed plasmid vectors carrying either anti-CMG2 ribozyme or full-coding sequence of human CMG2. The effect on growth of breast cancer cells was examined using in vitro and in vivo models.RESULTS: The CMG2 transcript levels were reduced in advanced tumours compared with its expression in tumours of early stage according to their TNM staging. The reduced expression was associated with shorter overall survival, p = 0.004 compared with patients who had higher expression. The knockdown of CMG2 resulted in an increased in vitro growth of MDA-MB-231 cells which express this gene at relatively higher levels. This is consistent with the finding from MCF-7 cells which express lower levels of CMG2 and exhibited reduced growth following over-expression of CMG2. The over-expression of CMG2 also demonstrated an inhibitory effect on in vivo growth of MCF-7 cells.CONCLUSION: Reduced expression of CMG2 is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis of breast cancer. CMG2 has an inhibitory effect on growth of breast cancer cells. Further investigation is required to shed light on the prognostic and therapeutic potential of targeting this molecule."

Previously we have shown that IRF-1 transcriptionally induces CEACAM1 via an ISRE (Interferon-Stimulated Response Element) in its promoter. CEACAM1 pre-mRNA undergoes extensive alternative splicing (AS) generating isoforms to produce either a short (S) cytoplasmic domain expressed primarily in epithelial cells or as an ITIM-containing long (L) isoform in immune cells.METHODS: The transcriptional and molecular mechanism of CEACAM1 minigenes AS containing promoter ISREs mutations in the breast epithelial, MDA-MB-468, cell line was detected using flow cytometry. In addition, transcriptome sequencing was utilized to determine whether IRF-1 could direct the AS of other genes as well. Tumor xenografts were used to evaluate CEACAM1 isoform expression on the leading edge of breast tumor cells.RESULTS: In the present study, we provide evidence that CEACAM1's promoter and variable exon 7 cross-talk allowing IRF-1 to direct AS events. Transcriptome sequencing shows that IRF-1 can also induce the global AS of genes involved in regulation of growth and differentiation as well as genes of the cytokine family. Furthermore, MDA-MB-468 cells grown as tumor xenografts exhibit an AS switch to the L-isoform of CEACAM1, demonstrating that an in vivo inflammatory milieu is also capable of generating the AS switch, similar to that found in human breast cancers Mol Cancer 7:46, 2008.CONCLUSIONS: The novel AS regulatory activities attributed to IRF-1 indicate that the IFN-γ response involves a global change in both gene transcription and AS in breast epithelial cells."

However, the roles and regulation mechanisms of heparanase during breast cancer progression are still not fully understood. The aim of this study is to determine the differential regulation of heparanase gene expression in specific stages of breast cancer by DNA methylation. We detected levels of heparanase expression and DNA methylation patterns of its promoter in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435) and clinical tissues, respectively. It has been observed that heparanase is highly expressed in the invasive MDA-MB-435 cells with low methylation modification in the heparanase promoter. In contrast, lower expression of heparanase in MCF-7 cells is accompanied by higher methylation in the promoter. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a potent demethylating agent, results in induction of heparanase expression and higher invasion potential in vitro and leads to an advantage of tumor formation in vivo. In 54 tissue samples, cancer samples at late stages (stage IV) showed the highest heparanase expression accomplished by little DNA methylation. On the contrary, methylation prevalence is highest in normal tissue and inversely correlated with heparanase expression. A significant correlation between DNA methylation and clinical stage was demonstrated (p = 0.012). Collectively, these results demonstrate that DNA methylation play the regulation role in heparanase gene in different stages of breast cancer and present a direct effect on tumor progression."

The need for new clinical biomarkers in breast cancer is necessary to further predict prognosis and therapeutic response. In this article, the LC-MS histone H1 phosphorylation profiles were established for three distinct breast cancer cell lines. The results show that the extent of H1 phosphorylation can distinguish between the different cell lines. The histone H1 from the metastatic cell line, MDA-MB-231, was subjected to chemical derivitization and LC-MS/MS analysis. The results suggest that the phosphorylation at threonine 146 is found on both histone H1.2 and histone H1.4. Cell lines were then treated with an extracellular stimulus, estradiol or kinase inhibitor LY294002, to monitor changes in histone H1 phosphorylation. The data show that histone H1 phosphorylation can increase and decrease in response to extracellular stimuli. Finally, primary breast tissues were stained for the histone H1 phosphorylation at threonine 146. Variable staining patterns across tumor grades and subtypes were observed with pT146 labeling correlating with tumor grade. These results establish the potential for histone H1 phosphorylation at threonine 146 as a clinical biomarker in breast cancer."

The aim of the present work was to examine the presence of WNT mutations in a population of women with Müllerian duct abnormalities (MDA) in order to elucidate whether mutations in WNT9B are causative for MDA in Chinese women. Initially, 191 Chinese MDA patients and 192 healthy individuals (controls) were recruited. All coding regions were amplified by PCR and sequenced to search for variants. To verify the initial results, the numbers of patients and ethnic-matched controls were expanded to 542 and 563, respectively. One known single-nucleotide polymorphism and four novel variants were identified in the first stage: two were synonymous; the other two were rare nonsynonymous novel variants (c.566G&gt;A (p.Arg189Gln) and c.773G&gt;A (p.Arg258His)). None of the four novel variants was found in controls. In the second stage, both novel nonsynonymous variants were detected in MDA cases and controls. The results indicate that mutations in the coding sequence of WNT9B are not responsible for MDA in the Chinese population."

Starting from a screening approach, we have identified and characterized an unexplored biological molecule with immunomodulatory characteristics which augments the efficacy of an MVA-based immunotherapeutic agent. The immune modulator consists of the purified dsRNA genome isolated from a commercially used yeast strain, NAB2, mixed with a cationic lipid, Lipofectin. NAB2-Lipofectin stimulates the immune system via TLR3 and MDA-5. When it was injected at the MVA vaccination site, the immune modulator increased survival in a preclinical tumor model. We could demonstrate that NAB2-Lipofectin augments the MVA-induced infiltration of natural killer and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We suggest indirect mechanisms of activation of these cell types by the influence of NAB2-Lipofectin on innate and adaptive immunity.

The aim was to evaluate the adaptability of bone metastasis to microenvironmental stimuli through Endothelin-1-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), or the reverse process MET, and through osteomimicry possible key features for bone colonization. We compared low (MCF-7) and high (MDA-MB231) invasive-breast carcinoma cells, and 1833-bone metastatic clone, with human pair-matched primary breast-carcinomas and bone metastases. Parental MDA-MB231 and the derived 1833-clone responded oppositely to the stimuli. In 1833 cells, TGF-β and hypoxia increased Endothelin-1 release, altogether reducing invasiveness important for engraftment, while Endothelin-1 enhanced MDA-MB231 cell invasiveness. The Endothelin-1-autocrine loop contributed to the cooperation of intracellular-signaling pathways and extracellular stimuli triggering MET in 1833 cells, and EMT in MDA-MB231 cells. Only in 1833 cells, HGF negatively influenced transactivation and release of Endothelin-1, suggesting a temporal sequence of these stimuli with an initial role of HGF-triggered Wnt/β-catenin pathway in metastatization. Then, Endothelin-1/ETAR conferred MET and osteomimetic phenotypes, with Runt-related transcription factor 2 activation and metalloproteinase 9 expression, contributing to colonization and osteolysis. Findings with human pair-matched primary ductal carcinomas and bone metastases gave a translational significance to the molecular study. Endothelin-1, ETAR and ETBR correlated with the acquisition of malignant potential, because of high expression already in the in situ carcinoma. These molecular markers might be used as predictive index of aggressive behavior and invasive/metastatic phenotype."

However, single-cell assembly projects are challenging due to (i) the highly nonuniform read coverage and (ii) a greatly elevated number of chimeric reads and read pairs. While recently developed single-cell assemblers have addressed the former challenge, methods for assembling highly chimeric reads remain poorly explored. We present algorithms for identifying chimeric edges and resolving complex bulges in de Bruijn graphs, which significantly improve single-cell assemblies. We further describe applications of the single-cell assembler SPAdes to a new approach for capturing and sequencing &quot;microbial dark matter&quot; that forms small pools of randomly selected single cells (called a mini-metagenome) and further sequences all genomes from the mini-metagenome at once. On single-cell bacterial datasets, SPAdes improves on the recently developed E+V-SC and IDBA-UD assemblers specifically designed for single-cell sequencing. For standard (cultivated monostrain) datasets, SPAdes also improves on A5, ABySS, CLC, EULER-SR, Ray, SOAPdenovo, and Velvet. Thus, recently developed single-cell assemblers not only enable single-cell sequencing, but also improve on conventional assemblers on their own turf.

Mediator and pol II function within the pre-initiation complex (PIC), which consists of Mediator, pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH and is approximately 4.0 MDa in size. Mediator serves as a central scaffold within the PIC and helps regulate pol II activity in ways that remain poorly understood. Mediator is also generally targeted by sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) that work to control gene expression programs in response to developmental or environmental cues. At a basic level, Mediator functions by relaying signals from TFs directly to the pol II enzyme, thereby facilitating TF-dependent regulation of gene expression. Thus, Mediator is essential for converting biological inputs (communicated by TFs) to physiological responses (via changes in gene expression). In this review, we summarize an expansive body of research on the Mediator complex, with an emphasis on yeast and mammalian complexes. We focus on the basics that underlie Mediator function, such as its structure and subunit composition, and describe its broad regulatory influence on gene expression, ranging from chromatin architecture to transcription initiation and elongation, to mRNA processing. We also describe factors that influence Mediator structure and activity, including TFs, non-coding RNAs and the CDK8 module."

Chlamydia trachomatis is responsible for sexually transmitted infections and the blinding disease trachoma, which affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Recombination is widespread within the genome of C. trachomatis, thus whole-genome sequencing is necessary to understand the evolution, diversity, and epidemiology of this pathogen. Culture of C. trachomatis has, until now, been a prerequisite to obtain DNA for whole-genome sequencing; however, as C. trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen, this procedure is technically demanding and time consuming. Discarded clinical samples represent a large resource for sequencing the genomes of pathogens, yet clinical swabs frequently contain very low levels of C. trachomatis DNA and large amounts of contaminating microbial and human DNA. To determine whether it is possible to obtain whole-genome sequences from bacteria without the need for culture, we have devised an approach that combines immunomagnetic separation (IMS) for targeted bacterial enrichment with multiple displacement amplification (MDA) for whole-genome amplification. Using IMS-MDA in conjunction with high-throughput multiplexed Illumina sequencing, we have produced the first whole bacterial genome sequences direct from clinical samples. We also show that this method can be used to generate genome data from nonviable archived samples. This method will prove a useful tool in answering questions relating to the biology of many difficult-to-culture or fastidious bacteria of clinical concern."

TM6 was detected in a biofilm from a sink drain within a hospital restroom by analyzing cells using a highly automated single-cell genomics platform. We developed an approach for increasing throughput and effectively improving the likelihood of sampling rare events based on forming small random pools of single-flow-sorted cells, amplifying their DNA by multiple displacement amplification and sequencing all cells in the pool, creating a &quot;mini-metagenome.&quot; A recently developed single-cell assembler, SPAdes, in combination with contig binning methods, allowed the reconstruction of genomes from these mini-metagenomes. A total of 1.07 Mb was recovered in seven contigs for this member of TM6 (JCVI TM6SC1), estimated to represent 90% of its genome. High nucleotide identity between a total of three TM6 genome drafts generated from pools that were independently captured, amplified, and assembled provided strong confirmation of a correct genomic sequence. TM6 is likely a Gram-negative organism and possibly a symbiont of an unknown host (nonfree living) in part based on its small genome, low-GC content, and lack of biosynthesis pathways for most amino acids and vitamins. Phylogenomic analysis of conserved single-copy genes confirms that TM6SC1 is a deeply branching phylum."

Currently, most of the EpCAM-based diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies rely on the anti-EpCAM antibody. However, the use of EpCAM antibody is restricted due to its large size and instability. In this study, we have successfully identified DNA aptamers that selectively bind human recombinant EpCAM protein. The aptamers can specifically recognize a number of live human cancer cells derived from breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers that express EpCAM but not bind to EpCAM-negative cells. Among the aptamer sequences identified, a hairpin-structured sequence SYL3 was optimized in length, resulting in aptamer sequence SYL3C. The Kd values of the SYL3C aptamer against breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and gastric cancer cell line Kato III were found to be 38 ± 9 and 67 ± 8 nM, respectively, which are better than that of the full-length SYL3 aptamer. Flow cytometry analysis results indicated that the SYL3C aptamer was able to recognize target cancer cells from mixed cells in cell media. When used to capture cancer cells, up to 63% cancer cell capture efficiency was achieved with about 80% purity. With the advantages of small size, easy synthesis, good stability, high binding affinity, and selectivity, the DNA aptamers reported here against cancer biomarker EpCAM will facilitate the development of novel targeted cancer therapy, cancer cell imaging, and circulating tumor cell detection."

In breast cancer cell systems, miR-31 has been shown to inhibit cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Here, we link enhanced expression of miR-31 to the inhibition of the oncogenic NF-κB pathway, thus supporting the tumor-suppressive function of this microRNA. We identified protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε encoded by the PRKCE gene) as a novel direct target of miR-31 and show that down-regulation of PKCε results in impaired NF-κB signaling, enhanced apoptosis, and increased sensitivity of MCF10A breast epithelial and MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells toward ionizing radiation as well as treatment with chemotherapeutics. Mechanistically, we attribute this sensitization to anti-cancer treatments to the PRKCE-mediated down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic factor BCL2. In clinical breast cancer samples, high BCL2 expression was associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, we found an inverse correlation between miR-31 and BCL2 expression, highlighting the functional relevance of the indirect down-regulation of BCL2 via direct targeting of PRKCE by miR-31."

This is largely due to our inability to culture most microorganisms in isolation, which is a prerequisite for traditional genome sequencing. Single-cell sequencing has allowed researchers to circumvent this limitation. DNA is amplified directly from a single cell using the whole-genome amplification technique of multiple displacement amplification (MDA). However, MDA from a single chromosome copy suffers from amplification bias and a large loss of specificity from even very small amounts of DNA contamination, which makes assembling a genome difficult and completely finishing a genome impossible except in extraordinary circumstances. Gel microdrop cultivation allows culturing of a diverse microbial community and provides hundreds to thousands of genetically identical cells as input for an MDA reaction. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by comparing sequencing results of gel microdroplets and single cells following MDA. Bias is reduced in the MDA reaction and genome sequencing, and assembly is greatly improved when using gel microdroplets. We acquired multiple near-complete genomes for two bacterial species from human oral and stool microbiome samples. A significant amount of genome diversity, including single nucleotide polymorphisms and genome recombination, is discovered.

The intrinsically disordered D-box, linker and tail elements, together with a structured zinc-binding domain, bind distinct regions of APC/C(CDH1) to synergistically both block the substrate-binding site and inhibit ubiquitin-chain elongation.

In this study, we present a single-cell genome sequencing approach to address these limitations and demonstrate it by specifically targeting bacterial cells within a complex biofilm from a hospital bathroom sink drain. A newly developed, automated platform was used to generate genomic DNA by the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) technique from hundreds of single cells in parallel. MDA reactions were screened and classified by 16S rRNA gene PCR sequence, which revealed a broad range of bacteria covering 25 different genera representing environmental species, human commensals, and opportunistic human pathogens.

The soybean isoflavone, genistein (GE), has been shown to prevent and inhibit breast cancer and recent studies have suggested that GE can enhance the anticancer capacity of an estrogen antagonist, tamoxifen (TAM), especially in ERα-positive breast cancer cells. However, the role of GE in ERα-negative breast cancer remains unknown.METHODS: We have evaluated the in vitro and in vivo epigenetic effects of GE on ERα reactivation by using MTT assay, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, western-blot assay, immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, immunohistochemistry and epigenetic enzymatic activity analysis. Preclinical mouse models including xenograft and spontaneous breast cancer mouse models were used to test the efficacy of GE in vivo.RESULTS: We found that GE can reactivate ERα expression and this effect was synergistically enhanced when combined with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. GE treatment also re-sensitized ERα-dependent cellular responses to activator 17β-estradiol (E2) and antagonist TAM. Further studies revealed that GE can lead to remodeling of the chromatin structure in the ERα promoter thereby contributing to ERα reactivation. Consistently, dietary GE significantly prevented cancer development and reduced the growth of ERα-negative mouse breast tumors. Dietary GE further enhanced TAM-induced anti-cancer efficacy due at least in part to epigenetic ERα reactivation.CONCLUSIONS: Our studies suggest that soybean genistein can epigenetically restore ERα expression, which in turn increases TAM-dependent anti-estrogen therapeutic sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. The results from our studies reveal a novel therapeutic combination approach using bioactive soybean product and anti-hormone therapy in refractory ERα-negative breast cancer which will provide more effective options in breast cancer therapy."

Exosomes have been found to contain various RNA species including miRNA, mRNA and long non-protein coding RNAs. A number of cancer cells produce elevated levels of exosomes. Because exosomes have been isolated from most body fluids they may provide a source for non-invasive cancer diagnostics. Transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies (RNA-Seq) offers enormous amount of data that can be used for biomarkers discovery, however, in case of exosomes this approach was applied only for the analysis of small RNAs. In this study, we utilized RNA-Seq technology to analyze RNAs present in microvesicles secreted by human breast cancer cell lines. Exosomes were isolated from the media conditioned by two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436. Exosomal RNA was profiled using the Ion Torrent semiconductor chip-based technology. Exosomes were found to contain various classes of RNA with the major class represented by fragmented ribosomal RNA (rRNA), in particular 28S and 18S rRNA subunits. Analysis of exosomal RNA content revealed that it reflects RNA content of the donor cells. Although exosomes produced by the two cancer cell lines shared most of the RNA species, there was a number of non-coding transcripts unique to MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells. This suggests that RNA analysis might distinguish exosomes produced by low metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-436) from that produced by highly metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). The analysis of gene ontologies (GOs) associated with the most abundant transcripts present in exosomes revealed significant enrichment in genes encoding proteins involved in translation and rRNA and ncRNA processing. These GO terms indicate most expressed genes for both, cellular and exosomal RNA. For the first time, using RNA-seq, we examined the transcriptomes of exosomes secreted by human breast cancer cells. We found that most abundant exosomal RNA species are the fragments of 28S and 18S rRNA subunits. This limits the number of reads from other RNAs. To increase the number of detectable transcripts and improve the accuracy of their expression level the protocols allowing depletion of fragmented rRNA should be utilized in the future RNA-seq analyses on exosomes. Present data revealed that exosomal transcripts are representative of their cells of origin and thus could form basis for detection of tumor specific markers."

In contrast, this manuscript explores an alternative encapsulation strategy based on high-specificity avidity between a small molecule drug and its cognate protein target fused to the corona of protein polymer nanoparticles. With the new strategy, the drug associates tightly to the carrier and releases slowly, which may decrease toxicity and promote tumor accumulation via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. To test this hypothesis, the drug Rapamycin (Rapa) was selected for its potent anti-proliferative properties, which give it immunosuppressant and anti-tumor activity. Despite its potency, Rapa has low solubility, low oral bioavailability, and rapid systemic clearance, which make it an excellent candidate for nanoparticulate drug delivery. To explore this approach, genetically engineered diblock copolymers were constructed from elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) that assemble small (&lt;100nm) nanoparticles. ELPs are protein polymers of the sequence (Val-Pro-Gly-Xaa-Gly)n, where the identity of Xaa and n determine their assembly properties. Initially, a screening assay for model drug encapsulation in ELP nanoparticles was developed, which showed that Rose Bengal and Rapa have high non-specific encapsulation in the core of ELP nanoparticles with a sequence where Xaa=Ile or Phe. While excellent at entrapping these drugs, their release was relatively fast (2.2h half-life) compared to their intended mean residence time in the human body. Having determined that Rapa can be non-specifically entrapped in the core of ELP nanoparticles, FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP), which is the cognate protein target of Rapa, was genetically fused to the surface of these nanoparticles (FSI) to enhance their avidity towards Rapa. The fusion of FKBP to these nanoparticles slowed the terminal half-life of drug release to 57.8h. To determine if this class of drug carriers has potential applications in vivo, FSI/Rapa was administered to mice carrying a human breast cancer model (MDA-MB-468). Compared to free drug, FSI encapsulation significantly decreased gross toxicity and enhanced the anti-cancer activity. In conclusion, protein polymer nanoparticles decorated with the cognate receptor of a high potency, low solubility drug (Rapa) efficiently improved drug loading capacity and its release. This approach has applications to the delivery of Rapa and its analogs; furthermore, this strategy has broader applications in the encapsulation, targeting, and release of other potent small molecules."

Unlike Bcl-2, Mcl-1 is not antagonized by ABT-263 or ABT-737 and is considered to be a major factor in resistance. Also, Mcl-1 exhibits differential regulation when compared with other Bcl-2 family members and is a target for anticancer drug discovery. Here, we demonstrate that BAG3, an Hsp70 co-chaperone, protects Mcl-1 from proteasomal degradation, thereby promoting its antiapoptotic activity. Using neuroblastoma cell lines, with a defined Bcl-2 family dependence, we found that BAG3 expression correlated with Mcl-1 dependence and ABT-737 resistance. RNA silencing of BAG3 led to a marked reduction in Mcl-1 protein levels and overcame ABT-737 resistance in Mcl-1-dependent cells. In ABT-737-resistant cells, Mcl-1 co-immunoprecipitated with BAG3, and loss of Mcl-1 after BAG3 silencing was prevented by proteasome inhibition. BAG3 and Mcl-1 were co-expressed in a panel of diverse cancer cell lines resistant to ABT-737. Silencing BAG3 reduced Mcl-1 protein levels and overcame ABT-737 resistance in several of the cell lines, including triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB231) and androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer (PC3) cells. These studies identify BAG3-mediated Mcl-1 stabilization as a potential target for cancer drug discovery."

Here low serum and high LATS1 activity are found to enhance the levels of the 130-kDa isoform of angiomotin (Amot130) through phosphorylation by LATS1/2 at serine 175, which then forms a binding site for 14-3-3. Such phosphorylation, in turn, enables the ubiquitin ligase atrophin-1 interacting protein (AIP)4 to bind, ubiquitinate, and stabilize Amot130. Consistently, the Amot130 (S175A) mutant, which lacks LATS phosphorylation, bound AIP4 poorly under all conditions and showed reduced stability. Amot130 and AIP4 also promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of YAP in response to serum starvation, unlike Amot130 (S175A). Moreover, silencing Amot130 expression blocked LATS1 from inhibiting the expression of connective tissue growth factor, a YAP-regulated gene. Concordant with phosphorylated Amot130 specifically mediating these effects, wild-type Amot130 selectively induced YAP phosphorylation and reduced transcription of connective tissue growth factor in an AIP4-dependent manner versus Amot130 (S175A). Further, Amot130 but not Amot130 (S175A) strongly inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. The dominant-negative effects of Amot130 (S175A) on YAP signaling also support that phosphorylated Amot130 transduces Hippo signaling. Likewise, Amot130 expression provoked premature growth arrest during mammary cell acini formation, whereas Amot130 (S175A)-expressing cells formed enlarged and poorly differentiated acini. Taken together, the phosphorylation of Amot130 by LATS is found to be a key feature that enables it to inhibit YAP-dependent signaling and cell growth."

It is well known that Mcl-1 pre-mRNA undergoes alternative splicing events to produce two functionally distinct proteins, Mcl-1(S) (pro-apoptotic) and Mcl-l(L) (anti-apoptotic); the latter isoform is predominant in different cancers including breast and ovarian cancer cells. In the present study we report that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) and proto-oncogene SRSF1 (serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 1) influences splicing of Mcl-1 in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and JAR choriocarcinoma cells; we also show for the first time that another RBP SRSF5 affects splicing of Mcl-1 in the MCF-7 cells. Moreover, we report that SRSF1 is involved in other aspects of Mcl-1 regulation with knockdown of SRSF1, by RNAi, resulting in a significant decrease in Mcl-1 protein levels in MCF-7 cells but an increase in JAR cells, respectively, by potentially affecting protein stability and translation of Mcl-l. The key findings from this study highlight the importance of the cellular context of different cancer cells for the function of multifunctional RBPs like SRSF1 and have implications for therapeutic approaches employed to target Mcl-1."

As it may be relevant to exploit the molecular mechanisms underlying this biological response to achieve new cancer therapies, in this paper we sought to identify them by using transcriptome and proteome analysis applied to an established glucose-addicted cellular model of transformation, namely, murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts harboring an oncogenic K-RAS gene, compared with parental cells. Noteworthy is that the analyses performed in high- and low-glucose cultures indicate that reduction of glucose availability induces, especially in transformed cells, a significant increase in the expression of several unfolded protein response (UPR) hallmark genes. We show that this response is strictly associated with transformed cell death, given that its attenuation, by reducing protein translation or by increasing cell protein folding capacity, preserves the survival of transformed cells. Such an effect is also observed by inhibiting c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, a pro-apoptotic signaling mediator set downstream of UPR. Strikingly, addition of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, a specific substrate for the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), to glucose-depleted cells completely prevents transformed cell death, stressing the important role of glucose in HBP fuelling to ensure UPR attenuation and increased cell survival. Interestingly, these results have been fully recognized in a human model of breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, we show that glucose deprivation, leading to harmful accumulation of unfolded proteins in consequence of a reduction of protein glycosylation, induces a UPR-dependent cell death mechanism. These findings may open the way for new therapeutic strategies to specifically kill glycolytic cancer cells."

Transmitochondrial cybrid systems (cybrids) are an excellent tool to study specific effects of altered mitochondria under a defined nuclear background. The majority of the studies using the cybrid model focused on the significance of specific mitochondrial DNA variations in mitochondrial function or tumor properties. However, most of these variants are benign polymorphisms without known functional significance. From an objective of rectifying mitochondrial defects in cancer cells and to establish mitochondria as a potential anticancer drug target, understanding the role of functional mitochondria in reversing oncogenic properties under a cancer nuclear background is very important. Here we analyzed the potential reversal of oncogenic properties of a highly metastatic cell line with the introduction of non-cancerous mitochondria. Cybrids were established by fusing the mitochondria DNA depleted 143B TK- ρ0 cells from an aggressive osteosarcoma cell line with mitochondria from benign breast epithelial cell line MCF10A, moderately metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 and 143B cells. In spite of the uniform cancerous nuclear background, as observed with the mitochondria donor cells, cybrids with benign mitochondria showed high mitochondrial functional properties including increased ATP synthesis, oxygen consumption and respiratory chain activities compared to cybrids with cancerous mitochondria. Interestingly, benign mitochondria could reverse different oncogenic characteristics of 143B TK(-) cell including cell proliferation, viability under hypoxic condition, anti-apoptotic properties, resistance to anti-cancer drug, invasion, and colony formation in soft agar, and in vivo tumor growth in nude mice. Microarray analysis suggested that several oncogenic pathways observed in cybrids with cancer mitochondria are inhibited in cybrids with non-cancerous mitochondria. These results suggest the critical oncogenic regulation by mitochondrial-nuclear cross talk and highlights rectifying mitochondrial functional properties as a promising target in cancer therapy."

Here, we localize the C-terminal helix of Sem1 binding to the PCI domain of the subunit Rpn7 using cryo-electron microscopy single particle reconstruction of proteasomes purified from yeast cells with sem1 deletion. The approximate position of the N-terminal region of Sem1 bridging the cleft between Rpn7 and Rpn3 was inferred based on site-specific cross-linking data of the 26S proteasome.

Despite being studied in great detail in recent years, the mechanisms that govern this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify a novel role for miR-139-5p in the inhibition of breast cancer progression. We highlight its clinical relevance by reviewing miR-139-5p expression across a wide variety of breast cancer subtypes using in-house generated and online data sets to show that it is most frequently lost in invasive tumors. A biotin pull-down approach was then used to identify the mRNA targets of miR-139-5p in the breast cancer cell line MCF7. Functional enrichment analysis of the pulled-down targets showed significant enrichment of genes in pathways previously implicated in breast cancer metastasis (P &lt; 0.05). Further bioinformatic analysis revealed a predicted disruption to the TGFβ, Wnt, Rho, and MAPK/PI3K signaling cascades, implying a potential role for miR-139-5p in regulating the ability of cells to invade and migrate. To corroborate this finding, using the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, we show that overexpression of miR-139-5p results in suppression of these cellular phenotypes. Furthermore, we validate the interaction between miR-139-5p and predicted targets involved in these pathways.

Because most adhesion molecules with adhesion domains have vital roles in cancer metastasis, we speculated that adhesion GPCRs are potentially involved in cancer metastasis. In this study, we identified GPR116 as a novel regulator of breast cancer metastasis through expression and functional screening of the adhesion GPCR family. We found that knockdown of GPR116 in highly metastatic (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells suppressed cell migration and invasion. Conversely, ectopic GPR116 expression in poorly metastatic (MCF-7 and Hs578T) cells promoted cell invasion. We further showed that knockdown of GPR116 inhibited breast cancer cell metastasis in two mammary tumor metastasis mouse models. Moreover, GPR116 modulated the formation of lamellipodia and actin stress fibers in cells in a RhoA- and Rac1-dependent manner. At a molecular level, GPR116 regulated cell motility and morphology through the Gαq-p63RhoGEF-RhoA/Rac1 pathway. The biologic significance of GPR116 in breast cancer is substantiated in human patient samples, where GPR116 expression is significantly correlated with breast tumor progression, recurrence, and poor prognosis. These findings show that GPR116 is crucial for the metastasis of breast cancer and support GPR116 as a potential prognostic marker and drug target against metastatic human breast cancer."

The PRKD1 gene encodes protein kinase D1 (PKD1), a serine/threonine kinase that is expressed in cells of the normal mammary gland, where it maintains the epithelial phenotype by preventing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.METHODS: The status of PRKD1 promoter methylation was analyzed by reduced representation bisulfite deep sequencing, methylation-specific PCR (MSP-PCR) and in situ MSP-PCR in invasive and noninvasive breast cancer lines, as well as in humans in 34 cases of &quot;normal&quot; tissue, 22 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ, 22 cases of estrogen receptor positive, HER2-negative (ER+/HER2-) invasive lobular carcinoma, 43 cases of ER+/HER2- invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), 93 cases of HER2+ IDC and 96 cases of triple-negative IDC. A reexpression strategy using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine was used in vitro in MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in vivo in a tumor xenograft model and measured by RT-PCR, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The effect of PKD1 reexpression on cell invasion was analyzed in vitro by transwell invasion assay. Tumor growth and metastasis were monitored in vivo using the IVIS Spectrum Pre-clinical In Vivo Imaging System.RESULTS: Herein we show that the gene promoter of PRKD1 is aberrantly methylated and silenced in its expression in invasive breast cancer cells and during breast tumor progression, increasing with the aggressiveness of tumors. Using an animal model, we show that reversion of PRKD1 promoter methylation with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine restores PKD1 expression and blocks tumor spread and metastasis to the lung in a PKD1-dependent fashion.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the status of epigenetic regulation of the PRKD1 promoter can provide valid information on the invasiveness of breast tumors and therefore could serve as an early diagnostic marker. Moreover, targeted upregulation of PKD1 expression may be used as a therapeutic approach to reverse the invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells."

During the hypoxic response, gene expression is altered by various transcription factors. The transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), plays a central role in the hypoxic response. The α subunit of HIF, which is actively degraded during normoxia, becomes stabilized during hypoxia, which leads to HIF activation. A microarray analysis of HeLa cells showed that expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) was markedly induced during prolonged hypoxia. CREB and NF-κB binding sites were identified in the MMP1 promoter region between 1945 and 1896 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site. Assays with luciferase reporters demonstrated that HIF activity was induced during the early phase of hypoxia, whereas CREB and NF-κB were activated during the later (prolonged) phase. Depletion of CREB and/or NF-κB reduced MMP1 induction during prolonged hypoxia both at the mRNA and protein levels. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated binding of CREB and NF-κB to the MMP1 promoter. Finally, cell migration and invasion on a collagen matrix and pulmonary metastasis in nude mice were inhibited after depletion of CREB and NF-κB in MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the cooperative action of CREB and NF-κB plays an important role to induce MMP1 expression during prolonged hypoxia and regulates cell migration and invasion in cancer cells."

Animal and human data suggest that mercury (Hg) impacts DNA methylation. We hypothesize that methylmercury and inorganic Hg exposures from fish consumption and dental amalgams, respectively, may be associated with altered DNA methylation at global repetitive elements (long interspersed elements, LINE-1) and candidate genes related to epigenetic processes (DNMT1) and protection against Hg toxicity (SEPW1, SEPP1). Dental professionals were recruited at Michigan Dental Association (MDA) meetings in 2009 and 2010. Subjects (n=131) provided survey data (e.g. exposure sources, demographics) and biological samples for Hg measurement and epigenetic analysis. Total Hg was quantified via atomic absorption spectrophotometry in hair and urine, indicative of methylmercury and inorganic Hg exposures, respectively. Global repetitive and candidate gene methylation was quantified via pyrosequencing of bisulfite converted DNA isolated from buccal mucosa. Hair Hg (geometric mean (95% CI): 0.37 (0.31-0.44) µg/g) and urine Hg (0.70 (0.60-0.83) µg/L) were associated with sources of exposure (fish consumption and dental amalgams, respectively). Multivariable linear regression revealed a trend of SEPP1 hypomethylation with increasing hair Hg levels, and this was significant (P&lt;0.05) among males. The trend remained when excluding non-dentists. No significant relationships between urine Hg and DNA methylation were observed. Thus, in a limited cohort, we identified an association between methylmercury exposure and hypomethylation of a potentially labile region of the genome (SEPP1 promoter), and this relationship was gender specific."

We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to the Warburg effect in human breast cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes were profiled using zymography. LDH-B subunit expression was assessed by reverse transcription PCR in cells, and by Immunohistochemistry in breast tissues. LDH-B promoter methylation was assessed by sequencing bisulfite modified DNA.RESULTS: Absent or decreased expression of LDH isoenzymes 1-4, were seen in T-47D and MCF7 cells. Absence of LDH-B mRNA was seen in T-47D cells, and its expression was restored following treatment with the demethylating agent 5'Azacytadine. LDH-B promoter methylation was identified in T-47D and MCF7 cells, and in 25/25 cases of breast cancer tissues, but not in 5/5 cases of normal breast tissues. Absent immuno-expression of LDH-B protein (&lt;10% cells stained), was seen in 23/26 (88%) breast cancer cases, and in 4/8 cases of adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ lesions. Exposure of breast cancer cells to hypoxia (1% O(2)), for 48 hours resulted in significant increases in lactate levels in both MCF7 (14.0 fold, p = 0.002), and T-47D cells (2.9 fold, p = 0.009), but not in MDA-MB-436 (-0.9 fold, p = 0.229), or MCF10AT (1.2 fold, p = 0.09) cells.CONCLUSIONS: Loss of LDH-B expression is an early and frequent event in human breast cancer occurring due to promoter methylation, and is likely to contribute to an enhanced glycolysis of cancer cells under hypoxia."

In human breast cancer, it is one of the most down-regulated miRNAs and is able to modulate ERBB2/3 expression. Here, we investigated its targets in breast cancer cell lines after miRNA-mimic transfection. We examined the interactions of the validated targets with ERBB2 oncogene and the correlation of miR-125b expression with clinical variables.METHODS: MiR-125b possible targets were identified after transfecting a miRNA-mimic in MCF7 cell line and analyzing gene expression modifications with Agilent microarrays and Sylamer bioinformatic tool. Erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor (EPOR) were validated as targets of miR-125b by luciferase assay and their expression was assessed by RT-qPCR in 42 breast cancers and 13 normal samples. The molecular talk between EPOR and ERBB2 transcripts, through miR-125b, was explored transfecting MDA-MD-453 and MDA-MB-157 with ERBB2 RNA and using RT-qPCR.RESULTS: We identified a panel of genes down-regulated after miR-125b transfection and putative targets of miR-125b. Among them, we validated erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor (EPOR) - frequently overexpressed in breast cancer--as true targets of miR-125b. Moreover, we explored possible correlations with clinical variables and we found a down-regulation of miR-125b in metastatic breast cancers and a significant positive correlation between EPOR and ERBB2/HER2 levels, that are both targets of miR-125b and function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs).CONCLUSIONS: Taken together our results show a mechanism for EPO/EPOR and ERBB2 co-regulation in breast cancer and confirm the importance of miR-125b in controlling clinically-relevant cancer features."

To further explore miR-205 targeting of HMGB3, WST-1 proliferation and in vitro invasion assays were performed in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells transiently transfected with precursor miR-205 oligonucleotide or HMGB3 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Both treatments reduced the proliferation and invasion of the cancer cells. The mRNA and protein levels of HMGB3 were higher in the tumor compared to adjacent benign specimens and there was an indirect correlation between the expression of HMGB3 mRNA and patient survival. Treatment of breast cancer cells with 5-Aza/TSA derepressed miR-205 and reduced HMGB3 mRNA while knockdown of the transcriptional repressor NRSF/REST, reduced miR-205 and increased HMGB3. In conclusion, regulation of HMGB3 by miR-205 reduced both proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. Our findings suggest that modulating miR-205 and/or targeting HMGB3 are potential therapies for advanced breast cancer."

Here, we use a recently developed metabolic labeling technique, NeuCode (neutron encoding) stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), which produces precursor partners spaced ~40 mDa apart to enable amino acid counting. We implement large scale counting of amino acids through a program, &quot;Amino Acid Counter&quot;, which determines the most likely combination of amino acids within a precursor based on NeuCode SILAC partner spacing and filters candidate peptide sequences during a database search using this information. Counting the number of lysine residues for precursors selected for MS/MS decreases the median number of candidate sequences from 44 to 14 as compared to an accurate mass search alone (20 ppm). Furthermore, the ability to co-isolate and fragment NeuCode SILAC partners enables counting of lysines in product ions, and when the information is used, the median number of candidates is reduced to 7. We then demonstrate counting leucine in addition to lysine results in a 6-fold decrease in search space, 43 to 7, when compared to an accurate mass search. We use this scheme to analyze a nanoLC-MS/MS experiment and demonstrate that accurate mass plus lysine and leucine counting reduces the number of candidate sequences to one for ~20% of all precursors selected, demonstrating an ability to identify precursors without MS/MS analysis."

We found that miR-663 was up-regulated in our induced multidrug-resistant MDA-MB-231/ADM cell line and that this up-regulation was closely related to chemosensitivity. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the role of miR-663 in regulating the chemoresistance of breast cancer. MicroRNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR assays were used to identify differentially expressed microRNAs. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by annexin V/propidium iodide staining, TUNEL, and reactive oxygen species generation analysis. The expression of miR-663 and HSPG2 in breast cancer tissues was detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The potential targets of miR-663 were defined by a luciferase reporter assay. Bisulfite sequencing PCR was used to analyze the methylation status. We found that miR-663 was significantly elevated in MDA-MB-231/ADM cells, and the down-regulation of miR-663 sensitized MDA-MB-231/ADM cells to both cyclophosphamide and docetaxel. The overexpression of miR-663 in breast tumor tissues was associated with chemoresistance; in MDA-MB-231 cells, this chemoresistance was accompanied by the down-regulation of HSPG2, which was identified as a target of miR-663. MDA-MB-231/ADM contained fewer methylated CpG sites than its parental cell line, and miR-663 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was reactivated by 5-aza-29-deoxycytidine treatment, indicating that DNA methylation may play a functional role in the expression of miR-663. Our findings suggest that the overexpression of hypomethylated miR-663 induced chemoresistance in breast cancer cells by down-regulating HSPG2, thus providing a potential target for the development of an microRNA-based approach for breast cancer therapy."

However, it is not known whether ASR genes confer drought stress tolerance by utilizing the antioxidant system. In this study, a wheat ASR gene, TaASR1, was cloned and characterized. TaASR1 transcripts increased after treatments with PEG6000, ABA and H(2)O(2). Overexpression of TaASR1 in tobacco resulted in increased drought/osmotic tolerance, which was demonstrated that transgenic lines had lesser malondialdehyde (MDA), ion leakage (IL) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), but higher relative water content (RWC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities than wild type (WT) under drought stress. Overexpression of TaASR1 in tobacco also enhanced the expression of ROS-related and stress-responsive genes under osmotic stress. In addition, transgenic lines exhibited improved tolerance to oxidative stress by retaining more effective antioxidant system. Finally, TaASR1 was localized in the cell nucleus and functioned as a transcriptional activator. Taken together, our results showed that TaASR1 functions as a positive factor under drought/osmotic stress, involved in the regulation of ROS homeostasis by activating antioxidant system and transcription of stress-associated genes."

These co-treatments significantly induced cell growth inhibition, apoptosis, as well as cell cycle modifications in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. FE enhanced apoptosis in cancer cells that responded to treatment with three chemotherapeutic drugs with downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. The combination treatments led to an obvious decrease in the phosphorylation of ERK and Akt in MDA-MB-231 cells, but increased the phosphorylation of ERK in MCF-7 cells.

The TNBC subtype constitutes approximately 10%-20% of all breast cancers, but has no effective molecular targeted therapies. Previous meta-analysis of gene expression profiles of 587 TNBC cases from 21 studies demonstrated high expression of Wnt signaling pathway-associated genes in basal-like 2 and mesenchymal subtypes of TNBC. In this study, we investigated the potential of Wnt pathway inhibitors in effective treatment of TNBC.METHODS: Activation of Wnt pathway was assessed in four TNBC cell lines (BT-549, MDA-MB-231, HCC-1143 and HCC-1937), and the ER+ cell line MCF-7 using confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis of pathway components. Effectiveness of five different Wnt pathway inhibitors (iCRT-3, iCRT-5, iCRT-14, IWP-4 and XAV-939) on cell proliferation and apoptosis were tested in vitro. The inhibitory effects of iCRT-3 on canonical Wnt signaling in TNBC was evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of Axin2 and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The effects of shRNA knockdown of SOX4 in combination with iCRT-3 and/or genistein treatments on cell proliferation, migration and invasion on BT-549 cells were also evaluated.RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining of β-catenin in TNBC cell lines showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization, indicating activation of Wnt pathway in TNBC cells. iCRT-3 was the most effective compound for inhibiting proliferation and antagonizing Wnt signaling in TNBC cells. In addition, treatment with iCRT-3 resulted in increased apoptosis in vitro. Knockdown of the Wnt pathway transcription factor, SOX4 in triple negative BT-549 cells resulted in decreased cell proliferation and migration, and combination treatment of iCRT-3 with SOX4 knockdown had a synergistic effect on inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that targeting SOX4 and/or the Wnt pathway could have therapeutic benefit for TNBC patients."

The current study is designed to evaluate the protective effects of DADS against ethanol-induced oxidative stress, and to explore the underlying mechanisms by examining the HO-1/Nrf-2 pathway.METHODS: We investigated whether or not DADS could activate the HO-1 in normal human liver cell LO2, and then evaluated the protective effects of DADS against ethanol-induced damage in LO2 cells and in acute ethanol-intoxicated mice. The biochemical parameters were measured using commercial kits. HO-1 mRNA level was determined by RT-PCR. Histopathology and immunofluorescence assay were performed with routine methods. Protein levels were measured by western blot.RESULTS: DADS significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of HO-1, stimulated the nuclear translocation of Nrf-2 and increased the phosphorylation of MAPK in LO2 cells. The nuclear translocation of Nrf-2 was abrogated by MAPK inhibitors. DADS significantly suppressed ethanol-induced elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate transaminase (AST) activities, decrease of glutathione (GSH) level, increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and apoptosis of LO2 cells, which were all blocked by ZnPPIX. In mice, DADS effectively suppressed acute ethanol-induced elevation of aminotransferase activities, and improved liver histopathological changes, which might be associated with HO-1 activation.CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that DADS could induce the activation of HO-1/Nrf-2 pathway, which may contribute to the protective effects of DADS against ethanol-induced liver injury.GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: DADS may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of ALD due to significant activation of HO-1/Nrf-2 pathway."

Cellular proliferation is often downregulated during EMT, and the reverse transition (MET) in metastases appears to be required for restoration of proliferation in secondary tumors. We studied the interplay between EMT and proliferation control by MYB in breast cancer cells.METHODS: MYB, ZEB1, and CDH1 expression levels were manipulated by lentiviral small-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown/overexpression, and verified with Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and qRT-PCR. Proliferation was assessed with bromodeoxyuridine pulse labeling and flow cytometry, and sulforhodamine B assays. EMT was induced with epidermal growth factor for 9 days or by exposure to hypoxia (1% oxygen) for up to 5 days, and assessed with qRT-PCR, cell morphology, and colony morphology. Protein expression in human breast cancers was assessed with immunohistochemistry. ZEB1-MYB promoter binding and repression were determined with Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay and a luciferase reporter assay, respectively. Student paired t tests, Mann-Whitney, and repeated measures two-way ANOVA tests determined statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05).RESULTS: Parental PMC42-ET cells displayed higher expression of ZEB1 and lower expression of MYB than did the PMC42-LA epithelial variant. Knockdown of ZEB1 in PMC42-ET and MDA-MB-231 cells caused increased expression of MYB and a transition to a more epithelial phenotype, which in PMC42-ET cells was coupled with increased proliferation. Indeed, we observed an inverse relation between MYB and ZEB1 expression in two in vitro EMT cell models, in matched human breast tumors and lymph node metastases, and in human breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of MYB in PMC42-LA cells (MYBsh-LA) led to morphologic changes and protein expression consistent with an EMT. ZEB1 expression was raised in MYBsh-LA cells and significantly repressed in MYB-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells, which also showed reduced random migration and a shift from mesenchymal to epithelial colony morphology in two dimensional monolayer cultures. Finally, we detected binding of ZEB1 to MYB promoter in PMC42-ET cells, and ZEB1 overexpression repressed MYB promoter activity.CONCLUSIONS: This work identifies ZEB1 as a transcriptional repressor of MYB and suggests a reciprocal MYB-ZEB1 repressive relation, providing a mechanism through which proliferation and the epithelial phenotype may be coordinately modulated in breast cancer cells."

The physiological function and regulation of KIBRA in non-neuronal cells are much less understood. Recent studies have identified KIBRA as a novel regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. We recently reported that KIBRA is phosphorylated by the mitotic kinases Aurora and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 during mitosis. In this current study, we show that KIBRA is also phosphorylated by the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases)-RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinases) cascade. We demonstrated that ERK1/2 phosphorylate KIBRA at Ser(548) in cells as well as in vitro. Moreover, we found that RSK1/2 specifically phosphorylates KIBRA at two highly conserved sites (Thr(929) and Ser(947)) in vitro and in cells. RSK-mediated phosphorylation is required for KIBRA binding to RSK1, but not RSK2. Surprisingly, KIBRA knockdown impaired cell migration and proliferation in breast cancer cells. By using inducible-expression cell lines, we further show that phospho-regulation of KIBRA by ERK1/2 and RSK1/2 is required for proper cell proliferation and RSK-mediated phosphorylation also modulates KIBRA's migratory activity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Our findings uncover unexpected results and a new mechanism through which KIBRA regulates cell migration and proliferation."

However, obtaining bacterial genomic information is not always trivial: the target bacteria may be difficult to culture or uncultured, and they may be found within samples containing complex mixtures of other contaminating microbes and/or host cells, from which it is very difficult to derive robust sequencing data. Here we describe our procedure to generate sufficient DNA for whole-genome sequencing from clinical samples and without the need for culture, as successfully used on the difficult-to-culture, obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis. Our protocol combines immunomagnetic separation (IMS) for targeted bacterial enrichment with multiple displacement amplification (MDA) for whole-genome amplification (WGA), which is followed by high-throughput sequencing. Compared with other techniques that might be used to generate such data, IMS-MDA is an inexpensive, low-technology and highly transferable process that provides amplified genomic DNA for sequencing from target bacteria in under 5 h, with little hands-on time."

Cancer cells are characterized by wholesale changes in long-range gene interactions, but the role that these long-range interactions play in cancer progression and metastasis is not well understood. In this study, we used IGFBP3, a gene involved in breast cancer pathogenesis, as bait in a 4C-seq experiment comparing normal breast cells (HMEC) with two breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, an ER positive cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple negative cell line). The IGFBP3 long-range interaction profile was substantially altered in breast cancer. Many interactions seen in normal breast cells are lost and novel interactions appear in cancer lines. We found that in HMEC, the breast carcinoma amplified sequence gene family (BCAS) 1-4 were among the top 10 most significantly enriched regions of interaction with IGFBP3. 3D-FISH analysis indicated that the translocation-prone BCAS genes, which are located on chromosomes 1, 17, and 20, are in close physical proximity with IGFBP3 and each other in normal breast cells. We also found that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a gene implicated in tumorigenesis, interacts significantly with IGFBP3 and that this interaction may play a role in their regulation. Breakpoint analysis suggests that when an IGFBP3 interacting region undergoes a translocation an additional interaction detectable by 4C is gained. Overall, our data from multiple lines of evidence suggest an important role for long-range chromosomal interactions in the pathogenesis of cancer."

Each FU contains two Cu ions, which can reversibly bind an oxygen molecule. Here, we report a 4.5 A° cryo-EM structure of HdH1. The structure clearly shows ten asymmetric units arranged with D5 symmetry. Each asymmetric unit contains two structurally distinct but chemically identical subunits. The map is sufficiently resolved to trace the entire subunit Ca backbone and to visualize densities corresponding to some large side chains, Cu ion pairs, and interaction networks of adjacent subunits. A FU topology path intertwining between the two subunits of the asymmetric unit is unambiguously determined.

Low expression of WNT5A is correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. The highly invasive breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and 4T1, express very low levels of WNT5A. To determine if enhanced expression of WNT5A would affect metastatic behavior, we generated WNT5A expressing cells from the 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 parental cell lines. WNT5A expressing cells demonstrated cobblestone morphology and reduced in vitro migration relative to controls. Cell growth was not altered. Metastasis to the lung via tail vein injection was reduced in the 4T1-WNT5A expressing cells relative to 4T1-vector controls. To determine the mechanism of WNT5A action on metastasis, we performed microarray and whole-transcriptome sequence analysis (RNA-seq) to compare gene expression in 4T1-WNT5A and 4T1-vector cells. Analysis indicated highly significant alterations in expression of genes associated with cellular movement. Down-regulation of a subset of these genes, Mmp13, Nos2, Il1a, Cxcl2, and Lamb3, in WNT5A expressing cells was verified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Significant differences in transcript splicing were also detected in cell movement associated genes including Cd44. Cd44 is an adhesion molecule with a complex genome structure. Variable exon usage is associated with metastatic phenotype. Alternative spicing of Cd44 in WNT5A expressing cells was confirmed using RT-PCR. We conclude that WNT5A inhibits metastasis through down-regulation of multiple cell movement pathways by regulating transcript levels and splicing of key genes like Cd44."

We utilized Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice to induce pre-conceptional and gestational obesity and followed offspring outcomes in the absence of any postnatal obesogenic influences. Male adult offspring developed overweight, insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, hyperuricemia and hepatic steatosis; all these features were not observed in females. Instead, they showed impaired fasting glucose and a reduced fat mass and adipocyte size. Influences of the interaction of maternal diet∗sex concerned offspring genes involved in fatty liver disease, lipid droplet size regulation and fat mass expansion.

Such data can reveal whether joint effects at the receptor are induced at low levels and may support the prioritisation of in vivo evaluations and provide orientations for the grouping of anti-androgens in cumulative risk assessment. Combinations of 30 AR antagonists from a wide range of sources and exposure routes (pesticides, antioxidants, parabens, UV-filters, synthetic musks, bisphenol-A, benzo(a)pyrene, perfluorooctane sulfonate and pentabromodiphenyl ether) were tested using a reporter gene assay (MDA-kb2). Chemicals were combined at three mixture ratios, equivalent to single components' effect concentrations that inhibit the action of dihydrotesterone by 1%, 10% or 20%. Concentration addition (CA) and independent action were used to calculate additivity expectations. We observed complete suppression of dihydrotestosterone effects when chemicals were combined at individual concentrations eliciting 1%, 10% or 20% AR antagonistic effect. Due to the large number of mixture components, the combined AR antagonistic effects occurred at very low concentrations of individual mixture components. CA slightly underestimated the combined effects at all mixture ratios. In conclusion, large numbers of AR antagonists from a wide variety of sources and exposure routes have the ability of acting together at the receptor to produce joint effects at very low concentrations. Significant mixture effects are observed when chemicals are combined at concentrations that individually do not induce observable AR antagonistic effects. Cumulative risk assessment for AR antagonists should apply grouping criteria based on effects where data are available, rather than on criteria of chemical similarity."

However, several recent studies showed its potential adverse health effects to humans as it may be an endocrine disruptor. This study focuses on the effects of pure glyphosate on estrogen receptors (ERs) mediated transcriptional activity and their expressions. Glyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone-dependent breast cancer, T47D cells, but not in hormone-independent breast cancer, MDA-MB231 cells, at 10⁻¹² to 10⁻⁶M in estrogen withdrawal condition. The proliferative concentrations of glyphosate that induced the activation of estrogen response element (ERE) transcription activity were 5-13 fold of control in T47D-KBluc cells and this activation was inhibited by an estrogen antagonist, ICI 182780, indicating that the estrogenic activity of glyphosate was mediated via ERs. Furthermore, glyphosate also altered both ERα and β expression. These results indicated that low and environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate possessed estrogenic activity. Glyphosate-based herbicides are widely used for soybean cultivation, and our results also found that there was an additive estrogenic effect between glyphosate and genistein, a phytoestrogen in soybeans.

TZs #8 and 9 docked to the Rad6B catalytic site with highest complementarity. TZs #1, 2, 8, and 9 inhibited Rad6B-ubiquitin thioester formation and subsequent ubiquitin transfer to histone H2A. SMI #9 inhibition of Rad6 was selective as BCA2 ubiquitination by E2 UbcH5 was unaffected by SMI #9. SMI #9 more potently inhibited proliferation, colony formation, and migration than SMI #8, and induced MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell G2-M arrest and apoptosis. Ubiquitination assays using Rad6 immunoprecipitated from SMI #8- or 9-treated cells confirmed inhibition of endogenous Rad6 activity. Consistent with our previous data showing Rad6B-mediated polyubiquitination stabilizes β-catenin, MDA-MB-231 treatment with SMIs #8 or 9 decreased β-catenin protein levels. Together these results describe identification of the first Rad6 SMIs."

Gankyrin regulates a variety of oncogenic signaling pathways in cancer cells and accelerates degradation of tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Rb. Therefore gankyrin may be a unique hub integrating signaling networks with the degradation pathway. To identify new interactions that may be crucial in consolidating its role as an oncogenic hub, crystal structure of gankyrin-proteasome ATPase complex was used to predict novel interacting partners. EEVD, a four amino acid linear sequence seems a hot spot site at this interface. By searching for EEVD in exposed regions of human proteins in PDB database, we predicted 34 novel interactions. Eight proteins were tested and seven of them were found to interact with gankyrin. Affinity of four interactions is high enough for endogenous detection. Others require gankyrin overexpression in HEK 293 cells or occur endogenously in breast cancer cell line- MDA-MB-435, reflecting lower affinity or presence of a deregulated network. Mutagenesis and peptide inhibition confirm that EEVD is the common hot spot site at these interfaces and therefore a potential polypharmacological drug target. In MDA-MB-231 cells in which the endogenous CLIC1 is silenced, trans-expression of Wt protein (CLIC1_EEVD) and not the hot spot site mutant (CLIC1_AAVA) resulted in significant rescue of the migratory potential. Our approach can be extended to identify novel functionally relevant protein-protein interactions, in expansion of oncogenic networks and in identifying potential therapeutic targets."

Epigenetic silencing of E-cadherin (loss of which is associated with more invasive phenotype) is observed in metastatic cell lines and invasive breast cancers. Here, we are showing that entinostat (ENT) can reverse epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is considered to be a first step in the process of metastases formation. Triple-negative breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T show a basal phenotype characterized by loss of E-cadherin expression and higher expression of mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin and vimentin along with transcriptional repressors such as twist and snail. When MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells or tumors were treated with ENT, E-cadherin transcription was increased along with reduction in N-cadherin mRNA expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that treatment of MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells increased the activation of E-cadherin promoter by reducing the association of twist and snail with the E-cadherin (CDH1) promoter and downregulated both the snail and twist. ENT also inhibited cell migration in vitro. In addition, phosphorylation of vimentin was increased, as well as remodeling of vimentin filaments. ENT treatment also reduced formation of tubulin-based microtentacles, which help floating cells attach to other surfaces. These findings suggest that ENT can reverse EMT and may reduce the formation of metastasis."

The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase acts as the convergent point of MAPK cascades during a variety of stress signaling. In this study, a novel MAPKK gene, ZmMKK1, in maize (Zea mays L.) belonging to group A MAPKK was isolated and functionally characterized. ZmMKK1 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and its constitutive kinase-active form ZmMKK1DD was localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus. QRT-PCR analysis uncovered that ZmMKK1 expression was triggered by abiotic and biotic stresses and exogenous signaling molecules. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Ca(2+) mediated 12°C-induced up-regulated expressing of ZmMKK1 at mRNA level. Ectopic expression of ZmMKK1 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) conferred tolerance to chilling stress by higher antioxidant enzyme activities, more accumulation of osmoregulatory substances and more significantly up-expression of ROS-related and stress-responsive genes compared with empty vector control plants. Furthermore, ZmMKK1 played differential functions in biotrophic versus necrotrophic pathogen-induced responses. These results suggested ZmMKK1 played a crucial role in chilling stress and pathogen defense in plants."

DADS at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day was administered orally once daily for 5 days, prior to CCl4 administration. Pretreatment with DADS attenuated CCl4-induced elevated serum transaminase activities and histopathological alterations in liver. It prevented the hepatocellular apoptotic changes with induction of Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), cytochrome c, and caspase-3 caused by CCl4. An increase in the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and phosphorylation of I kappaB alpha (IκBα) was observed in the livers of CCl4-treated rats that coincided with induction of inflammatory mediators or cytokines. In contrast, DADS inhibited NF-κB translocation and IκBα phosphorylation, and that subsequently decreased inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, DADS prevented CCl4-induced depletion of cytosolic nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and suppression of nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which, in turn, up-regulated phase II/antioxidant enzyme activities. Taken together, these results demonstrate that DADS increases the expression of phase II/antioxidant enzymes and simultaneously decreases the expression of inflammatory mediators in CCl4-induced liver injury. These findings indicate that DADS induces antioxidant defense mechanism by activating Nrf2 pathway and reduces inflammatory response by inhibiting NF-κB activation."

However, the mechanism by which BNF exerts this antitumor effect remains unclear. Thus, we explored mechanisms of BNF's antitumor effects in human breast cancer cells. This study showed that BNF suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase with downregulation of cyclin D1/D3 and CDK4 and upregulation of p21(Cip1/Waf1), leading to a senescence-like phenotype in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells, but not in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, BNF inhibited PI3K/AKT signaling, and the PI3K inhibitor, LY294,002, exhibited the same inhibitory effects on cyclinD1/D3, CDK4 and the cell cycle as BNF. Interestingly, BNF activated mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK-ERK) signaling, and more notably, MEK inhibitor PD98059 significantly blocked the BNF-induced cell cycle arrest and upregulation of p21(Cip1/Waf1). Furthermore, specific ERα and AhR siRNA studies indicate that ERα is required in BNF-induced p21(Cip1/Waf1) expression, and BNF-mediated cell cycle arrest and modulation of AKT and ERK signaling is AhR-dependent. Taken together, AhR-dependent inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway, activation of MAPK/ERK and modulation of ERα is a novel mechanism underlying BNF-mediated antitumor effects in breast cancer, which may represent a promising strategy to be exploited in future clinical trials."

We examined whether loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or methylation at ERβ promoters (0N, 0K) and/or untranslated exon 0N were involved in ERβ down-regulation in breast cancer tissues and cell lines and if treatment with the de-methylating agent 5-aza-deoxycytidine and/or the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A could influence expression in vitro. We found no evidence of correlation between LOH at 14q22-24 (genomic locus containing ERβ/ESR2), and ERβ1 expression in primary breast cancers. A negative correlation between ERβ1 mRNA expression and methylation status was observed for promoter 0N in BT-20, MDA-MB-453 and T47D cells. Promoter 0K was consistently unmethylated. In primary breast tumours, methylation of the untranslated exon 0N, downstream of promoter 0N, but not of promoter 0N itself, correlated with down-regulation of ERβ. In MDA-MB-453 cells, treatment with 5-aza-deoxycytidine was sufficient to induce ERβ1 expression from the 0N promoter while in BT-20 both agents were required. Examination of various sites on ESR2 highlighted epigenetic but not genetic regulation of ERβ1. In particular methylation adjacent to promoter 0N was a key regulatory event for ERβ1 silencing. A combination of de-methylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors fully restored ERβ1 expression which may offer a novel therapeutic angle for breast cancer management."

With MS/MS scan resolving powers of ~50,000 or higher, product ions containing the C terminus (i.e. lysine) appear as a doublet spaced by exactly 36 mDa, whereas N-terminal fragments exist as a single m/z peak. Through theory and experiment, we demonstrate that over 90% of all y-type product ions have detectable doublets. We report on an algorithm that can extract these neutron signatures with high sensitivity and specificity. In other words, of 15,503 y-type product ion peaks, the y-type ion identification algorithm correctly identified 14,552 (93.2%) based on detection of the NeuCode doublet; 6.8% were misclassified (i.e. other ion types that were assigned as y-type products).

TNBCs are associated with an overall poor prognosis because they lack expression of therapeutic targets like ERα and are biologically more aggressive. A second estrogen receptor, ERβ, has been found to be expressed in 50% to 90% of ERα-negative breast cancers, and ERβ expression in TNBCs has been shown to correlate with improved disease-free survival and good prognosis. To elucidate the role of ERβ in regulating gene expression and cell proliferation in TNBC cells, the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-468 was engineered with inducible expression of full-length ERβ. In culture, ERβ expression inhibited cell growth by inducing a G1 cell cycle arrest, which was further enhanced by 17β-estradiol treatment. In xenografts, ERβ expression also inhibited tumor formation and growth, and 17β-estradiol treatment resulted in rapid tumor regression. Furthermore, genomic RNA sequencing identified both ligand-dependent and -independent ERβ target genes, some of which were also regulated by ERβ in other TNBC cell lines and correlated with ERβ expression in a cohort of TNBCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas Network. ERβ target genes were enriched in genes that regulate cell death and survival, cell movement, cell development, and growth and proliferation, as well as genes involved in the Wnt/β-catenin and the G1/S cell cycle phase checkpoint pathways. In addition to confirming the anti-proliferative effects of ERβ in TNBC cells, these data provide a comprehensive resource of ERβ target genes and suggest that ERβ may be targeted with ligands that can stimulate its growth inhibitory effects."

For breast cancer patients, elevated plasma levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL1β) persisted for a few weeks after completion of radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine whether IL1β is involved in the enhancement of breast cancer cell invasion induced by radiation. The role of IL1β was assessed with invasion chambers where irradiated fibroblasts were used as chemoattractant for the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells plated in the upper compartment. The ability of IL1β to stimulate the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and biosynthesis of the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in MDA-MB-231 cells were also determined. Our results show that radiation-enhancement of MDA-MB-231 cell invasion was prevented with an anti-IL1β antibody. The production of IL1β was increased in irradiated fibroblasts, while the invasiveness of the MDA-MB-231 cells not exposed to irradiated fibroblasts was favored by adding this cytokine. Furthermore, addition of the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 prevented the stimulation of cancer cell invasion induced either by irradiated fibroblasts or IL1β. We propose that the effect of IL1β on the invasiveness of the MDA-MB-231 cells involves elevation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) production, induction of COX-2 expression and PGE2 biosynthesis. In conclusion, this study supports the involvement of IL1β in the radiation-enhancement of breast cancer cell invasion."

The N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), a putative tumor suppression gene, is involved in the regulation of human cell differentiation and metastasis in various cancers. Changes in the status of methylation of the NDRG1 gene have not been studied in detail in human breast cancer.RESULTS: The MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cell line could express NDRG1. However, it was only expressed after treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AZA) in T47D cell line, which revealed that NDRG1 expression could modulated by DNA methylation. Therefore, the fragment surrounding the transcript start site of NDRG1 gene promoter was cloned after sodium bisulfite DNA treatment. A high density (66%) of methylation for human NDRG1 gene promoter was detected in T47D; however, there was only 16% of methylated CpG dinucleotides in the NDRG1 gene promoter in MDA-MB-231. DNA methylation in the NDRG1 promoter was detected in 31.1% of primary breast cancer samples. Furthermore, the NDRG1 promoter methylation correlated with the Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) at stage III/IV, metastasis, lymph invasion, moderate and poor histological grade in the breast cancer patients.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the DNA methylation status of NDRG1 gene may play an important role in the pathogenesis and/or development of breast cancer, and the expression could be regulated by aberrant DNA methylation."

The induction of HO-1 by zinc was detected after 4-6 hours of treatment, reached maximal level at 8 hours, and declined thereafter. Using a human HO-1 gene promoter reporter construct, we identified two antioxidant response elements (AREs) that mediated the zinc-induced increase in HO-1 gene transcription, indicating that the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway is involved in this event. This assumption was supported by the observations that knockdown of Nrf2 expression compromised the zinc-induced increase in HO-1 gene transcription, and that zinc increased Nrf2 protein expression and the Nrf2 binding to the AREs. Additionally, we found that the zinc-induced HO-1 gene transcription can be enhanced by clioquinol, a zinc ionophore, and reversed by pretreatment with TPEN, a known zinc chelator, indicating that an increase in intracellular zinc levels is responsible for this induction.CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that zinc at sub-cytotoxic concentrations induces HO-1 expression in human cancer cells. The biological significance of this induction merits further investigation."

However, the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of GRg1 on peripheral nerve regeneration is currently unclear. The possible effect of GRg1 on Schwann cells (SCs), which were subjected to oxidative injury after nerve injury, might contribute to the beneficial effect of GRg1 on nerve regeneration. The present study was designed to investigate the potential beneficial effect of GRg1 on SCs exposed to oxidative injury. The oxidative injury to SCs was induced by hydrogen peroxide. The effect of GRg1 (50 μM) on SCs exposed to oxidative injury was measured by the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) in SCs. The cell number and cell viability of SCs were evaluated through fluorescence observation and MTT assay. The apoptosis of SCs induced by oxidative injury was evaluated by an apoptosis assay. The expression and secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were evaluated using RT-PCR, Western blotting, and an ELISA method. We found that GRg1 significantly up-regulated the level of SOD, GSH and CAT, and decreased the level of MDA in SCs treated with hydrogen peroxide. In addition, GRg1 has been shown to be able to inhibit the proapoptotic effect of hydrogen peroxide, as well as inhibit the detrimental effect of hydrogen peroxide on cell number and cell viability. Furthermore, GRg1 also increased the mRNA levels, protein levels and secretion of NGF and BDNF in SCs after incubation of hydrogen peroxide. Further study showed that preincubation with H89 (a PKA inhibitor) significantly inhibited the effects induced by hydrogen peroxide, indicating that the PKA pathway might be involved in the antioxidant effect and neurotrophic factors (NTFs) promoting effect of GRg1. In addition, a short-term in vivo study was performed to confirm and validate the antioxidant effect and nerve regeneration-promoting effect of GRg1 in a sciatic crush injury model in rats. We found that GRg1 significantly increased SOD, CAT and GSH, decreased MDA, as well as promoted nerve regeneration after crush injury. In conclusion, the present study showed that GRg1 is capable of helping SCs recover from the oxidative insult induced by hydrogen peroxide, which might account, at least in part, for the beneficial effect of GRg1 on nerve regeneration."

In addition, they are known to be associated with resistance to anticancer drugs. However, the relevance of HDAC4 in chemoresistance remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the interaction between HDAC4 expression and chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. We found that increased HDAC4 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was associated with resistance to the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). To verify these results, a cell line stably overexpressing HDAC4 was generated using MCF-7 cells (HDAC4OE). This cell line displayed increased 5-FU resistance, and HDAC4 knockdown in HDAC4OE cells restored 5-FU sensitivity. Consequently, we concluded that HDAC4 is a critical gene associated with 5‑FU chemoresistance. Further investigation using a microarray approach revealed that 355 genes were differentially expressed following HDAC4 overexpression. Based on functional annotation of the array results, HDAC4 overexpression was found to downregulate genes related to the transforming growth factor (TGF) β signaling pathway, including SMAD4, SMAD6, bone morphogenetic protein 6, inhibitor of DNA binding 1 and TGFβ2. We also found that HDAC4 expression regulates SMAD4 expression by inducing deacetylation of histone H3 in the SMAD4 promoter region. In addition, SMAD4 knockdown in MCF‑7 cells increased 5-FU resistance. In summary, our data suggest that HDAC4‑mediated deacetylation of the SMAD4 promoter may lead to 5-FU resistance in breast cancer cells."

Interestingly, the JMJD1A and ADM expressions were enhanced by hypoxia only in HepG2 and Hep3B cells.

The rice genome has eight OsAPXs, but their physiological functions remain to be determined. In this report, we studied the function of OsAPX2 gene using a T-DNA knockout mutant under the treatment of drought, salt and cold stresses. The Osapx2 knockout mutant was isolated by a genetic screening of a rice T-DNA insertion library under 20% PEG-2000 treatment. Loss of function in OsAPX2 affected the growth and development of rice seedlings, resulting in semi-dwarf seedlings, yellow-green leaves, leaf lesion mimic and seed sterility. OsAPX2 expression was developmental- and spatial-regulated, and was induced by drought, salt, and cold stresses. Osapx2 mutants had lower APX activity and were sensitive to abiotic stresses; overexpression of OsAPX2 increased APX activity and enhanced stress tolerance. H2O2 and MDA levels were high in Osapx2 mutants but low in OsAPX2-OX transgenic lines relative to wild-type plants after stress treatments.

Towards this goal, stealth liposomes bearing different molar ratios of p18-4 peptide (1.5 and 0.3 peptide/total lipid mol %), namely HD and LD liposomes, were successfully prepared. The effect of p18-4 peptide modification and density on breast cancer cell uptake, selective cytotoxicity as well as inhibition of tumor growth and the tissue disposition of encapsulated DOX in breast tumor xenograft models in mice were assessed. The results showed a 2.4 and 5 folds decrease in the IC50 of HD liposomes in MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 breast tumor cells, respectively. Although LD liposomes showed less (1.6 and 2.2 folds) decrease in the IC50 of DOX in the same breast cancer cell lines, they were more selective in their cytotoxic effect and uptake towards breast cancer over normal breast epithelial cells, MCF10A. Evaluation of the anticancer activity in NOD-SCID mice bearing MDA-MB-435 xenografts after receiving six i.v. injections of 2.5mg/kg/week DOX equivalent showed a superior anticancer activity for LD liposomal DOX compared to HD and unmodified liposomal formulations. Mice treated with LD liposomal DOX illustrated 4.8 folds reduction in the mean relative tumor volume compared to non-targeted DOX liposomes. This was despite similar tumor accumulation of DOX as part of LD liposomes compared to that for unmodified liposomes 24h following the last injection. In contrast, HD liposomes showed decreased DOX accumulation in the tumor and preferential uptake by liver and spleen. Treatment with unmodified and LD liposomes did not have any adverse impact on the activity level and mean body weight of live animals during the study period. In conclusion, surface modification of liposomal DOX with engineered p18-4 peptide at an optimum density can improve the antitumor efficacy and selectivity of liposomal DOX."

Reports about the early diagnosis of breast cancer are suggestive of an improved clinical outcome and overall survival rate in cancer patients. Therefore, cancer screening biomarker for early detection and diagnosis is urgently required for timely treatment and better cancer management. In this context, we investigated an association of cancer testis antigen, A-Kinase anchor protein 4 (AKAP4) with breast carcinoma.FINDINGS: We first compared the AKAP4 gene and protein expression in four breast cancer cells (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, SK-BR3 and BT474) and normal human mammary epithelial cells. In addition, 91 clinical specimens of breast cancer patients of various histotypes including ductal carcinoma in situ, infiltrating ductal carcinoma and infiltrating lobular carcinoma and 83 available matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues were examined for AKAP4 gene and protein expression by employing in situ RNA hybridization and immunohistochemistry respectively. Humoral response against AKAP4 was also investigated in breast cancer patients employing ELISA. Our in vitro studies in all breast cancer cells revealed AKAP4 gene and protein expression whereas, normal human mammary epithelial cells failed to show any expression. Using in situ RNA hybridization and immunohistochemistry, 85% (77/91) tissue specimens irrespective of histotypes, stages and grades of breast cancer clinical specimens revealed AKAP4 gene and protein expression. However, matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues failed to display any AKAP4 gene and protein expression. Furthermore, humoral response was observed in 79% (72/91) of total breast cancer patients. Interestingly, we observed that 94% (72/77) of breast cancer patients found positive for AKAP4 protein expression generated humoral response against AKAP4 protein.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data suggests that AKAP4 may be used as serum based diagnostic test for an early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer and may be a potential target for immunotherapeutic use."

Special attention was then paid to the involvement of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).METHODS: Wistar rats were given IH treatment for 1, 7, 14, or 28 days. Some of them were thereafter subject to myocardial infarction surgery. Right ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP), myocardial capillary density (CD), and mRNA/protein expression of HIF-1α, VEGF, and Bcl-2 in rat myocardial tissue were determined. Apoptotic cell number was determined by TUNEL staining, and concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured.RESULTS: IH treatment for 1, 7, 14, and 28 days reduced the myocardial infarction size, whereas IH for 28 days increased the RVSP, ratio of right to left ventricle weight (RV/LV+S), and CD. IH up-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, and Bcl-2 both under normal and I/R conditions. The induced expression of HIF-1α and VEGF by IH reached a peak after 7 days of treatment. Moreover, IH for 28 days induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, whereas prior treatment with IH for 1, 7, 14, and 28 days all markedly attenuated the apoptosis effected by the subsequent I/R injury. IH also decreased the concentrations of MDA but increased those of SOD in myocardial tissue of both in normal rats and following I/R.CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that short-term IH protects the heart from I/R injury through inhibiting apoptosis and oxidative stress. The up-regulation of HIF-1α and VEGF by short-term IH may participate in the cardioprotective effect of IH."

Whether H2A.Z is involved in p21 activity in the absence of p53 is not known. The p21 gene is repressed in estrogen receptor (ER) negative cell lines that are p53-/- and hormone independent for their growth. Here we demonstrate that class I and II pan Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) induce p21 transcription and reduce cell proliferation of MDA-MB231, an ERα-negative mammary tumor cell line, in a H2A.Z dependent manner. H2A.Z is associated with the transcription start site (TSS) of the repressed p21 gene. Depleting H2A.Z did not lead to transcription of p21 but annihilated the stimulating effect of HDACi on this gene. Acetylation of H2A.Z but not of H3K9 at the p21 promoter correlated with p21 activation. We further show that HDACi treatment reduced the presence of the p400 chromatin remodeler at the p21 TSS. We propose a model in which association of p400 negatively affects p21 transcription by interfering with acetylation of H2A.Z."

Recent studies have shown that cyclic isoDGR (CisoDGRC) has a more efficient affinity with α(v)β(3), a type of integrin that overexpresses in tumor cells. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an efficient antitumor peptide that specifically kills tumor cells. In the present study, we designed antimicrobial peptides containing the CisoDGRC motif (CDAK) and assessed its antitumor activity for CD13(-)/α(v)β(3) (+) breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) in vitro and in vivo.IN VITRO: We assessed the cytotoxicity of CDAK for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC), and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF). We performed an apoptosis assay using Annexin-V/PI, DNA ladder, mitochondrial membrane potential, and Caspase-3 and Bcl-2. The effect on cell cycles and affinity with cell were tested using flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy and the effect on invasion was analyzed using an invasion assay. CDAK was injected intravenously into tumor-bearing athymic nude mice in vivo experiment.RESULTS: CDAK showed cytotoxic activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas HUVEC and HFF were less sensitive to the peptides. CDAK induced apoptosis, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, promoted Caspase-3, and inhibited Bcl-2 expression in the two breast cancer cell lines. In addition, CDAK inhibited proliferation of cancer cell through S phase arrest, and own selective affinity with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cells, inhibited the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. In vivo, CDAK significant inhibited the progression of the tumor and the generation of neovascularization.CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial peptides containing the CisoDGRC (CDAK) motif could efficiently exhibit the antitumor activity for CD13(-)/α(v)β(3) (+) breast cancer cells."

Here, we present a three-dimensional reconstruction of the Mycobacterium smegmatis FAS complex at 7.5Å, highly homologous to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis multienzyme, by cryo-electron microscopy. Based on the obtained structural data, which allowed us to identify secondary-structure elements, and sequence homology with the fungal FAS, we generated an accurate architectural model of the complex. The FAS system from Mycobacteria resembles a minimized version of the fungal FAS with much larger openings in the reaction chambers. These architectural features of the mycobacterial FAS may be important for the interaction with mycolic acid processing and condensing enzymes that further modify the precursors produced by FAS and for autoactivation of the FAS complex."

However, there is no detailed structural information about CAD other than that it self-assembles into hexamers of ∼1.5 MDa. Here we report the crystal structure and functional characterization of the dihydroorotase domain of human CAD. Contradicting all assumptions, the structure reveals an active site enclosed by a flexible loop with two Zn²⁺ ions bridged by a carboxylated lysine and a third Zn coordinating a rare histidinate ion. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays prove the involvement of the Zn and flexible loop in catalysis. Comparison with homologous bacterial enzymes supports a reclassification of the DHOase family and provides strong evidence against current models of the architecture of CAD."

Since the cytoskeletal protein filamin-A is known to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of TF in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, the involvement of filamin-A in the incorporation of TF into MVs was examined. Endothelial cells were transfected to express TF, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells were used to examine endogenously expressed TF. MV release was induced by activating protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2). Partial suppression of filamin-A expression using two different filamin-A siRNA sequences resulted in significant reductions in the incorporation of TF antigen into MVs as determined by TF-ELISA and western blot analysis, and was reflected in reduced thrombin-generation and FXa-generation capacities of these MVs. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of TF also resulted in reduced incorporation of TF into MVs, whereas the suppression of filamin-A expression had no additional effect on the incorporation of truncated TF into MVs. Partial suppression of filamin-A expression had no effect on the number and size distribution of the released MVs. However, &gt;90% suppression of filamin-A expression resulted in increased MV release, possibly as a result of increased instability of the plasma membrane and underlying cytoskeleton. In conclusion, the presence of filamin-A appears to be essential for the incorporation of TF into MVs following PAR2 activation, but is not required for the process of MV formation and release following PAR2 activation."

A hybrid approach of single-particle electron microscopy and protein crystallography of individual APC/C subunits has been applied to generate pseudo-atomic models of various functional states of the complex. Three approaches for assigning regions of the EM-derived APC/C density map to specific APC/C subunits are described.

The [D9K] analog displays the greatest increase in potency against all four cell lines (up to 6 fold) but hemolytic activity also increases (LC50=174±12 μM). The [D9k] and [E6k,D9k] analogs retain relatively high cytotoxic potency against the tumor cells (LC50 in the range 2.1-21 μM) but show reduced hemolytic activity (LC50&gt;300 μM).

The cell-surface glycoprotein CD44 is one of the most common surface markers used to identify CSCs. Aptamers are synthetic oligonucleotides selected from pools of random sequences that can bind to a wide range of targets with high affinity and specificity. In this study, the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) technology was used to isolate RNA aptamers using human recombinant full-length CD44 protein and 2'-F-pyrimidine modified RNA library with a complexity of around 10(14) different molecules. Following 11 iterative rounds of SELEX, the selected aptamers were cloned and sequenced. Three different sequences were identified. The binding specificities for one of these RNA aptamers was assessed using representative breast cancer cell lines expressing CD44; namely, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, and T47D. The selected RNA aptamer (Apt1) was found to interact specifically with such cancer cells when analyzed by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy, with different intensities of fluorescence reflecting the level of CD44 expression on the surface of these cells. It can be concluded that the selected aptamers can be used to target CD44 positive cells, including cancer stem cells, for detection, sorting, and enrichment and for drug delivery purposes."

However, little is known about the roles of the key enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in response to environmental stress, such as UV-B radiation and drought. To understand this problem, we investigated the participation of flavanone 3-hydroxylase gene (F3H), a key enzyme in flavonoid biosynthetic pathway under UV-B radiation and drought stress in the desert plant Reaumuria soongorica. A novel cDNA sequence, named as RsF3H, was isolated from R. soongorica. The deduced amino acids showed high identities to other F3Hs. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that RsF3H appeared to be most homologous to F3H from Malus domestica (MdF3H). RsF3H protein structure contained all five conserved motifs for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODDs) and an Arg-X-Ser motif, all of which were also found in other F3Hs. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that there was a rapid increase in gene expression of RsF3H under stress. Both UV-B radiation and drought stress induced an increase in RsF3H enzyme activity and the accumulation of the products in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (total flavonoid and anthocyanin). The antioxidant ability (inhibition of lipid oxidation) of total flavonoid was enhanced during this study. The results suggested that one explanation of the stress tolerance of R. soongorica may be a combination of an increase in RsF3H gene expression, RsF3H enzyme activity and the anti-oxidative ability of the metabolic end products in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in response to UV-B radiation and drought."

However, few genes which show methylation change in accordance with the progression of breast cancer have been identified. To identify genes which consistently undergo promoter methylation alterations as the tumor develops from a benign to a malignant form, genome-wide methylation databases of breast cancer cell lines from stage I to stage IV were analyzed. Heatmap and cluster analysis revealed that the genome-wide methylation changes showed a good accordance with tumor progression. Seven out of 14,495 genes were found to be consistently increased alongside the promoter methylation level through the normal cell line to the cancer stage IV cell lines. NEFL, one of the in silico hypermethylated genes in cancer, showed hypermethylation and lower expression in the cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, as well as in cancer tissues (methylation, p&lt;0.05; expression, p&lt;0.01). The expression was restored by inducing demethylation of the promoter in MDA-MB-231 cells.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of p55-hTERT-HRE-TRAIL on the growth and metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We observed that infection of the recombinant adenovirus resulted in expression of TRAIL and massive cell death in a TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. This effect is much weaker in MCF-10A, which is a normal breast cell line.

We have recently shown that the inflammatory transcription factor SAF-1 is, at least in part, responsible for the marked increase of VEGF levels in breast cancer. Here, we show that SAF-1-mediated induction of VEGF is repressed by KLF-4 transcription factor. KLF-4 is abundantly present in normal breast epithelial cells, but its level is considerably reduced in breast cancer cells and clinical cancer tissues. In the human VEGF promoter, SAF-1- and KLF-4-binding elements are overlapping, whereas SAF-1 induces and KLF-4 suppresses VEGF expression. Ectopic overexpression of KLF-4 and RNAi-mediated inhibition of endogenous KLF-4 supported the role of KLF-4 as a transcriptional repressor of VEGF and an inhibitor of angiogenesis in breast cancer cells. We show that KLF-4 recruits histone deacetylases (HDACs) -2 and -3 at the VEGF promoter. Chronological ChIP assays demonstrated the occupancy of KLF-4, HDAC2, and HDAC3 in the VEGF promoter in normal MCF-10A cells but not in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Co-transfection of KLF-4 and HDAC expression plasmids in breast cancer cells results in synergistic repression of VEGF expression and inhibition of angiogenic potential of these carcinoma cells. Together these results identify a new mechanism of VEGF up-regulation in cancer that involves concomitant loss of KLF-4-HDAC-mediated transcriptional repression and active recruitment of SAF-1-mediated transcriptional activation."

The compound decreased the expression of ERα while increased the expression of ERβ thereby altering ERα/ERβ ratio in both cell lines. Although the compound showed low binding affinity to ERs, it acted as ERα antagonist and ERβ agonist in decreasing ERE- or AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation in these cells. Transactivation studies in ERα/β-transfected MDA-MB231 cells suggested that at cyclin D1 promoter, compound antagonized the action of ERα-mediated E2 response while acted as estrogen agonist via ERβ. Further, the compound led to decreased expression of ERα-dependent proliferation markers and ERβ-dependent cell cycle progression markers. The expression of cell cycle inhibitory protein p21 was increased leading to G2/M phase arrest. In parallel, compound also interfered with EGFR activation, caused inhibition of PI-3-K/Akt pathway and subsequent induction of apoptosis via intrinsic pathway. A significant reduction in tumor mass and volume was observed in 85/287-treated mice bearing MCF-7 xenograft. We conclude that compound 85/287 exhibits significant anti-tumor activity via modulation of genomic as well as non-genomic mechanisms involved in cellular growth and arrested the cells in G2 phase in both MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells.

Temperature and copper exerted additive effects on lysosomal membrane stability, exacerbating the toxic effects of metal cations present in non-physiological concentrations. Mussel lysosomal membrane stability is known to be positively related to scope for growth, indicating possible effects of increasing temperature on mussel populations in metal-polluted areas. To clarify the molecular response to environmental stressors, we used a cDNA microarray with 1,673 sequences to measure the relative transcript abundances in the gills of mussels exposed to copper (40 µg/L) and a temperature gradient (16°C, 20°C, and 24°C). In animals exposed only to heat stress, hierarchical clustering of the microarray data revealed three main clusters, which were largely dominated by down-regulation of translation-related differentially expressed genes, drastic up-regulation of protein folding related genes, and genes involved in chitin metabolism. The response of mussels exposed to copper at 24°C was characterized by an opposite pattern of the genes involved in translation, most of which were up-regulated, as well as the down-regulation of genes encoding heat shock proteins and &quot;microtubule-based movement&quot; proteins.

Based on data from 454 high-throughput sequencing (GS FLX) exposure to salt stress, an unknown functional MYB-related gene LcMYB1 was identified from sheepgrass. Tissue specific expression profiles showed that the LcMYB1 gene was expressed ubiquitously in different tissues, with higher expression levels observed in the rhizome and panicle. The expression of LcMYB1 was induced obviously by high salt, drought and abscisic acid and was induced slightly by cold. A fusion protein of LcMYB1 with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was localized to the nucleus, and yeast one-hybrid analysis indicated that LcMYB1 was an activator of transcriptional activity. LcMYB1-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to salt stress than WT plants. The amounts of proline and soluble sugars were higher in transgenic Arabidopsis than in WT plants under salt stress conditions. The overexpression of LcMYB1 enhanced the expression levels of P5CS1 and inhibited other salt stress response gene markers. These findings demonstrate that LcMYB1 influences the intricate salt stress response signaling networks by promoting different pathways than the classical DREB1A- and MYB2-mediated signaling pathway. Additionally, LcMYB1 is a promising gene resource for improving salinity tolerance in crops."

We examined the effect of TFAP2C overexpression in a basal cell line and characterized the expression of TFAP2C and CD44 in breast cancer specimens to determine if expression was associated with clinical response.METHODS: MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with a TFAP2C-containing plasmid and evaluated for effects on CD44 expression. Pretreatment biopsy cores from patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer were evaluated for TFAP2A, p53, TFAP2C, and CD44 expression by immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Overexpression of TFAP2C in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in decreased expression of CD44 mRNA and protein, P &lt; 0.05. A pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy was achieved in 17% of patients (4/23). Average expression for TFAP2C by immunohistochemistry in patients with a pCR was 93%, compared with 46% in patients with residual disease, P = 0.016; and in tumors that stained at ≥80% for TFAP2C, 4 of 9 (44%) achieved pCR, compared with 0 of 14 below 80%, P = 0.01.

The largest numbers of the HvGST genes (50) were included in the Tau class followed by 21 genes in Phi, five in Zeta, two in DHAR, two in EF1G, two in Lambda, and one each in TCHQD and Theta classes. Phylogenetic analysis of the putative GSTs from Arabidopsis, rice, and barley indicated that major functional diversification within the GST family predated the monocot/dicot divergence. However, intra-specious duplication seems to be common. Expression patterns of five GST genes from Phi and Tau classes were investigated in three barley genotypes (Yusof [drought-tolerant], Moroc9-75 [drought-sensitive], and HS1 [wild ecotype]) under control and drought-stressed conditions, during the vegetative stage. All investigated genes were up-regulated significantly under drought stress and/or showed a higher level of transcripts in the tolerant cultivar. Additionally, GST enzyme activity was superior in Yusof and induced in the extreme-drought-treated leaves, while it was not changed in Moroc9-75 under drought conditions. Moreover, the lowest and highest levels of lipid peroxidation were observed in the Yusof and Moroc9-75 cultivars, respectively. Based on the achieved results, detoxification and antioxidant activity of GSTs might be considered an important factor in the drought tolerance of barley genotypes for further investigations."

Tocopherol deficiency has been shown to affect germination, retard growth and change responses to abiotic stress, suggesting that tocopherols may be involved in a number of diverse physiological processes in plants. Instead of seeking constitutive synthesis of tocopherols to improve stress tolerance, we followed an inducible approach of enhancing α-tocopherol accumulation under dehydration conditions in tobacco. Two uncharacterized stress inducible promoters isolated from Arabidopsis and the VTE2.1 gene from Solanum chilense were used in this work. VTE2.1 encodes the enzyme homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT), which catalyzes the prenylation step in tocopherol biosynthesis. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing ScVTE2.1 under the control of stress-inducible promoters showed increased levels of α-tocopherol when exposed to drought conditions. The accumulation of α-tocopherol correlated with higher water content and increased photosynthetic performance and less oxidative stress damage as evidenced by reduced lipid peroxidation and delayed leaf senescence. Our results indicate that stress-induced expression of VTE2.1 can be used to increase the vitamin E content and to diminish detrimental effects of environmental stress in plants. The stress-inducible promoters introduced in this work may prove valuable to future biotechnological approaches in improving abiotic stress resistance in plants."

We report that AHRR expression is inhibited by tristetraprolin (TTP), an AU-rich element (ARE)-binding protein. Overexpression of TTP decreased the mRNA stability and protein expression of AHRR, and TTP-overexpressing cells made smaller colonies than the control. Contrarily, inhibition of TTP by siRNA increased AHRR expression. Analyses of point mutants of the AREs demonstrated that AREs were responsible for the TTP-mediated destabilization of AHRR mRNA. RNA EMSA revealed that TTP directly binds to the AHRR 3'UTR. Taken together, we demonstrate that TTP acts as a negative regulator of AHRR and may affect tumor development through induction of tumor suppressor genes as observed in MDA-MB435."

Its prognostic relevance for breast cancer is unclear so far. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of HTRA1 mRNA expression on patient outcome using a cohort of 131 breast cancer patients as well as a validation cohort including 2809 publically available data sets. Additionally, we aimed at investigating for the presence of promoter hypermethylation as a mechanism for silencing the HTRA1 gene in breast tumors. HTRA1 downregulation was detected in more than 50% of the breast cancer specimens and was associated with higher tumor stage (p = 0.025). By applying Cox proportional hazard models, we observed favorable overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) related to high HTRA1 expression (HR = 0.45 [CI 0.23-0.90], p = 0.023; HR = 0.55 [CI 0.32-0.94], p = 0.028, respectively), with even more pronounced impact in node-positive patients (HR = 0.21 [CI 0.07-0.63], p = 0.006; HR = 0.29 [CI 0.13-0.65], p = 0.002, respectively). Moreover, HTRA1 remained a statistically significant factor predicting DFS among established clinical parameters in the multivariable analysis. Its impact on patient outcome was independently confirmed in the validation set (for relapse-free survival (n = 2809): HR = 0.79 [CI 0.7-0.9], log-rank p = 0.0003; for OS (n = 971): HR = 0.63 [CI 0.48-0.83], log-rank p = 0.0009). In promoter analyses, we in fact detected methylation of HTRA1 in a small subset of breast cancer specimens (two out of a series of 12), and in MCF-7 breast cancer cells which exhibited 22-fold lower HTRA1 mRNA expression levels compared to unmethylated MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, we show that downregulation of HTRA1 is associated with shorter patient survival, particularly in node-positive breast cancer. Since HTRA1 loss was demonstrated to induce EMT and cancer cell invasion, these patients might benefit from demethylating agents or histone deacetylase inhibitors previously reported to lead to HTRA1 upregulation, or from novel small-molecule inhibitors targeting EMT-related processes."

However, the role of endogenous FKBPL in angiogenesis is not well characterised. Here we investigated the molecular effects of the endogenous protein and its peptide derivative, AD-01, leading to their anti-migratory activity. Inhibition of secreted FKBPL using a blocking antibody or siRNA-mediated knockdown of FKBPL accelerated the migration of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Furthermore, MDA-MB-231 tumour cells stably overexpressing FKBPL inhibited tumour vascular development in vivo suggesting that FKBPL secreted from tumour cells could inhibit angiogenesis. Whilst FKBPL and AD-01 target CD44, the nature of this interaction is not known and here we have further interrogated this aspect. We have demonstrated that FKBPL and AD-01 bind to the CD44 receptor and inhibit tumour cell migration in a CD44 dependant manner; CD44 knockdown abrogated AD-01 binding as well as its anti-migratory activity. Interestingly, FKBPL overexpression and knockdown or treatment with AD-01, regulated CD44 expression, suggesting a co-regulatory pathway for these two proteins. Downstream of CD44, alterations in the actin cytoskeleton, indicated by intense cortical actin staining and a lack of cell spreading and communication were observed following treatment with AD-01, explaining the anti-migratory phenotype. Concomitantly, AD-01 inhibited Rac-1 activity, up-regulated RhoA and the actin binding proteins, profilin and vinculin. Thus the anti-angiogenic protein, FKBPL, and AD-01, offer a promising and alternative approach for targeting both CD44 positive tumours and vasculature networks."

The three bacterial strains included a cadmium resistant Ochrobactrum sp., a lead resistant Bacillus sp. and an arsenic resistant Bacillus sp. designated as CdSP9, PbSP6, and AsSP9, respectively. When these isolates were used as inocula applied to metal-treated rice plants of variety Satabdi, the germination percentage, relative root elongation (RRE), amylase and protease activities were increased. The toxic effect of metal was reduced in presence of these bacteria. The overall biomass and root/shoot ratio were also enhanced by bacterial inoculation. Hydroponic studies showed that the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level, which had been increased in the presence of metal stress in rice roots, were lowered by the bacterial inoculation. In addition, all three strains were 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase and catalase positive, whereas siderophore producing ability was lacking in PbSP6. However, both PbSP6 and AsSP9 were protease positive and could hydrolyse starch. The data indicate that these bacteria have promise for bioremediation as well as for plant growth promotion."

In this report Rab28 LEA gene has been over-expressed in maize plants under a constitutive maize promoter. The expression of Rab28 transcripts led to the accumulation and stability of Rab28 protein in the transgenic plants. Native Rab28 protein is localized to nucleoli in wild type maize embryo cells; here we find by whole-mount immunocytochemistry that in root cells of Rab28 transgenic and wild-type plants the protein is also associated to nucleolar structures. Transgenic plants were tested for stress tolerance and resulted in sustained growth under polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-mediated dehydration compared to wild-type controls. Under osmotic stress transgenic seedlings showed increased leaf and root areas, higher relative water content (RWC), reduced chlorophyll loss and lower Malondialdehyde (MDA) production in relation to wild-type plants. Moreover, transgenic seeds exhibited higher germination rates than wild-type seeds under water deficit. Overall, our results highlight the presence of transgenic Rab28 protein in nucleolar structures and point to the potential of group 5 LEA Rab28 gene as candidate to enhance stress tolerance in maize plants."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression pattern of miR-96 in breast cancer and its biological role in tumor progression. The expression levels of miR-96 were analyzed in 38 breast cancer specimens and 6 breast cancer cell lines by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The effect of miR-96 on proliferation was evaluated by MTT assays, and cell migration and invasion were evaluated by transwell assays in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate the regulation of a putative target of miR-96. The effects of modulating miR-96 on endogenous levels of this potential target were subsequently confirmed via qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. We found that expression of miR-96 was commonly upregulated in breast cancer cells and breast cancer specimens when compared with that in non-malignant breast epithelial cells and adjacent normal tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-96 promoted cellular proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, whereas inhibition of miR-96 suppressed those functions. Luciferase assays revealed that miR-96 directly bound to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of RECK. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis confirmed that miR-96 regulated the expression of RECK both at the mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of RECK expression in MDA-MB-231 cells by siRNA significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Collectively, miR-96 was significantly upregulated in breast cancer. our data also delineate the molecular pathway by which miR-96 promotes breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion. Our findings may have important implications for the treatment of breast cancer."

The human lymphocytes were cultured in eight different doses of DON (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 250 and 500 ng/mL) during 6, 12 and 24 h. DON was able to decrease cell viability and cause damage to the membrane, the chromosomes or the DNA at all times of culture. It was also able to induce lipid peroxidation and raise the levels of 8-OHdG and ROS in 6, 12 and 24 h. The results of the RT-PCR and the Western Blot indicated that DON is able to enhance mRNA or protein expressions of DNA repair genes and HO-1 in 6 h and to inhibit these expressions in 24 h. DON potentially triggers genotoxicity in human lymphocytes. This mechanism is probably related to depletion of antioxidase and oxidative damage to the DNA that reduced expression of HO-1, thereby inhibiting the ability of DNA repair."

The significant inductions of FeSOD, MnSOD, APX2, CAT1 and CAT3 isoforms in tolerant genotypes suggested their participation in heat tolerance. The differential isoform patterns of SOD, APX and CAT between stems and roots also indicated their tissue specificity. Furthermore, despite the sequence similarity of the studied antioxidant genes among &quot;C. maxima&quot; and &quot;Maxchata&quot;, most of these genes were highly induced under heat stress in &quot;Maxchata&quot;, which contributed to its heat tolerance.

This study evaluated the role of Nrf2-ARE signal pathway in protecting the brain from seizure-mediated damage. Wistar rats and Nrf2-deficient or control mice were chronic kindled in the amygdala. Sulforaphane (SF) was used to activate Nrf2-ARE signal pathway. The progression of kindling, the cognitive impairment and oxidative stress parameters were assessed to determine the extent of seizure-mediated brain damage. Our results indicate that activation Nrf2-ARE signal pathway with SF in hippocampus suppressed the progression of amygdala kindling, and also ameliorated the cognitive impairment and oxidative stress induced by epileptic seizure. These observations suggest that Nrf2-ARE signal pathway may represent a strategic target for epilepsy therapies."

Knockout of AHR or ARNT prevented the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-dependent induction of all AHR target genes examined. Knockout of AHR or ARNT also significantly reduced basal cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1) expression levels, which were restored with overexpression of either protein but not with a DNA binding-deficient AHR mutant. Basal and TCDD-, 17β-estradiol (E2)-, or TCDD + E2-dependent recruitment of AHR, ARNT, ERα, NCoA3, and RNA polymerase II to CYP1B1 as well as CYP1B1 mRNA levels were abolished in MCF7-AHR((ko)) and MDA-MB-231 AHR(ko) cells. However, reduced but significant E2-dependent recruitment of ERα, NCoA3, and RNA polymerase II to CYP1B1 and weak increases in CYP1B1 mRNA levels were observed in MCF7 ARNT((ko)) cells. Interestingly, E2-dependent increases in trefoil factor 1, but not growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1) mRNA levels, were dependent on ARNT expression. Moreover, the TCDD-dependent increases in the proteolytic degradation of ERα were prevented by the loss of AHR or ARNT. Our data show that AHR and ARNT play critical roles in the basal, TCDD, and E2-induced regulation of CYP1B1 but also reveal distinct roles for both proteins in ERα transactivation."

The oncogene, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers, where it stimulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), an important enzyme in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix. However, its role in breast cancer remains poorly understood. This study assessed the clinical significance of MDM2 expression in IDC and used in vitro expression assays to determine the molecular roles of MDM2. Immunohistochemical staining for MMP9 and MDM2 was performed using archived tumor blocks from 321 women who underwent surgical resection for IDC at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, China between January 2002 and December 2003. MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231 cell lines were transfected with siRNA targeted against MDM2, or MDM2 was overexpressed using transiently expressed vectors. The invasion, cell migration and proteolytic capabilities of cells that over- or underexpressed MDM2 was then assessed and compared against control cells, in addition to the consequent effects on MMP9 expression using RT-PCR. In vivo, 54.9% and 49.6% of samples were positive for MMP9 and MDM2 expression, respectively, and their expression was significantly correlated (r² = 0.171, P = 0.012). Moreover, MDM2 expression was markedly correlated with disease-free survival (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.02-6.40, P = 0.038). In vitro, MDM2 overexpression significantly enhanced cell invasion, migration and proteolysis compared with control cells, and the converse effects were observed after MDM2-siRNA treatment. MDM2 overexpression induced MMP9 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that high levels of MDM2 are associated with a poorer prognosis in IDC. This might result from increased tumor invasiveness due to enhanced MMP9 expression causing increased extracellular matrix breakdown."

We previously demonstrated that SCUBE2 is a novel breast-tumor suppressor and could be a useful prognostic marker. However, the role of SCUBE2 in breast-cancer cell migration and invasion and how it is regulated during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remain undefined. In this study, we showed that ectopic SCUBE2 overexpression could enhance the formation of E-cadherin-containing adherens junctions by β-catenin-SOX-mediated induction of forkhead box A1 (a positive regulator of E-cadherin) and upregulation of E-cadherin, which in turn led to epithelial transition and inhibited migration and invasion of aggressive MDA-MB-231 breast-carcinoma cells. SCUBE2 expression was repressed together with that of E-cadherin in TGF-β-induced EMT; direct expression of SCUBE2 alone was sufficient to inhibit the TGF-β-induced EMT. Furthermore, quantitative DNA methylation, methylation-specific PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that SCUBE2 expression was inactivated by DNA hypermethylation at the CpG islands by recruiting and binding DNA methyltransferase 1 during TGF-β-induced EMT. Together, our results suggest that SCUBE2 plays a key role in suppressing breast-carcinoma-cell mobility and invasiveness by increasing the formation of the epithelial E-cadherin-containing adherens junctions to promote epithelial differentiation and drive the reversal of EMT."

Overexpression of MBD2 in breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A results in induced expression and demethylation of hsa-mir-496 while depletion of MBD2 in a human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 results in suppression of hsa-mir-496. Activation of hsa-mir-496 by MBD2 is associated with silencing of several of its target genes while depletion of MBD2 leads to induction of hsa-mir-496 target genes. Depletion of hsa-mir-496 by locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotide leads to activation of these target genes in MBD2 overexpressing cells supporting that hsa-mir-496 is mediating in part the effects of MBD2 on gene expression. We demonstrate that MBD2 binds the promoter of hsa-mir-496 in MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and that it activates an in vitro methylated hsa-mir-496 promoter driving a CG-less luciferase reporter in a transient transfection assay.

Apart from the inhibitory effect on MDA production in vitro and in vivo, the results showed that RES (10(-10)mol/L to 10(-5)mol/L) could significantly increase the cell viability and decrease the LDH activity and that RES (15mg/kg) treatment could alleviate the depression-like behavior of CUMS rats, as indicated by increased sucrose preference and decreased immobility in forced swimming test and tail suspension test. Rats that received RES treatment displayed a reduction of serum CORT, suggesting that RES affected the hyperactivity of the HPA axis in CUMS rats. However, RES did not affect the expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA in the hypothalamus of CUMS rats. In summary, our results demonstrated that in addition to its widely known antioxidant properties, RES also has antidepressant-like effects, and suggested that the underlying mechanism might involve its peripheral effect on the regulation of the HPA axis."

Among differentially expressed genes, oxidative stress response genes played important roles in cryoprotectant treatment, and peroxidation was a key factor related to cell survival. Seedlings underwent more peroxidation at 72-h than at 48-h. A comprehensive analysis indicated that peroxidation injured membrane systems leading to photophosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation damage. Furthermore, the apoptosis-like events were found in cryogenic treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings. 48- and 72-h seedlings underwent different degrees of membrane lipid peroxidation during cryoprotectant treatment, and reducing the injury of oxidative stress was an important factor to successful cryopreservation. This study provided a novel insight of genetic regulatory mechanisms in cryopreservation, and established an excellent model to test and evaluate the effect of exogenous antioxidants and conventional cryoprotectants in plant cryopreservation."

Thus, obtaining a reliable signature in the context of isogenic nature of the cells has been challenging and the precise contribution of isogenic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) versus non-TNBC remains poorly defined.METHODS: We established isogenic stable cell lines representing TNBC and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancers by introducing HER2 in TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. We examined protein level expression and functionality of the transfected receptor by treatment with an antagonist of HER2. Using microarray profiling, we obtained a comprehensive gene list of differentially expressed between TNBC and HER2+ clones. We identified and validated underlying isogenic components using qPCR and also compared results with expression data from patients with similar breast cancer subtypes.RESULTS: We identified 544 and 1087 statistically significant differentially expressed genes between isogenic TNBC and HER2+ samples in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 backgrounds respectively and a shared signature of 49 genes. By comparing results from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 backgrounds with two patient microarray datasets, we identified 17 and 22 common genes with same expression trend respectively. Additionally, we identified 56 and 78 genes from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 comparisons respectively present in our published RNA-seq data.CONCLUSIONS: Using our unique model system, we have identified an isogenic gene expression signature between TNBC and HER2+ breast cancer. A portion of our results was also verified in patient data samples, indicating an existence of isogenic element associated with HER2 status between genetically heterogeneous breast cancer samples. These findings may potentially contribute to the development of molecular platform that would be valuable for diagnostic and therapeutic decision for TNBC and in distinguishing it from HER2+ subtype."

Very little is known about the molecular basis of HIC1 in antagonizing oncogenic pathways. Here, we report that HIC1 forms complexes with the signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and attenuates STAT3-mediated transcription. STAT3 was identified as a HIC1-interacting protein by affinity capture and followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Overexpression or depletion of HIC1 resulted in decreased or increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6)/oncostatin M (OSM)-induced STAT3-mediated reporter activity and expression of target genes such as VEGF and c-Myc, respectively. Furthermore, HIC1 suppressing the VEGF and c-Myc promoter activity and the colony formation of MDA-MB 231 cells were STAT3-dependent. Further studies showed that HIC1 interacts with the DNA binding domain of STAT3 and suppresses the binding of STAT3 to its target gene promoters. Domain mapping study revealed that HIC1 C-terminal domain binds to STAT3. HIC1 mutant defective in STAT3 interaction reduced its repressive effect on STAT3 DNA binding activity, the reporter activity and gene expression of the VEGF and c-Myc genes, and cell growth in MDA-MB 231 cells. Altogether, our findings not only provide a novel role of HIC1 in antagonizing STAT3-mediated activation of VEGF and c-Myc gene expression and cell growth, but also elucidate a molecular basis underlying the inhibitory effect of HIC1 on STAT3 transcriptional potential."

The non-ice-binding region II (RII), one of five distinct domains in MpAFP, constitutes ~ 90% of the protein. RII consists of ~ 120 tandem copies of an identical 104-residue sequence. We used the Protein Homology/analogy Recognition Engine server to define the boundaries of a single 104-residue RII construct (RII monomer). CD demonstrated that Ca(2+) is required for RII monomer folding, and that the monomer is fully structured at a Ca(2+) /protein molar ratio of 10 : 1. The crystal structure of the RII monomer was solved to a resolution of 1.35 Å by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion and molecular replacement methods with Ca(2+) as the heavy atom to obtain phase information. The RII monomer folds as a Ca(2+) -bound immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich. Ca(2+) ions are coordinated at the interfaces between each RII monomer and its symmetry-related molecules, suggesting that these ions may be involved in the stabilization of the tandemly repeated RII. We hypothesize that &gt; 600 Ca(2+) ions help to rigidify the chain of 104-residue repeats in order to project the ice-binding domain of MpAFP away from the bacterial cell surface. The proposed role of RII is to help the strictly aerobic bacterium bind surface ice in an Antarctic lake for better access to oxygen and nutrients. This work may give insights into other bacterial proteins that resemble MpAFP, especially those of the large repeats-in-toxin family that have been characterized as adhesins exported via the type I secretion pathway."

It is involved in the development and progression of several human carcinomas, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and lung and breast cancers. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/ETS-1 signaling pathway is involved in regulation of cancer cell proliferation, metastasis and invasion. The biological function of the interaction between LINE-1 ORF-1p and the HGF/ETS-1 signaling pathway in regulation of human breast cancer proliferation remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that LINE-1 ORF-1p enhanced ETS-1 transcriptional activity and increased expression of downstream genes of ETS-1. Interaction between ETS-1 and LINE-1 ORF-1p was identified by immunoprecipitation assays. LINE-1 ORF-1p modulated ETS-1 activity through cytoplasm/nucleus translocation and recruitment to the ETS-1 binding element in the MMP1 gene promoter. We also showed that LINE-1 ORF-1p promoted proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. By investigating a novel role of the LINE-1 ORF-1p in the HGF/ETS-1 signaling pathway and MDA-MB-231 cells, we demonstrated that LINE-1 ORF-1p may be a novel ETS-1 coactivator and molecular target for therapy of human triple negative breast cancer."

Previous studies have shown that steroid hormones, like progesterone (PROG), regulate BCRP expression. The presence of a progesterone response element (PRE) in the BCRP promoter, suggests that PROG may regulate transcription of BCRP.METHODS: To investigate the role of PROG in the regulation of BCRP expression, two constructs encoding full-length BCRP driven by either an endogenous PRE promoter or a constitutive CMV promoter, were transfected into T47D cells that express the progesterone receptor (PR) or into PR-negative MDA-MB-231 cells.RESULTS: After treatment with PROG, qPCR and Western blotting analyses indicated that BCRP mRNA and BCRP protein levels were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in PR-positive cells, but PROG had no significant effect on BCRP levels in the PR-negative cells. The effect observed in PR-positive cells was reversed by co-treatment with RU-486, a specific PROG inhibitor. Cytometric analysis confirmed that BCRP-mediated drug efflux was inhibited and chemosensitivity to mitoxantrone was markedly increased by PROG treatment.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that PROG reverses BCRP-mediated MDR by down-regulating BCRP expression in breast cancer cells by affecting transcription from the PRE-containing BCRP promoter. Our studies suggest that breast cancer patients with BCRP-mediated MDR may be successfully treated with PROG."

The unlocking of the DNA pore-capping units is achieved by the biocatalytic cleavage of the DNA, and the unlocking process is amplified by the regeneration of the analyte-trigger. The RhB-loaded MP-SiO2 NPs are capped with nucleic acid hairpin structures that lock the RhB in the pores. Opening of the hairpin structures by a nucleic acid analyte trigger or by the formation of an aptamer-substrate (ATP) complex leads to the formation of duplex structures being cleaved by exonuclease III, Exo III, or the nicking enzyme, Nb. BbvCI. This results in the regeneration of the target analytes, the autonomous unlocking of the pores, and the release of RhB. The systems reveal selectivity, and one-, two-, three-base mutations in the target DNA, or substitution of ATP with other triphosphate nucleotides, prohibit the unlocking of the pores. In analogy to the biocatalytic release of the model fluorophore substrates, the anticancer drug camptothecin, CPT, was entrapped in the pores and locked by the 1 or 11 hairpin structures. The drug was released from the pores in the presence of the nucleic acid 2 or ATP and the Exo III, as biocatalyst. Similarly, CPT locked in the pores by the 6 or 12 hairpins were released from the pores in the presence of ATP and Nb. BbvCI, as nicking enzyme, respectively. The effects of the CPT-loaded MP-SiO2 NPs, capped with the ATP-dependent lock 6, on the viability of MDA-231 breast cancer cells and MCF-10a normal breast cells were examined. We find that after 48 h, 65% cell death was observed for the MDA-231 cancer cells, where only 25% cell death was observed for the normal cells. The higher cell death of the cancer cells correlates well with the enhanced metabolic synthesis of ATP in the cancerous cells."

Our studies of LF in Papua New Guinea (PNG) have shown that it is possible to reduce the prevalence of Wb in humans and mosquitoes through mass drug administration (MDA; diethylcarbamazine with/without ivermectin). While MDAs in the Dreikikir region through 1998 significantly reduced prevalence of Wb infection, parasites continue to be transmitted in the area.METHODS: We sequenced the Wb mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase 1 (CO1) gene from 16 people infected with Wb. Patients were selected from 7 villages encompassing both high and moderate annual transmission potentials (ATP). We collected genetic data with the objectives to (i) document contemporary levels of genetic diversity and (ii) distinguish between populations of parasites and hosts across the study area.PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We discovered 109 unique haplotypes currently segregating in the Wb parasite population, with one common haplotype present in 15 out of 16 infections. We found that parasite diversity was similar among people residing within the same village and clustered within transmission zones. For example, in the high transmission area, diversity tended to be more similar between neighboring villages, while in the moderate transmission area, diversity tended to be less similar.CONCLUSIONS: In the Dreikikir region of PNG there are currently high levels of genetic diversity in populations of Wb. High levels of genetic diversity may complicate future MDAs in this region and the presence of dominant haplotypes will require adjustments to current elimination strategies."

The concentration of Al-induced PCD was lower in Zhonghua 2 than in 99-1507. AhSAG, a senescence-associated gene was isolated from cDNA library of Al-stressed peanut with PCD. Open reading frame (ORF) of AhSAG was 474bp, encoding a SAG protein composed of 157 amino acids. Compared to the control and the antisense transgenic tobacco plants, the fast development and blossom of the sense transgenic plants happened to promote senescence. The ability of Al tolerance in sense transgenic tobacco was lower than in antisense transgenic tobacco according to root elongation and Al content analysis. The expression of AhSAG-GFP was higher in sense transgenic tobacco than in antisense transgenic tobacco. Altogether, these results indicated that there was a negative relationship between Al-induced PCD and Al-resistance in peanut, and the AhSAG could induce or promote the occurrence of PCD in plants."

It was expressed in neurons and has been suggested to play a role in cell survival. However, no clear evidence has yet been available for functions of NELL2. In this study, we found two E2F1 binding sites located in the NELL2 promoter region. We examined the expression of NELL2 and E2F1 in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231, MCF7) and bladder cancer cells (5637, UC5). In MDA-MB231 and 5637, the expression levels of NELL2 and E2F1 were higher. To examine the interaction between E2F1 and NELL2, the binding activity was checked by a promoter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. From the results, we suggest that NELL2 is a novel target gene of E2F1, which is a key regulator of cell proliferation. We reveal that expression of NELL2 is regulated by E2F1, specifically, mRNA and protein levels of NELL2 are elevated upon activation of exogenous E2F1. Moreover, cells overexpressing NELL2 increased their invasive ability and an enhancement of the effect was observed when NELL2 and E2F1 were coexpressed in MDA-MB231 cells. Therefore, we suggest a novel activity for NELL2 in cancer progression through the regulation of E2F1."

The testes of male mice subjected to whole body irradiation with carbon ion beam (0.5 and 4Gy) were analyzed at 7days after irradiation. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis approach was employed to investigate the alteration of protein expression in the testes. Spot detection and matching were performed using the PDQuest 8.0 software. A difference of more than threefold in protein quantity (normalized spot volume) is the standard for detecting differentially expressed protein spots. A total of 11 differentially expressed proteins were found. Protein identification was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF). Nine specific proteins were identified by searching the protein sequence database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. These proteins were found involved in molecular chaperones, metabolic enzymes, oxidative stress, sperm function, and spermatogenic cell proliferation. HIR decreased glutathione activity and increased malondialdehyde content in the testes. Given that Pin1 is related to the cell cycle and that proliferation is affected by spermatogenesis, we analyzed testicular histological changes and Pin1 protein expression through immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Alterations of multiple pathways may be associated with HIR toxicity to the testes. Our findings are essential for studies on the development, biology, and pathology of mouse testes after HIR in space or radiotherapy."

Our goal was to design a small peptide that possesses similar functions to an antibody drug conjugate with regard to targeting and killing cancer cells, but that overcomes size restrictions.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a novel cancer-specific killer peptide created by fusion of the toxic peptide (KLAKLAK)2 with the cancer recognition peptide LTVSPWY.RESULTS: This bi-functional peptide showed toxicity to breast cancer, prostate cancer, and neuroblastoma cell lines. Only low toxicity to non-cancer cells, colon cancer, lung cancer, and lymphoma cell lines was observed. In vivo injections of the bi-functional peptide caused tumor growth retardation compared to mice treated with control peptides. The bi-functional peptide caused retardation of MDA-MB-435S tumors in vivo and increased survival to 80% at day 100 after tumor implantation, whereas all control animals died at day 70. Previous reports showed that the recognition moiety LTVSPWY targets the tumor-associated antigen HER2. Here we found that our new peptide TP-Tox also excerts toxic effects on HER2-negative cell lines. Therefore, we searched for the molecular target of the bi-specific peptide using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Our data suggest a possible interaction with RAS GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1).CONCLUSION: We designed a bi-functional peptide of 23 amino acids and demonstrated its ability to bind and kill several cancer cell lines in vitro and to strongly increase survival in breast cancer bearing mice in vivo. This novel toxin could be used in future cancer therapies and warrants further pre-clinical and clinical exploration."

In this study, 96 15-d-old male quails were randomly allocated into 12 groups (eight each group) for exposure to acute (up to 12h) and chronic (up to 20 days) cold stress (12 ± 1°C).

For this purpose, we measured total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDLC), HDL cholesterol (HDLC), total antioxidant ability (TAA), lipid peroxidation indices (LPI), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in HIV negative persons and HIV positive HAART-naïve patients infected with HIV-1 group M subtypes.METHODS: We measured serum TC, LDLC, HDLC, plasma MDA, and TAA concentrations, and calculated LPI indices in 151 HIV-positive HAART-naïve patients and 134 seronegative controls. We also performed gene sequence analysis on samples from 30 patients to determine the effect of viral genotypes on these biochemical parameters. We also determined the correlation between CD4 cell count and the above biochemical parameters.RESULTS: We obtained the following controls/patients values for TC (1.96±0.54/1. 12±0. 48 g/l), LDLC (0. 67±0. 46/0. 43±0. 36 g/l), HDLC (105. 51±28. 10/46. 54±23. 36 mg/dl) TAA (0. 63±0. 17/0. 16±0. 16 mM), MDA (0. 20±0. 07/0. 41±0. 10 µM) and LPI (0. 34±0. 14/26. 02±74. 40). In each case, the difference between the controls and patients was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). There was a positive and statistically significant Pearson correlation between CD4 cell count and HDLC (r = +0.272; p&lt;0.01), TAA (r = +0.199; p&lt;0.05) and a negative and statistically significant Pearson correlation between CD4 cell count and LPI (r = -0.166; p&lt;0.05).

None of the HIV-1 subtypes significantly influenced the levels of the biochemical parameters, but by grouping them as pure subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), the CRF significantly influenced TC levels. TC was significantly lower in patients infected with CRF (0.87±0.27 g/l) compared to patients infected with pure HIV-1 subtypes (1.32±0.68 g/l) (p&lt;0.017).

Both minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA), also known as adenoma malignum, and the benign lesion lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), have been known for some time to exhibit a gastric phenotype and immunophenotype (HIK1083 and/or MUC6 positive). Accumulated evidence suggests that a subset of LEGH (atypical LEGH) exhibits a degree of cytologic and/or architectural atypia which, in some cases, may be associated with and be a precursor of adenocarcinomas exhibiting gastric differentiation, including MDA. Gastric-type adenocarcinoma (GAS), a recently described subtype of cervical adenocarcinoma, is an emerging clinicopathologic entity. These neoplasms exhibit a spectrum of differentiation, including MDA as its very well-differentiated form, are unrelated to HPV, and exhibit aggressive clinical behavior. It is proposed that a LEGH-GAS sequence exists and, from a practical point of view, the development of optimal biomarkers is awaited to assist in early detection of GAS and atypical LEGH, as current HPV-targeted screening generally does not detect these lesions and strategies employing HPV vaccination will not prevent their occurrence. Pathologists should be familiar with the morphologic spectrum of these benign, premalignant, and malignant cervical glandular lesions exhibiting gastric differentiation.

The primary focus on the toxicity of PAHs is their ability to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated pathway and lead to carcinogenesis in different organisms. However, the influence of PAHs on the antioxidant system in mammalian systems has received only limited attention. In the present study, we observed that the intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) into mice significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and decreased glutathione (GSH) contents and the activity of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), indicating that serious oxidative stress had been induced in the liver of mice. Then, the oxidative stress signal activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) pathway by enhancing the mRNA levels of Nrf2, p38, and Erk2. Moreover, the mRNA levels of Nrf2/ARE target genes, including glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione synthetase (GS), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1), and Sod2, increased significantly after treatment with 3MC for 24 hours. The hepatic levels of NQO1 and the activities of GR and GS were also significantly enhanced at 24 hours after 3MC treatment. Because the expression of NQO1 is co-regulated by Nrf2/ARE and AhR/XRE in mammalian tissues, NQO1 may play an important role in protecting against the oxidative stress induced by 3MC. Taken together, our findings suggested that acute exposure to 3MC altered the cellular redox balance in hepatocytes to trigger Nrf2-regulated antioxidant responses, which may represent an adaptive cell defense mechanism against the oxidative stress induced by PAHs."

The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of conditionally replicating adenovirus (CRAd) in combination with X-ray irradiation on the proliferation and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells, as well as to determine the molecular mechanisms involved. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated simultaneously with CRAd and X-ray irradiation. Then, cell viability was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry with Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) double-staining. The expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), death receptor 5 (DR5), caspase-3 and caspase-8 mRNA was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of TRAIL, DR5, caspase-3 and caspase-8 protein was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting, respectively. The results showed that CRAd, in combination with irradiation, inhibited cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis and significantly increased the expression of TRAIL, DR5, caspase-3 and caspase-8 mRNA and proteins in MDA-MB-231 cells. Therefore, three aspects, including the targeted killing effect of CRAd, the apoptosis-promoting role of TRAIL and the direct killing effect of ionizing radiation to MDA-MB-231 cells, contribute to the mechanisms of CRAd in combination with irradiation to inhibit the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells.

Microarray analysis of MCF-7 cells cultured under these conditions showed that expression of 105 of 1,357 genes potentially related to the pathogenesis of breast neoplasm was significantly altered by heparin treatment. The changes in gene expression correlated with a less tumourigenic phenotype, including reduction of cell adhesive, invasive and migratory properties. These effects were associated with an inhibition of the PI3K/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathways. The modulatory effect of heparin on HS-associated activity was confirmed with one example of heparin/HS interactomes, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). The innate TGFβ activity of MCF-7 cells was reduced by heparin treatment, with specific interruption of the TGFβ-Smad signalling pathway. The pro-tumourigenic contribution of the heparin/HS interactomes was verified in cells in which HSPG synthesis was blocked using β-xyloside. In conclusion, the interaction between cell surface HPSGs and innate heparin/HS interactomes makes a significant contribution to the tumourigenicity."

Although it has no DNA-binding site, AES can regulate transcriptional activity by interacting with transcriptional factors. Emerging evidence indicates that AES may play an important role in tumor metastasis, but the molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, we found that knockdown of AES by RNA interference (RNAi) downregulated RND3 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 and HepG2, two cancer cell lines. Furthermore, luciferase assays showed that overexpression of AES significantly enhanced RND3 promoter activity. Moreover, inhibition of AES both in MDA-MB-231 and HepG2 cells by RNAi significantly promoted cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and invasion, consistent with the effects of RNAi-mediated RND3 knockdown in these cells. For the first time, data are presented showing that alteration of the malignant behavior of cancer cells by AES is related to RND3 regulation, and these findings also provide new insights into the mechanism of AES action in regulating tumor malignancy."

Our aim was to evaluate the transcriptional effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in a more physiological model of breast cancer, consisting of fresh tumor slices exposed to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) at concentrations that can be attained in vivo.METHODS: Tumor samples from post-menopausal breast cancer patients were sliced and cultured for 24 hours with or without 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) 0.5nM or 100nM. Gene expression was analyzed by microarray (SAM paired analysis, FDR≤0.1) or RT-qPCR (p≤0.05, Friedman/Wilcoxon test). Expression of candidate genes was then evaluated in mammary epithelial/breast cancer lineages and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), exposed or not to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) 0.5nM, using RT-qPCR, western blot or immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) 0.5nM or 100nM effects were evaluated in five tumor samples by microarray and seven and 136 genes, respectively, were up-regulated. There was an enrichment of genes containing transcription factor binding sites for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in samples exposed to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) near physiological concentration. Genes up-modulated by both 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) concentrations were CYP24A1, DPP4, CA2, EFTUD1, TKTL1, KCNK3. Expression of candidate genes was subsequently evaluated in another 16 samples by RT-qPCR and up-regulation of CYP24A1, DPP4 and CA2 by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) was confirmed. To evaluate whether the transcripitonal targets of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) 0.5nM were restricted to the epithelial or stromal compartments, gene expression was examined in HB4A, C5.4, SKBR3, MDA-MB231, MCF-7 lineages and CAFs, using RT-qPCR. In epithelial cells, there was a clear induction of CYP24A1, CA2, CD14 and IL1RL1. In fibroblasts, in addition to CYP24A1 induction, there was a trend towards up-regulation of CA2, IL1RL1, and DPP4. A higher protein expression of CD14 in epithelial cells and CA2 and DPP4 in CAFs exposed to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) 0.5nM was detected.CONCLUSIONS: In breast cancer specimens a short period of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) exposure at near physiological concentration modestly activates the hormone transcriptional pathway. Induction of CYP24A1, CA2, DPP4, IL1RL1 expression appears to reflect 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) effects in epithelial as well as stromal cells, however, induction of CD14 expression is likely restricted to the epithelial compartment."

In mammals, ATR is essential whose complete absence results in early embryonic lethality and its hypomorphic mutation causes a complex disease known as Seckel syndrome. However, molecular mechanisms that cause a wide variety of symptoms including accelerated aging have remained unclear. Similarly, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a deletion mutant of ATR ortholog atl-1 appears to develop into normal adults, but their eggs do not hatch and die at early embryogenesis. Here we show that the parental worms of atl-1 defective mutant achieved longevity. Transcription levels of certain superoxide dismutase genes, sod-3 and -5 and enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutases significantly increased in the mutant. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation such as a formation of malondialdehyde was attenuated. Expressions of other genes regulated by DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor were also altered. In contrast, the mutant became hypersensitive to rotenone and ethidium bromide. Compared with the wild type the mitochondrial DNA copy number in the mutant was lesser and its proliferation is more severely inhibited in the presence of rotenone. These results suggest that C. elegans ATL-1 is involved not only in the nuclear checkpoint control but also in the mitochondrial maintenance, and its dysfunction activates mild oxidative stress response, resulting in an alteration of life span."

Papain hydrolysates, which showed clearly superior free radical scavenging activity, were further purified using consecutive chromatographic methods. Finally, a novel antioxidant peptide was obtained, and the sequence was identified as Ser-Leu-Pro-Ile-Gly-Leu-Met-Ile-Ala-Met at N-terminal.

BRMS1 interacts with several nuclear proteins including SIN3:HDAC chromatin remodeling complexes that are involved in repressing transcription. However, recent reports suggest BRMS1 may function in the cytoplasm. BRMS1 has two predicted nuclear localization sequences (NLS) that are located near the C-terminus (amino acids 198-205 and 238-244, NLS1 and NLS2 respectively). We hypothesized that nuclear localization sequences of BRMS1 were essential for BRMS1 mediated metastasis suppression. Replacement of NLS2 with NLS1 (BRMS1(NLS1,1)), truncation at 238 (BRMS1(ΔNLS2)), or switching the location of NLS1 and NLS2 (BRMS1(NLS2,1)) did not affect nuclear localization; but, replacement of NLS1 with NLS2 (BRMS1(NLS2,2)) or truncation at 197 (BRMS1(ΔNLS) which removes both NLS) promoted cytoplasmic localization. MDA-MB-231 human metastatic breast cancer cells transduced with BRMS1(NLS1,1), BRMS1(NLS2,2) or BRMS1(NLS2,1) were evaluated for metastasis suppression in an experimental xenograft mouse model. Interestingly, while NLS2 was not necessary for nuclear localization, it was found to be important for metastasis suppression since BRMS1(NLS2,2) suppressed metastasis by 85%. In contrast, BRMS1(NLS2,1) and BRMS1(NLS1,1) did not significantly suppress metastasis. Both BRMS1 and BRMS1(NLS2,2) co-immunoprecipitated with SIN3A in the nucleus and cytoplasm; however, BRMS1(NLS1,1) and BRMS1(NLS2,1) were associated with SIN3A in the nucleus only. Moreover, BRMS1 and BRMS1(NLS2,2), but not BRMS1(NLS1,1) and BRMS1(NLS2,1), down-regulated the pro-metastatic microRNA, miR-10b. Together, these data demonstrate an important role for NLS2 in the cytoplasm that is critical for metastasis suppression and is distinct from nuclear localization."

In order to investigate the physiological characteristics and geno-toxicity effects of foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L) Beauv) under different Cu2+ stress, four genotypes of foxtail millet (Zhaogu, Huangmi, An06, D2-8) from Shanxi, China were cultivated for 30 days in a pot filled with soil of with different mass concentrations of Cu2+ (0, 50, 100, 200, 400 mg.kg-l). Effects of Cu2+ stress on DNA damage of genome in foxtail millet were studied using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) , and the contents of soluble sugar, proline and MDA were tested. The result showed that the content of soluble sugar had a trend of initial increased followed by decline in all four foxtail millet seedlings in response to the rising Cu2+ concentration, and the maximum value was 50 mg.kg-1. At Cu2 concentrations of 200 mg. kg-1 or more, the soluble sugar content in the four kinds of millet showed an average reduction of 32.44% to 56.5% compared to that of the control group. The result showed that proline synthesis was enhanced at low concentrations (less than 50 mg.kg-1) , but inhibited at high concentrations (more than 100 mg.kg-1), and the contents of MDA in the four genotypes of foxtail millet were significantly increased compared with the control group (P &lt;0. 05). The changes occurring in random amplified polymorphic DNA profiles of the four genotypes of foxtail millet following Cu' treatment included loss of normal bands, appearance of new bands and variation in band intensity compared to the plantlet without treatment, showing that Cu2+ significantly affected the stability of the genomic DNA in the cells of millet seedlings. Additionally, the effect of DNA polymorphism changes was dose-dependent with the Cu2+ concentration. The different genotypes of millet showed different response in the physiological and genetic damage under Cu2+ stress. The change of DNA polymorphism using RAPD technique could be used as the biomarkers to find genotoxic effects of Cu2+."

Quantitative methylation analysis by MassArray revealed that CpG sites in SASH1 promoter shared similar methylation pattern in tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue. The CpG sites with significant difference in methylation level were CpG_26.27 and CpG_54.55.

The C4-PEPC gene (pepc) from maize in the transgenic rice plants was checked by PCR. Comparison of yield components and photosynthetic indices between PC and untransformed wild-type (WT) plants indicated that increased yield in PC was associated with higher net photosynthetic rate and higher activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). Both PC and WT plants were treated with 1 mmol L(-1) abscisic acid (ABA), 0.04% 1-butanol (BA), 2 mmol L(-1) neomycin (NS), or 2 mmol L(-1) diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) to investigate the relationship between photosynthesis and levels of H2O2 and phosphatidic acid. In both PC and WT, ABA induced H2O2 generation and simultaneous decrease in stomatal conductance (g(s)). PC plants treated with BA showed decreased H2O2 content and strongly increased g(s) within 2 h of treatment. Similar results were observed in response to DPI treatment in PC. However, WT did not observe the decrease of H2O2 during the treatments of BA and DPI. The reduced H2O2 content in PC caused by BA treatment differed to that induced by DPI because BA did not inhibit NADPH oxidase activities. While BA induced a larger PEPC activity in PC, and higher catalase activity as well. These results indicated that the regulation of endogenous H2O2 metabolism of PC could be helpful for enhancing photosynthetic capability."

This protein is hydrophilic with an aliphatic index of 81.64 and its structure consisting of α-helixes, β-turns, and random coils. The AnAPX protein showed 93%, 87%, 87%, 87%, and 86% similarities to the APX homologs from Zantedeschia aethiopica, Vitis pseudoreticulata, Gossypium hirsutum, Elaeis guineensis, and Zea mays, respectively. AnAPX gene transcript was measured non-significantly in roots, stems, leaves, spathes, and spadices by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Interestingly, this gene expression was remarkably up-regulated in response to a cold stress under 6 °C, implying that AnAPX might play an important role in A. andraeanum tolerance to cold stress. To confirm this function we overexpressed AnAPX in tobacco plants by transformation with an AnAPX expression construct driven by CaMV 35S promoter. The transformed tobacco seedlings under 4 °C showed less electrolyte leakage (EL) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content than the control. The content of MDA was correlated with chilling tolerance in these transgenic plants. These results show that AnAPX can prevent the chilling challenged plant from cell membrane damage and ultimately enhance the plant cold tolerance."

It demonstrates potent antitumour activity at much lower doses than parent compounds with high therapeutic efficacy in paediatric blood cancers. Our previous studies in breast cancer cells indicate that 2CdA and F-ara-A are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. We therefore investigated whether ClF influences methylation and expression of selected tumour suppressor genes, such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), and retinoic acid receptor beta 2 (RARbeta2), as well as expression of p53, p21 and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines with different invasive potential. Promoter methylation and gene expression were estimated using methylation-sensitive restriction analysis (MSRA) and real-time PCR, respectively. ClF demonstrated potent growth inhibitory activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells after 96h treatment with IC50 determined as equal to 640nM and 50nM, respectively. In both breast cancer cell lines, ClF led to hypomethylation and up-regulation of APC, PTEN and RARbeta2 as well as increase in p21 expression. Only in non-invasive MCF-7 cells, these changes were associated with down-regulation of DNMT1. Our results provide first evidence of ClF implications in epigenetic regulation of transcriptional activity of selected tumour suppressor genes in breast cancer.

Notably, berberine treatment significantly inhibited cell growth and colony formation in the two cell lines, berberine in combination with cisplatin exerting synergistic growth inhibitory effects.

To provide a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms of action of berberine, we performed genome-wide expression profiling of berberine-treated cells using cDNA microarrays. This revealed that there were 3,397 and 2,706 genes regulated by berberine in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Fene oncology (GO) analysis identified that many of the target genes were involved in regulation of the cell cycle, cell migration, apoptosis, and drug responses.

Aberrant subcellular localisation of PRH is associated with breast cancer and thyroid cancer. Further, in blast crisis chronic myeloid leukaemia, and a subset of acute myeloid leukaemias, PRH is aberrantly localised and its activity is downregulated. Here we show that PRH is involved in the regulation of cell migration and cancer cell invasion. We show for the first time that PRH is expressed in prostate cells and that a decrease in PRH protein levels increases the migration of normal prostate epithelial cells. We show that a decrease in PRH protein levels also increases the migration of normal breast epithelial cells. Conversely, PRH overexpression inhibits cell migration and cell invasion by PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Previous work has shown that the transforming growth factor-β co-receptor Endoglin inhibits the migration of prostate and breast cancer cells. Here we show that PRH can bind to the Endoglin promoter in immortalised prostate and breast cells. PRH overexpression in these cells results in increased Endoglin protein expression, whereas PRH knockdown results in decreased Endoglin protein expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that Endoglin overexpression abrogates the increased migration shown by PRH knockdown cells. Our data suggest that PRH controls the migration of multiple epithelial cell lineages in part at least through the direct transcriptional regulation of Endoglin.

However, the effects of SelS on endothelial cells (ECs) have not been reported. In the present study, the role of SelS in oxidative stress and the underlying mechanism were investigated in human ECs.METHODS: A SelS over-expression plasmid (pc-SelS) and a SelS-siRNA plasmid were transfected into human umbilical vein endothelial cells (American Type Culture Collection, USA). The cells were divided into four groups: control, SelS over-expression (transfected with pc-SelS), vector control, and SelS knockdown (transfected with siRNA-SelS). After treating the cells with H2O2, the effects of oxidative stress and the expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and protein kinase Cα (PKCα) were investigated.RESULTS: Following treatment with H2O2, over-expression of SelS significantly increased cell viability and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) production and Cav-1 gene and protein expression. However, no effects on PKCα were observed. In contrast, knockdown of SelS significantly decreased cell viability, SOD activity, and PKCα gene and protein expression, and increased MDA production and Cav-1 gene and protein expression.CONCLUSIONS: SelS protects ECs from oxidative stress by inhibiting the expression of Cav-1 and PKCα."

Development of methyl-specific labeling protocols combined with improved NMR spectroscopy enable nowadays studies of proteins complexes up to 1 MDa. For such large complexes, the major interest lies in obtaining structural, dynamic and interaction information in solution, which requires sequence-specific resonance assignment of NMR signals. While such analysis is quite standard for small proteins, it remains one of the major bottlenecks when the size of the protein increases. Here, we describe implementation and latest improvements of SeSAM, a fast and user-friendly approach for assignment of methyl resonances in large proteins using mutagenesis. We have improved culture medium to boost the production of methyl-specifically labeled proteins, allowing us to perform small-scale parallel production and purification of a library of (13)CH3-specifically labeled mutants. This optimized protocol is illustrated by assignment of Alanine, Isoleucine, and Valine methyl groups of the homododecameric aminopeptidase PhTET2. We estimated that this improved method allows assignment of ca. 100 methyl cross-peaks in 2 weeks, including 4 days of NMR time and less than 2 k€ of isotopic materials."

Evidence supports that accumulation of endogenous OPPs plays a negative role in physiological metabolism. However, the impacts of dietary OPPs and the mechanisms have not been elucidated yet. The present study evaluated whether oral oxidized casein would destruct the antioxidant defense system and cause potential oxidized injury in mice liver and kidney.METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed oxidized casein (modified respectively by H2O2-Cu and HClO) feeding experiments using KM mice (20-22 g). A 10-weeks feeding of oxidized casein as basal protein caused oxidative stress by increasing protein carbonylation (PC), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), dityrosine (Dityr), lipid peroxidation and ROS levels in mice liver, kidney and blood (P&lt;0.05). In mice liver and kidney, the mRNA expression of Nrf2, γ-GCS, HO-1, GPX-3, and GPX-4 up-regulated, the protein level of Nrf2 in nucleus increased. However, activities of anti-oxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, and GPX) decreased (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, histopathological examination displayed the formation of fibrous septa in mice liver and kidney after oxidized casein feeding.CONCLUSION: Oxidized casein impairs antioxidant defense system and induces hepatic and renal fibrosis."

It has been found that CPF is relatively safe to human but highly toxic to fish. In this study, acute toxicity of CPF on goldfish was determined and then the transcription of goldfish cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A was evaluated after 96 h of CPF exposure at concentrations of 15.3 [1/10 50% lethal concentration (LC50 )] or 51 μg L(-1) (1/3 LC50 ) of CPF. Meanwhile, the enzymatic activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), total antioxidant activity (T-AOC), and the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver or brain of goldfish were also determined. The results of acute toxicity testing showed that the 96-h LC50 of CPF to the goldfish was 153 μg L(-1) . Moreover, a length sequence of 1243 bp CYP3A cDNA encoding for 413 amino acids from goldfish liver was cloned. Polymerase chain reaction results reveal that CPF exposure downregulates CYP 3A transcription in goldfish liver, suggesting that goldfish CYP 3A may be not involved in CPF bioactivation. Finally, the results of biochemical assays indicate that 96 h of CPF exposure remarkably inhibits AChE activity in fish liver or brain, alters hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities, decreases brain T-AOC, and causes lipid peroxidation in fish liver. These results suggest that oxidative stress might be involved in CPF toxicity on goldfish."

Cigarette smoking is the primary risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 25% of individuals with asthma smoke. Smokers experience both longer and more severe colds. We previously showed that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) inhibited HRV-induced expression of a range of epithelial antiviral molecules. Here, we use CXCL10 as a model antiviral gene to examine the mechanisms by which CSE inhibits epithelial antiviral immunity. HRV-induced CXCL10 transcription depends on activation of NF-ĸB and IFN-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), and we now also implicate two signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) consensus sequences in the CXCL10 promoter in HRV-induced CXCL10 expression. CSE inhibited HRV-induced activation and nuclear translocation/binding of both NF-ĸB, and IRF-1 to their respective recognition sequences in the CXCL10 promoter. HRV also induced formation of complexes at the STAT region in the CXCL10 promoter, and HRV-induced activation of STAT-1 was inhibited by CSE. In addition, CSE inhibited HRV-induced chromatin accessibility around the transcriptional start site of the CXCL10 promoter. Although CSE inhibited HRV-induced expression of both the viral double-stranded RNA sensors, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA) 5, only specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) to MDA5, but not nontargeting siRNA, or siRNA to retinoic acid-inducible gene-I, inhibited HRV-induced CXCL10 induction. We conclude that CSE reduces chromatin accessibility and inhibits viral signaling via NF-ĸB, IRF-1, STAT-1, and MDA5. Thus, we show that CSE can simultaneously modulate multiple pathways linked to innate immune responses to HRV infection."

The major aim of this study is to elucidate the effects of rice protein on cholesterol level and oxidative stress in adult rats fed with and without cholesterol. After 2 weeks of feeding, hepatic and plasma contents of cholesterol, reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCO) were measured. In liver, total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC), activities of antioxidant enzymes (total superoxide dismutase, T-SOD; catalase, CAT), glutathione metabolizing enzyme activities and gene expression levels (γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, γ-GCS; glutathione reductase, GR; glutathione peroxidase, GPx) were determined. Under cholesterol-free/enriched dietary condition, T-AOC, activities of T-SOD and CAT, glutathione metabolism related enzymes' activities and mRNA levels (γ-GCS, GR and GPx) were effectively stimulated by rice proteins as compared to caseins. Compared with caseins, rice proteins significantly increased hepatic and plasma GSH contents, whereas hepatic and plasma accumulations of MDA, PCO and GSSG were significantly reduced by rice protein-feedings. As a result, the marked reductions of cholesterol in the plasma and in the liver were observed in adult rats fed rice proteins with and without cholesterol. The present study demonstrates that the hypocholesterolemic effect of rice protein is attributable to inducing antioxidative response and depressing oxidative damage in adult rats fed cholesterol-free/enriched diets. Results suggest that the antioxidant capability involved in the hypocholesterolemic action exerted by rice protein is independent of dietary cholesterol during adult period."

Despite the wealth information we have garnered from these models thus far, a comprehensive time-course analysis of the estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2/neu) receptors on the gene and protein level, coupled with expression array data is currently lacking. We aimed to address this knowledge gap in order to enhance our understanding of endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer patients.METHODS: ER positive MCF7 and BT474 breast cancer cells were grown in estrogen depleted medium for 10 months with the ER negative MDA-MB-231 cell line employed as control. ER, PR and HER-2/neu expression were analysed at defined short and long-term time points by immunocytochemistry (ICC), and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Microarray analysis was performed on representative samples.RESULTS: MCF7 cells cultured in estrogen depleted medium displayed decreasing expression of ER up to 8 weeks, which was then re-expressed at 10 months. PR was also down-regulated at early time points and remained so for the duration of the study. BT474 cells generally displayed no changes in ER during the first 8 weeks of deprivation, however its expression was significantly decreased at 10 months. PR expression was also down-regulated early in BT474 samples and was absent at later time points. Finally, microarray data revealed that genes and cell processes down-regulated in both cell lines at 6 weeks overlapped with those down-regulated in aromatase inhibitor treated breast cancer patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that expression of ER, PR, and cell metabolic/proliferative processes are unstable in response to long-term estrogen deprivation in breast cancer cell lines. These results mirror recent clinical findings and again emphasize the utility of LTED models in translational research."

The related molecular mechanisms were also studied. A primary mammary epithelial cell line HMEC2595 cells and the highly metastatic breast cell line MDA-MB-231, the HER2-positive BT-474 cells, and the ER-positive MCF7 cells were treated with PU-H71 in the presence or absence of TNF-α. The effects of PU-H71 and TNF-α treatments on cells viabilities and on intracellular signaling pathway proteins were determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, apoptosis assays, immunoblot assays, and luciferase assays. It was found that TNF-α enhances the toxic effects of PU-H71 on tumor cells but not normal cells. PU-H71 treatments lead to degradation of IKKβ. Moreover, PU-H71 down-regulates the NF-κB transcriptional activity induced by TNF-α treatment. The experimental results indicated PU-H71 effectively induces cell killing of malignant breast cells in the presence of TNF-α, possibly through a mechanism related to degradation of IKKβ. It is suggested that combination of PU-H71 and TNF-α treatments might be an effective therapeutic strategy of breast malignancies."

Recently, it was noted that UBC9 expression and activity play a role in breast tumorigenesis and response to anticancer drugs. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. To investigate the transcriptional regulation of the UBC9 gene, we identified and characterized its promoter and cis-elements. Promoter activity was tested using luciferase reporter assays. The binding of transcription factors to the promoter was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and their functional role was confirmed by siRNA knockdown. UBC9 mRNA and protein levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. An increased expression of UBC9 mRNA and protein was found in MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with 17β-estradiol (E2). Analysis of various deletion mutants revealed a 137 bp fragment upstream of the transcription initiation site to be sufficient for reporter gene transcription. Mutations of putative estrogen receptor α (ER-α) (one imperfect estrogen response element, ERE) and/or nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) binding sites (two CCAAT boxes) markedly reduced promoter activity. Similar results were obtained in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells except that the ERE mutation did not affect promoter activity. Additionally, promoter activity was stimulated upon E2 treatment and overexpression of ER-α or NF-YA in MCF-7 cells. ChIP confirmed direct binding of both transcription factors to the UBC9 promoter in vivo. Furthermore, UBC9 expression was diminished by ER-α and NF-Y siRNAs on the mRNA and protein levels. In conclusion, we identified the proximal UBC9 promoter and provided evidence that ER-α and NF-Y regulate UBC9 expression on the transcriptional level in response to E2 in MCF-7 cells. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of UBC9 in ER-positive breast cancer and be useful for the development of cancer therapies targeting UBC9."

HIC1 encodes a transcriptional repressor involved in the regulation of growth control, DNA damage response and cell migration properties. We previously demonstrated that the membrane-associated G-protein-coupled receptors CXCR7, ADRB2 and the tyrosine kinase receptor EphA2 are direct target genes of HIC1. Here we show that ectopic expression of HIC1 in U2OS and MDA-MB-231 cell lines decreases expression of the ApoER2 and VLDLR genes, encoding two canonical tyrosine kinase receptors for Reelin. Conversely, knock-down of endogenous HIC1 in BJ-Tert normal human fibroblasts through RNA interference results in the up-regulation of these two Reelin receptors. Finally, through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in BJ-Tert fibroblasts, we demonstrate that HIC1 is a direct transcriptional repressor of ApoER2 and VLDLR. These data provide evidence that HIC1 is a new regulator of the Reelin pathway which is essential for the proper migration of neuronal precursors during the normal development of the cerebral cortex, of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and of mammary epithelial cells. Deregulation of this pathway through HIC1 inactivation or deletion may contribute to its role in tumor promotion. Moreover, HIC1, through the direct transcriptional repression of ATOH1 and the Reelin receptors ApoER2 and VLDLR, could play an essential role in normal cerebellar development."

However, little is known about the exact molecular mechanisms for antitumor actions of ZOL. In this study, two breast cancer cell lines were used to investigate the antitumor efficacy of ZOL and the underlying molecular mechanisms.RESULTS: The growth of two breast cancer cell lines was markedly decreased following treatment with ZOL. Compared with MCF-7 cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were more sensitive to ZOL treatment. Western blot analysis showed that the inhibitory effect of zoledronic acid on growth was related to the extent of inhibition of phosphorylated-protein kinase B (p-AKT), and phosphorylated-mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR). Moreover, the expression of the stress-responsive protein regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1), an inhibitor of mTOR, was induced markedly to various degrees in different breast cancer cell lines after ZOL treatment. Interestingly, by examining the upstream signaling pathway of REDD1, we found that ZOL can induce endoplasmic reticulum stress responses through activating the protein kinase R (PKR)-related ER kinase-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha-CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (PERK-eIF2α-CHOP) pathway.CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results indicated that ZOL-induced cell death was caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress activating PERK-eIF2α-CHOP pathway to induce REDD1 expression and inhibit the mTOR pathway."

The EGFR ligand EGF was conjugated to a fluorophore- or (111)In-labeled anti-γH2AX antibody, linked via a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) to ensure nuclear translocation. EGF conjugation was achieved either through a noncleavable PEG linker (PEO6) or a cleavable disulfide bond. Both conjugates selectively bound EGFR on fixed cells and γH2AX in cell extracts. Both compounds enter EGFR-expressing cells in an EGF/EGFR-dependent manner. However, only the cleavable compound was seen to associate with γH2AX foci in the nuclei of irradiated cells. Intracellular retention of the cleavable compound was prolonged in γH2AX-expressing cells. Clonogenic survival was significantly reduced when cells were exposed to IR (to induce γH2AX) plus (111)In-labeled cleavable compound compared to either alone and compared to nonspecific controls. In vivo, uptake of (111)In-labeled cleavable compound in MDA-MB-468 xenografts in athymic mice was 2.57 ± 0.47 percent injected dose/g (%ID/g) but increased significantly to 6.30 ± 1.47%ID/g in xenografts where γH2AX was induced by IR (P &lt; 0.01).

The tumor-suppressing effects of maspin depend in part on its ability to enhance cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. Although the molecular mechanism of maspin's action is still unclear, its functional domain is believed to be located at the reactive center loop (RCL). We have elucidated the role of maspin RCL on adhesion, migration, and invasion by transfecting the highly invasive human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cell line with pcDNA3.1-His/FLAG containing wild-type maspin, ovalbumin, or maspin/ovalbumin RCL chimeric mutants in which maspin RCL is replaced by ovalbumin (MOM) and vice versa (OMO). MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with maspin- or OMO-containing recombinant expression plasmid manifested significant increase in adhesion to fibronectin and reduction in in vitro migration and invasion through Matrigel compared with mock transfection or cells transfected with ovalbumin or MOM. Proteomics analysis of maspin- or OMO-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells revealed reduction in contents of proteins known to promote cancer metastasis and those of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, while those with tumor-suppressing properties were increased. Furthermore, MDA-MB-231 cells containing maspin or OMO transgene have significantly higher levels of ubiquitin and ubiquitinated conjugates, but reduced 20S proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity.

Triticuside A inhibited the proliferation of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) in a dose-dependent manner but barely showed cytotoxicity to the normal human fibroblasts. Triticuside A-induced apoptosis was accompanied by a significant decrease of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 proteins and by an increase of cleavage of caspases-3, -7, -9, and PARP. Triticuside A also suppressed the level of phospho-Akt and its downstream targets, mTOR and P70 S6 kinase. LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, significantly enhanced the Triticuside A-induced apoptosis. Moreover LY294002 not only downregulated the level of phospho-Akt but also enhanced the inhibition of Mcl-1 expression when combined with Triticuside A.

The expression of modified affibody was induced with isopropyl Β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside(IPTG)and identified by SDS-PAGE. The affibody was purified by nickel affinity binding and imidazole elution. The purified affibody was labeled with (68)Ga and its affinity was determined by saturation analysis with HER2-positive cells MDA-MB-361.RESULTS: The affibody gene containing N-terminal HEHEHE and C-terminal GGGC sequences were confirmed by Hind 3 endonuclease restriction and gene sequencing. A newly expressed 8×10(3) protein was expressed from the induced recombinant bacteria identified by SDS-PAGE after sub-cloning HER2 affibody gene into pET22b(+)plasmid,transforming recombinant plasmid into competent BL21(DE3)bacteria and inducing the recombinant bacteria with IPTG. The expressed protein was purified from nickel agarose by 60 mmol/L imidazole eluting. The affinity Kd value of (68)Ga labeled affibody to HER2 positive MDA-MB-361 cells was 1.5 nmol/L.CONCLUSION: The affiibody ZHER2V2 containing N-terminal HEHEHE and C-terminal GGGC was successfully prepared by gene optimization,recombinant expression and affinity purification."

So far, no study assessed the effect of the first three short consensus repeats (SCR1-3) with low molecular weight, one of the most active functional domains of CR1, binding C4b with a powerful decay-acceleration effect on classical and alternative C3/C5 convertases pathways. Therefore, we aim to assess this effect on CI/R injury in the present study.METHODS: Seventy-five adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham operation group (n = 15), CI/R group (n = 30), and CI/R group treated with CR1-SCR1-3 protein (n = 30). After middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 hour and reperfusion for 24 hours, neurological motor deficits, cerebral infarct size, and biochemical parameters including myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were assessed. Meanwhile, tissues in cerebral cortex were collected and processed for western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and HE staining.RESULTS: CR1-SCR1-3 could improve neurological functions in brain with a 26.8% decrease in neurological motor deficit score and could lead to a 63.8% reduction in cerebral infarct size. Besides, pretreatment using CR1-SCR1-3 could prevent neutrophil infiltration and alleviate inflammation severity and subsequent tissue damage. Decreased C4b expression and action, as well as improved morphological changes, were also observed in cerebral tissues of CI/R+CR1-SCR1-3 rats.CONCLUSION: CR1-SCR1-3 protein could possess a neuroprotective effect on acute CI/R injury."

Taking melon cultivar 'Xitian 1' as test material, the re-inoculation and seed germination experiments were conducted to investigate the pathogenicity and growth inhibition effect of these fungi isolates on melon. Through the determination of the induced enzyme activities, resistant substance contents, and cell membrane permeability of potted melon roots, the allelopathic effect of the crude toxins of two harmful fungi was studied, and according to the morphological characteristics and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing, the two harmful fungi were identified. The crude toxins of the two harmful fungi TF and HF had strong inhibition effects on the germination and growth of the melon seeds. The MDA and soluble protein contents and the cell membrane permeability of the 'Xitian 1' seedlings roots all increased, among which, the MDA content and cell membrane permeability increased by 108.6% and 40.6%, respectively when treated with the stock solution of TF toxin, compared with the control. The crude toxins of the two harmful fungi improved the induced enzyme activities of the melon roots, with the increment of the PAL and POD activities under the treatment of 10-fold dilution of TF crude toxin increased by 25.6% and 23.2%, respectively. When treated with the stock solution of HF toxin, the PAL activity significantly increased by 30.0%. The two harmful fungi TF and HF were primarily identified as Fusarium equisti and F. proliferatum, respectively. This study showed that the two Fusarium isolates could not infect melon via re-inoculation, but could negatively affect the melon's normal growth and normal physiological and biochemical metabolism via toxins excretion, and in the meantime, improve the root protective enzyme activities, with the effects of both benefit and harmfulness on melon plants. The allelopathic hazard of the crude toxins of the isolates could be one of the main causes of continuous cropping obstacle of melon."

Despite of unfavorable clinical prognosis, radiation therapy is still the only viable treatment option for brain metastases. Expression of c-Met induces cell migration and invasion in many cancers, which are indispensable steps for metastasis. Accordingly, we examined the effects of gene silencing of c-Met on brain metastasis to evaluate the possibility of c-Met as a potential target. MDA-MB-435 cells were transfected with c-Met targeting short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Effects of c-Met shRNAs on the expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) related proteins, in vitro migration, and in vivo brain metastasis were examined. Expression of mesenchymal markers and in vitro migration of MDA-MB-435 cells were significantly inhibited by introduction of c-Met shRNAs. When c-Met-silenced MDA-MB-435 cells were stereotactically implanted into the brains of immune-compromised mice or injected into the right internal carotid arteries, c-Met-silenced MDA-MB-435 cells produced significantly smaller tumor masses or survival time was significantly prolonged, respectively, compared with MDA-MB-435 cells transfected with control shRNA.

The present study focused on the protective effects of selenium on oxidative damage of chronic arsenic poisoning in rat liver. Rats were divided into four groups at random and given designed treatments for 20 weeks. The oxidative damage of liver tissue was evaluated by lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes. Oxidative stress related genes were detected to reflect the liver stress state at the molecular level. Compared to the control and Na2SeO3 groups, the MDA content in liver tissue was decreased and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were increased in the Na2SeO3 intervention group. The mRNA levels of SOD1, CAT, GPx and Txnrd1 were increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) in the combined Na2SeO3+NaAsO2 treatment group. The expressions of HSP70 and HO-1 were significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased in the NaAsO2 group and reduced in the combined treatment group.

ERα17p was subsequently found to elicit estrogenic responses in E2-deprived ERα-positive breast cancer cells, increasing proliferation and ERE-dependent gene transcription. Surprisingly, in E2-supplemented media, ERα17p-induced apoptosis and modified the actin network, influencing cell motility. Here, we report that ERα17p internalizes in breast cancer cells (T47D, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3) and induces a massive early (3 h) transcriptional activity. Remarkably, about 75% of significantly modified transcripts were also modified by E2, confirming the pro-estrogenic profile of ERα17p. The different ER spectra of the used cell lines allowed us to identify a specific ERα17p signature related to ERα as well as its variant ERα36. With respect to ERα, the peptide activates nuclear (cell cycle, cell proliferation, nucleic acid and protein synthesis) and extranuclear signaling pathways. In contrast, through ERα36, it mainly triggers inhibitory actions on inflammation. This is the first work reporting a detailed ERα36-specific transcriptional signature. In addition, we report that ERα17p-induced transcripts related to apoptosis and actin modifying effects of the peptide are independent from its estrogen receptor(s)-related actions. We discuss our findings in view of the potential use of ERα17p as a selective peptidomimetic estrogen receptor modulator (PERM)."

To this end, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting the α7 nAChR subunit and/or exposed to Aβ1-42. For α7 nAChR, BACE1 (cleaving at the β-site of APP) and BACE2 (cleaving within the Aβ domain), α-secretase (ADAM10), and the two components of γ-secretase, PS and NCT, the mRNA and protein levels were determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The level of Aβ1-42 in the cell culture medium was determined by an ELISA procedure. The extent of lipid peroxidation and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were assayed spectrophotometrically. In the transfected SH-SY5Y cells, expression of α7 nAChR was reduced; the level of BACE1 increased and that of BACE2 decreased; the amount of ADAM10 lowered; and the level of PS raised. Moreover, the level of Aβ1-42 in the culture medium was elevated. Treatment of non-transfected cells with Aβ elevated the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lowered the activities of SOD and GSH-Px and these changes were potentiated by inhibiting expression of α7 nAChR.

The present study reports that aspirin induces the apoptosis of MDA‑MB‑453 breast cancer cells which was attributed to the increased expression and activation of caspase‑3. Moreover, AP‑2α, a transcription factor highly expressed in MDA‑MB‑453 cells, was identified as a negative regulator of caspase‑3 transcription and AP‑2α was attenuated following aspirin treatment. Therefore, aspirin may increase the expression of caspase‑3 by inducing the degradation of AP‑2α, which increases activated caspase‑3 expression, thereby triggering apoptosis in MDA‑MB‑453 cells.

After the treatments, luciferase activity, cell viability, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, Olive tail moment, and micronuclei frequency were determined, respectively.RESULTS: The bottom COEs induced significant increases (P &lt; 0.01) in relative luciferase activity up to 1.4 times the control level at 0.15 µg/L. The low dose of side COEs (0.02 µg/L) led to a significant increase (P &lt; 0.01) in relative luciferase activity that progressively increased to 2.1 times the control level at 65.4 µg/L. The top COEs produced a strong dose-dependent induction of relative luciferase activity up to over 5 times the control level at the highest concentration tested (202 µg/L). In HepG2/HSPA1A cells treated with the bottom COEs, relative luciferase activity was positively correlated with MDA concentration (r = 0.404, P &lt; 0.05).

The miR-124 was reported to be attenuated in several tumors, such as glioma, medulloblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its role in cancer remains greatly elusive. In this study, we show that the miR-124 expression is significantly suppressed in human breast cancer specimens, which is reversely correlated to histological grade of the cancer. More intriguingly, ectopic expression of miR-124 in aggressive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 strongly inhibits cell motility and invasive capacity, as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Also, lentivirus-delivered miR-124 endows MDA-MB-231 cells with the ability to suppress cell colony formation in vitro and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Further studies have identified the E-cadherin transcription repressor Slug as a direct target gene of miR-124; its downregulation by miR-124 increases the expression of E-cadherin, a hallmark of epithelial cells and a repressor of cell invasion and metastasis. Moreover, knockdown of Slug notably impairs the motility of MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas re-expression of Slug abrogates the reduction of motility and invasion ability induced by miR-124 in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings highlight an important role for miR-124 in the regulation of invasive and metastatic potential of breast cancer and suggest a potential application of miR-124 in cancer treatment."

Low-resolution structural studies confirmed the TRiC particle to be composed of two stacked octameric rings enclosing a folding cavity. The exact arrangement of the different proteins in the rings underlies the functionality of TRiC and is likely to be conserved across all eukaryotes. Yet despite its importance it has not been determined conclusively, mainly because the different subunits appear nearly identical under low resolution. This work successfully addresses the arrangement problem by the emerging technique of cross-linking, mass spectrometry, and modeling. We cross-linked TRiC under native conditions with a cross-linker that is primarily reactive toward exposed lysine side chains that are spatially close in the context of the particle. Following digestion and mass spectrometry we were able to identify over 60 lysine pairs that underwent cross-linking, thus providing distance restraints between specific residues in the complex. Independently of the cross-link set, we constructed 40,320 (= 8 factorial) computational models of the TRiC particle, which exhaustively enumerate all the possible arrangements of the different subunits. When we assessed the compatibility of each model with the cross-link set, we discovered that one specific model is significantly more compatible than any other model. Furthermore, bootstrapping analysis confirmed that this model is 10 times more likely to result from this cross-link set than the next best-fitting model. Our subunit arrangement is very different than any of the previously reported models and changes the context of existing and future findings on TRiC."

In addition, the representation of microRNA genes and imprinted loci on the Illumina, Inc. array was assessed in detail. Genomic DNA from 4 human breast cancer cell lines (IPH-926, HCC1937, MDA-MB-134, PMC42) and 18 human breast cancer specimens as well as 4 normal mammary epithelial fractions was analyzed on 450k DNA methylation arrays. The β-values for 692 individual CpG sites from 62 different genes were cross-validated using conventional quantitative pyrosequencing.FINDINGS: The newly released 450k methylation array from Illumina, Inc. shows a high concordance with quantitative pyrosequencing if identical CpG sites are analyzed in cell lines (Spearman r = 0.88, p ≪ 0.0001), which is somewhat reduced in primary tumor specimens (Spearman r = 0.86, p ≪ 0.0001). 80.7% of the CpG sites show an absolute difference in methylation level of less than 15 percentage points. If different CpG sites in the same CpG islands are targeted the concordance is lower (r = 0.83 in cell lines and r = 0.7 in primary tumors).

Previous genome-wide studies have identified gene-expression patterns correlated with cancer patient outcome. However, these were derived mostly from whole tissue without respect to cell heterogeneity. In reality, only a small subpopulation of invasive cells inside the primary tumor is responsible for escaping and initiating dissemination and metastasis. When whole tissue is used for molecular profiling, the expression pattern of these cells is masked by the majority of the noninvasive tumor cells. Therefore, little information is available about the crucial early steps of the metastatic cascade: migration, invasion, and entry of tumor cells into the systemic circulation.METHODS: In the past, we developed an in vivo invasion assay that can capture specifically the highly motile tumor cells in the act of migrating inside living tumors. Here, we used this assay in orthotopic xenografts of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to isolate selectively the migratory cell subpopulation of the primary tumor for gene-expression profiling. In this way, we derived a gene signature specific to breast cancer migration and invasion, which we call the Human Invasion Signature (HIS).RESULTS: Unsupervised analysis of the HIS shows that the most significant upregulated gene networks in the migratory breast tumor cells include genes regulating embryonic and tissue development, cellular movement, and DNA replication and repair. We confirmed that genes involved in these functions are upregulated in the migratory tumor cells with independent biological repeats. We also demonstrate that specific genes are functionally required for in vivo invasion and hematogenous dissemination in MDA-MB-231, as well as in patient-derived breast tumors. Finally, we used statistical analysis to show that the signature can significantly predict risk of breast cancer metastasis in large patient cohorts, independent of well-established prognostic parameters.CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide novel insights into, and reveal previously unknown mediators of, the metastatic steps of invasion and dissemination in human breast tumors in vivo. Because migration and invasion are the early steps of metastatic progression, the novel markers that we identified here might become valuable prognostic tools or therapeutic targets in breast cancer."

In this study, we provide the first evidence that E-cadherin (E-cad) is a potential target of miR-10b.METHOD: By applying gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in the metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, we demonstrated that miR-10b is necessary and sufficient to regulate the cellular expression of E-cad and in vitro tumor cell invasion.RESULTS: Comparative expression analysis of miR-10b in benign breast lesions (N=16), primary breast cancers (N=21), and metastatic breast carcinomas (N=23) revealed that miR-10b transcription was uniquely up-regulated in metastatic cancers. The expression level of miR-10b positively correlated with tumor size, pathological grading, clinical staging, lymph node metastasis, Her2-positivity and tumor proliferation, but was negatively associated with estrogen receptor-positivity, progesterone receptor-positivity and E-cad mRNA and protein levels.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the existence of a novel E-cadherin-related mechanism by which miR-10b modulates breast cancer metastasis.

Laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) shares homology with RIG-I and mda-5 but lacks the CARD domains required for signaling. The V proteins of paramyxoviruses limit interferon induction by binding mda-5 and preventing its activation; however, they do not bind RIG-I and have not been considered inhibitors of RIG-I signaling. Here we uncover a novel mechanism of RIG-I inhibition in which the V protein of parainfluenzavirus type 5 (PIV5; formerly known as simian virus type 5 [SV5]) interacts with LGP2 and cooperatively inhibits induction by RIG-I ligands. A complex between RIG-I and LGP2 is observed in the presence of PIV5-V, and we propose that this complex is refractory to activation by RIG-I ligands. The V proteins from other paramyxoviruses also bind LGP2 and demonstrate LGP2-dependent inhibition of RIG-I signaling. This is significant, because it demonstrates a general mechanism for the targeting of the RIG-I pathway by paramyxoviruses."

In the present study, the authors demonstrated that microRNA (miRNA) let-7a downregulates CCR7 expression and directly influences the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.METHODS: The expression of CCR7, its ligand CCL21, and let-7a was detected in breast cancer cell lines and in breast cancer patient tissues. Synthetic let-7a and an inhibitor of let-7a were transfected into MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, respectively, and cell proliferation, cell migration, and invasion assays were performed. To confirm the fact that 3'UTR of CCR7 is a direct target of let-7a, a luciferase assay for the reporter gene expressing the let-7a binding sites of CCR7 3'UTR was used. An in vivo invasion animal model system using transparent zebrafish embryos was also established to determine the let-7a effect on breast cancer cell invasion.RESULTS: First, a higher expression of both CCR7 and CCL21 in malignant tissues than in their normal counterparts from breast cancer patients was observed. In addition, a reverse correlation in the expression of CCR7 and let-7a in breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer patient tissues was detected. Synthetic let-7a decreased breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as CCR7 protein expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. The let-7a inhibitor reversed the let-7a effects on the MCF-7 cells. The 3'UTR of CCR7 was confirmed as a direct target of let-7a by using the luciferase assay for the reporter gene expressing let-7a CCR7 3'UTR binding sites. Notably, when analyzing in vivo invasion, MDA-MB 231 cells after synthetic let-7a transfection were unable to invade the vessels in zebrafish embryos.CONCLUSIONS: The results from the present study suggest that targeting of CCL21-CCR7 signaling is a valid approach for breast cancer therapy and that let-7a directly binds to the 3'UTR of CCR7 and blocks its protein expression, thereby suppressing migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the present study underscores the therapeutic potential of let-7a as an antitumor and antimetastatic manager in breast cancer patients."

We recently published an experimental model for the study of human tumor dormancy and the role of angiogenesis, and reported that the angiogenic switch was preceded by a local increase in VEGF-A and basic fibroblast growth factor. In this breast cancer xenograft model (MDA-MB-436 cells), analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) was significantly up-regulated in angiogenic cells compared with nonangiogenic cells. The effect of HSP27 down-regulation was further evaluated in cell lines, mouse models, and clinical datasets of human patients with breast cancer and melanoma. Stable down-regulation of HSP27 in angiogenic tumor cells was followed by long-term tumor dormancy in vivo. Strikingly, only 4 of 30 HSP27 knockdown xenograft tumors initiated rapid growth after day 70, in correlation with a regain of HSP27 protein expression. Significantly, no tumors escaped from dormancy without HSP27 expression. Down-regulation of HSP27 was associated with reduced endothelial cell proliferation and decreased secretion of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and basic fibroblast growth factor. Conversely, overexpression of HSP27 in nonangiogenic cells resulted in expansive tumor growth in vivo. By clinical validation, strong HSP27 protein expression was associated with markers of aggressive tumors and decreased survival in patients with breast cancer and melanoma. An HSP27-associated gene expression signature was related to molecular subgroups and survival in breast cancer. Our findings suggest a role for HSP27 in the balance between tumor dormancy and tumor progression, mediated by tumor-vascular interactions. Targeting HSP27 might offer a useful strategy in cancer treatment."

Sequential genetic mutations, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, interaction with local stroma, and formation of hybrids between cancer cells and normal bone marrow-derived cells have been advocated as tumor progression mechanisms. We report herein the spontaneous in vitro formation of heterotypic hybrids between human bone marrow-derived multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) and two different breast carcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (MDA) and MA11. Hybrids showed predominantly mesenchymal morphological characteristics, mixed gene expression profiles, and increased DNA ploidy. Both MA11 and MDA hybrids were tumorigenic in immunodeficient mice, and some MDA hybrids had an increased metastatic capacity. Both in culture and as xenografts, hybrids underwent DNA ploidy reduction and morphological reversal to breast carcinoma-like morphological characteristics, while maintaining a mixed breast cancer-mesenchymal expression profile. Analysis of coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms by RNA sequencing revealed genetic contributions from both parental partners to hybrid tumors and metastasis. Because MSCs migrate and localize to breast carcinoma, our findings indicate that formation of MSC-breast cancer cell hybrids is a potential mechanism of the generation of invasive/metastatic breast cancer cells. Our findings reconcile the fusion theory of cancer progression with the common observation that breast cancer metastases are generally aneuploid, but not tetraploid, and are histopathologically similar to the primary neoplasm."

The aim of the present study was to identify the unique salivary anticoagulant of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, which remained elusive for decades.METHODS AND RESULTS: Several L. longipalpis salivary proteins were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and screened for inhibition of blood coagulation. A novel 32.4-kDa molecule, named Lufaxin, was identified as a slow, tight, noncompetitive, and reversible inhibitor of factor Xa (FXa). Notably, Lufaxin's primary sequence does not share similarity to any physiological or salivary inhibitors of coagulation reported to date. Lufaxin is specific for FXa and does not interact with FX, Dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-FXa, or 15 other enzymes. In addition, Lufaxin blocks prothrombinase and increases both prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. Surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that FXa binds Lufaxin with an equilibrium constant ≈3 nM, and isothermal titration calorimetry determined a stoichiometry of 1:1. Lufaxin also prevents protease-activated receptor 2 activation by FXa in the MDA-MB-231 cell line and abrogates edema formation triggered by injection of FXa in the paw of mice. Moreover, Lufaxin prevents FeCl(3)-induced carotid artery thrombus formation and prolongs activated partial thromboplastin time ex vivo, implying that it works as an anticoagulant in vivo. Finally, salivary gland of sand flies was found to inhibit FXa and to interact with the enzyme.CONCLUSIONS: Lufaxin belongs to a novel family of slow-tight FXa inhibitors, which display antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory activities. It is a useful tool to understand FXa structural features and its role in prohemostatic and proinflammatory events."

Although tamoxifen therapy is successful for some patients, it does not provide adequate benefit for those who have estrogen receptor (ER)-negative cancers. Therefore, we approached novel treatment strategies by combining two potential bioactive dietary supplements for the reactivation of ERα expression for effective treatment of ERα-negative breast cancer with tamoxifen. Bioactive dietary supplements such as green tea polyphenols (GTPs) and sulforaphane (SFN) inhibit DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively, which are of central importance to cancer prevention. In the present study, we have observed that treatment of ERα-negative breast cancer cells with GTPs and SFN alone or in combination leads to the reactivation of ERα expression. The combination of 20 µg/mL GTPs and 5 µM SFN was found to be the optimal dose of ERα-reactivation at 3 days in MDA-MB-231 cells. The reactivation of ERα expression was consistently correlated with ERα promoter hypomethylation and hyperacetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of the ERα promoter revealed that GTPs and SFN altered the binding of ERα-transcriptional co-repressor complex thereby contributing to ERα-reactivation. In addition, treatment with tamoxifen in combination with GTPs and SFN significantly increased both cell death and inhibition of cellular proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison to treatment with tamoxifen alone. Collectively, our findings suggest that a novel combination of bioactive-HDAC inhibitors with bioactive-demethylating agents is a promising strategy for the effective treatment of hormonal refractory breast cancer with available anti-estrogens."

We used cryo-electron microscopy and reconstituted in vitro transcription assays to characterize a transcriptionally-active complex including the Mediator Head module and components of a minimum preinitiation complex (RNAPII, TFIIF, TFIIB, TBP, and promoter DNA).

The chemokine CXCL12 interacts with its receptor, CXCR4, to promote cellular adhesion, survival, proliferation and migration. The CXCR4 gene is upregulated in several types of cancers, including skin, lung, pancreas, brain and breast tumors. In pancreatic cancer and melanoma, CXCR4 expression is regulated by DNA methylation within its promoter region. In this study we examined the role of cytosine methylation in the regulation of CXCR4 expression in breast cancer cell lines and also correlated the methylation pattern with the clinicopathological aspects of sixty-nine primary breast tumors from a cohort of Brazilian women. RT-PCR showed that the PMC-42, MCF7 and MDA-MB-436 breast tumor cell lines expressed high levels of CXCR4. Conversely, the MDA-MB-435 cell line only expressed CXCR4 after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR, which suggests that CXCR4 expression is regulated by DNA methylation. To confirm this hypothesis, a 184 bp fragment of the CXCR4 gene promoter region was cloned after sodium bisulfite DNA treatment. Sequencing data showed that cell lines that expressed CXCR4 had only 15% of methylated CpG dinucleotides, while the cell line that not have CXCR4 expression, had a high density of methylation (91%). Loss of DNA methylation in the CXCR4 promoter was detected in 67% of the breast cancer analyzed. The absence of CXCR4 methylation was associated with the tumor stage, size, histological grade, lymph node status, ESR1 methylation and CXCL12 methylation, metastasis and patient death. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that patients with an unmethylated CXCR4 promoter had a poorer overall survival and disease-free survival. Furthermore, patients with both CXCL12 methylation and unmethylated CXCR4 had a shorter overall survival and disease-free survival. These findings suggest that the DNA methylation status of both CXCR4 and CXCL12 genes could be used as a biomarker for prognosis in breast cancer."

However, the relationship between these disparate functions remains to be elucidated. Caveola biogenesis requires expression of both Cav1 and cavin-1, but Cav1Y14 phosphorylation is dispensable. In this paper, we show that Cav1 tyrosine phosphorylation induces caveola biogenesis via actin-dependent mechanotransduction and inactivation of the Egr1 (early growth response-1) transcription factor, relieving inhibition of endogenous Cav1 and cavin-1 genes. Cav1 phosphorylation reduces Egr1 binding to Cav1 and cavin-1 promoters and stimulates their activity. In MDA-231 breast carcinoma cells that express elevated levels of Cav1 and caveolae, Egr1 regulated Cav1, and cavin-1 promoter activity was dependent on actin, Cav1, Src, and Rho-associated kinase as well as downstream protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. pCav1 is therefore a mechanotransducer that acts via PKC to relieve Egr1 transcriptional inhibition of Cav1 and cavin-1, defining a novel feedback regulatory loop to regulate caveola biogenesis."

Expression of CSF-1 (colony stimulating factor-1) by breast cancer cells acts as potent activator of malignancy and metastasis. In this report, we used two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, to show that the bioactive fish oil component DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) inhibits expression of CSF-1 and its secretion from these cancer cells. We found that the tumor suppressor protein PTEN regulates CSF-1 expression through PI 3 kinase/Akt signaling via a transcriptional mechanism. The enhanced abundance of microRNA-21 (miR-21) in breast cancer cells contributes to the growth and metastasis. Interestingly, DHA significantly inhibited expression of miR-21. miR-21 Sponge, which derepresses the miR-21 targets, markedly decreased expression of CSF-1 and its secretion. Furthermore, miR-21-induced upregulation of CSF-1 mRNA and its transcription were prevented by expression of PTEN mRNA lacking 3'-untranslated region (UTR) and miR-21 recognition sequence. Strikingly, miR-21 reversed DHA-forced reduction of CSF-1 expression and secretion. Finally, we found that expression of miR-21 as well as CSF-1 was significantly attenuated in breast tumors of mice receiving a diet supplemented with fish oil. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for the therapeutic function of fish oil diet that blocks miR-21, thereby increasing PTEN levels to prevent expression of CSF-1 in breast cancer."

In order for CD44 to be induced, YB-1 must be phosphorylated at S102 by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). We therefore questioned whether RSK might be a tractable molecular target to eliminate TICs. In support of this idea, injection of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing Flag-YB-1 into mice increased tumor growth as well as enhanced CD44 expression. Despite enrichment for TICs, these cells were sensitive to RSK inhibition when treated ex vivo with BI-D1870. Targeting RSK2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or small molecule RSK kinase inhibitors (SL0101 and BI-D1870) blocked TNBC monolayer cell growth by ∼100%. In a diverse panel of breast tumor cell line models RSK2 siRNA predominantly targeted models of TNBC. RSK2 inhibition decreased CD44 promoter activity, CD44 mRNA, protein expression, and mammosphere formation. CD44(+) cells had higher P-RSK(S221/227) , P-YB-1(S102) , and mitotic activity relative to CD44(-) cells. Importantly, RSK2 inhibition specifically suppressed the growth of TICs and triggered cell death. Moreover, silencing RSK2 delayed tumor initiation in mice. In patients, RSK2 mRNA was associated with poor disease-free survival in a cohort of 244 women with breast cancer that had not received adjuvant treatment, and its expression was highest in the basal-like breast cancer subtype. Taking this further, we report that P-RSK(S221/227) is present in primary TNBCs and correlates with P-YB-1(S102) as well as CD44. In conclusion, RSK2 inhibition provides a novel therapeutic avenue for TNBC and holds the promise of eliminating TICs."

We recently found that inhibition of MAPK/ERK upregulated both full length TF (flTF) and soluble isoform TF (asTF) gene expression and cell-associated TF activity in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. We explored the possible mechanisms, especially the possible interaction with EGFR and PI3K/Akt pathways.METHODS: A plasmid containing TF promoter -2174 ~ +128 plus luciferase reporter gene was introduced into MDA-MB-231 cells to evaluate TF promoter activity. In order to study the interaction of these pathways, ERK inhibitor (PD98059), PI3K inhibitors (LY294002, wortmannin), Akt inhibitor (A6730), and EGFR inhibitor (erlotinib) as well as the corresponding siRNAs were used to treat MDA-MB-231 cells, and ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells. Quantitative PCR and western blot were used to determine TF expression. One stage clotting assays were used to measure pro-coagulation activity of the MDA-MB-231 cells.RESULTS: We show that PI3K inhibitors LY294002, wortmannin and A6730 significantly inhibited TF promoter activity, and reduced TF mRNA and protein levels due to the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. In contrast, ERK inhibitor PD98059 and ERK siRNA enhanced TF promoter activity by 2.5 fold and induced an increase in TF mRNA and protein levels in a dose dependent manner in these cells. The PI3K/Akt pathway was shown to be involved in PD98059-induced TF expression because the induction was inhibited by PI3K/Akt inhibitors. Most interestingly, the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib and EGFR siRNA also significantly suppressed PD98059- or ERK siRNA-induced TF promoter activity and TF protein expression. Similar results were found with ovarian cancer cells SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3. Furthermore, in MDA-MB-231, mRNA levels of asTF were regulated in a similar way to that of TF in response to the cell treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a regulatory mechanism in which MAPK/ERK signals inhibit EGFR/PI3K/Akt-mediated TF expression in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The same regulation was observed in ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells. Interestingly, we observed that both flTF and asTF could be regulated in a parallel manner in MDA-MB-231. As the PI3K/Akt pathway and EGFR regulate TF expression in cancer cells, targeting these signaling components is expected to potentially inhibit TF expression-associated tumor progression."

Protein expression was determined by DNA microarray and Western blot analysis. Metastatic potential was evaluated by cell adhesion, migration, invasion, capillary morphogenesis, and ELISA assays. The anticancer activity in vivo was evaluated in mouse xenograft model. NAHA inhibited proliferation and colony formation of MDA-MB-231 cells together with the down-regulation of expression of Cdk2 and CDC20 proteins. NAHA inhibited cell adhesion, migration, and invasion through the suppression of secretion of uPA. NAHA suppressed secretion of VEGF from MDA-MB-231 cells and inhibited capillary morphogenesis of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Finally, NAHA at 50 mg/kg was not toxic and decreased tumor volume and tumor weight in vivo. This suppression of tumor growth was associated with the inhibition of mitotic figures and induction of apoptosis, and the reduction of CD31 and VEGF positive cells in tumors.CONCLUSION: NAHA could be a novel promising compound for the development of new drugs for the therapy of invasive breast cancers."

However, the precise mechanisms of iron entry and sequestration in the heart are still unclear. Our previous study showed that Fe(2+) uptake in thalassemic cardiomyocytes are mainly mediated by T-type calcium channels (TTCC). Nevertheless, the role of TTCC as well as other transporters such as divalent metal transporter1 (DMT1) and L-type calcium channels (LTCC) as possible portals for iron entry into the heart in in vivo thalassemic mice under an iron-overload condition has not been investigated.METHODS: An iron-overload condition was induced in genetically altered β-thalassemic mice and adult wild-type mice by feeding them with an iron diet (0.2% ferrocene w/w) for 3 months. Then, blockers for LTCC (verapamil and nifedipine), TTCC (efonidipine), and DMT1 (ebselen) as well as iron chelator desferoxamine (DFO) were given for 1 month with continuous iron feeding.RESULTS: Treatment with LTCC, TTCC, DMT1 blockers, and DFO reduced cardiac iron deposit, cardiac malondialdehyde (MDA), plasma non-transferrin-bound iron, and improved heart rate variability and left ventricular (LV) function in thalassemic mice with iron overload. Only TTCC and DMT1 blockers and DFO reduced liver iron accumulation, liver MDA, plasma MDA, and decreased mortality rate in iron-overloaded thalassemic mice.CONCLUSIONS: DMT1, LTCC, and TTCC played important roles for iron entry in the thalassemic heart under an iron-overloaded condition. Unlike LTCC blocker, TTCC blocker provided all benefits including attenuating iron deposit in both the heart and liver, reduced oxidative stress, and decreased mortality in iron-overloaded mice."

In the present study, we have identified a function for PPARβ/δ in cancer cell invasion. We show that two structurally divergent inhibitory ligands for PPARβ/δ, the inverse agonists ST247 and DG172, strongly inhibit the serum- and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced invasion of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells into a three-dimensional matrigel matrix. To elucidate the molecular basis of this finding, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and microarray analyses, which identified the gene encoding angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) as the major transcriptional PPARβ/δ target in MDA-MB-231 cells, previously implicated in TGFβ-mediated tumor progression and metastatic dissemination. We show that the induction of ANGPTL4 by TGFβ and other oncogenic signals is strongly repressed by ST247 and DG172 in a PPARβ/δ-dependent fashion, resulting in the inhibition of ANGPTL4 secretion. This effect is attributable to these ligands' ability to induce a dominant transcriptional repressor complex at the site of transcription initiation that blocks preinitiation complex formation through an histone deacetylase-independent, non-canonical mechanism. Repression of ANGPTL4 transcription by inverse PPARβ/δ agonists is functionally linked to the inhibition of cancer cell invasion into a three-dimensional matrix, as (i) invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells is critically dependent on ANGPTL4 expression, (ii) recombinant ANGPTL4 stimulates invasion, and (iii) reverses the inhibitory effect of ST247 and DG172. These findings indicate that a PPARβ/δ-ANGPTL4 pathway is involved in the regulation of tumor cell invasion and that its pharmacological manipulation by inverse PPARβ/δ agonists is feasible."

In fibroblasts, caveolin-1 polarization and phosphorylation of tyrosine-14 are essential to promote migration. However, the role of caveolin-1 in migration of metastatic cells remains poorly defined. Here, caveolin-1 participation in metastatic cell migration was evaluated by shRNA targeting of endogenous caveolin-1 in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and ectopic expression in B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells. Depletion of caveolin-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells reduced, while expression in B16-F10 cells promoted migration, polarization and focal adhesion turnover in a sequence of events that involved phosphorylation of tyrosine-14 and Rac-1 activation. In B16-F10 cells, expression of a non-phosphorylatable tyrosine-14 to phenylalanine mutant failed to recapitulate the effects observed with wild-type caveolin-1. Alternatively, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 reduced caveolin-1 phosphorylation on tyrosine-14 and cell migration. Surprisingly, unlike for fibroblasts, caveolin-1 polarization and re-localization to the trailing edge were not observed in migrating metastatic cells. Thus, expression and phosphorylation, but not polarization of caveolin-1 favor the highly mobile phenotype of metastatic cells."

Tanshinones showed the dose-dependent effect on the growth inhibition of breast cancer cells in vitro, with tanshinone I (T1) the most potent agent. T1 was also the only tanshinone to have potent activity in inhibiting the growth of the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231. T1 caused cell cycle arrests of both estrogen-dependent and estrogen-independent cell lines associated with alterations of cyclinD, CDK4 and cyclinB, and induced breast cancer cell apoptosis associated with upregulation of c-PARP and downregulation of survivin and Aurora A. Among these associated biomarkers, Aurora A showed the most consistent pattern with the anti-growth activity of tanshinones. Overexpression of Aurora A was also verified in breast tumors. The gene function assay showed that knockdown of Aurora A by siRNA dramatically reduced the growth-inhibition and apoptosis-induction activities of T1, suggesting Aurora A as an important functional target of T1 action. On the other hand, tanshinones had much less adverse effects on normal mammary epithelial cells. Epigenetic mechanism studies showed that overexpression of Aurora A gene in breast cancer cells was not regulated by gene promoter DNA methylation, but by histone acetylation. T1 treatment significantly reduced acetylation levels of histone H3 associated with Aurora A gene. Our results supported the potent activity of T1 in inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro in part by downregulation of Aurora A gene function. Our previous studies also demonstrated that T1 had potent anti-angiogenesis activity and minimal side effects in vivo. Altogether, this study warrants further investigation to develop T1 as an effective and safe agent for the therapy and prevention of breast cancer."

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism by which methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) inhibits breast cancer growth in mice xenografts. MSM is an organic sulfur-containing natural compound without any toxicity. In this study, we demonstrated that MSM substantially decreased the viability of human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. MSM also suppressed the phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5b, expression of IGF-1R, HIF-1α, VEGF, BrK, and p-IGF-1R and inhibited triple-negative receptor expression in receptor-positive cell lines. Moreover, MSM decreased the DNA-binding activities of STAT5b and STAT3, to the target gene promoters in MDA-MB 231 or co-transfected COS-7 cells. We confirmed that MSM significantly decreased the relative luciferase activities indicating crosstalk between STAT5b/IGF-1R, STAT5b/HSP90α, and STAT3/VEGF. To confirm these findings in vivo, xenografts were established in Balb/c athymic nude mice with MDA-MB 231 cells and MSM was administered for 30 days. Concurring to our in vitro analysis, these xenografts showed decreased expression of STAT3, STAT5b, IGF-1R and VEGF. Through in vitro and in vivo analysis, we confirmed that MSM can effectively regulate multiple targets including STAT3/VEGF and STAT5b/IGF-1R. These are the major molecules involved in tumor development, progression, and metastasis. Thus, we strongly recommend the use of MSM as a trial drug for treating all types of breast cancers including triple-negative cancers."

Small molecules can freely exchange through the NPC, but macromolecules larger than ~40 kDa must be aided across by transport factors, most of which belong to a related family of proteins termed karyopherins (Kaps). These transport factors bind to the disordered phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domains in a family of NPC proteins termed FG nups, and this specific binding allows the transport factors to cross the NPC. However, we still know little in terms of the molecular and kinetic details regarding how this binding translates to selective passage of transport factors across the NPC. Here we show that the specific interactions between Kaps and FG nups are strongly modulated by the presence of a cellular milieu whose proteins appear to act as very weak competitors that nevertheless collectively can reduce Kap/FG nup affinities by several orders of magnitude. Without such modulation, the avidities between Kaps and FG nups measured in vitro are too tight to be compatible with the rapid transport kinetics observed in vivo. We modeled the multivalent interactions between the disordered repeat binding sites in the FG nups and multiple cognate binding sites on Kap, showing that they should indeed be sensitive to even weakly binding competitors; the introduction of such competition reduces the availability of these binding sites, dramatically lowering the avidity of their specific interactions and allowing rapid nuclear transport."

We have previously reported that Lcn2 induces the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer through the estrogen receptor α/Slug axis and that it is a potential noninvasive biomarker of this disease. Here, we report the novel finding that Lcn2 regulates breast cancer angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key angiogenic activator, was significantly increased with Lcn2 expression in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells as well as in an angiogenic line derived from MDA-MB-436 cells. Treatment with a VEGF-neutralizing antibody demonstrates that VEGF is essential for the angiogenic activity of Lcn2. We further demonstrate that Lcn2-induced VEGF is mediated through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and that Lcn2 regulates HIF-1α through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). The regulation of HIF-1α and VEGF by Lcn2 was also demonstrated in the aggressive MDA-MB-231 cell line. Using the mouse corneal pocket assay, we found that Lcn2 significantly enhanced the angiogenesis induced by VEGF. Taken together, these results are the first to demonstrate that Lcn2 promotes angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo and suggest a novel mechanism through which Lcn2 may promote tumor progression."

Here we examine a distinctive group of gene fusions that involve genes present in the loci of chromosomal amplifications--a class of oncogenic aberrations that are widely prevalent in breast cancers. Integrative analysis of a panel of 14 breast cancer cell lines comparing gene fusions discovered by high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and genome-wide copy number aberrations assessed by array comparative genomic hybridization, led to the identification of 77 gene fusions, of which more than 60% were localized to amplicons including 17q12, 17q23, 20q13, chr8q, and others. Many of these fusions appeared to be recurrent or involved highly expressed oncogenic drivers, frequently fused with multiple different partners, but sometimes displaying loss of functional domains. As illustrative examples of the &quot;amplicon-associated&quot; gene fusions, we examined here a recurrent gene fusion involving the mediator of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, RPS6KB1 kinase in BT-474, and the therapeutically important receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line. These gene fusions comprise a minor allelic fraction relative to the highly expressed full-length transcripts and encode chimera lacking the kinase domains, which do not impart dependence on the respective cells. Our study suggests that amplicon-associated gene fusions in breast cancer primarily represent a by-product of chromosomal amplifications, which constitutes a subset of passenger aberrations and should be factored accordingly during prioritization of gene fusion candidates."

However, the regulatory mechanism of MMP-9 expression and its biological effects on breast cancer development remain obscure. In the current study, we examined the potential role of annexin A1 (ANXA1) in regulating migration and invasion in breast cancer cell lines. Both ANXA1 mRNA and protein are expressed in the highly invasive, hormone-insensitive human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and SKBr3, but not in the hormone-responsive cell lines MCF-7 and T47D. Downregulation of ANXA1 expression with specific small interfering RNAs (ANXA1 siRNA) in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in decreased cancer cell migration and invasion. Ablation of ANXA1 expression decreases the expression of MMP-9 at both the mRNA and protein levels and also reduces the proteolytic activity of MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, silencing ANXA1 also decreases the transcriptional activity of MMP-9 by the suppression of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) activity. Collectively, these results indicate that ANXA1 functions as a positive regulator of MMP-9 expression and invasion of breast cancer cells through specific activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway."

To identify peptide mimotopes of MDA-LDL, phage display libraries were screened with the MDA-LDL-specific IgM monoclonal Ab LRO4, and the specificity and antigenic properties of MDA mimotopes were assessed in vitro and in vivo. We identified one 12-mer linear (P1) and one 7-mer cyclic (P2) peptide carrying a consensus sequence, which bound specifically to murine and human anti-MDA monoclonal Abs. Furthermore, MDA mimotopes were found to mimic MDA epitopes on the surface of apoptotic cells. Immunization of mice with P2 resulted in the induction of MDA-LDL-specific Abs, which strongly immunostained human atherosclerotic lesions. We detected IgG and IgM autoAbs to both MDA mimotopes in sera of healthy subjects and patients with myocardial infarction and stable angina pectoris undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, and the titers of autoAbs correlated significantly with respective Ab titers against MDA-LDL.

However, a large body of evidence has demonstrated that the effects of mitogenic estrogen signaling exhibit a non-monotonic or biphasic, dose-response curve; estrogen at low concentrations, elicits a mitogenic signaling pathway to stimulate cell proliferation, while at high concentrations, estrogen inhibits cell growth. The molecular mechanism underlying this paradoxical effect of estrogen on cell proliferation remains largely unknown. Recently, we reported that ER-α36, a variant of ER-α, mediates mitogenic estrogen signaling in ER-negative breast cancer cells. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the biphasic estrogen signaling in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 ER-negative breast cancer cells. We found that 17β-estradiol (E2β) at l nM induced the phosphorylation of Src-Y416, an event that activates Src, while at 5 µM failed to induce Src-Y416 phosphorylation but induced Src-Y527 phosphorylation an event that inactivates Src. E2β at 1 nM, but not at 5 µM, also induced phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK and activated Cyclin D1 promoter activity through the Src/EGFR/STAT5 pathway. Knockdown of ER‑α36 abrogated the biphasic estrogen signaling in these cells. Our results thus indicate that in ER-negative breast cancer cells Src functions as a switch in ER‑α36-mediated biphasic estrogen signaling through the EGFR/STAT5 pathway."

In several cancer models, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1α,25(OH)(2)D(3)) induces differentiation by increasing E-cadherin expression. The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) was evaluated as a possible therapeutic target for metaplastic carcinomas and 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) effects as a differentiating agent in triple-negative breast cancer cells were assessed.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Metaplastic carcinomas were assessed for VDR expression by immunohistochemistry; differences in E-cadherin expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells were evaluated by real-time PCR, western blotting and Cadherin 1 (CDH1) methylation status.RESULTS: Most of the metaplastic carcinomas were positive for VDR expression. Furthermore, 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) promoted differentiation of MDA-MB-231 cells by inducing de novo E-cadherin expression, an effect that was time- and dose-dependent. Also, E-cadherin expression was due to promoter demethylation.CONCLUSION: Metaplastic carcinomas may respond to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3), since they express VDR and 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) induces de novo E-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells by promoter demethylation."

In this study, we have acquired data supporting previous observations that demonstrate glutamine metabolism affects histone modifications in human breast cancer cell lines. Treatment of non-invasive epithelial (T-47D and MDA-MB-361) and invasive mesenchymal (MDA-MB-231 and Hs-578T) breast cancer cell lines with the glutaminase inhibitor, Compound 968, resulted in cytotoxicity in all cell lines, with the greatest effect being observed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Compound 968-treatment induced significant downregulation of 20 critical cancer-related genes, the majority of which are anti-apoptotic and/or promote metastasis, including AKT, BCL2, BCL2L1, CCND1, CDKN3, ERBB2, ETS1, E2F1, JUN, KITLG, MYB, and MYC. Histone H3K4me3, a mark of transcriptional activation, was reduced at the promoters of all but one of these critical cancer genes. The decrease in histone H3K4me3 at global and gene-specific levels correlated with reduced expression of SETD1 and ASH2L, genes encoding the histone H3K4 methyltransferase complex. Further, the expression of other epigenetic regulatory genes, known to be downregulated during apoptosis (e.g., DNMT1, DNMT3B, SETD1 and SIRT1), was also downregulated by Compound 968. These changes in gene expression and histone modifications were accompanied by the activation of apoptosis, and decreased invasiveness and resistance of MDA-MB-231 cells to chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. The results of this study provide evidence to a link between cytotoxicity caused by inhibiting glutamine metabolism with alterations of the epigenome of breast cancer cells and suggest that modification of intracellular metabolism may enhance the efficiency of epigenetic therapy."

Invasion by cancer cells has been associated with NFAT1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells) activation and expression of the COX-2 (cyclooxygenase 2) gene. We hypothesized that VRK proteins might play a regulatory role in NFAT1 activation in tumor cells. We demonstrate that VRK2 directly interacts and phosphorylates NFAT1 in Ser-32 within its N-terminal transactivation domain. VRK2 increases NFAT1-dependent transcription by phosphorylation, and this effect is only detected following cell phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin stimulation and calcineurin activation. This NFAT1 hyperactivation by VRK2 increases COX-2 gene expression through the proximal NFAT1 binding site in the COX-2 gene promoter. Furthermore, VRK2A down-regulation by RNA interference reduces COX-2 expression at transcriptional and protein levels. Therefore, VRK2 down-regulation reduces cell invasion by tumor cells, such as MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, upon stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin. These findings identify the first reported target and function of human VRK2 as an active kinase playing a role in regulation of cancer cell invasion through the NFAT pathway and COX-2 expression."

Here, we report a dramatic asymmetry in the ATP utilization cycle of this ring-shaped chaperonin, despite its apparently symmetric architecture. Only four of the eight different subunits bind ATP at physiological concentrations. ATP binding and hydrolysis by the low-affinity subunits is fully dispensable for TRiC function in vivo. The conserved nucleotide-binding hierarchy among TRiC subunits is evolutionarily modulated through differential nucleoside contacts. Strikingly, high- and low-affinity subunits are spatially segregated within two contiguous hemispheres in the ring, generating an asymmetric power stroke that drives the folding cycle. This unusual mode of ATP utilization likely serves to orchestrate a directional mechanism underlying TRiC/CCT's unique ability to fold complex eukaryotic proteins."

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Sorghum is a principal cereal food in many parts of the world, and is critical in folk medicine of Asia and Africa. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of HSE in metastatic breast cancer.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Preliminary studies conducted on MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7 xenograft models showed tumor growth suppression by HSE. Western blotting studies conducted both in vivo and in vitro to check the effect of HSE in Jak/STAT pathways. Anti-metastatic effects of HSE were confirmed using both MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7 metastatic animal models. These studies showed that HSE can modulate Jak/STAT pathways, and it hindered the STAT5b/IGF-1R and STAT3/VEGF pathways not only by down-regulating the expression of these signal molecules and but also by preventing their phosphorylation. The expression of angiogenic factors like VEGF, VEGF-R2 and cell cycle regulators like cyclin D, cyclin E, and pRb were found down-regulated by HSE. In addition, it also targets Brk, p53, and HIF-1α for anti-cancer effects. HSE induced G1 phase arrest and migration inhibition in MDA-MB 231 cells. The metastasis of breast cancer to the lungs also found blocked by HSE in the metastatic animal model.SIGNIFICANCE: Usage of HS as a dietary supplement is an inexpensive natural cancer therapy, without any side effects.

Whether their role is direct has remained unclear as they also regulate the expression of Shh, which has similar roles. We characterized the Foxa2 cis-regulatory network by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing of mDA progenitors. This identified 9160 high-quality Foxa2 binding sites associated with 5409 genes, providing mechanistic insights into Foxa2-mediated positive and negative regulatory events. Foxa2 regulates directly and positively key determinants of mDA neurons, including Lmx1a, Lmx1b, Msx1 and Ferd3l, while negatively inhibiting transcription factors expressed in ventrolateral midbrain such as Helt, Tle4, Otx1, Sox1 and Tal2. Furthermore, Foxa2 negatively regulates extrinsic and intrinsic components of the Shh signaling pathway, possibly by binding to the same enhancer regions of co-regulated genes as Gli1. Foxa2 also regulates the expression of floor plate factors that control axon trajectories around the midline of the embryo, thereby contributing to the axon guidance function of the floor plate. Finally, this study identified multiple Foxa2-regulated enhancers that are active in the floor plate of the midbrain or along the length of the embryo in mouse and chick. This work represents the first comprehensive characterization of Foxa2 targets in mDA progenitors and provides a framework for elaborating gene regulatory networks in a functionally important progenitor population."

We investigate here contributions of epigenetic modifications to transcriptional silencing of CIITA in variants of the human breast cancer cell line MDA MB 435. Significant increases in histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation upon IFN-γ stimulation correlate with reductions in transcription factor recruitment to the interferon-γ inducible CIITA promoter, CIITApIV, and with significantly increased CIITApIV occupancy by the histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). Most compelling is evidence that decreased expression of EZH2 in MDA MB 435 variants results in significant increases in CIITA and HLA-DRA mRNA expression, even in the absence of interferon-γ stimulation, as well as increased cell surface expression of MHC II. Together, these data add mechanistic insight to prior observations of increased EZH2 expression and decreased CIITA expression in multiple tumor types."

To overcome the problem of limiting amounts of available DNA, Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) methods have been developed. The multiple displacement amplification (MDA) method using Φ29 polymerase has become the preferred choice due to its high processivity and low error rate. However, the uniformity and fidelity of the amplification process across the genome has not been extensively characterized.RESULTS: To assess amplification uniformity, we used array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to evaluate DNA copy number variations (CNVs) in DNAs amplified by two MDA kits: GenomiPhi and REPLI-g. The Agilent Human CGH array containing nearly one million probes was used in this study together with DNAs from a normal subject and 2 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Each DNA sample was amplified 4 independent times and compared to its native unamplified DNA. Komogorov distances and Phi correlations showed a high consistency within each sample group. Less than 2% of the probes showed more than 2-fold CNV introduced by the amplification process. The two amplification kits, REPLI-g and GenomiPhi, generate very similar amplified DNA samples despite the differences between the unamplified and amplified DNA samples. The results from aCGH analysis indicated that there were no obvious CNVs in the CFTR gene region due to WGA when compared to unamplified DNA. This was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR copy number assays at 10 locations within the CFTR gene. DNA sequencing analysis of a 2-kb region within the CFTR gene showed no mutations introduced by WGA.CONCLUSION: The relatively high uniformity and consistency of the WGA process, coupled with the low replication error rate, suggests that WGA DNA may be suitable for accurate genotyping. Regions of the genome that were consistently under-amplified were found to contain higher than average GC content. Because of the consistent differences between the WGA DNA and the native unamplified DNA, characterization of the genomic region of interest, as described here, will be necessary to ensure the reliability of genotyping results from WGA DNA."

The majority of our current knowledge of miRNA expression and function in cancer cells is derived from monolayer 2-D culture on plastic substratum, which lacks consideration of the influence of ECM-mediated morphogenesis on miRNAs. In the present study, we compared the expression of miRNAs in rBM 3-D and 2-D cultures of the non-invasive MCF-7 and the invasive MDA-MB231 cells. Our findings revealed a profound difference in miRNA profiles between 2-D and rBM 3-D cultures within each cell type. Moreover, rBM 3-D culture exhibited greater discrimination in miRNA profiles between MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells than 2-D culture. The disparate miRNA profiles correlated with distinct mass morphogenesis of MCF-7 and invasive stellate morphogenesis of MDA-MB231 cells in rBM 3-D culture. Supplementation of the tumor promoting type I collagen in rBM 3-D culture substantially altered the miRNA signature of mass morphologenesis of MCF-7 cells in rBM 3-D culture. Overexpression of the differentially expressed miR-200 family member miR429 in MDA-MB231 cells attenuated their invasive stellate morphogenesis in rBM 3-D culture. In summary, we provide the first miRNA signatures of morphogenesis of human breast cancer cells in rBM 3-D culture and warrant further utilization of rBM 3-D culture in investigation of miRNAs in breast cancer."

About 30% of breast cancers, however, are hormone- independent because of lack of ERα expression. New strategies are needed for re-expression of ERα and sensitization of ER-negative breast cancer cells to selective ER modulators. The present report shows that arsenic trioxide induces reactivated ERα, providing a target for therapy with ER antagonists. Exposure of ER-negative breast cancer cells to arsenic trioxide leads to re-expression of ERα mRNA and functional ERα protein in in vitro and in vivo. Luciferase reporter gene assays and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assays show that, upon exposure to arsenic trioxide, formerly unresponsive, ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells become responsive to ER antagonists, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and ICI 182,780. Furthermore, methylation- specific PCR and bisulfite-sequencing PCR assays show that arsenic trioxide induces partial demethylation of the ERα promoter. A methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), reduces the degree of arsenic trioxide-induced re-expression of ERα and demethylation. Moreover, Western blot and ChIP assays show that arsenic trioxide represses expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a along with partial dissociation of DNMT1 from the ERα promoter. Thus, arsenic trioxide exhibits a previously undefined function which induces re-expression ERα in ER-negative breast cancer cells through demethylation of the ERα promoter. These findings could provide important information regarding the application of therapeutic agents targeting epigenetic changes in breast cancers and potential implication of arsenic trioxide as a new drug for the treatment of ER-negative human breast cancer."

FGFR1 affects brain cell development by two distinct mechanisms. Activation of cell surface FGFR1 by secreted FGFs stimulates proliferation of neural progenitor cells, whereas direct integrative nuclear FGFR1 signaling (INFS) is associated with an exit from the cell cycle and neuronal differentiation. Both Nurr1 and INFS activate expression of neuronal genes, such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis. Here, we show that nuclear FGFR1 and Nurr1 are expressed in the nuclei of developing TH-positive cells in the embryonic ventral midbrain. Both nuclear receptors were effectively co-immunoprecipitated from the ventral midbrain of FGF-2-deficient embryonic mice, which previously showed an increase of mDA neurons and enhanced nuclear FGFR1 accumulation. Immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments showed the presence of Nurr1 and FGFR1 in common nuclear protein complexes. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the Nurr1-mediated shift of nuclear FGFR1-EGFP mobility toward a transcriptionally active population and that both Nurr1 and FGFR1 bind to a common region in the TH gene promoter. Furthermore, nuclear FGFR1 or its 23-kDa FGF-2 ligand (FGF-2(23)) enhances Nurr1-dependent activation of the TH gene promoter. Transcriptional cooperation of FGFR1 with Nurr1 was confirmed on isolated Nurr1-binding elements. The proposed INFS/Nurr1 nuclear partnership provides a novel mechanism for TH gene regulation in mDA neurons and a potential therapeutic target in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders."

Significant decrease in Bp(ND) was found in the blocked groups compared with the unblocked ones (dimer p = 0.00024, monomer p = 0.005, n = 4/group). Similarly, the RAD control group showed the lowest Bp(ND) value among all the test groups, as the RAD peptide does not bind to integrin α(v)β(3). Volume of distribution (V(T) = K(1)/k (2)(1 + k (3)/k (4))) could be separated into non-specific (V (ND) = K (1)/k (2)) and specific (V (S) = K (1) k (3)/(k (2) k (4))) components. Specific distribution volume (V(S)) was the dominant component of V(T) in the unblocked groups and decreased in the blocked groups. Unblocked RGD dimer also showed higher V(S) than that of the monomer (dimer V(S) = 2.38 ± 0.15, monomer V(S) = 0.90 ± 0.17, p = 0.0013, n = 4/group), well correlated with Bp(ND) calculations. Little difference in V(ND) was found among all groups. Moreover, parametric maps allowed quantitative analysis at voxel level and provided higher tumor-to-background contrast for Bp(ND) maps than the static images. Tumor heterogeneity in kinetic parameters was found in parametric images, which could not be clearly identified in static intensity images.CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of both monomeric and dimeric RGD peptide tracers was compared, and the RGD dimers showed significantly higher binding affinity than the monomeric analogs. Kinetic parameters were demonstrated to be valuable for separating specific and non-specific binding and may allow more sensitive and detailed quantification than simple standardized uptake value analysis."

The hyper-phosphorylation of STAT3 was attributed to either up-regulated phosphorylation by several tyrosine-kinases or down-regulated activity of phosphatases. Although several factors have been identified to phosphorylate STAT3, it remains unclear how STAT3 is dephosphorylated by PTPMeg2. The aim of this study was to determine the role of PTPMeg2 as a phosphatase in regulation of the activity of STAT3 in breast cancers.METHODS: Immunoprecipitation assays were used to study the interaction of STAT3 with PTPMeg2. A series of biochemistry experiments were performed to evaluate the role of PTPMeg2 in the dephosphorylation of STAT3. Two breast cancer cell lines MCF7 (PTPMeg2 was depleted as it was endogenously high) and MDA-MB-231 (PTPMeg2 was overexpressed as it was endogenously low) were used to compare the level of phosphorylated STAT3 and the tumor growth ability in vitro and in vivo. Samples from breast carcinoma (n = 73) were subjected to a pair-wise Pearson correlation analysis for the correlation of levels of PTPMeg2 and phosphorylated STAT3.RESULTS: PTPMeg2 directly interacts with STAT3 and mediates its dephosphorylation in the cytoplasm. Over-expression of PTPMeg2 decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 while depletion of PTPMeg2 increased its phosphorylation. The decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is coupled with suppression of STAT3 transcriptional activity and reduced tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Levels of PTPMeg2 and phosphorylated STAT3 were inversely correlated in breast cancer tissues (P = 0.004).CONCLUSIONS: PTPMeg2 is an important phosphatase for the dephosphorylation of STAT3 and plays a critical role in breast cancer development."

In addition to DNA methylation, other epigenetic post-translational modifications that modulate the stability and binding of specific transcription factors to gene promoters have emerged as important mechanisms for controlling gene expression. The aim of this study was to analyse the implications of these mechanisms and their molecular connections in the reactivation of RASSF1A in breast cancer.METHODS: Compounds that modulate the intracellular concentration of adenosine, such as dipyridamole (DIPY), greatly increase the antiproliferative effects of 3-O-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-(-)-catechin (TMCG), a synthetic antifolate derived from the structure of tea catechins. Quantitative real-time PCR arrays and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicated that this combination (TMCG/DIPY) induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells by modulating the methylation levels of DNA and proteins (such as E2F1), respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were employed to confirm that this combination induced chromatin remodelling of the RASSF1A promoter and increased the occupancy of E2F1 at the promoter of this tumour suppressor gene.RESULTS: The TMCG/DIPY combination acted as an epigenetic treatment that reactivated RASSF1A expression and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In addition to modulating DNA methylation and chromatin remodelling, this combination also induced demethylation of the E2F1 transcription factor. The ChIP assay showed enhancement of E2F1 occupancy at the unmethylated RASSF1A promoter after TMCG/DIPY treatment. Interestingly, inhibition of E2F1 demethylation using an irreversible inhibitor of lysine-specific demethylase 1 reduced both TMCG/DIPY-mediated RASSF1A expression and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that DNA and protein demethylation may act together to control these molecular and cellular processes.SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that simultaneous targeting of DNA and E2F1 methylation is an effective epigenetic treatment that reactivates RASSF1A expression and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells."

However, the molecular mechanism of this growth inhibition and apoptosis is poorly understood. In this study, we used MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells which have different estrogen receptor (ER) and tumor suppressor p53 statuses to examine the mechanisms of taxol-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Treatment of the cells with taxol resulted in a time-dependent inhibition of cell viability, which was accompanied by an accumulation of cells at G2/M and the sub-G1 apoptotic region, determined by flow cytometric analysis. Furthermore, chromatin condensation, DNA ladder formation and proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in both cell lines were observed following treatment with taxol, indicating the occurrence of apoptotic cell death. Western blot analysis using whole cell lysates from MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with taxol demonstrated that taxol treatment inhibited expression of cyclin A and cyclin B1 proteins in a time-dependent manner. The inhibitory effects of taxol on cell growth and apoptosis induced by taxol were also associated with the downregulation of Wee1 kinase expression and a marked induction in the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21WAF/CIP1. Furthermore, taxol elevated p21 promoter activity in both cell lines. These findings suggest that taxol-induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis in human breast carcinoma cells is mediated through the ER- and p53-independent upregulation of p21."

In principle, conditionally replication-competent adenoviruses that induce tumor oncolysis through cancer-specific replication hold promise for cancer therapy. However, a single-agent approach may not be adequate to completely eradicate cancer in a patient because most cancers arise from abnormalities in multiple genetic and signal transduction pathways and targeting disseminated metastases is difficult to achieve. Based on these considerations, a novel class of cancer destroying adenoviruses have been produced, cancer terminator viruses (CTVs), in which cancer-specific replication is controlled by the progression-elevated gene-3 promoter and replicating viruses produce a second transgene encoding an apoptosis-inducing and immunomodulatory cytokine, either melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24) or interferon-γ.

We sought to determine if TFAP2C regulates Ret expression directly or indirectly through ER.METHODS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and gel-shift assay were used to identify TFAP2C binding sites in the RET promoter in four breast cancer cell lines. Ret mRNA and protein levels were evaluated in ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cell lines after knockdown of TFAP2C. Luciferase expression assay was performed to assess expression from two of the identified sites.RESULTS: ChIP-Seq identified five main binding peaks for TFAP2C in the RET promoter at -101.5 kb, -50.7 kb, -32.5 kb, +5.0 kb, and +33.6 from the RET transcriptional start site. Binding at three of the AP-2 sites was conserved across all four cell lines, whereas the RET -101.5 and RET +33.6 sites were each found to be unbound by TFAP2C in one cell line. A TFAP2C consensus element was confirmed for all five sites. Knockdown of TFAP2C by siRNA in ER-positive MCF-7 cells resulted in significant down regulation of Ret mRNA compared to nontargeting (NT) siRNA (0.09 vs. 1.0, P &lt; 0.001). Knockdown of TFAP2C in ER-negative MDA-MB-453 cells also led to a significant reduction in Ret mRNA compared to NT siRNA (0.16 vs. 1.0, P &lt; 0.001). In MCF-7 cells, knockdown of TFAP2C abrogated Ret protein expression (0.02 vs. 1.0, P &lt; 0.001) before reduction in ER.CONCLUSIONS: TFAP2C regulates expression of the RET proto-oncogene through five AP-2 regulatory sites in the RET promoter. Regulation of Ret by TFAP2C occurs independently of ER expression in breast carcinoma."

CCN5 is a transcriptional repressor of genes associated with the EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and plays an important role in maintenance of the differentiated phenotype in ER (oestrogen receptor)-positive breast cancer cells. In contrast, CCN5 is undetectable in more aggressive ER-negative breast cancer cells. We now report that CCN5 is induced in ER-negative breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231 following glucocorticoid exposure, due to interaction of the endogenous glucocorticoid receptor with a functional glucocorticoid-response element in the CCN5 gene promoter. Glucocorticoid treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells is accompanied by morphological alterations, decreased invasiveness and attenuated expression of mesenchymal markers, including vimentin, cadherin 11 and ZEB1 (zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1). Interestingly, glucocorticoid exposure did not increase CCN5 expression in ER-positive breast cancer cells, but rather down-regulated ER expression, thereby attenuating oestrogen pathway signalling. Taken together, our results indicate that glucocorticoid treatment of ER-negative breast cancer cells induces high levels of CCN5 expression and is accompanied by the appearance of a more differentiated and less invasive epithelial phenotype. These findings propose a novel therapeutic strategy for high-risk breast cancer patients."

Here the steady-state kinetic mechanism of eEF-2K is presented using a peptide substrate and is shown to conform to an ordered sequential mechanism with ATP binding first. Substrate inhibition by the peptide was observed and revealed to be competitive with ATP, explaining the observed ordered mechanism. Several small molecules are reported to inhibit eEF-2K activity with the most notable being the histidine kinase inhibitor NH125, which has been used in a number of studies to characterize eEF-2K activity in cells. While NH125 was previously reported to inhibit eEF-2K in vitro with an IC(50) of 60 nM, its mechanism of action was not established. Using the same kinetic assay, the ability of an authentic sample of NH125 to inhibit eEF-2K was assessed over a range of substrate and inhibitor concentrations. A typical dose-response curve for the inhibition of eEF-2K by NH125 is best fit to an IC(50) of 18 ± 0.25 μM and a Hill coefficient of 3.7 ± 0.14, suggesting that NH125 is a weak inhibitor of eEF-2K under the experimental conditions of a standard in vitro kinase assay. To test the possibility that NH125 is a potent inhibitor of eEF2 phosphorylation, we assessed its ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of eEF2. Under standard kinase assay conditions, NH125 exhibits a similar weak ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of eEF2 by eEF-2K. Notably, the activity of NH125 is severely abrogated by the addition of 0.1% Triton to the kinase assay through a process that can be reversed upon dilution. These studies suggest that NH125 is a nonspecific colloidal aggregator in vitro, a notion further supported by the observation that NH125 inhibits other protein kinases, such as ERK2 and TRPM7 in a manner similar to that of eEF-2K. As NH125 is reported to inhibit eEF-2K in a cellular environment, its ability to inhibit eEF2 phosphorylation was assessed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, A549 lung cancer, and HEK-293T cell lines using a Western blot approach. No sign of a decrease in the level of eEF2 phosphorylation was observed up to 12 h following addition of NH125 to the media. Furthermore, contrary to the previously reported literatures, NH125 induced the phosphorylation of eEF-2."

Several ongoing clinical trials are assessing the unique therapeutic potential of Aurora-based targeted therapy, but several severe adverse events such as hematopoietic toxicity have been observed in the early-phase clinical trials because Aurora A is also involved in normal cells proliferation process. The strategy to develop tumor-specific inhibition of this target may be an alteration for the treatment of Aurora A overexpression tumors. In this study, we developed a novel tumor-specific RNA interference adenovirus system targeting Aurora A by using stathmin promoter and investigated the effects of it on the proliferation, apoptosis and chemotherapy sensitivity in human breast carcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that treatment of human breast carcinoma cells (SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231) by Aurora A short hairpin RNA (shRNA) driven by stathmin gene promoter not only inhibited the cells proliferation, but also enhanced the chemosensitivity to paclitaxel via downregulation of Aurora A mRNA and protein expression, which further decreased the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt and p-BRCA1 protein expression. Furthermore, there were no obvious phenotypes changes observed in normally differentiated epithelial cells of MCF210. Therefore, stathmin promoter-driving Aurora A shRNA adenoviral system may have potential use, with targeted tumor gene silencing effect and as adjuvant tumor-specific therapy method, in the treatment of human breast carcinomas."

Consequently, we investigated the effects of equol on DNA methylation of breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) and oncosuppressors in breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) and in a dystrophic breast cell line (MCF-10a) following exposure to S-equol (2 μm) for 3 weeks.

We also showed that S-equol increases BRCA1 and BRCA2 protein expression in the nuclei and the cytoplasm in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10a cell lines by immunohistochemistry. The increase in BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins was also found after Western blotting in the studied cell lines.

Therefore, gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches were employed in db/db mice to investigate the functions of ACOT1 in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and heart function. We found that in the hearts of db/db mice which overexpressed ACOT1, H(2)O(2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were reduced, the activities of ATPases in mitochondria associated with mitochondrial function were promoted, the expression of uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) contributing to oxygen wastage for noncontractile purposes was decreased, and cardiac dysfunction was attenuated, as determined by both hemodynamic and echocardiographic detections. Consistently, ACOT1 deficiency had opposite effects, which accelerated the cardiac damage induced by diabetes. Notably, by real-time PCR, we found that overexpression of ACOT1 in diabetic heart repressed the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha/PPARγ coactivator 1α (PPARα/PGC1α) signaling, as shown by decreased expression of PGC1α and the downstream genes involved in FAs use.CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that ACOT1 played a crucial protective role in diabetic heart via PPARα/PGC1α signaling."

MpAFP was purified from bacterial lysates by ice adsorption and gel electrophoresis. We have previously reported that two highly repetitive sequences, region II (RII) and region IV (RIV), divide MpAFP into five distinct regions, all of which require mM Ca(2+) levels for correct folding. Also, the antifreeze activity is confined to the 322-residue RIV, which forms a Ca(2+)-bound beta-helix containing thirteen Repeats-In-Toxin (RTX)-like repeats. RII accounts for approximately 90% of the mass of MpAFP and is made up of ∼120 tandem 104-residue repeats. Because these repeats are identical in DNA sequence, their number was estimated here by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Structural homology analysis by the Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine (Phyre2) server indicates that the 104-residue RII repeat adopts an immunoglobulin beta-sandwich fold that is typical of many secreted adhesion proteins. Additional RTX-like repeats in RV may serve as a non-cleavable signal sequence for the type I secretion pathway. Immunodetection shows both repeated regions are uniformly distributed over the cell surface. We suggest that the development of an AFP-like domain within this adhesin attached to the bacterial outer surface serves to transiently bind the host bacteria to ice. This association would keep the bacteria within the upper reaches of the water column where oxygen and nutrients are potentially more abundant. This novel envirotactic role would give AFPs a third function, after freeze avoidance and freeze tolerance: that of transiently binding an organism to ice."

Several potential resistance mechanisms have been investigated, but the results are controversial and no conclusion has been reached. Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) may function in cell growth, and expressed in various cancer cells. Because the downstream signaling pathways for EPOR and HER2 partially overlapped, we hypothesized that EPOR may play a role in the inhibition effect of trastuzumab and resistance to trastuzumab. Here, we detected the expression of EPOR mRNA and protein in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines and tissues. EPOR expressed in SKBR3, MDA-MB-453, and UACC-812 cell lines, but not in BT474. Of the 55 HER2-positive cancer tissues, EPOR was positive in 42 samples and highly expressed (H-score ≥ 25) in 24 by immunohistochemistry. The difference between EPOR expression and Ki67 index was significant (P = 0.033), and EPOR expression also positively correlated with higher pathological stage (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.359; P = 0.007). Exogenous EPO antagonized trastuzumab-induced inhibition of cell proliferation in HER2/EPOR dual-positive breast cancer cells. We then exposed SKBR3 cells to trastuzumab for 4 months to obtain trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cell line, which demonstrated higher phosphorylated EPOR level, higher EPO expression and more extracellular secretion than non-resistant parental SKBR3 cells. Downregulation EPOR expression using short hairpin RNA resensitized trastuzumab-resistant cells to this drug, and SKBR3 cells with EPOR downregulation demonstrated attenuated trastuzumab resistance after the same resistance induction. EPOR downregulation plus trastuzumab produced a synergetic action in the inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-453 cell lines. Therefore, EPOR expression may be involved in tumor progression and proliferation in HER2-positive breast cancer. EPO/EPOR contributes to the mechanism of trastuzumab resistance in SKBR3 cell lines, and EPOR downregulation can reverse the resistance to trastuzumab and increase the inhibition effect of this drug."

However, the relationship between the different modes of E-cadherin inactivation (mutation versus promotor hypermethylation) and breast cancer cell behavior is incompletely understood. The high correlation between E-cadherin inactivation status and cell morphology in vitro suggests different biological roles for the two inactivation modes during breast tumorigenesis. Because E-cadherin has been linked to cell invasion and metastasis, and cell motility is a crucial prerequisite to form metastases, we here compared the cell motility capacities of breast cancer cell lines with known E-cadherin status. Using barrier migration assays and time-lapse microscopy, we analyzed the migratory capacity of nine well-characterized human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, T47D, BT549, MPE600, CAMA-1, SUM159PT, SUM52PE, and SK-BR-3). This subset was chosen based on E-cadherin gene status (wild-type, mutated, and promotor hypermethylated): three cell lines of each group. In addition, cell proliferation assays were performed for all conditions, to dissect migratory from proliferative effects. In this study, we demonstrate an overt association between the mode of E-cadherin inactivation and cell migration. Promotor hypermethylated E-cadherin cell lines showed a higher migration capacity, while cell lines with mutated E-cadherin were less motile compared to wild-type E-cadherin cell lines. Migration induction by fibronectin and basic fibroblast growth factor did not alter the cell motility association differences. Cell proliferation assays showed that the associations found were not caused by proliferation differences. Inhibition and overexpression of E-cadherin as well as DNA demethylation confirmed the relationship between E-cadherin and breast cancer cell motility. Our results demonstrate an association between the mode of E-cadherin inactivation and migration of breast cancer cells, which justifies more detailed research on the role of E-cadherin inactivation in cell migration and metastasis."

This study investigated the influence of Matrigel on the expression of miRNAs that might facilitate ECM-associated cancer cell growth. We performed miRNA profiling by microarray using two colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW620), identifying significant differential expression of miRNAs between cells cultured in Matrigel and on plastic. Many of these miRNAs have previously been implicated in cancer-related processes. A common Matrigel-induced miRNA signature comprised of up-regulated miR-1290 and miR-210 and down-regulated miR-29b and miR-32 was identified using RT-qPCR across five epithelial cancer cell lines (SW480, SW620, HT-29, A549 and MDA-MB-231). Experimental modulation of these miRNAs altered expression of their known target mRNAs involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and invasion, in colon cancer cell lines. Furthermore, ITGA5 was identified as a novel putative target of miR-32 that may facilitate cancer cell interactions with the ECM. We propose that culture of cancer cell lines in Matrigel more accurately recapitulates miRNA expression and function in cancer than culture on plastic and thus is a valuable approach to the in vitro study of miRNAs."

We show that both splice variants have a positive effect on the metastatic potential of cells in vitro and on tumor progression in vivo.

Here, we aimed to elucidate potential differences in the role of those two GTPases in vesicle trafficking during cell migration.METHODS: We expressed Rab11 and Rab25 wildtype and mutant constructs in HeLa and MDA-MB231 cells and measured their effect on cell morphology, vesicle dynamics and migration behaviour. In prostate cancer samples we analyzed the expression of both GTPases.RESULTS: Cells grown on fibronectin displayed a more stretched morphology when Rab11 was inactivated, whereas inactivation of Rab25 led to reduced stretching. Overexpression of both Rab11 and Rab25 accelerated cell migration. Analysis of vesicular movement revealed higher transport efficiency in the inner cell compartment for Rab11 positive vesicles and in proximity to the membrane for Rab25 positive vesicles. Interestingly, we found Rab25 to be highly expressed in prostate cancer tissue.CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggest that Rab11 is mainly responsible for basal long-distance transport from the rear end to the front of the migrating cell, whereas Rab25 acts predominantly in the small-scale fast recycling within the tips of the cell. Our results further support the idea of Rab25 as a promoter of tumor development."

A functionally irreducible complex contains multiple copies of three proteins: the RsbRA coantagonist, RsbS antagonist, and RsbT serine-threonine kinase. Homologues of these proteins are coencoded in different genome contexts in diverse bacteria, forming a versatile sensing and transmission module called RST after its common constituents. However, the signaling pathway within the stressosome itself is not well defined. The N-terminal, nonheme globin domains of RsbRA project from the stressosome and are presumed to channel sensory input to the C-terminal STAS domains that form the complex core. A conserved, 13-residue α-helical linker connects these domains. We probed the in vivo role of the linker using alanine scanning mutagenesis, assaying stressosome output in B. subtilis via a σ(B)-dependent reporter fusion. Substitutions at four conserved residues increased output 4- to 30-fold in unstressed cells, whereas substitutions at four nonconserved residues significantly decreased output. The periodicity of these effects supports a model in which RsbRA functions as a dimer in vivo, with the linkers forming parallel paired helices via a conserved interface. The periodicity further suggests that the opposite, nonconserved faces make additional contacts important for efficient stressosome operation. These results establish that the linker influences stressosome output under steady-state conditions. However, the stress response phenotypes of representative linker substitutions provide less support for the notion that the N-terminal globin domain senses acute environmental challenge and transmits this information via the linker helix."

Examination of TdAtg8 expression patterns indicated that Atg8 expression was strongly upregulated under drought stress, especially in the roots when compared to leaves. LysoTracker(®) red marker, utilized to observe autophagosomes, revealed that autophagy is constitutively active in Triticum dicoccoides. Moreover, autophagy was determined to be induced in plants exposed to osmotic stress when compared to plants grown under normal conditions. Functional studies were executed in yeast to confirm that the TdATG8 protein is functional, and showed that the TdAtg8 gene complements the atg8∆::kan MX yeast mutant strain grown under nitrogen deficiency. For further functional analysis, TdATG8 protein was expressed in yeast and analyzed using Western immunoblotting. Atg8-silenced plants were exposed to drought stress and chlorophyll and malondialdehyde (MDA) content measurements demonstrated that Atg8 plays a key role on drought stress tolerance. In addition, Atg8-silenced plants exposed to osmotic stress were found to have decreased Atg8 expression level in comparison to controls. Hence, Atg8 is a positive regulator in osmotic and drought stress response."

Further, up-regulation of TG2 expression occurs during response to various forms of cell stress; however, the molecular mechanisms that drive inducible expression of the TG2 gene (TGM2) require elucidation. Here we show that genotoxic stress induces TG2 expression through the Ataxia-Telangiectasia, Mutated (ATM)/Nuclear Factor κ light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) signaling pathway. We further document that NFκB is both necessary and sufficient to drive constitutive TG2 expression in cultured cell lines. Additionally, shRNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of the ATM kinase results in reduced constitutive TG2 expression and NFκB transcriptional activity. We document that the NFκB subunit p65 (RelA) interacts with two independent consensus NFκB binding sites within the TGM2 promoter, that mutation of either site or pharmacological inhibition of NFκB reduces TGM2 promoter activity, and genotoxic stress drives heightened association of p65 with the TGM2 promoter. Finally, we observed that knockdown of either p65 or ATM in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells expressing recombinant TG2 partially reduces resistance to doxorubicin, indicating that the drug resistance linked to overexpression of TG2 functions, in part, through p65 and ATM. This work establishes a novel ATM-dependent signaling loop where TG2 and NFκB activate each other resulting in sustained activation of NFκB and acquisition of a drug-resistant phenotype."

Vascular endothelial growth inhibitor (VEGI), a potent and relatively nontoxic endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, has been intensively studied, and this work shed new light on developing promising anti-angiogenic strategies. It is well-documented that the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif exhibits high binding affinity to integrin α(v)β(3), which is abundantly expressed in cancer cells and specifically associated with angiogenesis on tumors. Here, we designed a fusion protein containing the special RGD-4C motif sequence and VEGI-192, aimed at offering more effective multiple targeting to tumor cells and tumor vasculature, and higher anti-angiogenic and antitumor efficacy. Functional tests demonstrated that the purified recombinant human RGD-VEGI-192 protein (rhRGD-VEGI-192) potently inhibited endothelial growth in vitro and suppressed neovascularization in chicken chorioallantoic membrane in vivo, to a higher degree as compared with rhVEGI-192 protein. More importantly, rhRGD-VEGI-192, but not rhVEGI-192 protein, could potentially target MDA-MB-435 breast tumor cells, significantly inhibiting growth of MDA-MB-435 cells in vitro, triggered apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 cells by activation of caspase-8 as well as caspase-3, which was mediated by activating the JNK signaling associated with upregulation of pro-apoptotic protein Puma, and consequently led to the observed significant antitumor effect in vivo against a human breast cancer xenograft. Our study indicated that the RGD-VEGI-192 fusion protein might represent a novel anti-angiogenic and antitumor strategy."

Mesencephalic dopaminergic (mDA) differentiation requires the activation of a cascade of transcription factors, among which play a crucial role the nuclear receptor Nurr1 and the paired-like homeodomain 3, Pitx3. During development the expression of Nurr1 precedes that of Pitx3 and those of typical dopaminergic markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine Transporter (DAT) that are directly regulated by Nurr1. Interestingly we have previously demonstrated that Nurr1 RNA silencing reduced Pitx3 transcripts, leading to the hypothesis that Nurr1 may control Pitx3 expression.Here we show that Nurr1 overexpression up-regulates that of Pitx3 in a dose-dependent manner by binding to a non-canonical NBRE consensus sequence, located at the 5' site of the gene. Interestingly, this sequence shows the same effect as the canonical one in promoting gene translation, and its deletion abolishes the ability of Nurr1 to sustain reporter gene expression. Moreover, we show that there is a direct interaction between Nurr1 and the Pitx3 gene promoter in dopaminergic cell cultures and midbrain embryonic tissue. Altogether, our results suggest that the regulation of Pitx3 by Nurr1 may be an essential event controlling the development and function of mDA neurons."

Although their cytotoxicity has been attributed to cell-cycle arrest through stabilization of microtubules, the mechanisms by which tumor cells die remains unclear. Paclitaxel has been shown to induce soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (sTNF-α) production in macrophages, but the involvement of TNF production in taxane cytotoxicity or resistance in tumor cells has not been established. Our study aimed to correlate alterations in the TNF pathway with taxane cytotoxicity and the acquisition of taxane resistance.METHODS: MCF-7 cells or isogenic drug-resistant variants (developed by selection for surviving cells in increasing concentrations of paclitaxel or docetaxel) were assessed for sTNF-α production in the absence or presence of taxanes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for sensitivity to docetaxel or sTNF-α by using a clonogenic assay (in the absence or presence of TNFR1 or TNFR2 neutralizing antibodies). Nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity was also measured with ELISA, whereas gene-expression changes associated with docetaxel resistance in MCF-7 and A2780 cells were determined with microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR).RESULTS: MCF-7 and A2780 cells increased production of sTNF-α in the presence of taxanes, whereas docetaxel-resistant variants of MCF-7 produced high levels of sTNF-α, although only within a particular drug-concentration threshold (between 3 and 45 nM). Increased production of sTNF-α was NF-κB dependent and correlated with decreased sensitivity to sTNF-α, decreased levels of TNFR1, and increased survival through TNFR2 and NF-κB activation. The NF-κB inhibitor SN-50 reestablished sensitivity to docetaxel in docetaxel-resistant MCF-7 cells. Gene-expression analysis of wild-type and docetaxel-resistant MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and A2780 cells identified changes in the expression of TNF-α-related genes consistent with reduced TNF-induced cytotoxicity and activation of NF-κB survival pathways.CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time that taxanes can promote dose-dependent sTNF-α production in tumor cells at clinically relevant concentrations, which can contribute to their cytotoxicity. Defects in the TNF cytotoxicity pathway or activation of TNF-dependent NF-κB survival genes may, in contrast, contribute to taxane resistance in tumor cells. These findings may be of strong clinical significance."

In this study, we investigated whether anisomycin treatment could modulate TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human renal carcinoma Caki cells. We found that anisomycin treatment (10-15 nM) alone had no effect on the level of apoptosis, but a combination treatment of anisomycin and TRAIL significantly increased the level of apoptosis in human renal carcinoma (Caki, ACHN and A498), human glioma (U251MG), and human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-361 and MCF7) cells. Anisomycin treatment led to the down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression at the transcriptional level, and the over-expression of Bcl-2 inhibited the apoptosis induced by the combination treatment of anisomycin and TRAIL. Furthermore, anisomycin treatment resulted in the down-regulation of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 at the post-transcriptional level, and the over-expression of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 blocked the induction of apoptosis caused by the combination treatment of anisomycin with TRAIL. In contrast, anisomycin treatment had no effect on the levels of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in mouse kidney cells (TMCK-1) or normal human skin fibroblasts (HSF). Cumulatively, our study demonstrates that anisomycin treatment enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis through the down-regulation of Bcl-2, c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level."

Breast cancer cells express the leptin receptor and are able to synthesize leptin in response to obesity-related stimuli. Furthermore, leptin is a positive regulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and high levels of both proteins are associated with worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) ligands are therapeutic agents used in patient with Type 2 diabetes and obesity which have recently been studied for their potential anti-tumor effect. Here, we studied if these compounds, ciglitazone and GW1929, can affect the expression of leptin and VEGF in breast cancer cells. In MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, treatment with submolar concentrations of ciglitazone and GW1929 elevated the expression of leptin and VEGF mRNA and protein, and increased cell viability and migration. These effects coincided with increased recruitment of PPARγ to the proximal leptin promoter and decreased association of a transcriptional factor Sp1 with this DNA region."

In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of DNA methylation profile in BCL2/E1B adenovirus interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) on the oxidative stress in CAD. Further, the contribution of folate pathway genetic polymorphisms in regulating epigenome was elucidated. The expression of BNIP3, EC-SOD, and GSTP1 were studied by using Maxima@SYBR-green based real-time qPCR approach in peripheral blood samples. Combined bisulfite restriction analysis and methylation-specific PCR were used to study promoter CpG island methylation. Further, the effect of homocysteine on BNIP3 gene expression was studied in human aortic endothelial cells in vitro. CAD cases exhibited upregulation of BNIP3, downregulation of EC-SOD and GSTP1. Hypomethylation of BNIP3 and hypermethylation of EC-SOD were observed in CAD cases. The expression of BNIP3 was positively correlated with homocysteine, MDA, protein carbonyls, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T, while showing inverse association with cytosolic serine hydroxymethyl transferase C1420T. The expressions of EC-SOD and GSTP1 showed positive association with thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 2R3R, while inverse association with MDA, protein carbonyls, and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) A66G. In vitro analysis showed homocysteine-dependent upregulation of BNIP3. The results of this study suggest that the aberrations in one-carbon metabolism appear to induce altered gene expression of EC-SOD, GSTP1, and BNIP3, and thus contribute to the increased oxidative stress and increased susceptibility to CAD."

Chemoresistance and radioresistance are the principal causes of failure of pancreatic cancer patients to respond to therapy. Conditionally replication competent adenovirus (CRCA)-based cancer gene therapy is an innovative strategy for treating cancers displaying inherent resistance to treatment. Limitations of current adenovirus (Ad)-based gene therapies for malignant tumors include lack of cancer-specificity, and effective and targeted delivery. To remedy this situation, CRCAs have been designed that express E1A, necessary for Ad replication, under the control of a cancer-specific progression elevated gene-3 promoter (PEG-Prom) with concomitant expression of an immunomodulatory cytokine, such as mda-7/IL-24 or interferon-γ (IFN-γ), under the control of a ubiquitous and strong cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV-Prom) from the E3 region. These bipartite CRCAs, when armed with a transgene, are called cancer terminator viruses (CTVs), i.e., Ad.PEG-E1A-CMV-mda-7 (CTV-M7) and Ad.PEG-E1A-CMV-IFN-γ (CTV-γ), because of their universal effectiveness in cancer treatment irrespective of p53/pRb/p16 or other genetic alterations in tumor cells. In addition to their selective oncolytic effects in tumor cells, the potent 'bystander antitumor' properties of MDA-7/IL-24 and IFN-γ embody the CTVs with expanded treatment properties for both primary and distant cancers. Pancreatic cancer cells display a &quot;translational block&quot; of mda-7/IL-24 mRNA, limiting production of MDA-7/IL-24 protein and cancer-specific apoptosis. Specific chemopreventive agents abrogate this &quot;translational block&quot; resulting in pancreatic cancer-specific killing. This novel chemoprevention gene therapy (CGT) strategy holds promise for both prevention and treatment of pancreatic cancers where all other strategies have proven ineffective."

The level and localization of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 protein were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was established to evaluate the relative mRNA expression levels of TGF-β1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6.RESULTS: Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased after irradiation and then significantly reduced (1.9-fold) under melatonin treatment. Changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities, as well as glutathione (GSH) levels, after irradiation were significantly reduced by melatonin, including a notable 5.4-fold difference in catalase activity. We observed increased expression of TGF-β1 and TNF-α after irradiation and a significant reduction in the elevation of their expression by melatonin treatment. Furthermore, irradiation-induced histopathologic alterations were obviously abated in the melatonin-pretreated mice.CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that melatonin reduces radiation-induced lung injury via a significant reduction of oxidative stress and of the production of cytokines, such as TGF-β1 and TNF-α, the production of which increased following lung irradiation."

Reduced genome coverage resulting in Allele Drop Out (ADO) at heterozygous loci or missing genotypes are drawbacks of MDA.

Missing genotypes and ADO drastically increased when fewer than 30-40 cells or the genomic equivalents were used. However, embryo viability was found to be reduced if biopsied with more than 10 cells.

Clinical trials and retrospective analyses showed that ER-positive (ER+) tumors were more vulnerable to development of chemotherapy resistance than ER-negative (ER-) tumors. The underlying mechanism is still to be elucidated. Aberrant DNA methylation has been recognized to be associated with cancer chemotherapy resistance. Recently, steroid hormone and their receptors have been found to be involved in the regulation of methyltransferases (DNMTs) and thereby contribute to chemotherapy resistance. The purpose of this study is to explore whether ERα could directly regulate the DNMTs expression.

The aim of this study was to identify new mechanisms responsible for hypoxia-induced resistance in breast cancer cells.METHODS: MDA-MB-231 and HepG2 cells were incubated in the presence of taxol or etoposide respectively under normoxia and hypoxia and apoptosis was analysed. A whole transcriptome analysis was performed in order to identify genes whose expression profile was correlated with apoptosis. The effect of gene invalidation using siRNA was studied on drug-induced apoptosis.RESULTS: MDA-MB-231 cells incubated in the presence of taxol were protected from apoptosis and cell death by hypoxia. We demonstrated that TMEM45A expression was associated with taxol resistance. TMEM45A expression was increased both in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and in HepG2 human hepatoma cells in conditions where protection of cells against apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents was observed, i.e. under hypoxia in the presence of taxol or etoposide. Moreover, this resistance was suppressed by siRNA-mediated silencing of TMEM45A. Kaplan Meier curve showed an association between high TMEM45A expression and poor prognostic in breast cancer patients. Finally, TMEM45 is highly expressed in normal differentiated keratinocytes both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this protein is involved in epithelial functions.CONCLUSION: Altogether, our results unravel a new mechanism for taxol and etoposide resistance mediated by TMEM45A.

However, a body of evidence indicated that the effects of mitogenic EGF signaling exhibit a non-monotonic, or biphasic dose response curve; EGF at low concentrations elicits a mitogenic signaling pathway to stimulate cell proliferation while at high concentrations, EGF inhibits cell growth. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this paradoxical effect of EGF on cell proliferation remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the biphasic EGF signaling in ER-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells, both of which express endogenous EGFR. We found that EGF at low concentrations induced the phosphorylation of the Src-Y416 residue, an event to activate Src, while at high concentrations allowed Src-Y527 phosphorylation that inactivates Src. EGF at 10 ng/ml also induced phosphorylation of the MAPK/ERK and activated cyclin D1 promoter activity through the Src/EGFR/STAT5 pathways but not at a higher concentration (500 ng/ml). Our results thus demonstrated that Src functions as a switch of EGF signaling depending on concentrations of EGF."

Assessment of HER2 expression in vivo would advance development of new HER2-targeted therapeutic agents and, potentially, facilitate choice of the proper treatment strategy offered to the individual patient. We present novel HER2-specific probes for in vivo evaluation of the receptor status by near-infrared (NIR) optical imaging.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Affibody molecules were expressed, purified, and labeled with NIR-fluorescent dyes. The binding affinity and specificity of the obtained probe were tested in vitro. For in vivo validation, the relationship of the measured NIR signal and HER2 expression was characterized in four breast cancer xenograft models, expressing different levels of HER2. Accumulation of Affibody molecules in tumor tissue was further confirmed by ex vivo analysis.RESULTS: Affibody-DyLight conjugates showed high affinity to HER2 (K(D) = 3.66±0.26). No acute toxicity resulted from injection of the probes (up to 0.5 mg/kg) into mice. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a relatively short (37.53±2.8 min) half-life of the tracer in blood. Fluorescence accumulation in HER2-positive BT-474 xenografts was evident as soon as a few minutes post injection and reached its maximum at 90 minutes. On the other hand, no signal retention was observed in HER2-negative MDA-MB-468 xenografts. Immunostaining of extracted tumor tissue confirmed penetration of the tracer into tumor tissue.CONCLUSIONS: The results of our studies suggest that Affibody-DyLight-750 conjugate is a powerful tool to monitor HER2 status in a preclinical setting. Following clinical validation, it might provide complementary means for assessment of HER2 expression in breast cancer patients (assuming availability of proper NIR scanners) and/or be used to facilitate detection of HER2-positive metastatic lesions during NIR-assisted surgery."

Previously we have shown that the indole-3-carbinol cyclic tetrameric derivative CTet induces autophagy and inhibits cell proliferation via inhibition of Akt activity and overexpression of p21/CDKN1A and GADD45A, in both estrogen receptor-positive (MCF-7) and triple negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell lines. In the present study, we further characterize the autophagic response and investigate the mechanism through which CTet regulates these events.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Analysis of gene expression microarray data and subsequent confirmation by quantitative real-time PCR, showed that CTet is able to induce up-regulation of key signaling molecules involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (e.g. DDIT3/CHOP, CHAC1, ATF3, HSPA5/BiP/GRP78, CEBPB, ASNS) and autophagy (e.g. MAP1LC3B), in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Moreover, the monitoring of Xbp-1 splicing confirmed the activation of IRE1/Xbp-1 ER stress response branch after CTet treatment. The role of autophagic processes (known to be induced by ER stress) was investigated further through ATG5 gene silencing and pharmacological inhibition of AVOs formation. CTet was shown to induce an autophagy-related cell death. Moreover, CTet-treated cells stained with Hoechst/PI revealed the presence of necrotic processes without evidence of apoptosis.SIGNIFICANCE: The ER stress response was identified as the main upstream molecular mechanism through which CTet acts in both hormone-responsive and triple-negative breast cancer cells. Because of its important role in cancer development, ER stress is a potential target in cancer therapy. The abiltiy of CTet to induce ER stress response and subsequently activate a death program in tumor cells confirms this molecule as a promising anticancer agent."

Both SKI-II and ABC294640 demonstrated greater efficacy in basal-A compared with luminal breast cancer. ABC294640, in particular, induced apoptosis and blocked proliferation both in vitro and in vivo in this triple-negative breast cancer system.

Although the BCA2 promoter contains several estrogen response element (ERE) half-sites, the role of ER in the regulation of BCA2 transcription has not been reported. The aim of this study is to investigate the molecular mechanism by which estrogen regulates BCA2 transcription. BCA2 mRNA and protein levels were examined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively, and localization was assessed by immunofluorescence. BCA2 promoter activity in response to E(2) was tested by a dual luciferase reporter assay and ER binding to the BCA2 promoter was examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. We found that BCA2 mRNA and protein levels are regulated by estrogen in ER-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells and MDA MB 231 cells stably transfected with ER. Estrogen treatment in hormonal depleted MCF7 and MDA MB 231/ER stably transfected cells resulted in increased nuclear ER and cytoplasmic and nuclear BCA2 staining. Cycloheximide is not able to inhibit BCA2 mRNA levels, suggesting potential BCA2 regulation at the transcriptional level. Anti-estrogens like tamoxifen and ICI 182 178 counteracted E(2)-induced BCA2 protein and knockdown of ER by ER siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in BCA2 protein and a lower nuclear expression pattern. Estrogen treatment lead to a significant increase in BCA2 promoter response, associated with increased binding of ER to the ERE region of the BCA2 promoter. BCA2 is therefore a newly identified transcriptional target of estrogen receptor."

We analyzed breast cancer cell lines for differential expression of regulatory miRs to determine if loss of miR-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of DNMT3b represents the molecular mechanism that governs the overexpression of DNMT3b that drives the hypermethylation defect in breast cancer. MicroRNAs (miRs) that regulate (miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-29c, miR-148a, miR-148b) or are predicted (miR-26a, miR-26b, miR-203, miR-222) to regulate DNMT3b were examined among 10 hypermethylator and 6 non-hypermethylator breast cancer cell lines. Hypermethylator cell lines express diminished levels of miR-29c, miR-148a, miR-148b, miR-26a, miR-26b, and miR-203 compared to non-hypermethylator cell lines. miR expression patterns correlate inversely with methylation-sensitive gene expression (r=-0.66, p=0.0056) and directly with the methylation status of these genes (r=0.72, p=0.002). To determine the mechanistic role of specific miRs in the dysregulation of DNMT3b among breast cancer cell lines, miR levels were modulated by transfection of pre-miR precursors for miR-148b, miR-26b, and miR-29c into hypermethylator cell lines (Hs578T, HCC1937, SUM185) and transfection of antagomirs directed against miR-148b, miR-26b, and miR-29c into non-hypermethylator cell lines (BT20, MDA-MB-415, MDA-MB-468). Antagomir-mediated knock-down of miR-148b, miR-29c, and miR-26b significantly increased DNMT3b mRNA in non-hypermethylator cell lines, and re-expression of miR-148b, miR-29c, and miR-26b following transfection of pre-miR precursors significantly reduced DNMT3b mRNA in hypermethylator cell lines. These findings strongly suggest that: i) post-transcriptional regulation of DNMT3b is combinatorial, ii) diminished expression of regulatory miRs contributes to DNMT3b overexpression, iii) re-expression of regulatory miRs reduces DNMT3b mRNA levels in hypermethylator breast cancer cell lines, and iv) down-regulation of regulatory miRs increases DNMT3b mRNA levels in non-hypermethylator breast cancer cell lines. In conlcusion, the molecular mechanism governing the DNMT3b-mediated hypermethylation defect in breast cancer cell lines involves the loss of post-transcriptional regulation of DNMT3b by regulatory miRs."

By screening an annotated human transcriptome database (H-InvDB), we identified three model ultra-short introns: the 56-nt intron in the HNRNPH1 (hnRNP H1) gene, the 49-nt intron in the NDOR1 (NADPH dependent diflavin oxidoreductase 1) gene, and the 43-nt intron in the ESRP2 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2) gene. We verified that these endogenous ultra-short introns are spliced, and also recapitulated this in cultured cells transfected with the corresponding mini-genes. The splicing of these ultra-short introns was repressed by a splicing inhibitor, spliceostatin A, suggesting that SF3b (a U2 snRNP component) is involved in their splicing processes. The 56-nt intron containing a pyrimidine-rich tract was spliced out in a lariat form, and this splicing was inhibited by the disruption of U1, U2, or U4 snRNA. In contrast, the 49- and 43-nt introns were purine-rich overall without any pyrimidine-rich tract, and these lariat RNAs were not detectable. Remarkably, shared G-rich intronic sequences in the 49- and 43-nt introns were required for their splicing, suggesting that these ultra-short introns may recruit a novel auxiliary splicing mechanism linked to G-rich intronic splicing enhancers."

Elevated levels of Jagged-1 (JAG1), a predicted miR-21 target, are implicated in estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer. We demonstrate (by ablation of the miR-21 binding site in the JAG1 3'UTR) that miR-21 directly targets and represses JAG1 levels in MCF-7 (ER+) breast cancer cells. MiR-21 targeting of JAG1 in MDA-MB-231 (ER-) breast cancer cells is dependent on miR-21 dosage (levels). In both cell lines, miR-21 and JAG1 expression levels were negatively correlated due to their regulatory relationship. In addition, 17beta-estradiol (E2) increases JAG1 levels by limiting (via downregulating miR-21 levels) the repressive effects of miR-21 on the JAG1 3'UTR. Our results reveal a regulatory interplay between miR-21, JAG1 and E2 that is important for advancing understanding of how the oncogenic potential of miR-21 and JAG1 manifests in different sub-types of breast cancer."

However, tumor cells often develop resistance to TRAIL, limiting its therapeutic potential. To study the mechanism underlying TRAIL-resistance in breast cancer cells, we performed a high-throughput compound screen in MCF-7 cells. We identified daunorubicin as a potent sensitizer of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Daunorubicin in combination with subtoxic concentrations of recombinant human TRAIL induced massive apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. This combination was effective in TRAIL-resistant MDA-MB-231 and T47D breast cancer cells. By immunoblotting, we found that daunorubicin treatment induced loss of the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1, in breast cancer cells. RNA interference experiments revealed that reduced expression of Mcl-1 sensitized MCF-7 cells to TRAIL. Together, these data suggest that Mcl-1 is a major contributor to TRAIL-resistance in breast cancer cells, and that reduction of Mcl-1 protein levels using DNA damaging agents is a promising approach for cancer therapy."

To explore wild-type p53-independent Wip1 induction, Wip1 promoter activity and its transcript level were evaluated by luciferase assay and real-time PCR, after methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) treatment in breast cancer cell lines and p53-null cell lines. Wip1 promoter activities in response to UV irradiation and various anti-cancer agents were compared between wild-type and a p53-response element (p53RE) mutated construct. Wip1 expression and its effects were examined in primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colon tumor cells by using Wip1-specific siRNA. MMS induced Wip1 promoter activity in Hs578T, MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3 cells expressing DNA binding-deficient p53 mutants. A549-E6 and HCT116 (p53(-/-)) cells retained substantial Wip1 induction.

LRH-1 plays important roles in embryonic development, steroidogenesis and cholesterol homeostasis. In tumor cells, LRH-1 induces proliferation and cell cycle progression. High LRH-1 expression is demonstrated in breast cancers, positively correlating with ERα status and aromatase activity. LRH-1 dependent cellular mechanisms in breast cancer epithelial cells are poorly defined. Hence in the present study we investigated the actions of LRH-1 in estrogen receptor α (ERα) positive breast cancer cells.RESULTS: The study aimed to investigate LRH-1 dependent mechanisms that promote breast cancer proliferation. We identified that LRH-1 regulated the expression of Growth Regulation by Estrogen in Breast Cancer 1 (GREB1) in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Over-expression of LRH-1 increased GREB1 mRNA levels while knockdown of LRH-1 reduced its expression. GREB1 is a well characterised ERα target gene, with three estrogen response elements (ERE) located on its promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies provided evidence of the co-localisation of LRH-1 and ERα at all three EREs. With electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrated direct binding of LRH-1 to EREs located on GREB1 and Trefoil Factor 1 (TFF1, pS2) promoters. LRH-1 and ERα co-operatively activated transcription of ERE luciferase reporter constructs suggesting an overlap in regulation of target genes in breast cancer cells. Over-expression of LRH-1 resulted in an increase in cell proliferation. This effect was more pronounced with estradiol treatment. In the presence of ICI 182,780, an ERα antagonist, LRH-1 still induced proliferation.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in ER-positive breast cancer cells, LRH-1 promotes cell proliferation by enhancing ERα mediated transcription of target genes such as GREB-1. Collectively these findings indicate the importance of LRH-1 in the progression of hormone-dependent breast cancer and implicate LRH-1 as a potential avenue for drug development."

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is highly susceptible to oxidative stress and mtDNA damage leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. This study aimed to investigate the mtDNA alterations that occurred during liver injury in patients with extrahepatic cholestasis. Along with an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and a decrease in ATP levels, extrahepatic cholestatic patients presented a significant increase in mitochondrial 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels and decreases in mtDNA copy number, mtDNA transcript levels, and mtDNA nucleoid structure. In L02 cells, glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) induced similar damage to the mtDNA and mitochondria. In line with the mtDNA alterations, the mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) were significantly decreased both in cholestatic patients and in GCDCA-treated L02 cells. Moreover, overexpression of TFAM could efficiently attenuate the mtDNA damage induced by GCDCA in L02 cells. However, without its C-tail, ΔC-TFAM appeared less effective against the hepatotoxicity of GCDCA than the wild-type TFAM. Overall, our study demonstrates that mtDNA damage is involved in liver damage in extrahepatic cholestatic patients. The mtDNA damage is attributable to the loss of TFAM. TFAM has mtDNA-protective effects against the hepatotoxicity of bile acid during cholestasis."

REIC/Dkk-3 mRNA has two isoforms (type-a,b). REIC type-a mRNA has shown to be a major transcript in various cancer cells, and its promoter activity was much stronger than that of type-b. In this study, we examined the methylation status of REIC/Dkk-3 type-a in a broad range of human malignancies.METHODS: We examined REIC/Dkk-3 type-a methylation in breast cancers, non-small-cell lung cancers, gastric cancers, colorectal cancers, and malignant pleural mesotheliomas using a quantitative combined bisulfite restriction analysis assay and bisulfate sequencing. REIC/Dkk-3 type-a and type-b expression was examined using reverse transcriptional PCR. The relationships between the methylation and clinicopathological factors were analyzed.RESULTS: The rate of REIC/Dkk-3 type-a methylation ranged from 26.2 to 50.0% in the various primary tumors that were examined. REIC/Dkk-3 type-a methylation in breast cancer cells was significantly heavier than that in the other cell lines that we tested. REIC/Dkk-3 type-a methylation was inversely correlated with REIC/Dkk-3 type-a expression. There was a correlation between REIC/Dkk-3 type-a and type-b mRNA expression. REIC/Dkk-3 type-a expression was restored in MDA-MB-231 cells using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. We found that estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers were significantly more common among the methylated group than among the non-methylated group.CONCLUSIONS: REIC/Dkk-3 type-a methylation was frequently detected in a broad range of cancers and appeared to play a key role in silencing REIC/Dkk-3 type-a expression in these malignancies."

As of yet, the mechanisms underlying this function have remained largely unknown. To further elucidate the role of Stat6 in breast cancer development, we investigated the consequences of exogenous Stat6 expression.METHODS: Proliferation assays and flow cytometry assays were conducted to evaluate the putative role of Stat6 on cell proliferation. To this end, we produced synchronized cells after a double thymidine block, as confirmed by FACS analysis. mRNA levels of Stat6 were measured by RNase protection analysis. To confirm the interaction among proteins, we employed GST pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation assays. Luciferase assays and ChIP assays were used to assess the transcriptional activity.RESULTS: Compared to control breast cancer cells, we found that exogenous Stat6 expression plays a critical role in controlling cell proliferation. Also in different breast tumor cell lines, endogenous Stat6 expression was found to be positively related to a lower proliferation rate. Interestingly, in human breast cancer cells Stat6 functions in G1/S cell cycle progression, and the growth-inhibitory effect of Stat6 was shown to be mediated by induction of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Cip1/WAF1) (p21) and p27(Kip1) (p27). Simultaneously, G1-related cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase activities and pRB phosphorylation were markedly reduced, and cell cycle progression was blocked in the G1 phase. Stat6 knockdown resulted in enhanced cell proliferation and a decrease in p21 and p27 mRNA levels in the steroid-responsive and non-responsive T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, respectively. In addition, the stimulatory effect of Stat6 on p21 and p27 gene transcription was found to be associated with interaction of Stat6 with the transcription factor Sp1 at the proximal Sp1-binding sites in their respective promoters.CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results identify Stat6 as an important cell differentiation regulatory protein functioning, at least in part, by interacting with Sp1 to activate the p21 and p27 gene promoters in breast cancer cells."

In this study, we investigated the feasibility of a dual-regulated oncolytic adenoviral vector with a novel suicide gene to treat breast cancer. Following targeted gene virotherapy of conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAds), the novel suicide gene of multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase of Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-DNK) was inserted into the double-regulated oncolytic adenovirus SG500 to ensure more safety and enhanced antitumor activity against breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Selective replication, cell-killing efficacy, and cytotoxicity, combined with chemotherapeutics were investigated in several breast cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), normal cells (WI-38 and MRC-5), and human (MDA-MB-231) tumor models in vivo. The double-regulated SG500-dNK had high cell-killing activity in breast cancer. Replication was similar to wild-type in breast cells and was attenuated in normal cells. SG500-dNK combined with the chemotherapeutics (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (Bvdu) and 2',2'-difluoro-deoxycytidine (dFdC) resulted in synergistically enhanced cell killing and greatly improved antitumor efficacy in vitro or in breast xenografts in vivo.

Bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of a series of cyclic lipodecapeptides, named minutissamides E-L (1-8). The planar structures were determined by analysis of HRESIMS, tandem MS, and 1D and 2D NMR data, and the stereoconfigurations were assigned by LC-MS analysis of the Marfey's derivatives after acid hydrolysis. Minutissamides E-L (1-8) exhibited antiproliferative activity against MDA-MB-435 cells with IC(50) values ranging between 1 and 10 μM. The structures of minutissamides E-L (1-8) were closely related with those of the previously reported lipopeptides, puwainaphycins A-E and minutissamides A-D, characterized by the presence of a lipophilic β-amino acid and three non-standard amino acids NMeAsn, OMeThr and Dhb (α,β-dehydro-α-aminobutyric acid).

The results showed that inoculation with siderophore-containing filtrates (SCF) partly enhanced the growth of O. radicata after 15 days, with 0.8-32.4% biomass increase for Cd and 0.7-20.8% for Pb compared to control(s), which lacked siderophore. The maximum enhancement for accumulation were found to be confined to Bacillus sp. FFQ2(s) (26.5%) for Cd and Pseudomonas sp. CY63(s) (158.9%) for Pb. A significant decrease in MDA content indicated that lipid peroxidation in O. radicata was alleviated by siderophores. Besides, antioxidant enzyme SOD and POD activities also displayed obviously decrease in SCF-treated mycelium compared to control(s) treatment, while CAT activity did not present significant change. Protein level in O. radicata treated by SCF increased from 0.3 to 138.0% for Cd and from 10.9 to 107.1% for Pb compared to control(s). Therefore, the present work suggests that microbial siderophores can reduce the toxicity of metals to mycelium and then alleviate heavy metals-inducing oxidative stress in O. radicata."

Patients with metastasis restricted to bone (BO) usually show a longer overall survival compared to patients who rapidly develop multiple metastases also involving liver and lung. Hence, molecular predisposition to generate bone and visceral metastases (BV) represents a clear indication of poor clinical outcome. We performed microarray analysis with two different chip platforms, Affymetrix and Agilent, on bone metastasis samples from BO and BV patients. The unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the resulting transcriptomes correlated with the clinical progression, segregating the BO from the BV profiles. Matching the twofold significantly regulated genes from Affymetrix and Agilent chips resulted in a 15-gene signature with 13 upregulated and two downregulated genes in BV versus BO bone metastasis samples. In order to validate the resulting signature, we isolated different MDA-MB-231 clonal subpopulations that metastasize only in the bone (MDA-BO) or in bone and visceral tissues (MDA-BV). Six of the signature genes were also significantly upregulated in MDA-BV compared to MDA-BO clones. A group of upregulated genes, including Hemoglobin B (HBB), were involved in oxygen metabolism, and in vitro functional analysis of HBB revealed that its expression in the MDA subpopulations was associated with a reduced production of hydrogen peroxide. Expression of HBB was detected in primary BrCa tissue but not in normal breast epithelial cells. Metastatic lymph nodes were frequently more positive for HBB compared to the corresponding primary tumors, whereas BO metastases had a lower expression than BV metastases, suggesting a positive correlation between HBB and ability of bone metastasis to rapidly spread to other organs. We propose that HBB, along with other genes involved in oxygen metabolism, confers a more aggressive metastatic phenotype in BrCa cells disseminated to bone."

Apoptosis appears to be a major mechanism for both agents to exert anti-cancer activity. The purpose of the present study was designed to determine whether the apoptotic effect on human cancer cells can be enhanced by combining curcumin with MSeA. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V staining of externalized phosphatidylserine by flow cytometry. Expression of protein was analyzed by Western blotting. Localization of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was detected by immunocytochemistry. RNA interference was employed to inhibit expression of specific protein. We found here that combining curcumin with MSeA led to a significantly enhanced apoptosis in both MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and DU145 prostate cancer cells. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that curcumin treatment alone caused a concentration dependent upregulation of Mcl-1, which can be overcome by combining it with MSeA. In line with the Mcl-1 reduction, an enhanced mitochondrial permeability transition and AIF nuclear translocation by the combination were achieved. In addition, an increased suppression of focal adhesion kinase activity was observed in the combination-treated cells which were associated with cell detachment-induced apoptosis by the combination. Our findings suggest that curcumin/MSeA combination holds excellent potential for improving their efficacy against human breast and prostate cancer through enhanced apoptosis induction."

Partial sequences of the 16s rRNA gene, phylogenetic tree construction, multiple sequence analysis and secondary structure analysis were also carried out with the actinomycetes isolates.RESULTS: Of the selected five actinomycete isolates, ACT01 and ACT02 showed the IC50 value with (10.13±0.92) and (22.34±5.82) µg/mL concentrations, respectively for MCF-7 cell line at 48 h, but ACT01 showed the minimum (18.54±2.49 µg/mL) level of IC50 value with MDA-MB-231 cell line. Further, the 16s rRNA partial sequences of ACT01, ACT02, ACT03, ACT04 and ACT05 isolates were also deposited in NCBI data bank with the accession numbers of GQ478246, GQ478247, GQ478248, GQ478249 and GQ478250, respectively. The phylogenetic tree analysis showed that, the isolates of ACT02 and ACT03 were represented in group I and III, respectively, but ACT01 and ACT02 were represented in group II. The multiple sequence alignment of the actinomycete isolates showed that, the maximum identical conserved regions were identified with the nucleotide regions of 125 to 221st base pairs, 65 to 119th base pairs and 55, 48 and 31st base pairs. Secondary structure prediction of the 16s rRNA showed that, the maximum free energy was consumed with ACT03 isolate (-45.4 kkal/mol) and the minimum free energy was consumed with ACT04 isolate (-57.6 kkal/mol).CONCLUSIONS: The actinomycete isolates of ACT01 and ACT02 (GQ478246 and GQ478247) which are isolated from sediment sample can be further used as anticancer agents against breast cancer cell lines."

Our results indicated that there was a negative relationship between catalase, and peroxidase activity with lipid peroxidation and SOD activity. Increase in MDA and SOD levels at the earlier stages of stress and later increase in CAT and POD levels on prolonged stress was evidenced. Thus they can be used as indicators of stress for sugarcane plants facing unfavourable environmental conditions. At molecular level, we have identified 137 salinity tolerant candidate cDNAs from sugarcane by cDNA-SSH, representing 20% of which are novel sugarcane genes. These unique sequences, never reported elsewhere to be stress related and might provide further understanding on perception, response and adaptations mechanisms of the non-model plant like sugarcane to salinity stress and will be potential candidates for manipulating salt tolerant trait."

In the present study, the GGP gene was isolated from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and transient expression of SlGGP-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein in onion cells revealed the cytoplasmic and nucleus localization of the protein. Antisense transgenic tomato lines with only 50-75% ascorbate level of the wild type (WT) were obtained. Chilling treatment induced lower increase in AsA levels and redox ratio of ascorbate in antisense transgenic plants compared with WT plants. Under chilling stress, transgenic plants accumulated more malendialdehyde (MDA) and more O(2)(·-), leaked more electrolytes and showed lower maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), and oxidizable P700 compared with WT plants. Furthermore, the antisense transgenic plants exhibited significantly higher H(2)O(2) level and lower ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity.

Our previous studies demonstrated that mutant p53 along with repression complex proteins including DNMT1, HDAC1 and MeCP2 is associated with ER-negative promoter in MDA-MB-468 cells. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene silencing in these cells, we down-regulated DNMT1 and HDAC1 expression using siRNAs and studied the ability of DNMT1, HDAC1, MeCP2 and p53 in binding to ESR1 promoter CpG island. Our results showed that DNMT1 or HDAC1 down-regulation disassembled the repression complex proteins and mutant p53 from ER-negative promoter. The partial demethylation of ESR1 promoter and ER re-expression in down-regulated cells supports these findings. In vivo binding studies demonstrated that mutation of p53 protein in this cell line did not affect its binding capacity to DNMT1, HDAC1 and MeCP2 proteins. Our observations suggest that not only histone deacetylase activity of HDAC1 contributes to inactivation of methylated ESR1 gene but also HDAC1 presence on ESR1 promoter is important for assembly of DNMT1 in repression complex. In addition, our data revealed that mutant p53 protein binds to the promoter of ESR1 through direct interaction with HDAC1 and indirect interaction with DNMT1, MeCP2 proteins in the ER-negative MDA-MB-468 cells."

In addition to cytostatic and cytotoxic activities, SAHA also represses angiogenesis to inhibit tumor growth. However, the effect of SAHA on tumor lymphangiogenesis, a step in which cancer cells produce pro-lymphangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) to stimulate proliferation and migration of lymphatic endothelial cells, remains largely unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression of VEGF-C in breast cancer cell lines and found that VEGF-C was highly expressed in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, MDA-MB-453 and BT-474 cells. SAHA inhibited VEGF-C expression in a dose-dependent manner in these cell lines. The secretion of VEGF-C into conditioned medium was also suppressed. We cloned human VEGF-C gene promoter and demonstrated that SAHA directly repressed promoter activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. Promoter deletion assay suggested that SAHA repressed VEGF-C via the -185/+38 region which contained several transcription factor binding sites. Notably, we found that SAHA reduced Sp1, but not Sp3 and NF-κB protein levels. Treatment with Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin A also inhibited VEGF-C expression in breast cancer cells. In addition, enforced expression of Sp1 partially rescued the inhibition of VEGF-C by SAHA. Collectively, our results suggest that SAHA inhibits VEGF-C expression in breast cancer cells via transcriptional repression and this drug may exert anti-lymphangiogenic activity in cancer treatment."

Drugs targeting EGFR have shown promising clinical results for several cancer types. However, resistance to EGFR inhibitors often occurs, such as with KRAS mutant cancers, therefore new methods of targeting EGFR are needed. The juxtamembrane (JXM) domain of EGFR is critical for receptor activation and targeting this region could potentially be a new method of inhibiting EGFR. We hypothesized that the structural role of the JXM region could be mimicked by peptides encoding a JXM amino acid sequence, which could interfere with EGFR signaling and consequently could have anti-cancer activity. A peptide encoding EGFR 645-662 conjugated to the Tat sequence (TE-64562) displayed anti-cancer activity in multiple human cancer cell types with diminished activity in non-EGFR expressing cells and non-cancerous cells. In nude mice, TE-64562 delayed MDA-MB-231 tumor growth and prolonged survival, without inducing toxicity. TE-64562 induced non-apoptotic cell death after several hours and caspase-3-mediated apoptotic cell death with longer treatment. Mechanistically, TE-64562 bound to EGFR, inhibited its dimerization and caused its down-regulation. TE-64562 reduced phosphorylated and total EGFR levels but did not inhibit kinase activity and instead prolonged it. Our analysis of patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas supported the hypothesis that down-regulation of EGFR is a potential therapeutic strategy, since phospho- and total-EGFR levels were strongly correlated in a large majority of patient tumor samples, indicating that lower EGFR levels are associated with lower phospho-EGFR levels and presumably less proliferative signals in breast cancer. Akt and Erk were inhibited by TE-64562 and this inhibition was observed in vivo in tumor tissue upon treatment with TE-64562. These results are the first to indicate that the JXM domain of EGFR is a viable drug target for several cancer types."

Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies and increasing evidence supports that it is not only a genetic but also an epigenetic disease. Epigenetics investigates changes in gene expression caused by mechanisms that do not involve alterations in DNA sequence. DNA methylation and histone acetylation are the most widely studied epigenetic changes in cancer cells. This study evaluated the effects of T. serpyllum on apoptosis and epigenetic events in breast cancer cells. XTT cell viability assay was used to determine cytotoxicity. DNA fragmentation and caspase 3/7 activity assays were used in the assesment of apoptosis. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities were evaluated by ELISA and verified by qRT-PCR. T. serpyllum extract induced significant cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) but not in normal cells.

CYP19A1, the encoding gene for aromatase, is often overexpressed in the oestrogen-producing cells of the breast adipose fibroblasts (BAFs) surrounding an ER+ tumour, and the molecular processes underlying this upregulation is important in the development of breast-specific aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer therapy. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a factor secreted by tumours, is known to stimulate CYP19A1 expression in human BAFs. The hormonal regulation of this process has been examined; however, what is less well understood is the emerging role of epigenetic mechanisms and how they modulate PGE2 signalling. This present study characterises the epigenetic processes underlying expression of the prostanoid receptor EP2 in the context of ER+ breast cancer. Sodium bisulphite sequencing of CpG methylation within the promoter region of EP2 revealed that an inverse correlation existed between methylation levels and relative EP2 expression in breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF7 and MCF10A but not in HS578t and T47D. Inhibition of DNA methylation with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5aza) and histone deacetylation with Trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in upregulation of EP2 mRNA in all cell lines with varying influences of each epigenetic process observed. Expression of EP2 was detected in human BAFs despite a natively methylated promoter, and this expression was further increased upon 5aza treatment. An examination of 3 triple negative, 3 ductal carcinoma in situ and 3 invasive ductal carcinoma samples revealed that there was no change in EP2 promoter methylation status between normal and cancer associated stroma, despite observed differences in relative mRNA levels. Although EP2 methylation status is inversely correlated to expression levels in established breast cancer cell lines, we could not identify that such a correlation existed in tumour-associated stroma cells."

One HapMap sample and three patient samples were randomly selected for replication to assess reproducibility. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the wgaDNA genotypes with gDNA genotypes. The kappa (κ) statistic was used to measure genotype concordance between paired gDNA-wgaDNA and wgaDNA-wgaDNA samples. Copy number variants (CNV) were not included in concordance analysis in this study.RESULTS: A good genotype call rate of 98.8%±1.06% (mean±standard deviation, 1931 markers) was observed for all 18 wgaDNA samples with three samples having call rates lower than 98%.

Emission of Auger electrons in close proximity to the nucleus caused multiple DNA double-strand breaks which diminished the clonogenic survival (CS) of MDA-MB-468 cells that have high EGFR density (2.4 × 10(6) receptors/cell) to less than 3 %. (111)In-Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab without NLS peptide modification was sevenfold less effective for killing MDA-MB-468 cells.

The MDA-MB-453 cell line is the prototypical model of this breast cancer subtype; its proliferation is stimulated by androgens such as 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) but inhibited by the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) via AR-mediated mechanisms. We report here that the AR gene in MDA-MB-453 cells contains a G-T transversion in exon 7, resulting in a receptor variant with a glutamine to histidine substitution at amino acid 865 (Q865H) in the ligand binding domain. Compared with wild-type AR, the Q865H variant exhibited reduced sensitivity to DHT and MPA in transactivation assays in MDA-MB-453 and PC-3 cells but did not respond to non-androgenic ligands or receptor antagonists. Ligand binding, molecular modeling, mammalian two-hybrid and immunoblot assays revealed effects of the Q865H mutation on ligand dissociation, AR intramolecular interactions, and receptor stability. Microarray expression profiling demonstrated that DHT and MPA regulate distinct transcriptional programs in MDA-MB-453 cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed that DHT- but not MPA-regulated genes were associated with estrogen-responsive transcriptomes from MCF-7 cells and the Wnt signaling pathway. These findings suggest that the divergent proliferative responses of MDA-MB-453 cells to DHT and MPA result from the different genetic programs elicited by these two ligands through the AR-Q865H variant. This work highlights the necessity to characterize additional models of molecular apocrine breast cancer to determine the precise role of AR signaling in this breast cancer subtype."

Validation of the results was done using real-time PCR. In addition, real-time PCR using primers for Mda-7 gene and F-actin staining were performed. Transfection experiments were performed to knockdown the expression of the Mc1r gene to evaluate its role in the cell morphological change observed.RESULTS: As expected, the expressions of the Mitf-regulated melanosome transport genes and the Mc1r gene were downregulated. Furthermore, the expressions of the MAPK pathway intermediates were either up- or downregulated. Genes associated with cell differentiation, such as Gadd45b, were upregulated and prompted us to determine the expression of the Il-24 (Mda-7) gene using real-time PCR. There was an increase in the Mda-7 mRNA expression in B16 and HMV-II melanoma cells, and in human melanocytes. To better visualize the cell morphology, F-actin staining was performed and the results showed an increase in the dendrite outgrowth in HA-treated cells. Silencing the Mc1r gene did not cause a change in the B16 cell morphology observed in cells treated with HA.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that HA downregulates Mitf gene expression by regulating the expressions of the MAPK signaling pathway intermediates. In addition, the inhibited Mc1r gene expression also contributed to the overall Mitf downregulation but does not play a role in the observed change in B16 cell morphology. HA surprisingly can regulate genes associated with differentiating cells (Mda-7) suggesting a role for HA in the melanoma cell differentiation induction. While the exact molecular mechanism by which HA promotes cell differentiation remain to be determined, it is clear that HA can downregulate Mitf expression and promote cell differentiation and has the potential to be used in the development of therapy for melanoma."

In this study we described that the treatment of human breast cancer cells, MDA MB 231 cells, with methyl-F-anandamide reduced protein levels of β-catenin in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions inhibiting the transcriptional activation of T Cell Factor (TCF) responsive element (marker for β-catenin signalling). The anandamide treatment resulted in up-regulation of epithelial markers, like E-cadherin with a concomitant decrease in protein levels of mesenchymal markers, including vimentin and Snail1.

This study was designed to assess the function of HIP/PAP in experimental UC and further to explore its underlying mechanisms.METHODS: Recombinant adenovirus was prepared to mediate ectopic expression of HIP/PAP in the colon of rats. The effect of HIP/PAP on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis was assessed by disease activity index (DAI), macroscopic, and histological evaluations. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production were determined in colonic mucosa. Proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was immunostained to reflect the proliferation of colonic epithelia. The effects of HIP/PAP on proliferation and H(2)O(2) -induced apoptosis of SW480 and LoVo colonic adenocarcinoma cells were also determined. Gene expression profiles in SW480 after HIP/PAP overexpression were analyzed by microarray analysis.RESULTS: The protective effect of HIP/PAP against DSS-induced colitis in rats was confirmed. Ectopic expression of HIP/PAP resulted in attenuation of oxidative damage, reduction of TNF-α and IL-6 expression, and elevation of epithelial proliferation in colonic mucosa and led to decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation in colonic adenocarcinoma cells. Microarray analysis revealed altered expression of inflammation-related molecules, growth factors, proliferation-related molecules, and antioxidant enzymes under overexpression of HIP/PAP.CONCLUSIONS: HIP/PAP has a protective effect against DSS-induced colitis in rats via inhibiting inflammation, alleviating oxidative damage, and promoting colonic epithelium regeneration. HIP/PAP might represent a new promising therapeutic strategy in UC."

The present study describes the preparation and evaluation of a series of new BN derivatives as potential tumor imaging agents.METHODS: Several new BN derivatives with the common structure MAG(3)-X-BN(1-14 or 6-14), where X=Asp or Asp-Asp, were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. S-benzoylmercaptoacetic acid was incorporated at the end of synthesis via manual conjugation to yield MAG(3)-BN conjugates. Radiolabeling with (99m)Tc was accomplished by ligand exchange method. The receptor-binding affinity assays were performed in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, T47-D and PC-3 cancer cell lines. In vivo biodistribution and clearance kinetics were assessed in Balb/c mice, and tumor targeting efficacy was determined in nude mice bearing breast tumor xenografts.RESULTS: The peptides were prepared conveniently and radiolabeled efficiently with (99m)Tc (up to 95% labeling efficiency). In vitro cell binding assays demonstrated high affinity (values in the nanomolar range) of (99m)Tc peptides towards breast and prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, the radioconjugates displayed significant internalization (values ranged between 19% and 35%) in tumor cells. In vivo biodistribution and biokinetics are characterized by efficient clearance from the blood and variable degrees of excretion through the renal pathway. In vivo tumor targeting studies displayed variable uptake capacity of different BN derivatives, underlining the influence of specific amino acid sequence on tumor targeting profiles. Tumor uptake was always higher than the radioactivity in the blood and muscle, with good tumor retention and good tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios, indicating the potential of these agents for targeting tumors in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of favorable in vitro and in vivo properties may render these BN peptides as potential candidates for targeting BN/GRP receptor-positive tumors. They deserve further evaluation to determine their real strength. The present data indeed provide useful information regarding peptide structure-pharmacologic activity relationship, which might be useful in designing and developing new BN-like peptides for efficient targeting of tumors in vivo."

We examined the expressions of BCRP, PR, estrogen receptor α (ERα), androgen receptor (AR) and Her-2 in 95 breast cancer samples by immunohistochemistry. Then, to identify the role of PR in the regulation of BCRP expression, two constructs encoding full length BCRP cDNA driven by putative PRE promoter or constitutive CMV promoter were transfected into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, respectively. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to detect the expression of BCRP. Further electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to verify the nuclear protein-DNA specific binding. We innovatively found that the expression of BCRP negatively related with that of PR and ERα in breast cancer by immunohistochemistry. While at a cellular level, after being treated by progesterone and 17β-estradiol, BCRP mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner in MCF-7/P-BCRP cells with PR bound to the identified PRE in BCRP promoter.

How this functional conversion occurs, however, remains unknown. Based on a genome-wide sequencing study that identified mutations in several breast cancer genes, we examined some of the genes for mutations, expression levels, and functional effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. We present the data for C1orf64 or ER-related factor (ERRF) from 31 cell lines and 367 primary breast cancer tumors. Whereas mutation of ERRF was infrequent (1 of 79 or 1.3%), its expression was up-regulated in breast cancer, and the up-regulation was more common in lower-stage tumors. In addition, increased ERRF expression was significantly associated with ER and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positivity, which was still valid in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative tumors. In ER-positive tumors, ERRF expression was inversely correlated with HER2 status. Furthermore, higher ERRF protein expression was significantly associated with better disease-free survival and overall survival, particularly in ER- and/or PR-positive and HER2-negative tumors (luminal A subtype). Functionally, knockdown of ERRF in two ER-positive breast cancer cell lines, T-47D and MDA-MB-361, suppressed cell growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in xenograft models. These results suggest that ERRF plays a role in estrogen-ER-mediated growth of breast cancer cells and could, thus, be a potential therapeutic target."

Therefore, relative quantification method could be applied to analyze the gene expression levels. The significant elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels indicated that the reactive oxygen species-induced cellular oxidative injury might be one of the main toxic effects of AHTN and HHCB. Besides, a significant positive correlation was observed between the up-regulation of SOD, CAT mRNA and the MDA levels, suggesting that possible changes in the transcript expression of antioxidant enzyme genes were associated with the oxidative stress.

Acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACHBLF) is most commonly caused by acute severe exacerbation during CHB virus infection. The pathophysiology of ACHBLF is still poorly understood. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) M3 belongs to GSTs superfamily and it has been demonstrated to contribute to oxidative stress-mediated liver damage. The present study was aimed to determine the potential association between GSTM3 promoter methylation and oxidative stress in ACHBLF patients. Thirty ACHBLF patients, 30 CHB patients and 10 healthy controls were included in this study. Methylation of GSTM3 promoter was determined using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) method. Plasma biomarkers for oxidative stress including malondialdehyde (MDA) and GST were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scoring system was used for predicting the severity and prognosis of liver failure. ACHBLF patients had significant higher GSTM3 promoter methylation rate than CHB patients (30% versus 6.7%, χ(2) = 5.455, P = 0.020). Plasma MDA and GST levels were significantly increased in ACHBLF patients compared with CHB patients. Meanwhile, MDA, MELD scores and mortality rate were significantly higher in methylated group than those in unmethylated group of ACHBLF patients. Furthermore, plasma MDA levels were positively correlated with MELD scores of ACHBLF (r = 0.588, P = 0.001).

Incorporation of a D-Lys(11) residue into the N15K analog generates a peptide that retains potency against A549 cells (LC(50) = 15 μM) but whose therapeutic index is 13-fold elevated relative to the native peptide. [G11k, N15K] alyteserin-2a is also active against human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells (LC(50) = 26 μM), breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells (LC(50) = 20 μM), and colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells (LC(50) = 28 μM). [G11k, N15K] alyteserin-2a, in concentrations as low as 1 μg/mL, significantly (P &lt; 0.05) inhibits the release of the immune-suppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β from unstimulated and concanavalin A-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The data suggest a strategy of increasing the cationicity while reducing the helicity of naturally occurring amphipathic α-helical peptides to generate analogs with improved cytotoxicity against tumor cells but decreased activity against non-neoplastic cells."

These activities were attributed in part to the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). The present study was carried out to explore the molecular mechanism underlying this effect. We found a marked (50%) inhibition in MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity in human breast cancer MDA-MB-435 cells pretreated with as little as 50 ng/ml of halofuginone, a concentration that markedly inhibited their invasive and proliferative capacities. We further show that both early growth response 1 (Egr-1) and Nab-2 (corepressor of Egr1 activation) are upregulated by halofuginone in a dose-dependent and time-dependent (up to 5 h) manner. Using MMP-2 reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, we found that Egr-1 binds to the MMP-2 promoter and inhibits its activity. Altogether, our results identify the downstream elements (Egr-1, Nab-2, and MMP-2) by which halofuginone exerts its antitumoral effect, thereby advancing its potential therapeutic application as an anticancer drug."

In this study, we show that P7 peptides significantly inhibits the proliferation of the bFGF-stimulated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Additional experiments revealed that the mechanisms of the P7 peptide inhibition of the cell proliferation of breast cancer cells stimulated with bFGF in vitro involved cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, blockade of the activation of Erk and P38 cascades and the upregulation of the expression of the growth inhibitor, proliferation-associated protein 2G4.

We analyzed the regulation mode of the gene, the expression pattern and subcellular localization of the predicted protein in the cell, and its role involving in cell proliferation and cell cycle control.METHODS: Dual-luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA were used to analysis the basal transcriptional requirements of the predicted promoter regions. C1ORF109 expression was assessed by western blot analysis. The subcellular localization of C1ORF109 was detected by immunofluorescence and immune colloidal gold technique. Cell proliferation was evaluated using MTT assay and colony-forming assay.RESULTS: We found that two cis-acting elements within the crucial region of the c1orf109 promoter, one TATA box and one CAAT box, are required for maximal transcription of the c1orf109 gene. The 5' flanking region of the c1orf109 gene could bind specific transcription factors and Sp1 may be one of them. Employing western blot analysis, we detected upregulated expression of c1orf109 in multiple cancer cell lines. The protein C1ORF109 was mainly located in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Moreover, we also found that C1ORF109 was a phosphoprotein in vivo and could be phosphorylated by the protein kinase CK2 in vitro. Exogenous expression of C1ORF109 in breast cancer Hs578T cells induced an increase in colony number and cell proliferation. A concomitant rise in levels of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and cyclinD1 expression was observed. Meanwhile, knockdown of c1orf109 by siRNA in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells confirmed the role of c1orf109 in proliferation.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings suggest that C1ORF109 may be the downstream target of protein kinase CK2 and involved in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation."

However, insufficient knowledge of their structure and function is a key gap. Using an elderly LDL receptor-deficient atherosclerotic mouse, we isolated a novel IgG3k against oxLDL (designated MAb LO1). LO1 reacts with copper-oxidized LDL, but minimally with native LDL. Further analysis showed that MAb LO1 also reacts in vitro with malondialdehyde-conjugated LDL (MDA-LDL), a known key epitope in copper-oxidized LDL preparations. By screening a phage library expressing single chain variable region antibodies (scFv), we selected an anti-idiotype scFv (designated H3) that neutralizes MAb LO1 binding to MDA-LDL. Amino acid substitutions between H3 and an irrelevant control scFv C12 showed that residues in the H3 CDRH2, CDRH3, and CDRL2 are all critical for MAb LO1 binding, consistent with a conformational epitope on H3 involving both heavy and light chains. Comparison of amino acids in H3 CDRH2 and CDRL2 with apoB, the major LDL protein, showed homologous sequences, suggesting H3 has structural similarities to the MAb LO1 binding site on MDA-LDL. Immunocytochemical staining showed that MAb LO1 binds epitopes in mouse and human atherosclerotic lesions. The MAb LO1-H3 combination therefore provides a very promising model for analyzing the structure and function of an individual IgG autoantibody in relation to atherosclerosis."

Depending on the localization of the receptor that mediates estrogen effects, nuclear and extra-nuclear actions have been described. The latter can trigger a number of signaling events leading also to transcriptional modifications. In an attempt to clarify the nature of the receptor(s) involved in the membrane initiated effect of estrogens on gene expression, we performed a whole transcriptome analysis of breast cancer cell lines with different receptor profiles (T47D, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3). A pharmacological approach was conducted with the use of estradiol (E(2)) or membrane-impermeable E(2)-BSA in the absence or presence of a specific ERα-β or GPR30/GPER antagonist. Our results clearly show that in addition to the ERα isoforms and/or GPR30/GPER that mainly mediate the transcriptional effect of E(2)-BSA, there is a specific transcriptional signature (found in T47D and MCF-7 cells) suggesting the presence of an unidentified membrane ER element (ERx).

We analysed the expression of the thioredoxin system in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line under conditions mimicking the tumor oxygen microenvironment. We grew breast cancer cells in either prolonged hypoxia or hypoxia followed by various lengths of reoxygenation and in each case cells were cultured with or without a hypoxic cycling preconditioning (PC) phase preceding the hypoxic growth. Flow cytometry-based assays were used to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Cells grown in hypoxia showed a significant decrease in ROS levels compared to normoxic cells, while a significant increase in ROS levels over normoxic cells was observed after 4 h of reoxygenation. The PC pre-treatment did not have a significant effect on ROS levels. Thioredoxin levels were also highest after 4 h of reoxygenation, however cells subjected to PC pre-treatment displayed even higher thioredoxin levels. The high level of intracellular thioredoxin was also reflected on the cell surface. Reporter assays showed that activity of the thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase gene promoters was also highest in the reoxygenation phase, although PC pre-treatment did not result in a significant increase over non-PC treated cells. The use of a dominant negative Nrf-2 negated the increased thioredoxin promoter activity during reoxygenation. This data suggests that the high levels of thioredoxin observed in tumors may arise due to cycling between hypoxia and reoxygenation."

Two recombinant plasmids were transfected into ERα-positive MCF-7 and ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Four kinds of BCRP expressing cell lines of MCF-7/Promoter-BCRP, MCF-7/CMV-BCRP, MDA-MB-231/Promoter-BCRP and MDA-MB-231/CMV-BCRP were established in which BCRP was promoted by the BCRP promoter and a CMV promoter as control, respectively. The drug resistant cells were treated with toremifene. Then RT-PCR, Western blot, mitoxantrone efflux assays and cytotoxicity assay were performed to detect the reversal function of BCRP by toremifene on the drug resistance cell lines.RESULTS: Toremifene significantly downregulated BCRP mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner in ERα-positive MCF-7/Promoter-BCRP cells than that of untreated control cells. In MCF-7/Promoter-BCRP cells, toremifene at the dose of 0.1, 1 and 10 µmol/L decreased BCRP mRNA expression by 29.5% (P &lt; 0.05), 68.1% (P &lt; 0.01) and 97.4% (P &lt; 0.01), respectively.

Furthermore, the effect of toremifene on BCRP protein is similar in BCRP mRNA. Toremifene obviously increased the mitoxantrone fluorescence intensity and decreased the efflux activity by 47.3% (P &lt; 0.05) in MCF-7/promoter-BCRP cells when compared with the untreated control, whereas intracellular accumulation of mitoxantrone obviously decreased and the efflux activity increased by 61.5% were observed in combination with 17β-estradiol when compared with toremifene treatment alone.

However, in MCF-7/CMV-BCRP, MDA-MB-231/Promoter-BCRP and MDA-MB-231/CMV-BCRP cells, toremifene or in combination with 17β-estradiol did not affect intracellular mitoxantrone uptake.CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings indicate that expression of BCRP is downregulated by toremifene, via a novel transcriptional mechanism which might be involved in the ERE of BCRP promoter through ER-mediated to inactivate the transcription of BCRP gene."

Five single cells were isolated inside an integrated microfluidic device using laser tweezers, the cells' genomic DNA was amplified by multiple displacement amplification (MDA) in 50 nL volumes and then sequenced by high-throughput DNA pyrosequencing. This microscopy-based approach to single-cell genomics minimizes contamination and allows correlation of high-resolution cell images with genomic sequences. Statistical properties of coverage across the five single cells, in combination with the contrasting properties of the metagenomic dataset allowed the assembly of a high-quality draft genome.

Assembling a genome is challenging, however, because MDA generates highly nonuniform coverage of the genome. Here we describe an algorithm tailored for short-read data from single cells that improves assembly through the use of a progressively increasing coverage cutoff. Assembly of reads from single Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus cells captures &gt;91% of genes within contigs, approaching the 95% captured from an assembly based on many E. coli cells. We apply this method to assemble a genome from a single cell of an uncultivated SAR324 clade of Deltaproteobacteria, a cosmopolitan bacterial lineage in the global ocean. Metabolic reconstruction suggests that SAR324 is aerobic, motile and chemotaxic. Our approach enables acquisition of genome assemblies for individual uncultivated bacteria using only short reads, providing cell-specific genetic information absent from metagenomic studies."

Here, we demonstrated that miR-21 expression was up-regulated and its function was elevated in HER2(+) BT474, SKBR3, and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells that are induced to acquire trastuzumab resistance by long-term exposure to the antibody, whereas protein expression of the PTEN gene, a miR-21 target, was reduced. Blocking the action of miR-21 with antisense oligonucleotides re-sensitized the resistant cells to the therapeutic activities of trastuzumab by inducing growth arrest, proliferation inhibition, and G(1)-S cell cycle checking in the presence of the antibody. Ectopic expression of miR-21 in HER2(+) breast cancer cells confers resistance to trastuzumab. Rescuing PTEN expression with a p3XFLAG-PTEN-mut construct with deleted miR-21 targeting sequence at its 3' UTR restored the growth inhibition of trastuzumab in the resistant cells by inducing PTEN activation and AKT inhibition. In vivo, administering miR-21 antisense oligonucleotides restored trastuzumab sensitivity in the resistant breast cancer xenografts by inducing PTEN expression, whereas injection of miR-21 mimics conferred trastuzumab resistant in the sensitive breast tumors via PTEN silence. Up-regulatin of miR-21 in tumor biopsies obtained from patients receiving pre-operative trastuzumab therapy was associated with poor trastuzumab response. Therefore, miR-21 overexpression contributes to trastuzumab resistance in HER2(+) breast cancers and antagonizing miR-21 demonstrates therapeutic potential by sensitizing the malignancy to anti-HER2 treatment."

The 3.25-Å-resolution structure of the portal-protein core bound to 12 copies of gene product 4 (gp4) reveals a ~1.1-MDa assembly formed by 24 proteins. Unexpectedly, a lower-resolution structure of the full-length portal protein unveils the unique topology of the C-terminal domain, which forms a ~200-Å-long α-helical barrel. This domain inserts deeply into the virion and is highly conserved in the Podoviridae family. We propose that the barrel domain facilitates genome spooling onto the interior surface of the capsid during genome packaging and, in analogy to a rifle barrel, increases the accuracy of genome ejection into the host cell."

In this study, we investigated miRNA profiling as a complementary tool to improve our understanding of breast cancer (BC) biology and to assess whether miRNA expression could predict clinical outcome of BC patients.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Global miRNA expression profiling using microarray technology was conducted in 56 systemically untreated BC patients who had corresponding mRNA expression profiles available. Results were further confirmed using qRT-PCR in an independent dataset of 89 ER-positive BC patients homogeneously treated with tamoxifen only. MiR-210 functional analyses were performed in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 BC cell lines using lentiviral transduction.RESULTS: Estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor grade and our previously developed gene expression grade index (GGI) were associated with distinct miRNA profiles. Several miRNAs were found to be clinically relevant, including miR-210, its expression being associated with tumor proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, miR-210 was associated with poor clinical outcome in ER-positive, tamoxifen-treated BC patients. Interestingly, the prognostic performance of miR-210 was similar to several reported multi-gene signatures, highlighting its important role in BC differentiation and tumor progression. Functional analyses in BC cell lines revealed that miR-210 is involved in cell proliferation, migration and invasion.CONCLUSIONS: This integrated analysis combining miRNA and mRNA expression demonstrates that miRNA expression provides additional biological information beyond mRNA expression. Expression of miR-210 is linked to tumor proliferation and appears to be a strong potential biomarker of clinical outcome in BC."

Combination of chemotherapy and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapy represents an example of this approach. Hypothesizing that the chemotherapeutic drug and the siRNA should be simultaneously delivered to the same tumoral cell to exert their synergistic effect, the development of delivery systems that can efficiently encapsulate two drugs and successfully deliver payloads to targeted sites via systemic administration has proven to be challenging. Here, we demonstrate an innovative &quot;two-in-one&quot; micelleplex approach based on micellar nanoparticles of a biodegradable triblock copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone)-b-poly(2-aminoethyl ethylene phosphate) to systemically deliver the siRNA and chemotherapeutic drug. We show clear evidence that the micelleplex is capable of delivering siRNA and paclitaxel simultaneously to the same tumoral cells both in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that systemic administration of the micelleplex carrying polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) specific siRNA and paclitaxel can induce a synergistic tumor suppression effect in the MDA-MB-435s xenograft murine model, requiring a thousand-fold less paclitaxel than needed for paclitaxel monotherapy delivered by the micelleplex and without activation of the innate immune response or generation of carrier-associated toxicity."

Several members of this family are involved in oncogenesis and this prompted us to assess whether expression levels of individual POK family members are associated with clinical outcomes in cancer. We have observed that ZBTB4 (zinc-finger and BTB domain containing 4) is downregulated in breast cancer patients, and that its expression is significantly correlated with relapse-free survival. Further integrative analysis of mRNA and microRNA (miR) expression data from the NCI-60 cell lines revealed an inverse correlation between ZBTB4 and oncogenic miRs derived from the miR-17-92 cluster and its paralogs. The experimental results using MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells confirm that miRNAs derived from these clusters, containing miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-106a, miR-106b and miR-93, negatively regulate ZBTB4 expression. Overexpression of ZBTB4 or restoration of ZBTB4 by using an antagomir inhibit growth and invasion of breast cancer cells, and this effect is due, in part, to ZBTB4-dependent repression of the specificity protein 1 (Sp1), Sp3 and Sp4 genes, and subsequent downregulation of several Sp-dependent oncogenes, in part, through competition between ZBTB4 and Sp transcription factors for GC-rich promoter sequences. These results confirm that ZBTB4 functions as a novel tumor-suppressor gene with prognostic significance for breast cancer survival, and the oncogenic miR-17-92/ZBTB4/Sp axis may be a potential therapeutic target."

A key oncomir in carcinogenesis is miR-21, which is consistently up-regulated in a wide range of cancers. However, few functional studies are available for miR-21, and few targets have been identified. In this study, we explored the role of miR-21 in human breast cancer cells and tissues, and searched for miR-21 targets.METHODS: We used in vitro and in vivo assays to explore the role of miR-21 in the malignant progression of human breast cancer, using miR-21 knockdown. Using LNA silencing combined to microarray technology and target prediction, we screened for potential targets of miR-21 and validated direct targets by using luciferase reporter assay and Western blot. Two candidate target genes (EIF4A2 and ANKRD46) were selected for analysis of correlation with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis using immunohistochemistry on cancer tissue microrrays.RESULTS: Anti-miR-21 inhibited growth and migration of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro, and tumor growth in nude mice. Knockdown of miR-21 significantly increased the expression of ANKRD46 at both mRNA and protein levels. Luciferase assays using a reporter carrying a putative target site in the 3' untranslated region of ANKRD46 revealed that miR-21 directly targeted ANKRD46. miR-21 and EIF4A2 protein were inversely expressed in breast cancers (rs = -0.283, P = 0.005, Spearman's correlation analysis).CONCLUSIONS: Knockdown of miR-21 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells inhibits in vitro and in vivo growth as well as in vitro migration. ANKRD46 is newly identified as a direct target of miR-21 in BC. These results suggest that inhibitory strategies against miR-21 using peptide nucleic acids (PNAs)-antimiR-21 may provide potential therapeutic applications in breast cancer treatment."

Molecular apocrine tumours were recently identified as an additional subgroup, characterised as oestrogen receptor negative and androgen receptor positive (ER- AR+), but with an expression profile resembling ER+ luminal breast cancer. One possible explanation for the apparent incongruity is that ER gene expression programmes could be recapitulated by AR. Using a cell line model of ER- AR+ molecular apocrine tumours (termed MDA-MB-453 cells), we map global AR binding events and find a binding profile that is similar to ER binding in breast cancer cells. We find that AR binding is a near-perfect subset of FoxA1 binding regions, a level of concordance never previously seen with a nuclear receptor. AR functionality is dependent on FoxA1, since silencing of FoxA1 inhibits AR binding, expression of the majority of the molecular apocrine gene signature and growth cell growth. These findings show that AR binds and regulates ER cis-regulatory elements in molecular apocrine tumours, resulting in a transcriptional programme reminiscent of ER-mediated transcription in luminal breast cancers."

In this study, two of the most widely used amplification methods, the linker amplified shotgun library (LASL) and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) methods, were applied to a sample from the seawater surface. Viral DNA was extracted from viruses concentrated by tangential flow filtration and amplified by these two methods. 454 pyrosequencing was used to read the metagenomic sequences from different libraries. The resulting taxonomic classifications of the viruses, their functional assignments, and assembly patterns differed substantially depending on the amplification method. Only double-stranded DNA viruses were retrieved from the LASL, whereas most sequences in the MDA library were from single-stranded DNA viruses, and double-stranded DNA viral sequences were minorities. Thus, the two amplification methods reveal different aspects of viral diversity."

We mapped the binding profiles of ERα and its interacting transcription factors (TFs), FOXA1 and GATA3 in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, and observed that these three TFs form a functional enhanceosome that regulates the genes driving core ERα function and cooperatively modulate the transcriptional networks previously ascribed to ERα alone. We demonstrate that these enhanceosome occupied sites are associated with optimal enhancer characteristics with highest p300 co-activator recruitment, RNA Pol II occupancy, and chromatin opening. Most importantly, we show that the transfection of all three TFs was necessary to reprogramme the ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells to restore the estrogen-responsive growth resembling estrogen-treated ERα-positive MCF-7 cells. Cumulatively, these results suggest that all the enhanceosome components comprising ERα, FOXA1, and GATA3 are necessary for the full repertoire of cancer-associated effects of the ERα."

Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24), an IL-10 family cytokine, exhibits pleiotropic anticancer activities without adversely affecting normal cells. We previously demonstrated that suppression of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family member, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), is required for mda-7/IL-24-mediated apoptosis of prostate carcinomas. Here we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of Mcl-1 expression with the unique Apogossypol derivative BI-97C1, also called Sabutoclax, is sufficient to sensitize prostate tumors to mda-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis, whereas ABT-737, which lacks efficacy in inhibiting Mcl-1, does not sensitize mda-7/IL-24-mediated cytotoxicity. A combination regimen of tropism-modified adenovirus delivered mda-7/IL-24 (Ad.5/3-mda-7) and BI-97C1 enhances cytotoxicity in human PC cells, including those resistant to mda-7/IL-24 or BI-97C1 alone. The combination regimen causes autophagy that facilitates NOXA- and Bim-induced and Bak/Bax-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. Treatment with Ad.5/3-mda-7 and BI-97C1 significantly inhibits the growth of human PC xenografts in nude mice and spontaneously induced PC in Hi-myc transgenic mice. Tumor growth inhibition correlated with increased TUNEL staining and decreased Ki-67 expression in both PC xenografts and prostates of Hi-myc mice. These findings demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of Mcl-1 with the Apogossypol derivative, BI-97C1, sensitizes human PCs to mda-7/IL-24-mediated cytotoxicity, thus potentially augmenting the therapeutic benefit of this combinatorial approach toward PC."

However, the structure and composition of the channel are elusive. We determined the crystal structures of the interacting domains between these nucleoporins and pieced together the molecular architecture of the mammalian transport channel. Located in the channel midplane is a flexible Nup54⋅Nup58 ring that can undergo large rearrangements yielding diameter changes from ∼20 to ∼40 nm. Nup62⋅Nup54 triple helices project alternately up and down from either side of the midplane ring and form nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic entries. The channel consists of as many as 224 copies of the three nucleoporins, amounting to a molar mass of 12.3 MDa and contributing 256 phenylalanine-glycine repeat regions. We propose that the occupancy of these repeat regions with transport receptors modulates ring diameter and transport activity."

In this study, we investigated whether this variability could be influenced by age or sex hormones in humans. To this end, we studied LINE-1 methylation in vivo in blood-derived DNA from individuals aged 18 to 64 years and from young healthy females at various hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. Our results show that no significant association with age was observed. However, the previously reported increase of LINE-1 methylation in males was reconfirmed. In females, although no correlation between LINE-1 or Alu methylation and hormone levels was observed, a significant stable individual specific level of methylation was noted. In vitro results largely confirmed these findings, as neither estrogen nor dihydrotestosterone affected LINE-1 or Alu methylation in Hek293T, HUVEC, or MDA-kb2 cell lines. In contrast, a decrease in methylation was observed in estrogen-treated T47-Kbluc cell lines strongly expressing estrogen receptor. The very low expression of estrogen receptor in blood cells could explain the observed insensitivity of methylation at LINE-1 to natural hormonal variations in females. In conclusion, neither natural cycle of hormones nor age has a detectable effect on the LINE-1 methylation in peripheral blood cells, while gender remains an important factor."

The CCT interactome shows involvement in folding and assembly of a small range of proteins linked to essential cellular processes such as cytoskeleton assembly and cell-cycle regulation. CCT has a classic chaperonin architecture, with two heterogeneous 8-membered rings stacked back-to-back, enclosing a folding cavity. However, the mechanism by which CCT assists folding is distinct from other chaperonins, with no hydrophobic wall lining a potential Anfinsen cage, and a sequential rather than concerted ATP hydrolysis mechanism. We have solved the crystal structure of yeast CCT in complex with actin at 3.8 Å resolution, revealing the subunit organisation and the location of discrete patches of co-evolving 'signature residues' that mediate specific interactions between CCT and its substrates. The intrinsic asymmetry is revealed by the structural individuality of the CCT subunits, which display unique configurations, substrate binding properties, ATP-binding heterogeneity and subunit-subunit interactions.

We used deep pyrosequencing to examine the gut-associated microbiome of 11 ELBW infants in the first postnatal month, with a first time determination of the eukaryote microbiota such as fungi and nematodes, including bacteria and viruses that have not been previously described. Among the fungi observed, Candida sp. and Clavispora sp. dominated the sequences, but a range of environmental molds were also observed. Surprisingly, seventy-one percent of the infant fecal samples tested contained ribosomal sequences corresponding to the parasitic organism Trichinella. Ribosomal DNA sequences for the roundworm symbiont Xenorhabdus accompanied these sequences in the infant with the greatest proportion of Trichinella sequences. When examining ribosomal DNA sequences in aggregate, Enterobacteriales, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus were the most abundant bacterial taxa in a low diversity bacterial community (mean Shannon-Weaver Index of 1.02 ± 0.69), with relatively little change within individual infants through time. To supplement the ribosomal sequence data, shotgun sequencing was performed on DNA from multiple displacement amplification (MDA) of total fecal genomic DNA from two infants. In addition to the organisms mentioned previously, the metagenome also revealed sequences for gram positive and gram negative bacteriophages, as well as human adenovirus C.

Here, we analyze on a genome-wide level the impact of recombination on gene-complement diversity and virulence evolution in N. meningitidis. We combined comparative genome hybridization using microarrays (mCGH) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of 29 meningococcal isolates with computational comparison of a subset of seven meningococcal genome sequences.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that lateral gene transfer of minimal mobile elements as well as prophages are major forces shaping meningococcal population structure. Extensive gene content comparison revealed novel associations of virulence with genetic elements besides the recently discovered meningococcal disease associated (MDA) island. In particular, we identified an association of virulence with a recently described canonical genomic island termed IHT-E and a differential distribution of genes encoding RTX toxin- and two-partner secretion systems among hyperinvasive and non-hyperinvasive lineages. By computationally screening also the core genome for signs of recombination, we provided evidence that about 40% of the meningococcal core genes are affected by recombination primarily within metabolic genes as well as genes involved in DNA replication and repair. By comparison with the results of previous mCGH studies, our data indicated that genetic structuring as revealed by mCGH is stable over time and highly similar for isolates from different geographic origins.CONCLUSIONS: Recombination comprising lateral transfer of entire genes as well as homologous intragenic recombination has a profound impact on meningococcal population structure and genome composition. Our data support the hypothesis that meningococcal virulence is polygenic in nature and that differences in metabolism might contribute to virulence."

Gene regulation through microRNAs (miRNA) has been shown to play an important role in cancer drug resistance. By directly targeting mRNA, miRNAs are able to inhibit genes that are necessary for signalling pathways or drug induced apoptosis rendering cells drug resistant. This study investigated the role of differential miRNA expression in two in vitro breast cancer cell line models (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) of acquired docetaxel resistance. MiRNA microarray analysis identified 299 and 226 miRNAs altered in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 docetaxel-resistant cells, respectively. Docetaxel resistance was associated with increased expression of miR-34a and miR-141 and decreased expression of miR-7, miR-16, miR-30a, miR-125a-5p, miR-126. Computational target prediction revealed eight candidate genes targeted by these miRNAs. Quantitative PCR and western analysis confirmed decreased expression of two genes, BCL-2 and CCND1, in docetaxel-resistant cells, which are both targeted by miR-34a. Modulation of miR-34a expression was correlated with BCL-2 and cyclin D1 protein expression changes and a direct interaction of miR-34a with BCL-2 was shown by luciferase assay. Inhibition of miR-34a enhanced response to docetaxel in MCF-7 docetaxel-resistant cells, whereas overexpression of miR-34a conferred resistance in MCF-7 docetaxel-sensitive cells. This study is the first to show differences in miRNA expression, in particular, increased expression of miR-34a in an acquired model of docetaxel resistance in breast cancer. This serves as a mechanism of acquired docetaxel resistance in these cells, possibly through direct interactions with BCL-2 and CCND1, therefore presenting a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of docetaxel-resistant breast cancer."

However, changes in glycosylation occur in nearly all breast cancers, which can alter this interaction. Here, we report that profiles of glycosylation vary between ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers. We found that genes involved in the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis x (sLe(x); FUT3, FUT4, and ST3GAL6) are significantly increased in estrogen receptor alpha-negative (ER-negative) tumors compared with ER-positive ones. SLe(x) expression had no influence on the survival of patients whether they had ER-negative or ER-positive tumors. However, high expression of sLe(x) in ER-positive tumors was correlated with metastasis to the bone where sLe(x) receptor E-selectin is constitutively expressed. The ER-positive ZR-75-1 and the ER-negative BT20 cell lines both express sLe(x) but only ZR-75-1 cells could adhere to activated endothelial cells under dynamic flow conditions in a sLe(x) and E-selectin-dependent manner. Moreover, L/P-selectins bound strongly to ER-negative MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cell lines in a heparan sulfate (HS)-dependent manner that was independent of sLe(x) expression. Expression of glycosylation genes involved in heparan biosynthesis (EXT1 and HS3ST1) was increased in ER-negative tumors. Taken together, our results suggest that the context of sLe(x) expression is important in determining its functional significance and that selectins may promote metastasis in breast cancer through protein-associated sLe(x) and HS glycosaminoglycans."

We evaluated the expression pattern of miRNAs in human breast cancer cells by qPCR, finding out an up-regulated miRNA miR-29b and studying its biological effect by migration assay. We defined a target gene PTEN by bioinformatics approach and western blot. In breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 cell, which migrate faster than MCF-7, we observed that miR-29b was highly over-expressed. Inhibition of miR-29b in cultured cells increased the expression of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor, promoting apoptosis, decreasing migration, and decreasing invasion. In contrast, enhanced miR-29b expression by transfection with pre-miR-29b decreased the expression of PTEN and impaired apoptosis, increasing tumor cell migration and invasion. Moreover, PTEN was shown to be a direct target of miR-29b and was also shown to contribute to the miR-29b-mediated effects on cell invasion.

To test this hypothesis, cotransfection of let-7 mimics or inhibitors together with full-length or a fragment of ER-α36 3'UTR luciferase construct was performed, and we found that let-7b and let-7i mimics suppressed the activity of reporter gene significantly, which was enhanced remarkably by let-7b and let-7i inhibitors. Both mRNA and protein expression of ER-α36 were inhibited by let-7 mimics and enhanced by let-7 inhibitors. Furthermore, ER-α36 mediated nongenomic MAPK and Akt pathways were weakened by let-7b and let-7i mimics in triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. The reverse correlation between let-7 miRNAs and ER-α36 also exists in Tamoxifen (Tam)-resistant MCF7 cell line. Transfection of let-7 mimics to Tam-resistant MCF7 cells downregulated ER-α36 expression and enhanced the sensitivity of MCF7 cells to Tam in estrogen-free medium, which could be restored by overexpression of ER-α36 constructs without 3'UTR. Our results suggested a novel regulatory mechanism of let-7 miRNAs on ER-α36 mediated nongenomic estrogen signal pathways and Tam resistance."

Notch-1 and Notch-4 are potent breast oncogenes that are overexpressed in triple-negative and other subtypes of breast cancer. PEA3, an ETS transcription factor, is also overexpressed in triple-negative and other breast cancer subtypes. We investigated whether PEA3 could be the critical transcriptional activator of Notch receptors in MDA-MB-231 and other breast cancer cells.METHODS: Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to detect Notch-1, Notch-2, Notch-3 and Notch-4 receptor expression in breast cancer cells when PEA3 was knocked down by siRNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to identify promoter regions for Notch genes that recruited PEA3. TAM-67 and c-Jun siRNA were used to identify that c-Jun was necessary for PEA3 enrichment on the Notch-4 promoter. A Notch-4 luciferase reporter was used to confirm that endogenous PEA3 or AP-1 activated the Notch-4 promoter region. Cell cycle analysis, trypan blue exclusion, annexin V flow cytometry, colony formation assay and an in vivo xenograft study were performed to determine the biological significance of targeting PEA3 via siRNA, Notch signaling via a γ-secretase inhibitor, or both.RESULTS: Herein we provide new evidence for transcriptional regulation of Notch by PEA3 in breast cancer. PEA3 activates Notch-1 transcription in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SKBr3 breast cancer cells. PEA3 activates Notch-4 transcription in MDA-MB-231 cells where PEA3 levels are endogenously high. In SKBr3 and BT474 breast cancer cells where PEA3 levels are low, overexpression of PEA3 increases Notch-4 transcripts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed the enrichment of PEA3 on Notch-1 and Notch-4 promoters in MDA-MB-231 cells. PEA3 recruitment to Notch-1 was AP-1-independent, whereas PEA3 recruitment to Notch-4 was c-JUN-dependent. Importantly, the combined inhibition of Notch signaling via a γ-secretase inhibitor (MRK-003 GSI) and knockdown of PEA3 arrested growth in the G1 phase, decreased both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth and significantly increased apoptotic cells in vitro. Moreover, either PEA3 knockdown or MRK-003 GSI treatment significantly reduced tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results from this study demonstrate for the first time that Notch-1 and Notch-4 are novel transcriptional targets of PEA3 in breast cancer cells. Targeting of PEA3 and/or Notch pathways might provide a new therapeutic strategy for triple-negative and possibly other breast cancer subtypes."

It is also important for assessing the role of deamidation in vivo. However, nonenzymatic deamidation occurs easily in peptides under conditions commonly used in treatment with trypsin and PNGase F. The impact on proteomic sample preparation has not yet been evaluated systematically. In addition, the (13)C peaks of amidated peptides can be misassigned as monoisotopic peaks of the corresponding deamidated ones in database searches. The 19.34 mDa mass difference between them is proposed as a means for eliminating the resulting false positive identifications in large-scale proteomic analysis. We evaluated five groups of proteomic data, obtained mainly through an electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC)-reverse phase (RP) chromatography sequence, and ascertained that nonenzymatic asparagine deamidation occurred to some extent on 4-9% of the peptides, resulting in the false positive identification of many N-glycosylation sites. A comprehensive investigation indicated that the chief causative factors were the mildly alkaline pH and prolonged incubations at 37 °C during proteomic sample preparation. An improved protocol is proposed featuring tryptic digestion at pH 6 and deglycosylation at pH 5, resulting in a significant decrease in nonenzymatic deamidation while conserving adequate digestion efficiency. The number of identified deamidation sites was improved significantly by increasing the sample loading amount in liquid chromatography-tandem MS. This permitted the identification of a significant number of glutamine deamidation sites, which featured sequence motifs largely different from those for asparagine deamidation: -Q-V-, -Q-L- and -Q-G- and, to a lesser extent, -Q-A- and -Q-E-."

The glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) transcription factor is the terminal effector of the Hedgehog pathway, frequently activated in human breast cancer and an emerging target of breast cancer therapy. While somatic mutations in the human GLI1 gene have never been reported in any cell or tumor type, we recently uncovered the existence of a novel alternatively spliced, truncated GLI1 (tGLI1) that has an in-frame deletion of 41 codons spanning the entire exon 3 and part of exon 4 of the GLI1 gene. Using glioblastoma models, we showed that tGLI1 has gained the ability to promote glioblastoma migration and invasion via its gain-of-function transcriptional activity. However, the pathological impact of tGLI1 on breast cancer remains undefined. Here, we report that tGLI1 is frequently expressed in human breast cancer cell lines and primary specimens we have examined to date, but is undetectable in normal breast tissues. We found for the first time that tGLI1, but not GLI1, binds to and enhances the human vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) gene promoter, leading to its upregulation. Consequently, tGLI1-expressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells secret higher levels of VEGF-A and contain a higher propensity, than the isogenic cells with control vector and GLI1, to stimulate in vitro angiogenesis of human vascular endothelial cells. We further showed that tGLI1 has gained the ability to enhance the motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells in a proliferation-independent manner and that this functional gain is associated with increased expression of migration/invasion-associated genes, CD24, MMP-2 and MMP-9. tGLI1 has also acquired the property to facilitate anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells. Collectively, our results define tGLI1 as a gain-of-function GLI1 transcription factor and a novel mediator of the behavior of clinically more aggressive breast cancer."

Protein assemblies with molecular masses up to MDa are now accessible by this approach. Most current approaches have used quadrupole/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry, sometimes coupled with ion mobility, to reveal stoichiometry, shape, and dissociation of protein assemblies. The amino-acid sequence of the subunits, however, still relies heavily on independent bottom-up proteomics. We describe here an approach to study protein assemblies that integrates electron-capture dissociation (ECD), native ESI, and FTICR mass spectrometry (12 T). Flexible regions of assembly subunits of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (147 kDa), concanavalin A (103 kDa), and photosynthetic Fenna-Matthews-Olson antenna protein complex (140 kDa) can be sequenced by ECD or &quot;activated-ion&quot; ECD. Furthermore, noncovalent metal-binding sites can also be determined for the concanavalin A assembly. Most importantly, the regions that undergo fragmentation, either from one of the termini by ECD or from the middle of a protein, as initiated by CID, correlate well with the B-factor from X-ray crystallography of that protein. This factor is a measure of the extent an atom can move from its coordinated position as a function of temperature or crystal imperfections. The approach provides not only top-down proteomics information of the complex subunits but also structural insights complementary to those obtained by ion mobility."

In this study, we identified the oncogenic protein, TWIST1 (Twist), which is overexpressed in high-grade breast cancers, as a potential negative regulator of ER expression. Functional characterization of ER regulation by Twist was performed using Twist low (MCF-7, T-47D) and Twist high (Hs 578T, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7/Twist) expressing cell lines. All Twist high expressing cell lines exhibited low ER transcript and protein levels. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter assays, we demonstrated that Twist could directly bind to E-boxes in the ER promoter and significantly downregulate ER promoter activity in vitro. Functionally, Twist overexpression caused estrogen-independent proliferation of breast cells, and promoted hormone resistance to the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen and selective estrogen receptor down-regulator fulvestrant. Importantly, this effect was reversible on downregulating Twist. In addition, orthotopic tumors generated in mice using MCF-7/Twist cells were resistant to tamoxifen. These tumors had high vascular volume and permeability surface area, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mechanistically, Twist recruited DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) to the ER promoter, leading to a significantly higher degree of ER promoter methylation compared with parental cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that Twist interacted with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) at the ER promoter, causing histone deacetylation and chromatin condensation, further reducing ER transcript levels. Functional re-expression of ER was achieved using the demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine, and the HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid. Finally, an inverse relationship was observed between Twist and ER expression in human breast tumors. In summary, the regulation of ER by Twist could be an underlying mechanism for the loss of ER activity observed in breast tumors, and may contribute to the generation of hormone-resistant, ER-negative breast cancer."

However, the major concerns with GTPs are their bioavailability and stability under physiologic conditions. In the present study, we show that treatments with EGCG and a novel prodrug of EGCG (pro-EGCG or pEGCG) dose- and time-dependently inhibited the proliferation of human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells but not normal control MCF10A cells. Furthermore, both EGCG and pro-EGCG inhibited the transcription of hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase), the catalytic subunit of telomerase, through epigenetic mechanisms in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. The downregulation of hTERT expression was found to be because of hTERT promoter hypomethylation and histone deacetylations, mediated at least partially through inhibition of DNA methyltransferase and histone acetyltransferase activities, respectively. In addition, we also observed that EGCG and pEGCG can remodel chromatin structures of the hTERT promoter by decreasing the level of acetyl-H3, acetyl-H3K9, and acetyl-H4 to the hTERT promoter. EGCG and pEGCG induced chromatin alterations that facilitated the binding of many hTERT repressors such as MAD1 and E2F-1 to the hTERT regulatory region. Depletion of E2F-1 and MAD1 by using siRNA reversed the pEGCG downregulated hTERT expression and associated cellular apoptosis differently in ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells. Collectively, our data provide new insights into breast cancer prevention through epigenetic modulation of telomerase by using pro-EGCG, a more stable form of EGCG, as a novel chemopreventive compound."

It is estimated that more than 40% of congenital disorders of glycosylation patients lack a confirmatory molecular diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to improve molecular diagnosis for congenital disorders of glycosylation by developing and validating a next generation sequencing panel for comprehensive mutation detection in 24 genes known to cause congenital disorders of glycosylation.METHODS: Next generation sequencing validation was performed on 12 positive control congenital disorders of glycosylation patients.

The nuclear amine oxidase, lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) has the ability to broadly repress gene expression by removing the activating mono- and di-methylation marks at the lysine 4 residue of histone 3 (H3K4me1 and me2). Additionally, LSD1 is highly expressed in estrogen receptor α negative (ER-) breast cancer cells. Since epigenetic marks are reversible, they make attractive therapeutic targets. Here we examine the effects of polyamine analog inhibitors of LSD1 on gene expression, with the goal of targeting LSD1 as a therapeutic modality in the treatment of breast cancer. Exposure of the ER-negative human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 to the LSD1 inhibitors, 2d or PG11144, significantly increases global H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, and alters gene expression. Array analysis indicated that 98 (75 up and 23 down) and 477 (237 up and 240 down) genes changed expression by at least 1.5-fold or greater after treatment with 2d and PG11144, respectively. The expression of 12 up-regulated genes by 2d and 14 up-regulated genes by PG11144 was validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated that up-regulated gene expression by polyamine analogs is associated with increase of the active histone marks H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K9act, and decrease of the repressive histone marks H3K9me2 and H3K27me3, in the promoter regions of the relevant target genes. These data indicate that the pharmacologic inhibition of LSD1 can effectively alter gene expression and that this therapeutic strategy has potential."

Herein, we synthesized a novel small (2 nm) AuNPs, which were functionalized with the therapeutic peptide, PMI (p12), and a targeted peptide, CRGDK for selective binding to neuropilin-1(Nrp-1) receptors which overexpressed on the cancer cells and regulated the process of membrane receptor-mediated internalization. It was found that CRGDK peptides increased intracellular uptake of AuNPs compared to other surface conjugations quantified by ICP-MS. Interestingly, CRGDK functionalized AuNPs resulted in maximal binding interaction between the CRGDK peptide and targeted Nrp-1 receptor overexpressed on MDA-MB-321 cell surface, which improved the delivery of therapeutic P12 peptide inside targeted cells. Au@p12 + CRGDK nanoparticles indicated with highly effective cancer treatment by increasing p53 expression upregulated with intracellular enhanced p12 therapeutic peptide.

The Runt-related transcription factor 2, Runx2, is an important determinant of bone metastasis in breast cancer. Runx2 is known to mediate activation of osteoclast activity and inhibition of osteoblast differentiation by metastatic breast cancer cells. However, while Runx2-regulated genes that mediate osteoclast activation have been identified, how Runx2 determines inhibition of osteoblasts is unknown.METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine how Runx2 mediates the ability of metastatic breast cancer cells to modulate the activity of bone cells. We have previously demonstrated that Runx2 requires the co-activator core binding factor beta (CBFβ) to regulate gene expression in breast cancer cells. We, therefore, performed independent microarray analyses to identify target genes whose expression is dependent upon both Runx2 and CBFβ. Common target genes, with a role in modulating bone-cell function, were confirmed using a combination of siRNA, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), ELISA, promoter reporter analysis, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. The function of Runx2/CBFβ-regulated genes in mediating the ability of MDA-MB-231 to inhibit osteoblast differentiation was subsequently established in primary bone marrow stromal cell cultures and MC-3T3 osteoblast cells.RESULTS: We show that Runx2/CBFβ mediates inhibition of osteoblast differentiation by MDA-MB-231 cells through induction of the Wnt signaling antagonist, sclerostin. We demonstrate that MDA-MB-231 cells secrete sclerostin and that sclerostin-expression is critically dependent on both Runx2 and CBFβ. We also identified the osteoclast activators IL-11 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as new target genes of Runx2/CBFβ in metastatic breast cancer cells.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Runx2 and CBFβ are required for the expression of genes that mediate the ability of metastatic breast cancer cells to directly modulate both osteoclast and osteoblast function. We also show that Runx2-dependent inhibition of osteoblast differentiation by breast cancer cells is mediated through the Wnt antagonist, sclerostin."

Deregulated microRNA expression represents one type of molecular event that has been associated with many different human cancers. In order to identify a miRNA/mRNA regulatory interaction that is biologically relevant to the triple-negative breast cancer genotype/phenotype, we initially conducted a miRNA profiling experiment to detect differentially expressed miRNAs in cell line models representing triple-negative (MDA-MB-231), ER(+) (MCF7), and HER-2 overexpressed (SK-BR-3) histotypes. We identified human miR-34a expression as being &gt;3-fold down (from its median expression value across all cell lines) in MDA-MB-231 cells, and identified AXL as a putative mRNA target using multiple miRNA/target prediction algorithms. The miR-34a/AXL interaction was functionally characterized through ectopic overexpression experiments with a miR-34a mimic in two independent triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. In reporter assays, miR-34a binds to its putative target site within the AXL 3'UTR to inhibit luciferase expression. We also observed degradation of AXL mRNA and decreased AXL protein levels, as well as cell signaling effects on AKT phosphorylation and phenotypic effects on cell migration. Finally, we present an inverse correlative trend in miR-34a and AXL expression for both cell line and patient tumor samples."

The advances of next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) provide unprecedented capabilities to scan genomes for changes such as mutations, deletions, and alterations of chromosomal copy number. However, the cost of full-genome sequencing still prevents the routine application of NGS in many areas. Capturing and sequencing the coding exons of genes (the &quot;exome&quot;) can be a cost-effective approach for identifying changes that result in alteration of protein sequences. We applied an exome-sequencing technology (Roche Nimblegen capture paired with 454 sequencing) to identify sequence variation and mutations in eight commonly used cancer cell lines from a variety of tissue origins (A2780, A549, Colo205, GTL16, NCI-H661, MDA-MB468, PC3, and RD). We showed that this technology can accurately identify sequence variation, providing ∼95% concordance with Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 performed on the same cell lines. Furthermore, we detected 19 of the 21 mutations reported in Sanger COSMIC database for these cell lines. We identified an average of 2,779 potential novel sequence variations/mutations per cell line, of which 1,904 were non-synonymous. Many non-synonymous changes were identified in kinases and known cancer-related genes. In addition we confirmed that the read-depth of exome sequence data can be used to estimate high-level gene amplifications and identify homologous deletions. In summary, we demonstrate that exome sequencing can be a reliable and cost-effective way for identifying alterations in cancer genomes, and we have generated a comprehensive catalogue of genomic alterations in coding regions of eight cancer cell lines.

It is essential for tumor growth under adverse environment. Mitochondria play an important role in the formation of autophagosome and its subsequent docking and fusion with lysosome. To understand the contribution of mitochondria to the regulation of homeostatic autophagy in cancer cells, we used the transmitochondrial cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) model. Cybrid system allowed us to compare mitochondria from different cell types including highly metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (c231), less metastatic breast cancer cell lines: MDA-MB-436 (c436) and MDA-MB-468 (c468), as well as non-cancerous mammary epithelial cell MCF-10A (c10A) in a defined nuclear background. The c231 exhibited lower LC3-II levels but higher ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I than c436, c468 and c10A. In addition, c231 displayed more punctate LC3-positive cells and had lower levels of sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) than other cybrids. These suggested that mitochondria could contribute to the increased autophagy and autophagic flux in metastatic cancer. This increased autophagy was found to be non-selective autophagy instead of selective mitophagy since LC3 puncta in c231 did not co-localize with mitochondria labeled by Mitotracker red or Tomm 20. The promotion of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) in c231 also contributed to increased autophagy. Block of MPT by the inhibition of low-conductance stage of MPT pores resulted in a decrease of LC3 puncta in c231. These results suggested that mitochondria from highly metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 can promote homeostatic autophagy of cancer through opening low-conductance MPT pores."

Alternative splicing of CEACAM1 pre-mRNA generates two cytoplasmic domain splice variants characterized by the inclusion (L-isoform) or exclusion (S-isoform) of exon 7. Here we show that the alternative splicing of CEACAM1 pre-mRNA is regulated by novel cis elements residing in exon 7. We report the presence of three exon regulatory elements that lead to the inclusion or exclusion of exon 7 CEACAM1 mRNA in ZR75 breast cancer cells. Heterologous splicing reporter assays demonstrated that the maintenance of authentic alternative splicing mechanisms were independent of the CEACAM1 intron sequence context. We show that forced expression of these exon regulatory elements could alter CEACAM1 splicing in HEK-293 cells. Using RNA affinity chromatography, three members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family (hnRNP L, hnRNP A1, and hnRNP M) were identified. RNA immunoprecipitation of hnRNP L and hnRNP A1 revealed a binding motif located central and 3' to exon 7, respectively. Depletion of hnRNP A1 or L by RNAi in HEK-293 cells promoted exon 7 inclusion, whereas overexpression led to exclusion of the variable exon. By contrast, overexpression of hnRNP M showed exon 7 inclusion and production of CEACAM1-L mRNA. Finally, stress-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1 in MDA-MB-468 cells dynamically alters the CEACAM1-S:CEACAM1:L ratio in favor of the l-isoform.

Moreover, controversial data have been reported. TFF1 function in the mammary gland therefore needs to be clarified. In this study, using retroviral vectors, we performed TFF1 gain- or loss-of-function experiments in four human mammary epithelial cell lines: normal immortalized TFF1-negative MCF10A, malignant TFF1-negative MDA-MB-231 and malignant TFF1-positive MCF7 and ZR75.1. The expression of TFF1 stimulated the migration and invasion in the four cell lines. Forced TFF1 expression in MCF10A, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells did not modify anchorage-dependent or -independent cell proliferation. By contrast, TFF1 knockdown in MCF7 enhanced soft-agar colony formation. This increased oncogenic potential of MCF7 cells in the absence of TFF1 was confirmed in vivo in nude mice. Moreover, chemically induced tumorigenesis in TFF1-deficient (TFF1-KO) mice led to higher tumor incidence in the mammary gland and larger tumor size compared with wild-type mice. Similarly, tumor development was increased in the TFF1-KO ovary and lung. Collectively, our results clearly show that TFF1 does not exhibit oncogenic properties, but rather reduces tumor development. This beneficial function of TFF1 is in agreement with many clinical studies reporting a better outcome for patients with TFF1-positive breast primary tumors."

Thus, the regulation of FPR2/ALX expression may have pathophysiological and therapeutic relevance. Here, we mapped a nucleotide sequence with strong FPR2/ALX promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed specificity protein 1 (Sp1) binding to the core promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Sp1 cis-acting element and Sp1 overexpression established that this transcription factor is key for maximal promoter activity, which is instead suppressed by DNA methylation.

Cells expressing GOF p53 -R175H, -R273H and -D281G showed enhanced migration, which was reversed by RNA interference (RNAi) or transactivation-deficient mutants. In cells with engineered or endogenous p53 mutants, enhanced migration was reduced by downregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB2, a GOF p53 target. We found that GOF p53 proteins upregulate CXC-chemokine expression, the inflammatory mediators that contribute to multiple aspects of tumorigenesis. Elevated expression of CXCL5, CXCL8 and CXCL12 was found in cells expressing oncogenic p53. Transcription was elevated as CXCL5 and CXCL8 promoter activity was higher in cells expressing GOF p53, whereas wild-type p53 repressed promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed enhanced presence of acetylated histone H3 on the CXCL5 promoter in H1299/R273H cells, in agreement with increased transcriptional activity of the promoter, whereas RNAi-mediated repression of CXCL5 inhibited cell migration. Consistent with this, knockdown of the endogenous mutant p53 in lung cancer or melanoma cells reduced CXCL5 expression and cell migration. Furthermore, short hairpin RNA knockdown of mutant p53 in MDA-MB-231 cells reduced expression of a number of key targets, including several chemokines and other inflammatory mediators. Finally, CXCL5 expression was also elevated in lung tumor samples containing GOF p53, indicating relevance to human cancer. The data suggest a mechanistic link between GOF p53 proteins and chemokines in enhanced cell motility."

Treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative MDA-MB-231 and BT474 breast cancer cells with TCDD or the selective AHR modulator 6-methyl-1,3,-trichlorodibenzofuran (MCDF) inhibited breast cancer cell invasion in a Boyden chamber assay. These results were similar to those previously reported for the antimetastic microRNA-335 (miR-335). Both TCDD and MCDF induced miR-335 in MDA-MB-231 and BT474 cells and this was accompanied by downregulation of SOX4, a miR-335-regulated (inhibited) gene. The effects of TCDD and MCDF on miR-335 and SOX4 expression and interactions of miR-335 with the 3'-UTR target sequence in the SOX4 gene were all inhibited in cells transfected with an oligonucleotide (iAHR) that knocks down the AHR, thus confirming AHR-miR-335 interactions. MCDF (40 mg/kg/d) also inhibited lung metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells in a tail vein injection model, showing that the AHR is a potential new target for treating patients with ER-negative breast cancer, a disease where treatment options and their effectiveness are limited."

However, the ghrelin gene also encodes additional peptides through alternative splicing or post-translational modifications. Indeed, we previously identified a spliced mRNA ghrelin variant in mouse (In2-ghrelin-variant), which is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner by metabolic status and may thus be of biological relevance. Here, we have characterized a new human ghrelin variant that contains Ex0-1, intron (In) 1, and Ex2 and lacks Ex3-4. This human In1-ghrelin variant would encode a new prepropeptide that conserves the first 12aa of native-ghrelin (including the Ser3-potential octanoylation site) but has a different C-terminal tail. Expression of In1-variant was detected in 22 human tissues and its levels were positively correlated with those of ghrelin-O-acyltransferase (GOAT; p = 0.0001) but not with native-ghrelin expression, suggesting that In1-ghrelin could be a primary substrate for GOAT in human tissues. Interestingly, levels of In1-ghrelin variant expression in breast cancer samples were 8-times higher than those of normal mammary tissue, and showed a strong correlation in breast tumors with GOAT (p = 0.0001), ghrelin receptor-type 1b (GHSR1b; p = 0.049) and cyclin-D3 (a cell-cycle inducer/proliferation marker; p = 0.009), but not with native-ghrelin or GHSR1a expression. Interestingly, In1-ghrelin variant overexpression increased basal proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results provide evidence that In1-ghrelin is a novel element of the ghrelin family with a potential pathophysiological role in breast cancer."

Here, we show that ectopic expression of HIC1 in the highly malignant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line severely impairs cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. In parallel, infection of breast cancer cell lines with a retrovirus expressing HIC1 also induces decreased mRNA and protein expression of the tyrosine kinase receptor EphA2. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequential ChIP experiments demonstrate that endogenous HIC1 proteins are bound, together with the MTA1 corepressor, to the EphA2 promoter in WI38 cells. Taken together, our results identify EphA2 as a new direct target gene of HIC1. Finally, we observe that inactivation of endogenous HIC1 through RNA interference in normal breast epithelial cells results in the up-regulation of EphA2 and is correlated with increased cellular migration. To conclude, our results involve the tumor suppressor HIC1 in the transcriptional regulation of the tyrosine kinase receptor EphA2, whose ligand ephrin-A1 is also a HIC1 target gene. Thus, loss of the regulation of this Eph pathway through HIC1 epigenetic silencing could be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of epithelial cancers."

The carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) is a U-box-type ubiquitin ligase that induces ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of its substrate proteins. In this study, we investigated the role of CHIP in the NF-κB pathway in the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, a highly aggressive breast cancer cell line. We showed that overexpression of CHIP significantly inhibits the invasion of the MDA-MB-231 cells. The overexpression of CHIP suppressed expression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, CHIP strongly inhibited the nuclear localization and the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. The activation of the IkappaB kinase complex (IKK) was also blocked by CHIP overexpression. Importantly, CHIP overexpression resulted in a significant decrease in the level of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an upstream key player in the NF-κB pathway. However, the level of TRAF2 was restored after treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132. Moreover, CHIP overexpression promoted the ubiquitination of TRAF2. We also found cell invasion significantly decreased in cells transfected with TRAF2 small interfering RNA (siRNA). In contrast, when CHIP expression was suppressed by siRNA in poorly invasive MCF-7 cells, cell invasion significantly increased in conjunction with enhanced NF-κB activation and TRAF2 levels. Taken together, these results suggest that CHIP regulates NF-κB-mediated cell invasion via the down-regulation of TRAF2."

DIM inhibited the breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and caused cell-cycle arrest by down-regulating protein levels of cell-cycle related kinases CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, as well as Cyclin B1 and Cdc25A.

Neither prior assignments, including backbone assignments, for the protein, nor experiments that transfer magnetization between methyl groups and the protein backbone, are required.

We hypothesized that it might be a tumor suppressor and were interested in its regulation.METHODS: We examined nischarin expression in approximately 300 human breast cancer and normal tissues using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Loss of heterozygosity analysis was performed by examining three microsatellite markers located near the NISCH locus in normal and tumor tissues. We generated derivatives of MDA-MB-231 human metastatic breast cancer cells that overexpressed nischarin and measured tumor growth from these cells as xenografts in mice; metastasis by these cells after tail vein injection; and α5 integrin expression, Rac, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling using western blotting. We also generated clones of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in which nischarin expression was silenced and measured tumor growth in mouse xenograft models (n = 5 for all mouse experiments). P values were from two-sided Student t tests in pairwise comparisons.RESULTS: Normal human breast tissue samples had statistically significantly higher expression of nischarin mRNA compared with tumor tissue samples (mean level in normal breast = 50.7 [arbitrary units], in breast tumor = 16.49 [arbitrary units], difference = 34.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.63 to 56.79, P = .003), and loss of heterozygosity was associated with loss of nischarin expression. MDA-MB-231 cells in which nischarin was overexpressed had statistically significantly reduced tumor growth and metastasis compared with parental MDA-MB-231 cells (mean volume at day 40, control vs nischarin-expressing tumors, 1977 vs 42.27 mm(3), difference = 1935 mm(3), 95% CI = 395 to 3475 mm(3), P = .025). Moreover, MCF-7 tumor xenografts in which nischarin expression was silenced grew statistically significantly faster than parental cells (mean volume at day 63, tumors with scrambled short hairpin RNA [shRNA] vs with nischarin shRNA, 224 vs 1262 mm(3), difference = 1038 mm(3), 95% CI = 899.6 to 1176 mm(3), P &lt; .001). Overexpression of nischarin was associated with decreased α5 integrin expression, FAK phosphorylation, and Rac activation.CONCLUSION: Nischarin may be a novel tumor suppressor that limits breast cancer progression by regulating α5 integrin expression and subsequently α5 integrin-, FAK-, and Rac-mediated signaling."

These interactions are mediated, in part, through proteolytic sculpting of the microenvironment, particularly by the matrix metalloproteinases, with both tumors and stroma contributing to the proteolytic milieu. Because bone is one of the predominant sites of breast cancer metastases, we used a co-culture system in which a subpopulation of the highly invasive human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, with increased propensity to metastasize to bone, was overlaid onto a monolayer of differentiated osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells in a mineralized osteoid matrix. CLIP-CHIP® microarrays identified changes in the complete protease and inhibitor expression profile of the breast cancer and osteoblast cells that were induced upon co-culture. A large increase in osteoblast-derived MMP-13 mRNA and protein was observed. Affymetrix analysis and validation showed induction of MMP-13 was initiated by soluble factors produced by the breast tumor cells, including oncostatin M and the acute response apolipoprotein SAA3. Significant changes in the osteoblast secretomes upon addition of MMP-13 were identified by degradomics from which six novel MMP-13 substrates with the potential to functionally impact breast cancer metastasis to bone were identified and validated. These included inactivation of the chemokines CCL2 and CCL7, activation of platelet-derived growth factor-C, and cleavage of SAA3, osteoprotegerin, CutA, and antithrombin III. Hence, the influence of breast cancer metastases on the bone microenvironment that is executed via the induction of osteoblast MMP-13 with the potential to enhance metastases growth by generating a microenvironmental amplifying feedback loop is revealed."

In the present study, we further demonstrated that conditioned medium derived from δEF1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells significantly induces osteoclast maturation and concurrently represses osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. On the contrary, conditioned medium derived from δEF1-interfered MDA-MB-231 cells exhibits an opposite effect, thus confirming the effect of δEF to mediate osteolytic metastasis of breast cancer. Furthermore, we found that, during this process, δEF1 remarkably up-regulates matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression at both mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 cells. Importantly, the results of luciferase and CHIP assays indicated that δEF1 activates MMP-1 promoter activity through the AP-1 response element. Overexpression of δEF1 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly increases the recruitment of the AP-1 components, c-Jun/c-Fos, to the endogenous MMP-1 promoter, which in effect could be mediated via the MAPK signaling pathway. In conclusion, these observations suggest a potent role of δEF1 to promote breast cancer metastasis to bone by regulating secretion of growth factors in the tumor microenvironment."

Such associations are possibly mediated by adipokines. Visfatin, an adipokine, has recently been shown to be related to the development and progression of breast cancer. Therefore, the down-regulation of visfatin may be a novel strategy for breast cancer therapy. Curcumin has anticancer activities by modulating multiple signaling pathways and genes. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether visfatin gene expression is affected by curcumin in human breast cancer cells and to characterize the functional role of visfatin in breast cancer. We found that the mRNA and protein levels of visfatin were down-regulated by curcumin in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, along with decreased activity of constitutive nuclear factor (NF)-κB. We confirmed the repressive effect of curcumin on visfatin transcription by performing a visfatin promoter-driven reporter assay and identified two putative NF-κB-binding sites on visfatin promoter that are important for this effect. EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated the binding of p65 to the visfatin promoter, which was effectively blocked by curcumin. Enforced expression of p65 protein increased visfatin promoter activity, whereas blocking NF-κB signaling suppressed visfatin gene expression. Visfatin could enhance the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells and also attenuate curcumin-induced inhibition of cell invasion; on the other hand, visfatin knockdown by small interfering RNA led to the reduction of cell invasion. Our data demonstrate, for the first time, that curcumin down-regulates visfatin gene expression in human breast cancer cells by a mechanism that is, at least in part, NF-κB dependent and suggest that visfatin may contribute to breast cancer cell invasion and link obesity to breast cancer development and progression."

The PFKFB3 gene is extensively involved in cell proliferation owing to its key role in carbohydrate metabolism. In the present study we analyse its mechanism of regulation by progestins in breast cancer cells. We report that exposure of T47D cells to synthetic progestins (ORG2058 or norgestrel) leads to a rapid increase in Fru-2,6-P2 concentration. Our Western blot results are compatible with a short-term activation due to PFKFB3 isoenzyme phosphorylation and a long-term sustained action due to increased PFKFB3 protein levels. Transient transfection of T47D cells with deleted gene promoter constructs allowed us to identify a PRE (progesterone-response element) to which PR (progesterone receptor) binds and thus transactivates PFKFB3 gene transcription. PR expression in the PR-negative cell line MDA-MB-231 induces endogenous PFKFB3 expression in response to norgestrel. Direct binding of PR to the PRE box (-3490 nt) was confirmed by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipiation) experiments. A dual mechanism affecting PFKFB3 protein and gene regulation operates in order to assure glycolysis in breast cancer cells. An immediate early response through the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase)/RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase) pathway leading to phosphorylation of PFKFB3 on Ser461 is followed by activation of mRNA transcription via cis-acting sequences on the PFKFB3 promoter."

Vitamin D₃ and resveratrol improved the inhibitory effects of 2CdA and F-ara-A on PTEN methylation in MCF-7 cells; however, only the combined action of vitamin D₃ and 2CdA boosted the induction of PTEN expression, suggesting a cooperation of these compounds in additional processes driving changes in PTEN expression.

To understand the contribution of the extracellular matrix (ECM) environment to this phenomenon, we isolated ECM surrogate invading cell populations from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and studied their genotype and malignant phenotype.METHODS: We isolated invasive subpopulations (INV) from non invasive populations (REF) using a 2D-Matrigel assay, a surrogate of basal membrane passage. INV and REF populations were investigated by microarray assay and for their capacities to adhere, invade and transmigrate in vitro, and to form metastases in nude mice.RESULTS: REF and INV subpopulations were stable in culture and present different transcriptome profiles. INV cells were characterized by reduced expression of cell adhesion and cell-cell junction genes (44% of down regulated genes) and by a gain in expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic gene sets. In line with this observation, in vitro INV cells showed reduced adhesion and increased motility through endothelial monolayers and fibronectin. When injected into the circulation, INV cells induced metastases formation, and reduced injected mice survival by up to 80% as compared to REF cells. In nude mice, INV xenografts grew rapidly inducing vessel formation and displaying resistance to apoptosis.CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that the in vitro ECM microenvironment per se was sufficient to select for tumor cells with a stable metastatic phenotype in vivo characterized by loss of adhesion molecules expression and induction of pro-angiogenic and survival factors."

However, these cells were described to have profound effects on biological behaviour of tumour cells. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of adipose tissue-derived human mesenchymal stromal cells (AT-MSC) on the proliferation of breast cancer cells. We have tested proliferation of three different human breast cancer cell lines under the influence of AT-MSC derived soluble factors as well as in the direct cocultures. These data were supplemented with the expression analysis of cytokines and their cognate receptors on the target cells. We have observed stimulation of proliferation in breast cancer cells MDA-MB-361, T47D and EGFP-MCF7. AT-MSC were found to secrete wide scale of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, thus we concluded that this pro-proliferative effect was a result of their synergistic action. These data bring out a need to evaluate whether primary breast tumour derived human cells would respond to these type of stimuli in a similar manner in order to exclude any potential clinical risk related to the application of human mesenchymal stromal cells under the context of patient with history of breast cancer malignancy."

Previously, we described an Arabidopsis mutant with altered cold-responsive gene expression (acg1) displaying a late flowering phenotype, a null allele of fve. FVE is a homologue of the mammalian retinoblastoma-associated protein (RbAp), one component of a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex involved in transcriptional repression, and has been shown to be involved in the deacetylation of the FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) chromatin encoding for a repressor of flowering. In an effort to gain insight into the biochemical functions of FVE, we overexpressed FVE tagged with the hemagglutinin (HA) and FLAG epitope at the N-terminus in acg1 mutants. The results of physiological and molecular analyses demonstrated that FVE overexpression in acg1 rescued the mutant phenotypes, including late flowering and alterations in floral pathway gene expression such as FLC, SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO1 (SOC1), and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), and also super-induced cold-responsive reporter gene expression. The chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed the amplification of specific DNA regions of FLC and COLD-REGULATED 15A (COR15A), indicating that FVE may bind to the FLC and COR15A chromatin. Gel-filtration chromatography and the immunoprecipitation of putative FVE complexes showed that FVE forms a protein complex of approximately 1.0 MDa. These results demonstrate that FVE may exist as a multiprotein complex, similar to the mammalian HDAC complex harboring RbAp, to regulate flowering time and cold response by associating with the FLC and COR chromatin."

We examined whether repeated intake of excess energy in the form of HFHC meals alters reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes and mitochondrial proteins in mononuclear cells, and to determine whether this is associated with insulin resistance. We recruited healthy lean individuals (n 10). The individuals were divided into two groups: one group (n 5) ingested 10878·4 kJ/d (2600 kcal/d; 55-70 % carbohydrate, 9·5-16 % fat, 7-20 % protein) recommended by the Dietary Reference Intake for Koreans for 4 d and the other group (n 5) ingested a HFHC meal containing 14 644 kJ/d (3500 kcal/d). Then, measurements of blood insulin and glucose levels, together with suppressor of cytokine signalling-3 (SOCS-3) expression levels, were performed in both groups. Also, cellular and mitochondrial ROS levels as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. Expression levels of cytosolic and mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes, and mitochondrial complex proteins were analysed. Repeated intake of HFHC meals induced an increase in homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), together with an increase in SOCS-3 expression levels. While a single intake of the HFHC meal increased cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS, repeated intake of HFHC meals reduced them and increased the levels of MDA, cytosolic and mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes, and several mitochondrial complex proteins. Repeated intake of HFHC meals induced cellular antioxidant mechanisms, which in turn increased lipid peroxidation (MDA) and SOCS-3 expression levels, induced hyperinsulinaemia and increased HOMA-IR, an index of insulin resistance. In conclusion, excess energy added to a diet can generate detrimental effects in a short period."

A different pattern of protein expression was observed in MDA-MB-231 compared to MCF-7 cells determined by western blot, exhibiting the presence of a diverse range of molecular weight species of the H4R. H4R agonist reduced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation induced by forskolin only in MCF-7 cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, H4R agonists significantly decreased cell proliferation, augmented the Annexin-V and TdT-mediated UTP-biotin Nick End labelling (TUNEL) positive cells and produced a 2.5-fold increase in cell senescence. In MCF-7 cells, H4R agonists inhibited proliferation by 50%, increasing the exponential doubling time. This effect was associated to an augment in Annexin-V and TUNEL positive cells, and a 2-fold increase in cell senescence. We conclude that H4R is functionally expressed in human breast cancer cell lines, exhibiting a key role in histamine-mediated biological processes such as cell proliferation, senescence and apoptosis."

Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia inducible factor-1α is a transcriptional activator of DDX3 in breast cancer cells. Within the promoter region of the human DDX3 gene, we identified three putative hypoxia inducible factor-1 responsive elements. By luciferase reporter assays in combination with mutated hypoxia inducible factor-1 responsive elements, we determined that the hypoxia inducible factor-1 responsive element at position -153 relative to the translation start site is essential for transcriptional activation of DDX3 under hypoxic conditions. We also demonstrated that hypoxia inducible factor-1 binds to the DDX3 promoter and that the binding is specific, as revealed by siRNA against hypoxia inducible factor-1 and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Thus, the activation of DDX3 expression during hypoxia is due to the direct binding of hypoxia inducible factor-1 to hypoxia responsive elements in the DDX3 promoter. In addition, we observed a significant overlap in the protein expression pattern of hypoxia inducible factor-1α and DDX3 in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors. Taken together, our results demonstrate, for the first time, the role of DDX3 as a hypoxia-inducible gene that exhibits enhanced expression through the interaction of hypoxia inducible factor-1 with hypoxia inducible factor-1 responsive elements in its promoter region."

Whereas hypomethylation is found mainly in repeat sequences, regional hypermethylation has been linked to the transcriptional silencing of certain tumor suppressor genes. We attempted to search for candidate genes involved in breast/prostate carcinogenesis, using the criteria that they should be expressed in primary cultures of normal breast/prostate epithelial cells but are frequently downregulated in breast/prostate cancer cell lines and that their promoters are hypermethylated.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified several dozens of candidates among 194 homeobox and related genes using Systematic Multiplex RT-PCR and among 23,000 known genes and 23,000 other expressed sequences in the human genome by DNA microarray hybridization. An additional examination, by real-time qRT-PCR of clinical specimens of breast cancer, further narrowed the list of the candidates. Among them, the most frequently downregulated genes in tumors were NP_775756 and ZNF537, from the homeobox gene search and the genome-wide search, respectively. To our surprise, we later discovered that these genes belong to the same gene family, the 3-member Teashirt family, bearing the new names of TSHZ2 and TSHZ3. We subsequently determined the methylation status of their gene promoters. The TSHZ3 gene promoter was found to be methylated in all the breast/prostate cancer cell lines and some of the breast cancer clinical specimens analyzed. The TSHZ2 gene promoter, on the other hand, was unmethylated except for the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. The TSHZ1 gene was always expressed, and its promoter was unmethylated in all cases.SIGNIFICANCE: TSHZ2 and TSHZ3 genes turned out to be the most interesting candidates for novel tumor suppressor genes. Expression of both genes is downregulated. However, differential promoter methylation suggests the existence of distinctive mechanisms of transcriptional inactivation for these genes."

Here we investigated a novel protein, FKBPL, and peptide derivative for their antiangiogenic activity and mechanism of action.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Recombinant FKBPL (rFKBPL) and its peptide derivative were assessed in a range of human microvascular endothelial cell (HMEC-1) assays in vitro. Their ability to inhibit proliferation, migration, and Matrigel-dependent tubule formation was determined. They were further evaluated in an ex vivo rat model of neovascularization and in two in vivo mouse models of angiogenesis, that is, the sponge implantation and the intravital microscopy models. Antitumor efficacy was determined in two human tumor xenograft models grown in severe compromised immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Finally, the dependence of peptide on CD44 was determined using a CD44-targeted siRNA approach or in cell lines of differing CD44 status.RESULTS: rFKBPL inhibited endothelial cell migration, tubule formation, and microvessel formation in vitro and in vivo. The region responsible for FKBPL's antiangiogenic activity was identified, and a 24-amino acid peptide (AD-01) spanning this sequence was synthesized. It was potently antiangiogenic and inhibited growth in two human tumor xenograft models (DU145 and MDA-231) when administered systemically, either on its own or in combination with docetaxel. The antiangiogenic activity of FKBPL and AD-01 was dependent on the cell-surface receptor CD44, and signaling downstream of this receptor promoted an antimigratory phenotype.CONCLUSION: FKBPL and its peptide derivative AD-01 have potent antiangiogenic activity. Thus, these agents offer the potential of an attractive new approach to antiangiogenic therapy."

Particularly breast cancers, which do not express estrogen and progesterone receptors and which have no overexpression/amplification of the HER2-neu gene, so called triple-negative breast cancers, are considered as very aggressive and possess a bad prognosis. About 60% of all human breast cancers and about 74% of triple-negative breast cancers express receptors for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which might be used as a therapeutic target. Recently, we could show that bone-directed invasion of human breast cancer cells in vitro is time- and dose-dependently reduced by GnRH analogs. In the present study, we have analyzed whether GnRH analogs are able to reduce metastases of triple-negative breast cancers in vivo. In addition, we have evaluated the effects of GnRH analogs on tumor growth. To quantify formation of metastasis by triple-negative MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancers, we used a real-time PCR method based on detection of human-specific alu sequences measuring accurately the amount of human tumor DNA in athymic mouse organs. To analyze tumor growth, the volumes of breast cancer xenotransplants into nude mice were measured. We could demonstrate that GnRH analogs significantly reduced metastasis formation by triple-negative breast cancer in vivo. In addition, we could show that GnRH analogs significantly inhibited the growth of breast cancer into nude mice. Side effects were not detectable. In conclusion, GnRH analogs seem to be suitable drugs for an efficacious therapy for triple-negative, GnRH receptor-positive human breast cancers to prevent metastasis formation."

However many types of solid cancer cells are resistant to ABT-737. One practical approach to improve its therapeutic efficacy is to combine with the agents that can overcome such resistance to restore the sensitivity. In the present study, a second-generation selenium compound methylseleninic acid (MSeA) synergistically sensitized MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, HT-29 human colon cancer cells and DU145 human prostate cancer cells to apoptosis induction by ABT-737, as evidenced by greater than additive enhancement of Annexin V/FITC positive (apoptotic) cells and activation of multiple caspases and PARP cleavage. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that MSeA significantly decreased basal Mcl-1 expression and ABT-737-induced Mcl-1 expression. Knocking down of Mcl-1 with RNAi approach supported the functional significance of this molecular target. More importantly, we identified inactivation of Bad by phosphorylation on ser-136 and ser-112 as a novel mechanism involved in ABT-737 resistance, which can be overcome by combining with MSeA. In addition, we found that expression of Bax was required for the efficient execution of synergistic sensitization. Our findings, for the first time, provide a strong mechanistic rationale for developing MSeA as a novel sensitizing agent of ABT-737."

The nature of extranuclear estrogen elements has not been elucidated so far; classical or alternatively transcribed ER isoforms (ERα36, ERα46) anchored to the plasma membrane and GPR30 (GPER1) have been reported to exert early estrogen actions. Here, we used E2-BSA, an impermeable estradiol analog for a transcriptome analysis in four GREP1 positive breast cancer cell lines with different estrogen receptor profiles (T47D, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3) in order to evaluate GPER1 transcriptional effects. Early effects of E2-BSA were assayed after 3h of incubation, in the absence/presence of ICI182,780 (ER-inhibitor) or G15 (GREP1-specific inhibitor). E2-BSA specifically modified 277-549 transcripts in the different cell lines. Two different clusters of transcripts could be identified: (1) the majority of transcripts were inhibited by both ICI182,780 and G15, suggesting an interaction of E2-BSA with a common ER-related element, or a direct ER-GPER1 interaction; (2) a small number of G15-only modified transcripts, in two cell lines (T47D and SKBR3 cells), indicative of specific GPER1-related effects. The latter transcripts were significantly related to pathways including FOXA2/FOXA3 transcription factor networks, RNA-Polymerases Transcription Regulation and lipid metabolism, while ICI/G15 inhibited transcripts affected pathways related to apoptosis, erythropoietin signaling, metabolic effects through the citric acid cycle, IL-4 and IL-5 mediated events and homologous DNA recombination. Finally, we review the current literature of GPER1 actions, in view of our results of ER-dependent and independent GPER1-modified pathways."

Cancer cells adapt their metabolism by activating hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that promote the transcription of genes involved in processes such as cell survival, drug resistance and metastasis. HIF-1 is also induced in an oxygen-independent manner through the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of invasive breast cancer characterized by negative expression of hormonal and HER2 receptors, and this subtype generally overexpresses EGFR. Sensitivity to three EGFR inhibitors (cetuximab, gefitinib and lapatinib, an HER2/EGFR-TK inhibitor) was evaluated in a metastatic TNBC cell model (MDA-MB-231), and the impact of these drugs on the activity and stability of HIF was assessed.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MDA-MB-231 cells were genetically modified to stably express an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) induced by hypoxia; the Ca9-GFP cell model reports HIF activity, whereas GFP-P564 reports HIF stability. The reporter signal was monitored by flow cytometry. HIF-1 DNA-binding activity, cell migration and viability were also evaluated in response to EGFR inhibitors. Cell fluorescence signals strongly increased under hypoxic conditions (&gt; 30-fold). Cetuximab and lapatinib did not affect the signal induced by hypoxia, whereas gefitinib sharply reduced its intensity in both cell models and also diminished HIF-1 alpha levels and HIF-1 DNA-binding activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. This gefitinib feature was associated with its ability to inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell migration and to induce cell mortality in a dose-dependent manner. Cetuximab and lapatinib had no effect on cell migration or cell viability.CONCLUSION: Resistance to cetuximab and lapatinib and sensitivity to gefitinib were associated with their ability to modulate HIF activity and stability. In conclusion, downregulation of HIF-1 through EGFR signaling seems to be required for the induction of a positive response to EGFR-targeted therapies in TNBC."

We characterized β-cell function in 4-month-old (young), 14-month-old (adult), and 24-month-old (old) male Wistar rats, and found that islet β-cell function decreased gradually with age. Old rats displayed oral glucose intolerance and exhibited a decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin release (GSIR) and palmitic acid-stimulated insulin release (PSIR). Furthermore, total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity decreased, whereas serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased in the older rats. Moreover, we detected a significant reduction in β-cell proliferation and an increase in the frequency of apoptotic β-cells in the islets of rats in the old group.

Despite the remarkable success of mammography screening and use of adjuvant systemic therapy, it is estimated that approximately 200,000 new diagnoses will be made this year and 40,000 deaths will occur due to this disease (American Cancer Society). Angiogenesis, the growth of vessels from pre-existing microvasculature, is an essential component of tumor progression and has emerged as a therapeutic modality for anti-angiogenic therapies in cancer. Here we report in vitro and in vivo findings with a 20 amino acid peptide belonging to the collagen IV family, modified to facilitate possible translation to clinical applications. The two cysteines in its natural peptide progenitor were replaced by L-α-amino-n-butyric acid, a non-natural amino acid. The modified peptide was tested in vitro using endothelial cells and in vivo using mouse orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model with MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. This modified peptide demonstrated no significant changes in activity from the parent peptide; however, because it lacks cysteines, it is more suitable for clinical translation. We also investigated its efficacy in combination with a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel; the inhibition of tumor growth by the peptide was similar to that of paclitaxel alone, but the combination did not exhibit any additional inhibition. We have performed further characterization of the mechanism of action (MOA) for this peptide to identify its target receptors, enhancing its translation potential as an anti-angiogenic, non-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting agent for therapy in breast cancer."

Recent studies have shown the elevated expression levels of TfR on cancer cells compared with normal cells. The elevated expression levels of this receptor in malignancies, which is the accessible extracellular protein, can be a fascinating target for the treatment of cancer. We have recently designed novel type of immunotoxin, termed &quot;hybrid peptide&quot;, which is chemically synthesized and is composed of target-binding peptide and lytic peptide containing cationic-rich amino acids components that disintegrates the cell membrane for the cancer cell killing. The lytic peptide is newly designed to induce rapid killing of cancer cells due to conformational change. In this study, we designed TfR binding peptide connected with this novel lytic peptide and assessed the cytotoxic activity in vitro and in vivo.METHODS: In vitro: We assessed the cytotoxicity of TfR-lytic hybrid peptide for 12 cancer and 2 normal cell lines. The specificity for TfR is demonstrated by competitive assay using TfR antibody and siRNA. In addition, we performed analysis of confocal fluorescence microscopy and apoptosis assay by Annexin-V binding, caspase activity, and JC-1 staining to assess the change in mitochondria membrane potential. In vivo: TfR-lytic was administered intravenously in an athymic mice model with MDA-MB-231 cells. After three weeks tumor sections were histologically analyzed.RESULTS: The TfR-lytic hybrid peptide showed cytotoxic activity in 12 cancer cell lines, with IC(50) values as low as 4.0-9.3 μM. Normal cells were less sensitive to this molecule, with IC(50) values &gt; 50 μM. Competition assay using TfR antibody and knockdown of this receptor by siRNA confirmed the specificity of the TfR-lytic hybrid peptide. In addition, it was revealed that this molecule can disintegrate the cell membrane of T47D cancer cells just in 10 min, to effectively kill these cells and induce approximately 80% apoptotic cell death but not in normal cells. The intravenous administration of TfR-lytic peptide in the athymic mice model significantly inhibited tumor progression.CONCLUSIONS: TfR-lytic peptide might provide a potent and selective anticancer therapy for patients."

In the case of TGF-β, down-regulation of CAR occurred in context of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with transcriptional repression of E-cadherin by, for instance, the E2 box-binding factors Snail, Slug, SIP1 or ZEB1. While EMT is crucial in embryonic development, it has been proposed to contribute to the formation of invasive and metastatic carcinomas by reducing cell-cell contacts and increasing cell migration.RESULTS: Here, we show that ZEB1 represses CAR expression in both PANC-1 (pancreatic) and MDA-MB-231 (breast) human cancer cells. We demonstrate that ZEB1 physically associates with at least one of two closely spaced and conserved E2 boxes within the minimal CAR promoter here defined as genomic region -291 to -1 relative to the translational start ATG. In agreement with ZEB1's established role as a negative regulator of the epithelial phenotype, silencing its expression in MDA-MB-231 cells induced a partial Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition (MET) characterized by increased levels of E-cadherin and CAR, and decreased expression of fibronectin. Conversely, knockdown of ZEB1 in PANC-1 cells antagonized both the TGF-β-induced down-regulation of E-cadherin and CAR and the reduction of adenovirus uptake. Interestingly, even though ZEB1 clearly contributes to the TGF-β-induced mesenchymal phenotype of PANC-1 cells, TGF-β did not seem to affect ZEB1's protein levels or subcellular localization. These findings suggest that TGF-β may inhibit CAR expression by regulating factor(s) that cooperate with ZEB1 to repress the CAR promoter, rather than by regulating ZEB1 expression levels. In addition to the negative E2 box-mediated regulation the minimal CAR promoter is positively regulated through conserved ETS and CRE elements.CONCLUSIONS: This report provides evidence that inhibition of ZEB1 may improve adenovirus uptake of cancer cells that have undergone EMT and for which ZEB1 is necessary to maintain the mesenchymal phenotype. Targeting of ZEB1 may reverse some aspects of EMT including the down-regulation of CAR."

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) mediates inflammation and immunity, and MIF overexpression is observed in breast cancer. We hypothesized that the HLA class I of cancerous breast epithelial cells would present MIF-derived peptides. Consistent with this hypothesis, the peptide FLSELTQQL (MIF(19-27)) was eluted from the HLA-A*0201 (HLA-A2) of breast cancer cell lines. We posited that if this MIF(19-27)/HLA-A2 complex was exclusively found in invasive breast cancer, it could be a useful prognostic indicator. To assess the presentation of MIF peptides by the HLA of various cells and tissues, mice were immunized with the MIF(19-27)/HLA-A2 complex. The resulting mAb (RL21A) stained invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) but not ductal carcinoma in situ, fibroadenoma, or normal breast tissues. RL21A did not stain WBCs (total WBCs) or normal tissues from deceased HLA-A2 donors, substantiating the tumor-specific nature of this MIF/HLA complex. As this MIF/HLA complex appeared specific to the surface of IDC, RL21A was tested as an immunotherapeutic for breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, RL21A killed the MDA-MB-231 cell line via complement and induction of apoptosis. In an in vivo orthotopic mouse model, administration of RL21A reduced MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 tumor burden by 5-fold and by &gt;2-fold, respectively. In summary, HLA-presented MIF peptides show promise as prognostic cell surface indicators for IDC and as targets for immunotherapeutic intervention."

This study has utilized a proteomic approach integrating 2D-DIGE, LC-MS/MS, and bioinformatics to analyze the proteome of breast cancer (ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-231) and breast epithelial (MCF-10A) cell lines induced to undergo apoptosis using a combination of doxorubicin and TRAIL administered in sequence (Dox-TRAIL). Apoptosis induction was confirmed using a caspase-3 activity assay. Comparative proteomic analysis between whole cell lysates of Dox-TRAIL and control samples revealed 56 differentially expressed spots (≥2-fold change and p &lt; 0.05) common to at least two cell lines. Of these, 19 proteins were identified yielding 11 unique protein identities: CFL1, EIF5A, HNRNPK, KRT8, KRT18, LMNA, MYH9, NACA, RPLP0, RPLP2, and RAD23B. A subset of the identified proteins was validated by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and Western blotting. Pathway analysis revealed that the differentially abundant proteins were associated with cell death, cellular organization, integrin-linked kinase signaling, and actin cytoskeleton signaling pathways. The 2D-DIGE analysis has yielded candidate biomarkers of response to treatment in breast cancer cell models. Their clinical utility will depend on validation using patient breast biopsies pre- and post-treatment with anticancer drugs."

In this study, we define the CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to Mam-A-derived candidate epitopes presented in the context of HLA-A24 (A*2402). HLA-A24 has a frequency of 72% in Japanese, 27% in Asian Indian, and 18% in Caucasian populations. Using a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-binding prediction algorithm we identified 7 HLA-A24-restricted Mam-A-derived candidate epitopes (MAA24.1-7). Membrane stabilization studies with TAP-deficient T2 cells transfected with HLA-A2402 (T2.A24) indicated that MAA24.2 (CYAGSGCPL) and MAA24.4 (ETLSNVEVF) have the highest HLA-A24 binding affinity. Further, 2 CD8(+) CTL cell lines generated in vitro against T2.A24 cells individually loaded with Mam-A-derived candidate epitopes demonstrated significant cytotoxic activity against MAA24.2 and MAA24.4. In addition, the same CD8(+) CTL lines lysed the HLA-A24(+)/Mam-A(+) stable transfected human breast cancer cell lines AU565 and MDA-MB-361. However, these CTLs had no cytotoxicity against HLA-A24(-)/Mam-A(+) and HLA-A24(+)/Mam-A(-) breast cancer cell lines. In summary, our results define HLA-A24-restricted, Mam-A-derived, CD8(+) CTL epitopes that can potentially be employed for Mam-A-based breast cancer vaccine therapy to breast cancer patients with HLA-A24 phenotype."

We have already shown that Cd exerts a cytotoxic effect on neoplastic MDA-MB231 cells from the human breast, which is characterized by the onset of a &quot;non-classical&quot; apoptotic kind of death, impairment of mitochondrial activity and drastic changes in gene expression pattern. In the present study, employing a combination of conventional and differential display-PCR techniques, immunocytochemical, ELISA and Western analyses, we extended the knowledge on the transcriptional modulation exerted by the metal demonstrating that in MDA-MB231 cells 5 μM CdCl(2) treatment for 96 h selectively down-regulates astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) and reduces the accumulation of its protein product which appears to be associated with the internal cytomembranes and also present in the nucleoplasm. In addition, due to the acknowledged role of AEG-1 in the intranuclear shuttling of NF-κB p65 subunit, we also showed that CdCl(2) treatment determines the decrease of p65 amount in nuclear extracts and the down-regulation of the NF-κB downstream genes c-fos and c-jun, thus providing a new contribution to the comprehension of the intracellular molecular mechanisms implicated in Cd-breast cancer cell interactions."

Trx-1 augmented MMP-9 transcription through NF-κB, AP-1 and SP1 elements; stimulated p50/p65 NF-κB activity and recruitment to the MMP-9 promoter; and facilitated MMP-9 promoter-accessibility to NF-κB by preventing HDAC recruitment and maintaining MMP-9 promoter histone acetylation.

IPNV is represented by multiple strains with markedly different virulence. Comparison of isolates reveals hyper variable regions (HVR), which are presumably associated with pathogenicity. However little is known about the rates and modes of sequence divergence and molecular mechanisms that determine virulence. Also how the host response may influence IPNV virulence is poorly described.METHODS: In this study we compared two field isolates of IPNV (NFH-Ar and NFH-El). The sequence changes, replication and mortality were assessed following experimental challenge of Atlantic salmon. Gene expression analyses with qPCR and microarray were applied to examine the immune responses in head kidney.RESULTS: Significant differences in mortality were observed between the two isolates, and viral load in the pancreas at 13 days post infection (d p.i.) was more than 4 orders of magnitude greater for NFH-Ar in comparison with NFH-El. Sequence comparison of five viral genes from the IPNV isolates revealed different mutation rates and Ka/Ks ratios. A strong tendency towards non-synonymous mutations was found in the HRV of VP2 and in VP3. All mutations in VP5 produced precocious stop codons. Prior to the challenge, NFH-Ar and NFH-El possessed high and low virulence motifs in VP2, respectively. Nucleotide substitutions were noticed already during passage of viruses in CHSE-214 cells and their accumulation continued in the challenged fish. The sequence changes were notably directed towards low virulence. Co-ordinated activation of anti-viral genes with diverse functions (IFN-a1 and c, sensors - Rig-I, MDA-5, TLR8 and 9, signal transducers - Srk2, MyD88, effectors - Mx, galectin 9, galectin binding protein, antigen presentation - b2-microglobulin) was observed at 13 d p.i. (NFH-Ar) and 29 d p.i. (both isolates).CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and expression levels of the immune genes were directly related to the rate of viral replication, which was in turn associated with sequences of viral genes. Rapid changes in the viral genome that dramatically reduced virus proliferation might indicate a higher susceptibility to protective mechanism employed by the host. Disease outbreak and mortality depend on a delicate balance between host defence, regulation of signalling cascades and virus genomic properties."

TEM8 antagonists and TEM8-targeted delivery of toxins have been developed as effective cancer therapeutics. The ability to image TEM8 expression would be of use in evaluating TEM8-targeted cancer therapy.METHODS: A 13-meric peptide, KYNDRLPLYISNP (QQM), identified from the small loop in domain IV of protective antigen of anthrax toxin was evaluated for TEM8 binding and labeled with 18F for small-animal PET imaging in both UM-SCC1 head-and-neck cancer and MDA-MB-435 melanoma models.RESULTS: A modified ELISA showed that QQM peptide bound specifically to the extracellular vWA domain of TEM8 with an IC50 value of 304 nM. Coupling 4-nitrophenyl 2-(18)F-fluoropropionate with QQM gave almost quantitative yield and a high specific activity (79.2±7.4 TBq/mmol, n=5) of 18F-FP-QQM at the end of synthesis. 18F-FP-QQM showed predominantly renal clearance and had significantly higher accumulation in TEM8 high-expressing UM-SCC1 tumors (2.96±0.84 %ID/g at 1 h after injection) than TEM8 low-expressing MDA-MB-435 tumors (1.38±0.56 %ID/g at 1 h after injection).CONCLUSION: QQM peptide bound specifically to the extracellular domain of TEM8. 18F-FP-QQM peptide tracer would be a promising lead compound for measuring TEM8 expression. Further efforts to improve the affinity and specificity of the tracer and to increase its metabolic stability are warranted."

In the present study we aimed to investigate whether ginsenoside Rb1, a major constituent of ginseng, protects endothelial cells from H(2)O(2)-induced endothelial senescence. While H(2)O(2) induced premature senescent-like phenotype of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), as judged by increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, enlarged, flattened cell morphology and sustained growth arrest, our results demonstrated that Rb1 protected endothelial cells from oxidative stress induced senescence. Mechanistically, we found that Rb1 could markedly increase intracellular superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD/SOD1) activity and decrease the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in H(2)O(2)-treated HUVECs, and suppress the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistent with these findings, Rb1 could effectively restore the protein expression of Cu/Zn SOD, which was down-regulated in H(2)O(2) treated cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Rb1 exhibits antioxidant effects and antagonizes H(2)O(2)-induced cellular senescence."

Telomerase-driven expression of the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) in tumor cells has been successfully used as a reporter gene in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the NIS-mediated therapeutic effect of telomerase promoters in a wide variety of human cancer cell lines.DESIGN AND METHODS: Promoter fragments from either hTERT or hTR were used to drive the expression of NIS in cell lines derived from melanoma (M14), breast (MDA-MB-231), colon (HT-29), lung (H460), ovarian (OVCAR-3), and thyroid (TPC-1) carcinomas. Iodide uptake assays, protein immunodetection, and clonigenic assays were used to confirm NIS functional expression and the (131)I-mediated cytopathic effect. Tumor xenografts in mice were infected with hTERT and hTR and then treated using radioiodide.RESULTS: Both promoters were selectively active in cancer cells that were effectively killed by exposure to (131)I. One single dose of 1 mCi (131)I markedly suppressed tumor growth of melanoma-derived tumor xenografts compared with controls. This effect was more modest in colon cancer-derived xenografts in part due to the reduced infectivity and the tumor cystic nature. The therapeutic effect of hTR promoter was found to be stronger than that of hTERT promoter.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that telomerase-driven expression of NIS could potentially have applications for (131)I therapy of a wide variety of cancers. Additionally, this is the first study to report NIS-mediated (131)I therapy of melanoma tumors in vivo."

We have investigated the role of MBD2 in breast cancer cell growth and tumor suppressor gene expression. We show that stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of MBD2 leads to growth suppression of cultured human mammary epithelial cancer lines, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435. The peak antiproliferative occurs only after sustained, stable MBD2 knockdown. Once established, the growth inhibition persists over time and leads to a markedly decreased propensity for aggressive breast cancer cell lines to form in vivo xenograft tumors in Bagg Albino (BALB)/C nu/nu mice. The growth effects of MBD2 knockdown are accompanied by derepression of tumor suppressor genes, including DAPK1 and KLK10. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and bisulfite sequencing show MBD2 binding directly to the hyper methylated and CpG-rich promoters of both DAPK1 and KLK10. Remarkably, the promoter CpG island-associated methylation of these genes remained stable despite robust transcriptional activation in MBD2 knockdown cells. Expression of a shRNA-resistant MBD2 protein resulted in restoration of growth and resilencing of the MBD2-dependent tumor suppressor genes. Our data suggest that uncoupling CpG methylation from repressive chromatin remodeling and histone modifications by removing MBD2 is sufficient to initiate and maintain tumor suppressor gene transcription and suppress neoplastic cell growth. These results show a role for MBD2 in cancer progression and provide support for the prospect of targeting MBD2 therapeutically in aggressive breast cancers."

However, whether Cdc42 plays similar role in all cancer cells irrespective of metastatic potential remains poorly defined. Here, we show by using three different breast cancer cell lines with different metastatic potential, the role of Cdc42 in cell migration/invasion and its relationship with a number of downstream signaling pathways controlling cell migration. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Cdc42 in two highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and C3L5) resulted in enhancement, whereas the same in moderately metastatic (Hs578T) cell line resulted in inhibition of intrinsic cellular migration/invasion. Furthermore, Cdc42 silencing in MDA-MB-231 and C3L5 but not Hs578T cells was shown to be accompanied by increased RhoA activity and phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC)-δ, extracellular signal regulated kinase1/2 (Erk1/2), and protein kinase A (PKA). Pharmacological inhibition of PKCδ, MEK-Erk1/2, or PKA was shown to inhibit migration of both control and Cdc42-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, introduction of constitutively active Cdc42 was shown to decrease migration/invasion of MDA-MB-231 and C3L5 but increase migration/invasion of Hs578T cells. This decreased migration/invasion of MDA-MB-231 and C3L5 cells was also shown to be accompanied by the decrease in the phosphorylations of PKCδ, Erk1/2, and PKA. These results suggested that endogenous Cdc42 could exert a negative regulatory influence on intrinsic migration/invasion and some potentially relevant changes in phosphorylation of PKCδ, Erk1/2, and PKA of some aggressive breast cancer cells."

GIPC1 is highly expressed in a number of human malignancies, including breast, ovarian, gastric, and pancreatic cancers. Suppression of GIPC1 in human pancreatic cancer cells inhibits in vivo tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. To better understand GIPC1 function, we suppressed its expression in human breast and colorectal cancer cell lines and human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and assayed both gene expression and cellular phenotype. Suppression of GIPC1 promotes apoptosis in MCF-7, MDA-MD231, SKBR-3, SW480, and SW620 cells and impairs anchorage-independent colony formation of HMECs. These observations indicate GIPC1 plays an essential role in oncogenic transformation, and its expression is necessary for the survival of human breast and colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, a GIPC1 knock-down gene signature was used to interrogate publically available breast and ovarian cancer microarray datasets. This GIPC1 signature statistically correlates with a number of breast and ovarian cancer phenotypes and clinical outcomes, including patient survival.

Ovatodiolide, a bioactive cembrane-type diterpenoid isolated from Anisomeles indica (L.) Kuntze (Labiatae), has been shown to inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. However, the anti-metastatic effects of ovatodiolide on highly metastatic human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells remain unclear. In this study, we first noted that ovatodiolide inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion by wound-healing assay and Boyden chamber assay. Western blot, gelatin zymography and reversed transcription-PCR analysis showed that ovatodiolide significantly and selectively suppressed the expression, activation, and mRNA of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in a concentration-dependent manner. Ovatodiolide significantly decreased the nuclear level of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB), increased inhibitor of kappaBα (IκBα) through preventing phosphorylation of upstream signal IκB kinase (IKK). Pretreatment with a specific NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC) and an IκB protease inhibitor (TPCK) also reduced MMP-9 activity, cell migration and cell invasion. Moreover, ovatodiolide can suppress activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, while it did not affect phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulating kinases (ERK)1/2. Additionally, the treatment of inhibitors specific for PI3K (wortmannin), JNK (SP600125) or p38 MAPK (SB203580) to MDA-MB-231 cells could result in a reduced activation of MMP-9, concomitantly with a marked inhibition on cell migration and invasion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ovatodiolide inhibits the metastatic ability of MDA-MB-231 cells by reducing MMP-9 activity through suppressing JNK, p38 MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and inhibiting NF-κB activity. These results are the first to reveal the function of ovatodiolide in tumor metastasis and its underlying molecular mechanism, thus suggesting ovatodiolide to be a promising antimetastatic agent."

The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that p53 protein binds to both unmethylated CpG island of the ESR1 promoter in the ER-positive MCF-7 and the hypermethylated ESR1 promoter in the ER-negative MDA-MB-468 cells. However, repression complex including DNMT1, HDAC1 and MeCP2 is only associated with silenced ESR1 in ER-negative MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells. In addition, ectopically expressed wild type p53 failed to reactivate the ESR1 gene in these cells.

Lacking of such ideal model makes it difficult to study the whole process or accurate mechanism of each step of this metastatic disease. Development of xenograft mouse models has made great contributions in this area. Currently, the best animal model of breast cancer metastasizing to bone is NOD/SCID-hu models containing human bone, which makes it possible to let the breast cancer cells and the bone target of osteotropic metastasis be both of human origin. We have developed a novel mouse model containing both human bone and breast, and proved it functional and reliable.

Inhibitors of these enzymes are becoming potential targets for new therapies.METHODS AND RESULTS: This study reports by Western-Blot analysis, that peptide lunasin is mainly an in vitro inhibitor of histone H4 acetylation by P300/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP)-associated factor (PCAF), with IC₅₀ values dependent on the lysine position sensitive to be acetylated (0.83 μM (H4-Lys 8), 1.27 μM (H4-Lys 12) and 0.40 μM (H4-Lys 5, 8, 12, 16)). Lunasin is also capable of inhibiting H3 acetylation (IC₅₀ of 5.91 μM (H3-Lys 9) and 7.81 μM (H3-Lys 9, 14)). Studies on structure-activity relationship establish that lunasin's sequence are essential for inhibiting H4 acetylation whereas poly-D sequence is the main active sequence responsible for H3 acetylation inhibition. Lunasin also inhibits H3 and H4 acetylation and cell proliferation (IC₅₀ of 181 μM) in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, this peptide decreases expression of cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases-4 and -6, implicated in cell cycle pathways.CONCLUSION: Results from this study demonstrates lunasin's role as modulator of histone acetylation and protein expression that might contribute on its chemopreventive properties against breast cancer."

These data demonstrate that there is a fine balance between CCNL1 and TIMP1, which may contribute to breast cancer development."

However, ACC-HGT can also undergo transformation to adenocarcinomas which are not poorly differentiated. ACC-HGT is generally considered to be an aggressive variant of ACC, even more than solid ACC. This study was aimed to describe the genetic changes of ACC-HGT in relation to clinico-pathological features, and to compare results to solid ACC.METHODS: Genome wide DNA copy number changes were analyzed by microarray CGH in ACC-HGT, four with transformation into moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (MDA) and two into poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC), and five solid ACC. In addition, Ki67 index and p53 immunopositivity was assessed.RESULTS: ACC-HGT carried fewer copy number changes compared to solid ACC. Two ACC-HGT cases harboured a breakpoint at 6q23, near the cMYB oncogene. The complexity of the genomic profile concurred with the clinical course of the patient. Among the ACC-HGT, p53 positivity significantly increased from the conventional to the transformed (both MDA and PDC) component.CONCLUSION: ACC-HGT may not necessarily reflect a more advanced stage of tumor progression, but rather a transformation to another histological form in which the poorly differentiated forms (PDC) presents a genetic complexity similar to the solid ACC."

In the present study, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) expression in cancer cells was silenced with mTOR-siRNA (simTOR) formulated in TEPA-PCL modified with Ala-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly (APRPG), a peptide having affinity for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1). We investigated the effects of inhibition of mTOR, focusing on the differences between cells treated with simTOR and those with rapamycin in terms of Akt (ser473) phosphorylation and antiproliferative effects. Rapamycin treatment is known to induce Akt (ser473) phosphorylation which attenuates the antiproliferative effects of rapamycin. As a result, knockdown of mTOR did not alter or only slightly reduced Akt (ser473) phosphorylation in phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN)-null (LNCaP and MDA-MB-468 cells) and PTEN-positive (DU 145 and MDA-MB-231) cells, although rapamycin induced Akt (ser473) phosphorylation of these cells. Rapamycin suppressed the growth of PTEN-null cells, in which the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is excessively activated. On the other hand, rapamycin did not suppress the growth of PTEN-positive cells possibly through a negative feedback mechanism via the rapamycin-insensitive mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling pathway. In contrast, simTOR significantly suppressed the growth of cancer cells regardless of the presence of PTEN, possibly through inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. These results indicate that mTOR knockdown using APRPG-TEPA-PCL/simTOR is likely to be an effective strategy for cancer siRNA therapy."

The activation of benzo(a)pyrene (BP), a model compound of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, to its genotoxic BP-diolepoxide (BPDE) and p53 response and cell viability after BP exposure, and the p53 status in these cell lines were analyzed. Both TP53 (exons 5-8) mutations and total and phospho-p53 were analyzed. Three of the four cell lines clearly activated BP to BPDE-DNA adducts (MDA-MB-468, T47-D, ZR-75-1) and three had a mutation in the TP53 gene (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, T47-D). After BP-treatment the strongest p53 protein induction and phosphorylation at serine 392 was found in ZR-75-1 cells with a wt TP53 gene. Viability decreased dramatically only in ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-468 cells although the relative cell number was reduced in all the cell lines suggesting that BP affects cell proliferation. In conclusion, a TP53 mutation does not necessarily lead to a loss of p53 protein response.

We investigated the effects of Troglitazone (TGZ), Ciglitazone (CGZ), Rosiglitazone (RGZ) and, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ(2)) on the hormone-dependent breast cancer cell line MCF7. The early transcription factor EGR1 (Early Growth Response gene 1) mRNA and protein levels peaked after 3h of incubation with 25μM TGZ, CGZ or 15d-PGJ(2) and then gradually decreased. RGZ, the most potent activator of PPARγ, did not show this effect. The PPARγ antagonist GW 9662 did not block EGR1 mRNA induction which also still occurred in case of PPARγ silencing as well as in case of treatment with the PPARγ-inactive compound Δ2-TGZ. EGR1 mRNA induction required ERK1/2 phosphorylation which was not blocked by EGF Receptor (EGFR) inhibition. The ERK1/2 pathway was also involved in Δ2-TGZ-induced EGR1 mRNA expression in the hormone-independent breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Using the fluorescent dye Fura2, we showed in MCF7 that TGZ or Δ2-TGZ induced an immediate increase in cytosolic calcium which was required for ERK1/2 phosphorylation and EGR1 mRNA induction as demonstrated by calcium chelation experiments. Furthermore, in MCF7 transfected with siRNA targeting EGR1, Δ2-TGZ inhibited less efficiently cell proliferation."

OPN contains two integrin-binding sites and a thrombin cleavage domain located in close proximity to each other.METHODS: To study the role of the thrombin cleavage site of OPN, MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells were stably transfected with either wildtype OPN (468-OPN), mutant OPN lacking the thrombin cleavage domain (468-ΔTC) or an empty vector (468-CON) and assessed for in vitro and in vivo functional differences in malignant/metastatic behavior.RESULTS: All three cell lines were found to equivalently express thrombin, tissue factor, CD44, αvβ5 integrin and β1 integrin. Relative to 468-OPN and 468-CON cells, 468-ΔTC cells expressing OPN with a deleted thrombin cleavage domain demonstrated decreased cell adhesion (p &lt; 0.001), decreased mRNA expression of MCAM, maspin and TRAIL (p &lt; 0.01), and increased uPA expression and activity (p &lt; 0.01) in vitro.

However, its molecular mechanism is not thoroughly understood on breast cancer cells known to highly express intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) for their adhesion and metastasis. This study aims to investigate the effect of gossypol on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-stimulated ICAM-1 via nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activity. Gossypol was shown to inhibit TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression and U937 cell adhesion to MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Additionally, TNF-α-induced MDA-MB-231 cell invasion was blocked in the presence of gossypol. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that gossypol blocks NF-κB binding on the ICAM-1 promoter regions. Additionally, TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation was completely suppressed in the presence of gossypol. Gossypol did not directly suppress the binding of NF-κB to the DNA but rather inhibited the nuclear translocation of p65 and p50 via phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. We also found that gossypol suppresses NF-κB activation induced by a wide variety of agents, including taxol, okadaic acid, and phorbol myristate acetate. Taken together, gossypol effectively inhibited TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression via the suppression of NF-κB activation and in vitro adhesion and invasion in human breast cancer cells."

Despite the many advantages provided by PGD, there are several problems, including amplification failure, allele drop-out and amplification inefficiency. We evaluated multiple displacement amplification (MDA) for PGD of the fragile X syndrome. Whole genome amplification was performed using MDA. MDA products were subjected to fluorescent PCR of fragile X mental retardation-1 (FMR1) CGG repeats, amelogenin and two polymorphic markers. In the pre-clinical tests, the amplification rates of the FMR1 CGG repeat, DXS1215 and FRAXAC1 were 84.2, 87.5 and 75.0%, respectively, while the allele dropout rates were 31.3, 57.1 and 50.0%, respectively. In two PGD treatment cycles, 20 embryos among 30 embryos were successfully diagnosed as 10 normal embryos, four mutated embryos and six heterozygous carriers. Three healthy embryos were transferred to the uterus; however, no clinical pregnancy was achieved. Our data indicate that MDA and fluorescent PCR with four loci can be successfully applied to PGD for fragile X syndrome. Advanced methods for amplification of minuscule amounts of DNA could improve the sensitivity and reliability of PGD for complicated single gene disorders."

Ischemic postconditioning (Postcon) can protect an organ from ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. In the present study, we investigated the potential contributions of HO-1 to Postcon-dependent protection against I/R injury in rat liver transplantation models.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham group with laparotomy for liver exposure; I/R group with 24-hour cold ischemia of the donor liver; Postcon group with the same treatment as the I/R group plus ischemic Postcon; and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP HO-1 inhibitor) + Postcon group treated the same as the Postcon cohort with donors pretreated using ZnPP 24 hours before the I/R injury. We measured liver tissue and peripheral blood samples collected at 6 hours after reperfusion and serum transaminase levels, histopathology, liver tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and HO-1 expression in the liver.RESULTS: Postcon significantly diminished the elevation of serum transaminases levels after I/R injury when compared with I/R and ZnPP+Postcon groups. Postcon treated rats showed significantly lower MDA production and higher SOD activity. HO-1 was induced in rat livers exposed to Postcon; its levels were obviously overexpressed after 6 hours in Postcon rats. Inhibiting the expression of HO-1, negated the protective effects of Postcon.CONCLUSIONS: Induction of HO-1 in the Postcon condition played a protective role against hepatic I/R injury and enhanced the early antioxidative activity. The protective effects of Postcon were significantly associated with greater intrahepatic HO-1 expression."

To enhance the antitumor effect, an mda-7/IL-24 mutant, RGD-mda-7, which includes the cell adhesive sequence 164Arg-165Gly-166Asp (RGD motif), was constructed and evaluated for bioactivity. RGD peptide binds to integrins α(V)β(3) and α(V)β(5), which are selectively expressed in tumor neovasculature and in the surface of some tumor cells. The wtmda-7/IL-24 and RGD-mda-7 were expressed in Escherichia coli and then purified and renatured. The immunostimulatory activity of RGD-mda-7 was assayed by stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The results suggested that the abilities of RGD-mda-7 to induce IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ production were higher than wtmda-7/IL-24. Tumor targeting of RGD-mda-7 was assayed using cell adhesion experiments. The antitumor effect of the purified RGD-mda-7 on cell proliferation in vitro was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) uptake, cell apoptosis by staining with fluorescent probes of FITC-annexin V and DAPI, and caspase-3 expression and activity. The in vitro results showed that RGD-mda-7 inhibited the proliferation of multiple tumor cell lines (Hela, ACHN, HepG2, and A549). Staining with fluorescent probes of FITC-annexin V and DAPI indicated that RGD-mda-7 could induce apoptosis more effectively in four tumor cell lines than wtmda-7/IL-24, but has no effect on normal cell line NHLF. Western blotting showed that treatment of tumor cells with RGD-mda-7 could activate apoptotic pathway by cleavage of caspase-3 as same as wtmda-7/IL-24. Further, RGD-mda-7 group showed a higher cleaved level of caspase-3, but not in NHLF cells. These results demonstrate that RGD-MDA-7 possesses more potent antitumor effects than wtmda-7/IL-24 and therefore merits further investigation in preclinical and clinical studies."

Receptor fragments, especially those resulting from the proteolysis of its ligand binding domain, as well as corresponding synthetic peptides, have been studied with respect to their estrogenic/antiestrogenic potency. A peptide, corresponding to the human ERα P(295) -T(311) sequence (ERα17p) has been shown to alter breast cancer cell fate, triggering proliferation, or apoptosis. The aim of this work was to explore the effect of ERα17p on breast cancer cell migration and actin cytoskeleton dynamics and further analyze the mechanism of its membrane action. We show that ERα17p increases (MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells) or decreases (T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells) migration of breast cancer cells, in an ERα-independent manner, by mechanism(s) depending on Rho/ROCK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Moreover, the peptide enhances the association of both estrogens and androgens to membranes and modifies cell migration, induced by E(2) -BSA. Additionally, initial evidence of a possible agonistic action of the peptide on GPR30 is also provided. ERα17p can be considered as a cell migration-modulator and could therefore constitute a therapeutic challenge, even in anti-estrogen-resistant tumors."

Additionally, neutrophil accumulation and lipid peroxidase-mediated tissue injury, detected by MPO, MDA and ROS respectively, were attenuated after Gal-LipoNP TLR4 siRNA treatment.

VEGF is the most prominent angiogenic agent that is markedly induced in cancer. Induction of VEGF has been widely studied but as cancer cells are quite adept at acquiring new alternative processes to circumvent surrounding environmental pressures, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating VEGF expression in cancer, especially in triple-negative breast cancer cells, remains incomplete. Here, we present evidence of a novel mode of VEGF induction in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that is regulated by serum amyloid A activating factor 1 (SAF-1) transcription factor. Inhibition of SAF-1 by antisense short hairpin RNA profoundly reduces VEGF expression along with reduction in endothelial cell proliferation and migration. By both in vitro and in vivo molecular studies, we show that the effect of SAF-1 is mediated through its direct interaction with the VEGF promoter. In correlation, DNA-binding activity of SAF-1 is found to be significantly higher in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Examination of several breast cancer samples further revealed that SAF-1 is overexpressed in clinical breast cancer tissues. Taken together, these findings reveal that SAF-1 is a hitherto unrecognized participant in inducing VEGF expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells, an aggressive form of breast cancer that currently lacks effective treatment options. Suppression of SAF-1 activity in these cells can inhibit VEGF expression, providing a possible new method to control angiogenesis."

NCOA6 plays an important role in embryonic development, adipocyte differentiation, metabolism and breast carcinogenesis. The human and mouse NCOA6 genes had 15 and 14 previously identified exons, respectively. This study further identified an alternatively spliced exon 11b (E11b) in human or E10b in mouse, which codes a short polypeptide and a Stop codon, resulting in splicing variants lacking the last four exon-coded polypeptide. Analyses of mouse testis NCOA6 mRNAs identified four alternatively spliced variants, NCOA6-α (without E10b), -β (without E10a and E10b), -γ (with E10a and E10b) and -δ (without E10a but with E10b). These isoforms were detected in multiple mouse tissues and in MDA-MB-435 human cells. NCOA6-α and -β are mainly located in the nucleus; NCOA6-γ is located in both cytoplasm and nucleus; and NCOA6-δ is mainly located in mitochondria. The C-terminus coded by the last four exons was responsible for locating NCOA6-α and -β into the nucleus. The human E11a or mouse E10a-coded region is responsible for distributing NCOA6-γ in both cytoplasm and nucleus, while the region coded by E8-E9 in human or E7-E8 in mouse is responsible for directing NCOA6-δ to mitochondria. Our assays also demonstrated that NCOA6-α and -β could significantly enhance estrogen receptor α-mediated transcription, but NCOA6-γ and -δ were unable to do so. These results suggest that the diverse physiological function of NCOA6 may be mediated by multiple isoforms expressed in different tissues and localized in different subcellular compartments."

Here we studied the molecular basis of aggressive cell proliferation of an AHR overexpressing and ERα functionally down-regulated MCF10AT1 cell line, designated as P20E, in comparison to a matched sub-line, P20C with normal AHR expression and ERα function. We found that a 4-day treatment of P20E cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AZ) caused a significant suppression of cell proliferation. Such an effect of AZ was accompanied with the significant recovery of ERα function. Among diagnostic markers of AZ-induced cellular changes we found conspicuous up-regulation of mRNA expression of Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1), particularly in P20E. The possibility of AZ-induced demethylation on the promoter of WIF-1 gene was confirmed through methylation specific PCR assay. Such AZ-induced changes in P20E cells were also accompanied with the decrease in the binding of nuclear proteins to the (32)P labeled TRE (TCF response element) and the reduced accumulation of β-catenin protein in the cell nucleus, indicating the importance of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in maintaining the increased cell proliferation in P20E line over P20C line. The importance of WIF-1 in this regard has been validated by transfecting cells with siRNA against WIF-1, which caused an increase in cell proliferation. Moreover, artificial overexpression of ERα in both P20E as well as MDA-MB-231 cells increased the mRNA expression of WIF-1. Together these results support our main conclusion that the aggressive cell proliferation of this AHR-overexpressing sub-type of transformed mammary epithelial cells is assisted by the epigenetic suppression of WIF-1 gene, which is caused by the loss of ERα."

Mice were subjected to bilateral renal ischemia (35 min) followed by reperfusion (6 hours). Serum creatinine (sCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured. Additionally, renal superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were determined. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 was determined using real time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis.RESULTS: Minocycline administration significantly reduced the increases in sCr and BUN caused by I/R, indicating attenuation of renal dysfunction and injury, and reduced histological evidence of renal damage caused by I/R. Minocycline administration also markedly reduced the evidence of oxidative stress (MPO activity, SOD and MDA levels), inflammation (ICAM-1 expression and MPO activity) and apoptosis (caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 expression) in mouse kidneys subjected to I/R.CONCLUSION: These findings provide good evidence that minocycline can reduce the renal dysfunction and injury caused by I/R of the kidney.

Recent reports suggest that CAR levels are elevated in breast cancer, and this may have an impact on its use as means of delivery for gene therapy. In this study, we show that estradiol (E(2)) treatment of the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell MCF-7 increases CAR levels and, in turn, enhances adenoviral transduction. Employing the transfection of CAR promoters in breast cancer cells, we show that this regulation of CAR expression occurs at the transcriptional level. In addition, and by chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have identified a crucial region of CAR promoter that controls E(2) responsiveness of CAR gene through the recruitment of ER. Moreover, utilizing CAR antibodies or CAR silencing by RNA interference repressed the estrogen-dependent growth of breast cancer cells, whereas the stable expression of CAR in MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells led to an increased proliferation. Altogether, our data suggest that CAR is a novel estrogen-responsive gene, which is involved in the E(2)-dependent proliferation of breast cancer cells."

It involves estrogen receptor α which uses several enzymes that locally modify histone tails as cofactors. Using MCF-7 cells as a model, we found that Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1A (JARID1A; KDM5A/RBP2), an enzyme that removes the activating H3K4 di- and trimethylation marks, was involved in the fine-tuning of progesterone receptor gene expression. Reduction of JARID1A led to enhanced progesterone receptor expression, at both the basal and estrogen-stimulated levels. Conversely, overexpression of JARID1A wild-type, but not the enzymatically inactive mutant, suppressed progesterone receptor promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed JARID1A to bind in a ligand-independent manner to a progesterone receptor gene upstream region that contains an estrogen response element half-site as well as the CCGCCC sequence, which is potentially recognized by JARID1A. Estrogen treatment led to RNA polymerase II recruitment to this region and to increased estrogen receptor α binding to the PR enhancer region 1. In addition, elevation of H3K4 trimethylation was detected at the estrogen response element half-site region. Reduction of JARID1A expression was followed by higher H3K4 trimethylation in this region. Analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells, which do not express the progesterone receptor, indicated that H3K4 trimethylation did not take place in the regulatory regions examined. Taken together, the results underscore the importance of epigenetic modifications for regulation of progesterone receptor expression. They suggest that H3K4 tri- and dimethylation play an important role and that JARID1A is the histone-demethylating enzyme responsible for removal of this mark."

Overexpression of the ThZFL confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance in both yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and tobacco. Furthermore, MDA levels in ThZFL transformed tobacco were significantly decreased compared with control plants under salt and osmotic stress, suggesting ThZFL may confer stress tolerance by decreasing membrane lipid peroxidation. Subcellular localization analysis showed the ThZFL protein is localized in the cell wall. Our results indicated the ThZFL gene is an excellent candidate for genetic engineering to improve salt and osmotic tolerance in agricultural plants."

How this complex is formed is not understood, but appears to involve multiple interactions, including a coiled-coil region that mediates lower-order erlin assembly, and a short hydrophobic region, termed the &quot;assembly domain&quot;, that mediates higher-order assembly into ∼2 MDa complexes. Here we have used molecular modeling, mutagenesis and cross-linking to examine the role of the assembly domain in higher-order assembly. We find (i) that the assembly domains of erlin1 and erlin2 are amphipathic helices, (ii) that erlin1 alone and erlin2 alone can assemble into ∼2 MDa complexes, (iii) that higher-order assembly is strongly inhibited by point mutations to the assembly domain, (iv) that three interacting hydrophobic residues in the assembly domain and aromaticity are essential for higher-order assembly, and (iv) that while erlins1 and 2 are equally capable of forming lower-order homo- and hetero-oligomers, hetero-oligomers are the most prevalent form when erlin1 and erlin2 are co-expressed. Overall, we conclude that the ∼2 MDa erlin1/2 complex is composed of an assemblage of lower-order hetero-oligomers, probably heterotrimers, linked together by assembly domain hydrophobic residues."

There is little knowledge about in situ, in vivo, tumor hypoxia during intracranial development of malignant brain tumors because of lack of efficient means to monitor it in these deep-seated orthotopic tumors. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI), based on the detection of light emitted by living cells expressing a luciferase gene, has been rapidly adopted for cancer research, in particular, to evaluate tumor growth or tumor size changes in response to treatment in preclinical animal studies. Moreover, by expressing a reporter gene under the control of a promoter sequence, the specific gene expression can be monitored non-invasively by BLI. Under hypoxic stress, signaling responses are mediated mainly via the hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) to drive transcription of various genes. Therefore, we have used a HIF-1α reporter construct, 5HRE-ODD-luc, stably transfected into human breast cancer MDA-MB231 cells (MDA-MB231/5HRE-ODD-luc). In vitro HIF-1α bioluminescence assay is performed by incubating the transfected cells in a hypoxic chamber (0.1% O₂) for 24 hr before BLI, while the cells in normoxia (21% O₂) serve as a control. Significantly higher photon flux observed for the cells under hypoxia suggests an increased HIF-1α binding to its promoter (HRE elements), as compared to those in normoxia. Cells are injected directly into the mouse brain to establish a breast cancer brain metastasis model. In vivo bioluminescence imaging of tumor hypoxia dynamics is initiated 2 wks after implantation and repeated once a week. BLI reveals increasing light signals from the brain as the tumor progresses, indicating increased intracranial tumor hypoxia. Histological and immunohistochemical studies are used to confirm the in vivo imaging results. Here, we will introduce approaches of in vitro HIF-1α bioluminescence assay, surgical establishment of a breast cancer brain metastasis in a nude mouse and application of in vivo bioluminescence imaging to monitor intracranial tumor hypoxia."

Amino acids Asp and Arg were introduced at both ends to enhance its solubility. Purified NO2A-GSG-DRD-IVWHRWYAWSPASRI-DRD (NO2A-TFpep) was radiolabeled with (64)Cu and evaluated for binding to human MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells, 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)), and serum stability. In vivo pharmacokinetic and small-animal PET studies were performed using SCID mice bearing MDA-MB-435 tumor xenografts.RESULTS: (64)Cu-NO2A-TFpep bound to human MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells, whereas almost no binding was observed to normal human breast 184A1 cells. The peptide exhibited an apparent IC(50) value of 70 ± 8.0 nM. In vivo biodistribution studies indicated radiolabeled peptide accumulation in tumors of MDA-MB-435 xenografted SCID mice of approximately 1.10 ± 0.20 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) and 0.90 ± 0.12 %ID/g, at 0.5 and 1 h, respectively. Accumulation of radioactivity was low in other organs, with the exception of liver (1.52 ± 0.12 %ID/g) and kidneys (15.4 ± 1.73 %ID/g) at 1 h. Live imaging studies with (64)Cu-NO2A-TFpep (15 MBq) demonstrated good tumor uptake at 1 h after injection, whereas no tumor uptake was observed with a scrambled radiolabeled peptide (64)Cu-NO2A-GSG-DRD-RWSWWAVHRIPYSAI-DRD.CONCLUSION: (64)Cu-NO2A-TFpep may function as a noninvasive in vivo tumor imaging agent of human breast and other carcinomas expressing the TF carbohydrate antigen.

However, the use of α-peptides in pharmaceutical applications is hindered by their enzymatic degradation and low bioavailability. Starting with a 10-mer α-peptide 18 that we developed previously, here we report three novel analogues of 18 that are proteolytically stable and display better (up to 3.5-fold) affinity profiles for breast cancer cells compared to 18. The design strategy involved replacement of two or three amino acids in the sequence of 18 with d-residues or β(3)-amino acids. Such replacement maintained the specificity for cancer cells (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7) with low affinity for control noncancerous cells (MCF-10A and HUVEC), showed an increase in secondary structure, and rendered the analogues completely stable to human serum and liver homogenate from mice. The three analogues are potentially safe with minimal cellular toxicity and are efficient targeting moieties for specific drug delivery to breast cancer cells. The strategy used here may be adapted to develop peptide analogues that will target other cancer cell types."

Expression of the human TSPO gene is elevated in several cancers. To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate TSPO expression in human breast cancer cells, the TSPO promoter was identified, cloned, and functionally characterized in poor-in-TSPO hormone-dependent, non-aggressive MCF-7 cells and rich-in-TSPO hormone-independent, aggressive, and metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. RNA ligase-mediated 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis indicated transcription initiated at multiple sites downstream of a GC-rich promoter that lacks functional TATA and CCAAT boxes. Deletion analysis indicated that the region from -121 to +66, which contains five putative regulatory sites known as GC boxes, was sufficient to induce reporter activity up to 24-fold in MCF-7 and nearly 120-fold in MDA-MB-231 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 bind to these GC boxes in vitro and to the endogenous TSPO promoter. Silencing of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 gene expression reduced TSPO levels. In addition, TSPO expression was epigenetically regulated at one or more of the identified GC boxes. Disruption of the sequence downstream of the main start site of TSPO differentially regulated TSPO promoter activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, indicating that essential elements contribute to its differential expression in these cells. Taken together, these experiments constitute the first in-depth functional analysis of the human TSPO gene promoter and its transcriptional regulation."

We constructed an expression vector, PEP-1, fused PEP-1 with SOD1, and generated PEP-1-SOD1 fusion protein. We administered PEP-1 and 100 or 500 μg PEP-1-SOD1 intraperitoneally once a day for 3 weeks and sacrificed at 30 min after the last administrations. PEP-1 administration did not change the MDA levels compared to those in the vehicle-treated group, while PEP-1-SOD1 treatment significantly reduced MDA levels compared to the vehicle-treated group. In the PEP-1-treated group, the number of Ki67-positive nuclei was similar to that in the vehicle-treated group. In the 100 μg PEP-1-SOD1-treated group, the number of Ki67-positive nuclei was slightly decreased; however, in the 500 μg PEP-1-SOD1-treated group, Ki67-positive nuclei were decreased to 78.5% of the vehicle-treated group. The number of DCX-positive neuroblasts in the PEP-1-treated group was similar to that in the vehicle-treated group. However, the arborization of DCX-positive neuroblasts was significantly decreased in both the 100 and 500 μg PEP-1-SOD1-treated groups compared to that in the vehicle-treated group. The number of DCX-positive neuroblasts with tertiary dendrites was markedly decreased in the 500 μg PEP-1-SOD1-treated group.

The potential of a tumour to grow and metastasise is partly dependant on its ability to initiate angiogenesis or growth and remodelling of new blood vessels, usually from a pre-existing vascular network, to ensure delivery of oxygen, nutrients, and growth factors to rapidly dividing transformed cells along with access to the systemic circulation. Cell-cell signalling of semaphorin ligands through interaction with their plexin receptors is important for the homeostasis and morphogenesis of many tissues and has been widely studied for a role in neural connectivity, cancer, cell migration and immune responses. This study investigated the role of four semaphorin/plexin signalling genes in human breast cancers in vivo and in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: mRNA was extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded archival breast invasive ductal carcinoma tissue samples of progressive grades (grades I-III) and compared to tissue from benign tumours. Gene expression profiles were determined by microarray using the Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays and validated by Q-PCR using a Corbett RotorGene 6000. Following validation, the gene expression profile of the identified targets was correlated with those of the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231.RESULTS: The array data revealed that 888 genes were found to be significantly (p≤0.05) differentially expressed between grades I and II tumours and 563 genes between grade III and benign tumours. From these genes, we identified four genes involved in semaphorin-plexin signalling including SEMA4D which has previously been identified as being involved in increased angiogenesis in breast cancers, and three other genes, SEMA4F, PLXNA2 and PLXNA3, which in the literature were associated with tumourigenesis, but not directly in breast tumourigenesis. The microarray analysis revealed that SEMA4D was significantly (P=0.0347) down-regulated in the grade III tumours compared to benign tumours; SEMA4F, was significantly (P=0.0159) down-regulated between grades I and II tumours; PLXNA2 was significantly (P=0.036) down-regulated between grade III and benign tumours and PLXNA3 significantly (P=0.042) up-regulated between grades I and II tumours. Gene expression of SEMA4D was validated using Q-PCR, demonstrating the same expression profile in both data sets. When the sample set was increased to incorporate more cases, SEMA4D continued to follow the same expression profile, including statistical significance for the differences observed and small standard deviations. In vitro the same pattern was present where expression for SEMA4D was significantly higher in MDA-MB-231 cells when compared to MCF-7 cells. The expression of SEMA4F, PLXNA2 and PLXNA3 could not be validated using Q-PCR, however in vitro analysis of these three genes revealed that both SEMA4F and PLXNA3 followed the microarray trend in expression, although they did not reach significance. In contrast, PLXNA2 demonstrated statistical significance and was in concordance with the literature.DISCUSSION: We, and others, have proposed SEMA4D to be a gene with a potentially protective effect in benign tumours that contributes to tumour growth and metastatic suppression. Previous data supports a role for SEMA4F as a tumour suppressor in the peripheral nervous system but our data seems to indicate that the gene is involved in tumour progression in breast cancer. Our in vitro analysis of PLXNA2 revealed that the gene has higher expression in more aggressive breast cancer cell types. Finally, our in vitro analysis on PLXNA3 also suggest that this gene may have some form of growth suppressive role in breast cancer, in addition to a similar role for the gene previously reported in ovarian cancer. From the data obtained in this study, SEMA4D may have a role in more aggressive and potentially metastatic breast tumours.CONCLUSIONS: Semaphorins and their receptors, the plexins, have been implicated in numerous aspects of neural development, however their expression in many other epithelial tissues suggests that the semaphorin-plexin signalling system also contributes to blood vessel growth and development. These findings warrant further investigation of the role of semaphorins and plexins and their role in normal and tumour-induced angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. This may represent a new front of attack in anti-angiogenic therapies of breast and other cancers."

We have previously shown that mAb 4C5 specifically recognizes both the α- and to a lesser extent the β-isoform of HSP90. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that by selectively inhibiting the function of cell-surface HSP90, mAb 4C5 significantly impairs cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Here we describe the reconstitution of mAb 4C5 into a mouse-human chimera. More importantly we report that mAb 4C5 and consequently its chimeric counterpart are completely devoid of heavy chain and consist only of a functional kappa light chain dimer. The chimeric antibody is shown to retain the original antibody's specificity and functional properties. Thus it is capable of inhibiting the function of surface HSP90, leading to reduced cancer cell invasion in vitro. Finally, we present in vivo evidence showing that the chimeric 4C5 significantly inhibits the metastatic deposit formation of MDA-MB-453 cells into the lungs of SCID mice. These data suggest that a chimeric kappa light chain antibody could be potentially used as an anti-cancer agent, thereby introducing a novel type of antibody fragment, with reduced possible adverse immunogenic effects, into cancer therapeutics."

It expressed in vegetative and reproductive organs, and its expression was induced by salt, PEG-mediated osmotic stress, cold and heat in apple in vitro shoot cultures. MdVHP1 expression showed a similar pattern in different apple tissues, but different change dynamics in response to abiotic stresses, compared with MdVHP2 (another MdVHP gene in apple). MdVHP1 overexpression enhanced tolerance to salt, PEG-mimic drought, cold and heat in transgenic apple calluses, which was related to an increased accumulation of proline and decreased MDA content compared with control calluses. In addition, MdVHP1 overexpression confers improved tolerance to salt and drought in transgenic tomato, along with an increased ion accumulation, high RWC and low solute potential compared with wild type.

Vaccines 2 and 3 contained the protease-sensitive double-Arg (RR) linker sequence between the epitope and the EP54/EP67 moieties in order to provide a site for intracellular proteases to separate the epitope from the EP54/EP67 moieties once internalized by the APC and, consequently, enhance epitope presentation in the context of MHC I/II.

We have analyzed the organization of the TP53 gene domain using DNA arrays in several breast cancer and control cell lines. We have found that in the control breast epithelial cell line, HB2, the TP53 gene is positioned within a relatively small DNA domain, encompassing 50 kb, delimited by two nuclear matrix attachment sites. Interestingly, this domain structure was found to be radically different in the studied breast cancer cell lines, MCF7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and BT474, in which the domain size was increased and TP53 transcription was decreased.

There were no significant differences in the frequencies of the genotypes and alleles between PCOS and control groups (P &gt; 0.05). In the control group, the subjects with genotype CT had higher F-G scores and plasma glucose levels at 2 h during OGTT (75 g glucose) when compared with those of genotype CC (P &lt; 0.05). Higher FSH level and MDA concentration also observed in those of genotype TT by compared with those of CC genotype (P &lt; 0.05). The differences in FSH, GLU120 and MDA levels remained significant after adjustment for age and BMI (P = 0.006, 0.033 and 0.047, respectively). In the PCOS group, the patients with genotype CT had higher atherogenic index (AI) when compared with those of genotype CC (P = 0.038), but this difference was not significant after adjustment for age and BMI (P = 0.053).CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the -108 C/T polymorphism in the promoter of PON1 gene was associated with hormonal levels, glucose metabolism and oxidative stress in the control women, but not associated with PCOS in Chinese women of Chengdu area."

The objective of the present study was to determine whether a target sequence could be successfully amplified by conventional PCR when the genomic DNA of a single Day-7 porcine blastocyst (derived from SCNT of a gene-engineered fibroblast) was amplified by the MDA method and used as a template. The yield of double-stranded DNA was 103.5 ± 16.0 ng/embryo (range, 75-125), as assessed by a PocoGreen assay. However, non-specific products (20 ± 5 ng/tube) were also generated, even in the negative control. Thus, ∼81% of the 103.5 ng (84 ng) of amplified DNA was estimated to be porcine sequences (2.2 × 10(3)-fold enrichment). In addition, PCR confirmed the presence of transgenes, as well as endogenous α-1,3-galactosyltransferase and homeobox Nanog genes in all embryos. Sequencing of the amplified products verified the fidelity of this system. In conclusion, the MDA-mediated WGA, which was simple, inexpensive, and did not require a thermal cycler, could be a powerful tool for multiple genomic analyses of individual early porcine embryos."

Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears revealed B. ovis infection. The parasitological diagnosis was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis by amplifying a partial small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssu rRNA) gene sequence of B. ovis of 52 diseased sheep, 18 (34.61%), 11 (21.15%), 16 (30.76%) and 7 (13.48%) had &lt;1%, 1-2%, 2-3% and &gt;3% parasitemia, respectively. Compared to controls, the activities of erythrocyte GSH-Px, SOD, TAC and CAT showed a significant decrease, whereas the concentration of MDA in erythrocytes of infected sheep increased significantly. Parasitemia rate was positively correlated with MDA and negatively correlated with PCV, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and TAC. Also, MDA was negatively correlated with PCV, SOD, catalase, GSH-Px and TAC. The study demonstrated that B. ovis plays an important role in the occurrence of oxidative damage to RBCs and anemia in ovine babesiosis."

In this study, we have identified and characterized five alternatively spliced isoforms of this gene. Several, but not all of these isoforms induce apoptosis in the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS, while none affect the survival of the non-cancerous NOK cell line. One of these isoforms, lacking three exons and encoding the N-terminal end of the mda-7/IL-24 protein sequence, caused levels of apoptosis that were higher than those caused by the full-length mda-7/IL-24 variant. Additionally, we found that the ratio of isoform expression can be modified by the splice factor SRp55. This regulation suggests that alternative splicing of mda-7/IL-24 is under tight control in the cell, and can be modified under various cellular conditions, such as DNA damage. In addition to providing new insights into the function of an important tumor suppressor gene, these findings may also point toward new avenues for cancer treatment."

Since estradiol (E(2)) is a critical regulatory molecule in the growth of breast cancer, we examined the effect of BE-3-3-3-3 on estrogen receptor α (ERα) positive MCF-7 cells in the presence and absence of E(2). In the presence of E(2), a concentration-dependent decrease in DNA synthesis was observed using [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation assay. In the absence of E(2), low concentrations (2.5-10 μM) of BE-3-3-3-3 increased [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation at 24 and 48 h. BE-3-3-3-3 induced the expression of early response genes, c-myc and c-fos, in the absence of E(2), but not in its presence, as determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). BE-3-3-3-3 had no significant effect on these genes in an ERα-negative cell line, MDA-MB-231. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated enhanced promoter occupation by either E(2) or BE-3-3-3-3 of an estrogen-responsive gene pS2/Tff1 by ERα and its co-activator, steroid receptor co-activator 3 (SRC-3). Confocal microscopy of BE-3-3-3-3-treated cells revealed membrane localization of ERα, similar to that induced by E(2). The failure of BE-3-3-3-3 to inhibit cell proliferation was associated with autophagic vacuole formation, and the induction of Beclin 1 and MAP LC3 II. These results indicate a differential effect of BE-3-3-3-3 on MCF-7 cells in the absence and presence of E(2), and suggest that pre-clinical and clinical development of polyamine analogues might require special precautions and selection of sensitive subpopulation of patients."

In vitro transfection studies in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells revealed that ternary formulations of lipid:peptide:DNA (LPD) complexes prepared using the aforementioned lipids possessed highly synergistic transfection activity up to 2500-fold higher than their respective lipid:DNA (LD) or peptide:DNA (PD) counterparts. Furthermore, the small structural differences in the lipid alkyl chain geometries also resulted in pronounced differences in transfection within each type of formulation, whereby the trans lipids showed best activity when formulated as LD complexes, whereas the cis lipids were superior in LPD formulations. Confocal fluorescence internalization studies using labeled components of the formulations showed both the lipid and the DNA of LD complexes to be trapped in endocytic compartments, whereas in the case of LPD complexes, the DNA was clearly released from the endosomal compartments and, together with the peptide, internalized within the cell nucleus. Physicochemical characterization of the formulations carried out by light and neutron scattering, zeta potential measurement, and negative staining electron microscopy detected major structural differences between LD and LPD complexes. Gel electrophoresis assays additionally showed differences between the individual lipids tested in each type of formulation. In conclusion, the superior transfection of the trans lipids in the LD complexes was thought to be attributed to superior DNA binding caused by a more closely matched charge distribution of the more rigid, trans lipids with the DNA. In the case of the LPD complexes, the DNA was thought to be predominantly condensed by the cationic portion of the peptide forming a central core surrounded by a lipid bilayer from which the targeting sequence partially protrudes. The more fluid, cis lipids were thought to confer better activity in this formulation due to allowing more of the targeting peptide sequence to protrude."

We hypothesised that either somatic mutation or hypermethylation of the CITED4 gene underlies CITED4 down-regulation and thus enhanced HIF-1α expression in some breast tumours. DNA sequencing was used to screen for somatic mutations. Methylation-sensitive high resolution melting was performed to identify CITED4 methylation. RT-qPCR was carried out to measure the expression of CITED4 and selected HIF downstream targets. HIF-1α and downstream gene expression was assessed with immunohistochemistry. No somatic mutations of CITED4 were identified in 10 tumour cell lines and 100 breast carcinomas. However, CITED4 promoter methylation was identified in 5/168 breast carcinomas (four infiltrating ductal carcinomas and one infiltrating lobular carcinoma) and in 3/10 breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T). CITED4 mRNA expression in cell lines was inversely correlated with DNA methylation. CITED4 mRNA expression was significantly increased in all three cell lines after 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (DAC) treatment. Treatment of the MDA-MB-231 cell line with DAC followed by hypoxia (0.1% O²) resulted in down-regulation of expression of the HIF-1α downstream genes VEGFA and SLC2A1 (P = 0.0029). HIF-1α downstream SLC2A1 was decreased (P = 0.021) after CITED4 was re-expressed under hypoxia. Loss of expression of CITED4 in breast cancer may be due to DNA methylation but is unlikely to be due to mutation. Demethylation and histone modification can potentially reactivate CITED4 gene expression in some breast cancers and lead to changes in tumour behaviour. Strategies such as HDAC inhibitors may overcome this effect."

We explored the differences between changes in gene expression caused by the ability of these drugs to compete with Sp1 for binding to DNA and those produced by Sp1 knockdown. By quantitative RT-PCR of around 100 genes, most of them involved in control of cell cycle progression, we found that the treatment of human MDA-MB231 breast carcinoma cells with bis-anthracycline WP631 for 24 h produced a profile of gene down-regulation markedly different from the profile caused by doxorubicin treatment or by stable Sp1 knockdown. These observations are rationalized by considering a near-specific effect of WP631 on Sp1 interaction with several gene promoters, thus representing potential therapeutic targets for WP631, in contrast to a less specific effect of reducing the availability of Sp1 through RNA interference. Genes down-regulated upon each treatment were mapped to their molecular and biological functions, which documented the down-regulation, among other things, of genes involved in mRNA transcription regulation, granting us insights into the effects of challenging the transactivation of gene expression by Sp1."

Studies on isolated chlorosomes from Chlorobaculum tepidum based on SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting and molecular biology have revealed that they contain ten chlorosomal proteins, but no comprehensive information is available about the protein composition of the entire organelle. To extend these studies, chlorosomes were isolated from C. tepidum using three related and one independent isolation protocol and characterized by absorption spectroscopy, tricine SDS-PAGE, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electron microscopy. Tricine SDS-PAGE showed the presence of more than 20 proteins with molecular weights ranging between 6 and 70 kDa. The chlorosomes varied in size. Their hydrodynamic radius (R(h) ) ranged from 51 to 75 nm and electron microscopy indicated that they were on average 140 nm wide and 170 nm long. Furthermore, the mass of 184 whole chlorosome organelles determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy ranged from 27 to 237 MDa being on average 88 (±28) MDa. In contrast their mass-per-area was independent of their size, indicating that there is a strict limit to chlorosome thickness. The average protein composition of the C. tepidum chlorosome organelles was obtained by MS/MS-driven proteomics and for the first time a detailed protein catalogue of the isolated chlorosomal proteome is presented. Based on the proteomics results for chlorosomes isolated by different protocols, four proteins that are involved in the electron or ion transport are proposed to be tightly associated with or incorporated into C. tepidum chlorosomes as well as the ten Csm proteins known to date."

New material of this nematode species was recovered from the same type host species from Mexican waters off the Yucatán Peninsula. This material was compared with Brazilian specimens. Although Mexican material closely resembles the original description of C. dodsworthi in general appearance, previously undescribed characters, as observed by light and scanning electron microscopy, are described for the first time in this species from both Brazilian and Mexican specimens. These characters include lateral body alae or conspicuous lateral fields that begin in the cervical region and end anterior to first pair of adcloacal papillae in males and at the anus level in females, cephalic and caudal alae absent; presence of pseudobuccal capsule with simple buccal frame well sclerotized with dorsal arrow structures, lateral structures, and lateral reniform structures; deirids, excretory pore, and postdeirids; slight anal protuberance in both sexes, unpaired precloacal papilla in males, phasmids near pair 10 in males and near tail tip in females; female with protruding vulvar lips and smooth eggs. In the absence of better descriptions of this genus, it can be concluded that C. dodsworthi is the only species of marine Cucullanus from the Americas that possesses lateral body alae. Molecular characterization of C. dodsworthi with SSU (18S) and ITS2 rDNA genes is included. A preliminary genetic comparison between SSU rDNA of C. dodsworthi , Truttaedacnitis truttae (Fabricius, 1794), and Dichelyne mexicanus Caspeta-Mandujano, Moravec and Salgado-Maldonado, 1999 places C. dodsworthi as a putative sister taxon to T. truttae .

The aim of this study was to modify the peptide to enable regulation of cellular uptake through a dependency on activation by proteases present in the local environment.METHODS: The native Tat peptide sequence was altered to inhibit the initial interaction of the peptide with the cell membrane through the addition of the consensus sequence for urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). uPA expression was characterised and semi-quantitatively rated in three cell lines (U251mg, MDA-MB-231 and HeLa). The modified peptide was incubated with both recombinant enzyme and with cells varying in uPA activity. Cellular uptake of the modified Tat peptide line was compared with that of the native peptide and rated according to uPA activity measured in each cell line.KEY FINDINGS: uPA activity was observed to be high in U251mg and MDA-MB-231 and low in HeLa. In MDA-MB-231 and HeLa, uptake of the modified peptide correlated with the level of uPA expression detected (93 and 52%, respectively). In U251mg, however, the uptake of the modified peptide was much less (19% observed reduction) than the native peptide despite a high level of uPA activity detected.CONCLUSIONS: Proteolytic activation represents an interesting strategy for the targeted delivery of macromolecules using peptide-based carriers and holds significant potential for further exploitation."

In most intraductal breast carcinomas E-cadherin is regulated epigenetically via methylation of the promoter. E-cadherin expression is therefore dynamic and open to modulation by the microenvironment. In addition, it has been observed that metastatic foci commonly appear more differentiated than the primary tumor, suggesting that cancer cells may further undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transition (MErT) in the secondary organ environment following the EMT that allows for escape.RESULTS: We first examined E-cadherin expression in primary breast tumors and their corresponding metastases to liver, lung and brain and discovered that 62% (10/16) of cases showed increased E-cadherin expression in the metastases compared to the primaries. These observations led to the question of whether the positive metastatic foci arose from expansion of E-cadherin-positive cells or from MErT of originally E-cadherin-negative disseminated cells. Thus, we aimed to determine whether it was possible for the mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to undergo an MErT through the re-expression of E-cadherin, either through exogenous introduction or induction by the microenvironment. Ectopic expression of full-length E-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a morphological and functional reversion of the epithelial phenotype, with even just the cytosolic domain of E-cadherin yielding a partial phenotype. Introduction of MDA-MB-231 cells or primary explants into a secondary organ environment simulated by a hepatocyte coculture system induced E-cadherin re-expression through passive loss of methylation of the promoter. Furthermore, detection of E-cadherin-positive metastatic foci following the spontaneous metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells injected into the mammary fat pad of mice suggests that this re-expression is functional.CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical observations and experimental data indicate that the secondary organ microenvironment can induce the re-expression of E-cadherin and consequently MErT. This phenotypic change is reflected in altered cell behavior and thus may be a critical step in cell survival at metastatic sites."

Accommodation is a key conformational change during transfer RNA (tRNA) selection that allows movement of tRNA into the ribosome. Here, we address the structure-function relationship that governs accommodation using all-atom molecular simulations and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET). Simulations that employ an all-atom, structure-based (Gō-like) model illuminate the interplay between configurational entropy and effective enthalpy during the accommodation process. This delicate balance leads to spontaneous reversible accommodation attempts, which are corroborated by smFRET measurements. The dynamics about the endpoints of accommodation (the A/T and A/A conformations) obtained from structure-based simulations are validated by multiple 100-200 ns explicit-solvent simulations (3.2 million atoms for a cumulative 1.4 micros), and previous crystallographic analysis. We find that the configurational entropy of the 3'-CCA end of aminoacyl-tRNA resists accommodation, leading to a multistep accommodation process that encompasses a distribution of parallel pathways. The calculated mechanism is robust across simulation methods and protocols, suggesting that the structure of the accommodation corridor imposes stringent limitations on the accessible pathways. The identified mechanism and observed parallel pathways establish an atomistic framework for interpreting a large body of biochemical data and demonstrate that conformational changes during translation occur through a stochastic trial-and-error process, rather than in concerted lock-step motions."

The mechanisms by which SFN imparts its chemopreventive properties are of considerable interest and little is known of its preventive potential for breast cancer.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that SFN significantly inhibits the viability and proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro while it has negligible effects on normal breast cells. Inhibition of telomerase has received considerable attention because of its high expression in cancer cells and extremely low level of expression in normal cells. SFN treatment dose- and time-dependently inhibited human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic regulatory subunit of telomerase, in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), especially DNMT1 and DNMT3a, were also decreased in SFN-treated breast cancer cells suggesting that SFN may repress hTERT by impacting epigenetic pathways. Down-regulation of DNMTs in response to SFN induced site-specific CpG demethylation occurring primarily in the first exon of the hTERT gene thereby facilitating CTCF binding associated with hTERT repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of the hTERT promoter revealed that SFN increased the level of active chromatin markers acetyl-H3, acetyl-H3K9 and acetyl-H4, whereas the trimethyl-H3K9 and trimethyl-H3K27 inactive chromatin markers were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. SFN-induced hyperacetylation facilitated the binding of many hTERT repressor proteins such as MAD1 and CTCF to the hTERT regulatory region. Depletion of CTCF using siRNA reduced the SFN-induced down-regulation of hTERT mRNA transcription in these breast cancer cells. In addition, down-regulation of hTERT expression facilitated the induction of cellular apoptosis in human breast cancer cells.SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, our results provide novel insights into SFN-mediated epigenetic down-regulation of telomerase in breast cancer prevention and may open new avenues for approaches to SFN-mediated cancer prevention."

Single cell genomics is a novel culture-independent approach, which enables access to the genetic material of an individual cell. No single cell genome has to our knowledge been closed and finished to date. Here we report the completed genome from an uncultured single cell of Candidatus Sulcia muelleri DMIN. Digital PCR on single symbiont cells isolated from the bacteriome of the green sharpshooter Draeculacephala minerva bacteriome allowed us to assess that this bacteria is polyploid with genome copies ranging from approximately 200-900 per cell, making it a most suitable target for single cell finishing efforts. For single cell shotgun sequencing, an individual Sulcia cell was isolated and whole genome amplified by multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Sanger-based finishing methods allowed us to close the genome. To verify the correctness of our single cell genome and exclude MDA-derived artifacts, we independently shotgun sequenced and assembled the Sulcia genome from pooled bacteriomes using a metagenomic approach, yielding a nearly identical genome. Four variations we detected appear to be genuine biological differences between the two samples. Comparison of the single cell genome with bacteriome metagenomic sequence data detected two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indicating extremely low genetic diversity within a Sulcia population. This study demonstrates the power of single cell genomics to generate a complete, high quality, non-composite reference genome within an environmental sample, which can be used for population genetic analyzes."

In this first report, we examine the genome-wide chromatin localization of an altered-specificity mutant ER with a DNA binding domain deficient in binding to estrogen response element (ERE)-containing DNA (DBDmut ER) versus wild-type ER alpha. Using high-throughput sequencing of ER chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP-Seq) and mRNA transcriptional profiling, we show that direct ERE binding is required for most of (75%) estrogen-dependent gene regulation and 90% of hormone-dependent recruitment of ER to genomic binding sites. De novo motif analysis of the chromatin binding regions in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells defined unique transcription factor profiles responsible for genes regulated through tethering versus direct ERE binding, with Runx motifs enriched in ER-tethered sites. We confirmed a role for Runx1 in mediating ER alpha genomic recruitment and regulation of tethering genes. Our findings delineate the contributions of direct receptor ERE binding versus binding through response elements for other transcription factors in chromatin localization and ER-dependent gene regulation, paradigms likely to underlie the gene regulatory actions of other nuclear receptors as well."

To maximize protein complex stability and resolution of megadalton complexes, ionic strength and composition were optimized. Subsequent high accuracy tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LTQ-Orbitrap) identified 1081 proteins across the complete native mass range. Protein complexes and assembly states above 0.8 MDa were resolved using hierarchical clustering, and protein heat maps were generated from normalized protein spectral counts for each of the size exclusion chromatography fractions; this complemented previous analysis of stromal complexes up to 0.8 MDa (Peltier, J.

Mol. Cell. Proteomics 5, 114-133). This combined experimental and bioinformatics analyses resolved chloroplast ribosomes in different assembly and functional states (e.g. 30, 50, and 70 S), which enabled the identification of plastid homologues of prokaryotic ribosome assembly factors as well as proteins involved in co-translational modifications, targeting, and folding. The roles of these ribosome-associating proteins will be discussed. Known RNA splice factors (e.g. CAF1/WTF1/RNC1) as well as uncharacterized proteins with RNA-binding domains (pentatricopeptide repeat, RNA recognition motif, and chloroplast ribosome maturation), RNases, and DEAD box helicases were found in various sized complexes. Chloroplast DNA (&gt;3 MDa) was found in association with the complete heteromeric plastid-encoded DNA polymerase complex, and a dozen other DNA-binding proteins, e.g. DNA gyrase, topoisomerase, and various DNA repair enzymes. The heteromeric &gt;or=5-MDa pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the 0.8-1-MDa acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex associated with uncharacterized biotin carboxyl carrier domain proteins constitute the entry point to fatty acid metabolism in leaves; we suggest that their large size relates to the need for metabolic channeling.

Although KLF4 functions as a tumor suppressor in several tissues, including the colon, the role of KLF4 in breast cancer is less clear. Here, we show that KLF4 is necessary for maintenance of the epithelial phenotype in non-transformed MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. KLF4 silencing led to alterations in epithelial cell morphology and migration, indicative of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Consistent with these changes, decreased levels of KLF4 also resulted in the loss of E-cadherin protein and mRNA. Promoter/reporter analyses revealed decreased E-cadherin promoter activity with KLF4 silencing, while chromatin immunoprecipitation identified endogenous KLF4 binding to the GC-rich/E-box region of this promoter. Furthermore, forced expression of KLF4 in the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cell line was sufficient to restore E-cadherin expression and suppress migration and invasion. These findings identify E-cadherin as a novel transcriptional target of KLF4. The clear requirement for KLF4 to maintain E-cadherin expression and prevent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in mammary epithelial cells supports a metastasis suppressive role for KLF4 in breast cancer."

All known siphophages infecting gram+ Lactococcus lactis possess a baseplate at the tip of their tail involved in host recognition and attachment. Here, we report analysis of the p2 phage baseplate structure by X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy and propose a mechanism for the baseplate activation during attachment to the host cell. This approximately 1 MDa, Escherichia coli-expressed baseplate is composed of three protein species, including six trimers of the receptor-binding protein (RBP). RBPs host-recognition domains point upwards, towards the capsid, in agreement with the electron-microscopy map of the free virion. In the presence of Ca(2+), a cation mandatory for infection, the RBPs rotated 200 degrees downwards, presenting their binding sites to the host, and a channel opens at the bottom of the baseplate for DNA passage. These conformational changes reveal a novel siphophage activation and host-recognition mechanism leading ultimately to DNA ejection."

Proteasomes are activated in vitro by three known classes of proteins/complexes, including Blm10/PA200. Here, we report a 3.4 A resolution crystal structure of a proteasome-Blm10 complex, which reveals that Blm10 surrounds the proteasome entry pore in the 1.2 MDa complex to form a largely closed dome that is expected to restrict access of potential substrates. This architecture and the observation that Blm10 induces a disordered proteasome gate structure challenge the assumption that Blm10 functions as an activator of proteolysis in vivo. The Blm10 C terminus binds in the same manner as seen for 11S activators and inferred for 19S/PAN activators and indicates a unified model for gate opening. We also demonstrate that Blm10 acts to maintain mitochondrial function. Consistent with the structural data, the C-terminal residues of Blm10 are needed for this activity."

Understanding interactions between cancer cells and MSCs has become fundamental to determining whether MSC-tumour interactions should be harnessed for delivery of therapeutic agents or considered a target for intervention. Breast Cancer Cell lines (MDA-MB-231, T47D &amp; SK-Br3) were cultured alone or on a monolayer of MSCs, and retrieved using epithelial specific magnetic beads. Alterations in expression of 90 genes associated with breast tumourigenicity were analysed using low-density array. Expression of markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and array results were validated using RQ-PCR. Co-cultured cells were analysed for changes in protein expression, growth pattern and morphology. Gene expression and proliferation assays were also performed on indirect co-cultures. Following direct co-culture with MSCs, breast cancer cells expressed elevated levels of oncogenes (NCOA4, FOS), proto-oncogenes (FYN, JUN), genes associated with invasion (MMP11), angiogenesis (VEGF) and anti-apoptosis (IGF1R, BCL2). However, universal downregulation of genes associated with proliferation was observed (Ki67, MYBL2), and reflected in reduced ATP production in response to MSC-secreted factors. Significant upregulation of EMT specific markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin, Twist and Snail) was also observed following co-culture with MSCs, with a reciprocal downregulation in E-cadherin protein expression. These changes were predominantly cell contact mediated and appeared to be MSC specific. Breast cancer cell morphology and growth pattern also altered in response to MSCs. MSCs may promote breast cancer metastasis through facilitation of EMT."

In the present study, we set up a cell-based screen using a luciferase reporter plasmid carrying the whole approximately 4.7 kb 3'-UTR of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) mRNA cotransfected with a synthetic miRNA expression library to identify potential ERalpha-targeting miRNAs. Among all the miRNAs, miR-22 was found to repress robustly the luciferase signal in both HEK-293T and ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cells. Mutation of the target site was found to abrogate this repression effect of miR-22, whereas antagonism of endogenous miR-22 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in elevated reporter signals. We assessed the miR-22 expression patterns in five breast cancer cell lines and 23 clinical biopsies and revealed that there is a significant inverse association between the miR-22 levels and ERalpha protein expression. To evaluate the potential of miR-22 as a potential therapeutic intervention, we found that reduction of endogenous ERalpha protein levels and suppression of cancer cell growth could be achieved in MCF-7 cells by miR-22 overexpression in a way that can be recapitulated by the introduction of specific small interfering RNA against ERalpha. The phenomena can be rescued by the reintroduction of ERalpha. Taken together, our data indicate that miR-22 was frequently downregulated in ERalpha-positive human breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples. Direct involvement in the regulation of ERalpha may be one of the mechanisms through which miR-22 could play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer."

We previously demonstrated that the hemopexin (PEX) domain of MMP-9 is a prerequisite for enhanced cell migration. Using a biochemical approach, we now report that dimerization of MMP-9 through the PEX domain appears necessary for MMP-9-enhanced cell migration. Following a series of substitution mutations within the MMP-9 PEX domain, blade IV was shown to be critical for homodimerization, whereas blade I was required for heterodimerization with CD44. Blade I and IV mutants showed diminished enhancement of cell migration compared with wild type MMP-9-transfected cells. Peptides mimicking motifs in the outermost strands of the first and fourth blades of the MMP-9 PEX domain were designed. These peptides efficiently blocked MMP-9 dimer formation and inhibited motility of COS-1 cells overexpressing MMP-9, HT-1080, and MDA-MB-435 cells. Using a shRNA approach, CD44 was found to be a critical molecule in MMP-9-mediated cell migration. Furthermore, an axis involving a MMP-9-CD44-EGFR signaling pathway in cell migration was identified using antibody array and specific receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In conclusion, we dissected the mechanism of pro-MMP-9-enhanced cell migration and developed structure-based inhibitory peptides targeting MMP-9-mediated cell migration."

Several cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate, overexpress the cyclin D1 gene. However, the correlation of cyclin D1 overexpression with E2F target gene regulation or of cdk-dependent cyclin D1 activity with tumor development has not been identified. This suggests that the role of cyclin D1 in oncogenesis may be independent of its function as a cell cycle regulator. One such function is the role of cyclin D1 in cell adhesion and motility. Filamin A (FLNa), a member of the actin-binding filamin protein family, regulates signaling events involved in cell motility and invasion. FLNa has also been associated with a variety of cancers including lung cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, human bladder cancer, and neuroblastoma. We hypothesized that elevated cyclin D1 facilitates motility in the invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. We show that MDA-MB-231 motility is affected by disturbing cyclin D1 levels or cyclin D1-cdk4/6 kinase activity. Using mass spectrometry, we find that cyclin D1 and FLNa coimmunoprecipitate and that lower levels of cyclin D1 are associated with decreased phosphorylation of FLNa at Ser2152 and Ser1459. We also identify many proteins related to cytoskeletal function, biomolecular synthesis, organelle biogenesis, and calcium regulation whose levels of expression change concomitant with decreased cell motility induced by decreased cyclin D1 and cyclin D1-cdk4/6 activities."

Annexin II also mediates angiogenesis and enhances tumor growth and metastasis. However, the mechanism supporting this role is not known. Using human breast cancer model we show that invasive human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231) synthesize annexin II and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). In vitro both annexin II and tPA interacts which in turn convert zymogen plasminogen to reactive enzyme plasmin. Cell surface produced plasmin inhibited the migration of MDA-MB231 cells. Silencing of annexin II gene in MDA-MB231 cells abolished tPA binding therefore inhibited tPA dependent plasmin generation. These annexin II suppressed MDA-MB231 cells showed reduced motility. Immunohistochemical analysis of prediagnosed clinical specimens showed abundant secretion of tPA and expression of annexin II on the surface of invasive human breast cancer cells which correlates with neovascularization of the tumor. Taken together, these data indicate that annexin II may regulate localized plasmin generation in breast cancer. This may be an early event switching breast cancer from the prevascular phase to the vascular phase and thus contributing to aggressive cancer with the possibility of metastasis. The data provide a mechanism explaining the role of annexin II in breast cancer progression and suggest that annexin II may be an attractive target for therapeutic strategies aimed to inhibit angiogenesis and breast cancer."

The precise molecular mechanism by which the ER stress response culminates in cell death requires further clarification. The present study shows that in prostate carcinoma cells, the mda-7/IL-24-induced ER stress response causes apoptosis by translational inhibition of the antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). Forced expression of Mcl-1 blocked mda-7/IL-24 lethality, whereas RNA interference or gene knockout of Mcl-1 markedly sensitized transformed cells to mda-7/IL-24. Mcl-1 downregulation by mda-7/IL-24 relieved its association with the proapoptotic protein Bak, causing oligomerization of Bak and leading to cell death. These observations show the profound role of the Bcl-2 protein family member Mcl-1 in regulating cancer-specific apoptosis induced by this cytokine. Thus, our studies provide further insights into the molecular mechanism of ER stress-induced cancer-selective apoptosis by mda-7/IL-24.

Statins, potent inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, display anticancer activity. The molecular mechanisms by which statins block cancer cell growth are poorly understood. We demonstrate that in the tumors derived from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell xenografts, simvastatin significantly inhibited phosphorylation of Akt with concomitant attenuation of the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl(XL). In many cancer cells, Bcl(XL) is a target of NFkappaB. Simvastatin inhibited the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NFkappaB resulting in marked reduction in transcription of Bcl(XL). Signals transmitted by anti-neoplastic mechanism implanted in the cancer cells serve to obstruct the initial outgrowth of tumors. One such mechanism represents the action of the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, which negatively regulates Akt kinase activity. We provide the first evidence for significantly increased levels of PTEN in the tumors of simvastatin-administered mice. Importantly, simvastatin markedly prevented binding of NFkappaB to the two canonical recognition elements, NFRE-1 and NFRE-2 present in the PTEN promoter. Contrary to the transcriptional suppression of Bcl(XL), simvastatin significantly increased the transcription of PTEN. Furthermore, expression of NFkappaB p65 subunit inhibited transcription of PTEN, resulting in reduced protein expression, which leads to enhanced phosphorylation of Akt. Taken together, our data present a novel bifaceted mechanism where simvastatin acts on a nodal transcription factor NFkappaB, which attenuates the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl(XL) and simultaneously derepresses the expression of anti-proliferative/proapoptotic tumor suppressor PTEN to prevent breast cancer cell growth."

However, a comparative analysis of the potentially distinct functions of hypoxia in primary tumor growth and organ-specific metastasis has not been reported. Here, we show distinct hypoxia kinetics in tumors generated by the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer sublines with characteristically different primary tumor growth rates and organotropic metastasis potentials. Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis promotes both primary tumor growth and lung metastasis but is nonessential for bone metastasis. Microarray profiling revealed that hypoxia enhances the expression of a significant number of genes in the lung metastasis signature, but only activates a few bone metastasis genes, among which DUSP1 was functionally validated in this study. Despite the different mechanisms by which hypoxia promotes organ-specific metastasis, inhibition of HIF-1alpha with a dominant-negative form of HIF-1alpha or 2-methoxyestradiol reduced metastasis to both lung and bone. Consistent with the extensive functional overlap of hypoxia in promoting primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, a 45-gene hypoxia response signature efficiently stratifies breast cancer patients with low or high risks of lung metastasis, but not for bone metastasis. Our study shows distinct functions of hypoxia in regulating angiogenesis and metastasis in different organ microenvironments and establishes HIF-1alpha as a promising target for controlling organotropic metastasis of breast cancer."

IKKα regulates canonical TGFβ-SMAD signaling by interacting with SMAD3 and controlling SMAD complex formation on DNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the TGFβ-IKKα-SMAD signaling pathway induces transcription of the genes encoding SNAIL and SLUG. In addition, we demonstrate that IKKα also modulates canonical TGFβ-SMAD signaling in human MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells, arguing for a more general impact of IKKα on the control of TGFβ-SMAD signaling.

ERα-negative breast cancer is clinically aggressive and has a poor prognosis because of the lack of hormone target-directed therapies. Previous studies have shown that epigenetic regulation plays a major role in ERα silencing in human breast cancer cells. Dietary green tea polyphenol, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), is believed to be an anticancer agent in part through its regulation of epigenetic processes.RESULTS: In our current studies, we found that EGCG can reactivate ERα expression in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Combination studies using EGCG with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), revealed a synergistic effect of reactivation of ERα expression in ERα-negative breast cancer cells. Reactivation of ERα expression by EGCG and TSA treatment was found to sensitize ERα-dependent cellular responses to activator 17β-estradiol (E2) and antagonist tamoxifen in ERα-negative breast cancer cells. We also found that EGCG can lead to remodeling of the chromatin structure of the ERα promoter by altering histone acetylation and methylation status thereby resulting in ERα reactivation. A decreased binding of the transcription repressor complex, Rb/p130-E2F4/5-HDAC1-SUV39H1-DNMT1, in the regulatory region of the ERα promoter also contributes to ERα transcriptional activation through treatment with EGCG and/or TSA.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these studies show that green tea EGCG can restore ERα expression by regulating epigenetic mechanisms, and this effect is enhanced when combined with an HDAC inhibitor. This study will facilitate more effective uses of combination approaches in breast cancer therapy and will help to explore more effective chemotherapeutic strategies toward hormone-resistant breast cancer."

SATB1 mRNA expression was silenced in aggressive cells by use of short hairpin RNAs against SATB1. SATB1 was overexpressed in nonaggressive cells by use of SATB1 expression vectors. We assessed the effect of modifying SATB1 expression on the transformed phenotype by examining anchorage-independent cell proliferation, acinar morphology on matrigel, and migration by wound healing in cultured cells. We examined tumor formation and metastasis, respectively, by use of orthotopic mammary fat pad and tail vein xenograft mouse models (mice were used in groups of six, and in total, 96 mice were used). SATB1 mRNA expression was compared with outcome for patients with primary breast cancer from six previous microarray studies that included a total of 1170 patients. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: The transformed phenotype was not suppressed by SATB1 silencing in aggressive cells and was not enhanced by ectopic expression of SATB1 in nonaggressive cells. Modifying SATB1 expression did not alter anchorage-independent cell proliferation, invasive acinar morphology, or cell migration in cultured cells and did not affect tumor formation or metastasis in xenograft mouse models. In addition, SATB1 expression was not associated with decreased overall survival of patients with primary breast cancer in six previous independent microarray studies (overall odds ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval = 0.62 to 1.03, P = .10).CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous studies, we found that SATB1 expression did not promote breast cancer progression and was not associated with breast cancer outcome."

These complex epigenetic changes that we observed, along with concurrent karyotype analyses, have led us to hypothesize that complex genomic alterations in cancer cells (deletions, translocations and ploidy) are superimposed over promoter-specific methylation events that are responsible for gene-specific expression changes observed in breast cancer metastasis.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We undertook simultaneous high-resolution, whole-genome analyses of MDA-MB-468GFP and MDA-MB-468GFP-LN human breast cancer cell lines (an isogenic, paired lymphatic metastasis cell line model) using Affymetrix gene expression (U133), promoter (1.0R), and SNP/CNV (SNP 6.0) microarray platforms to correlate data from gene expression, epigenetic (DNA methylation), and combination copy number variant/single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays. Using Partek Software and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis we integrated datasets from these three platforms and detected multiple hypomethylation and hypermethylation events. Many of these epigenetic alterations correlated with gene expression changes. In addition, gene dosage events correlated with the karyotypic differences observed between the cell lines and were reflected in specific promoter methylation patterns. Gene subsets were identified that correlated hyper (and hypo) methylation with the loss (or gain) of gene expression and in parallel, with gene dosage losses and gains, respectively. Individual gene targets from these subsets were also validated for their methylation, expression and copy number status, and susceptible gene pathways were identified that may indicate how selective advantage drives the processes of tumourigenesis and metastasis.SIGNIFICANCE: Our approach allows more precisely profiling of functionally relevant epigenetic signatures that are associated with cancer progression and metastasis."

However, a responsible WNT ligand has not been identified. To further clarify this question, we comparatively investigated 22 human breast cancer brain metastases as well as the highly invasive human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and the weakly motile MCF-7 as models for the basal-like and the luminal A subtype. WNT5A and B were found overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 cells as compared with MCF-7. This corresponded to reduction of MDA-MB-231 invasiveness by WNT inhibitors, whereas MCF-7 invasion was enhanced by recombinant WNT5B and abolished by WNT and Jun-N-terminal kinase antagonists. Expression and subcellular distribution of β-catenin remained uninfluenced. Consistently, β-catenin was not localized in the nuclei of brain metastases while there was strong nuclear c-Jun staining. Similar to MDA-MB-231, metastases showed expression of WNT5A/B and the alternative WNT receptors ROR1 and 2. These findings were validated using external gene expression datasets (Gene Expression Omnibus) of different breast cancer subtypes and brain metastases. Hierarchical cluster analysis yielded a close relation between basal-like cancers and brain metastases. Gene set enrichment analyses confirmed WNT pathway enrichment not only in basal-like primaries but also in cerebral metastases of all subtypes. In conclusion, WNT signaling seems highly relevant for basal-like and other subtypes of breast cancers metastasizing into the brain. β-catenin-independent WNT signaling, presumably via ROR1-2, plays a major role in this context."

To identify microRNAs (miRNA) involved in metastasis, the expression of 254 miRNAs was measured across the following cell lines using microarray analysis: MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, cells that grew as a tumor in the mammary fat pad of nude mice (TMD-231), metastatic disease to the lungs (LMD-231), bone (BMD-231) and adrenal gland (ADMD-231). A brain-seeking variant of this cell line (231-BR) was used additionally in validation studies. Twenty miRNAs were upregulated and seven were downregulated in metastatic cancer cells compared with TMD-231 cells. The expression of the tumor suppressor miRNAs let-7 and miR-22 was consistently downregulated in metastatic cancer cells. These metastatic cells expressed higher levels of putative/proven miR-22 target oncogenes ERBB3, CDC25C and EVI-1. Introduction of miR-22 into cancer cells reduced the levels of ERBB3 and EVI-1 as well as phospho-AKT, an EVI-1 downstream target. The miR-22 primary transcript is located in the 5'-untranslated region of an open reading frame C17orf91, and the promoter/enhancer of C17orf91 drives miR-22 expression. We observed elevated C17orf91 expression in non-basal subtype compared with basal subtype breast cancers. In contrast, elevated expression of EVI-1 was observed in basal subtype and was associated with poor outcome in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients. These results suggest that metastatic cancer cells increase specific oncogenic signaling proteins through downregulation of miRNAs. Identifying such metastasis-specific oncogenic pathways may help to manipulate tumor behavior and aid in the design of more effective targeted therapies."

Array-based methods have proven utility to detect in a single assay at a reasonable cost any microbe from the thousands that have been sequenced.METHODS: We designed a pan-Microbial Detection Array (MDA) to detect all known viruses (including phages), bacteria and plasmids and developed a novel statistical analysis method to identify mixtures of organisms from complex samples hybridized to the array. The array has broader coverage of bacterial and viral targets and is based on more recent sequence data and more probes per target than other microbial detection/discovery arrays in the literature. Family-specific probes were selected for all sequenced viral and bacterial complete genomes, segments, and plasmids. Probes were designed to tolerate some sequence variation to enable detection of divergent species with homology to sequenced organisms, and to have no significant matches to the human genome sequence.RESULTS: In blinded testing on spiked samples with single or multiple viruses, the MDA was able to correctly identify species or strains. In clinical fecal, serum, and respiratory samples, the MDA was able to detect and characterize multiple viruses, phage, and bacteria in a sample to the family and species level, as confirmed by PCR.CONCLUSIONS: The MDA can be used to identify the suite of viruses and bacteria present in complex samples."

Recently, stress-induced catecholamines have been shown to increase the expression of various cancer progressive factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinases and interleukins. However, a detailed mechanism remains to be identified. In this study, we investigated the role of adrenergic receptors and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α protein in catecholamine-induced VEGF expression and angiogenesis. Treatment of the cells with norepinephrine (NE) or isoproterenol induced VEGF expression and HIF-1α protein amount in a dose-dependent manner. Induction of VEGF expression by NE was abrogated when the cells were transfected with HIF-1α-specific siRNA. Similarly, adenylate cyclase activator forskolin and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 enhanced and decreased HIF-1α protein amount, respectively. More importantly, conditioned medium of NE-stimulated cancer cells induced angiogenesis in a HIF-1α protein-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment of cells with propranolol, a β-adrenergic receptor (AR) blocker, completely abolished induction of VEGF expression and HIF-1α protein amount by NE in all of the tested cancer cells. However, treatment with the α1-AR blocker prazosin inhibited NE-induced HIF-1α protein amount and angiogenesis in SK-Hep1 and PC-3 but not MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, our results suggest that ARs and HIF-1α protein have critical roles in NE-induced VEGF expression in cancer cells, leading to stimulation of angiogenesis. These findings will help to understand the mechanism of cancer progression by stress-induced catecholamines and design therapeutic strategies for cancer angiogenesis."

PKCvarepsilon-mediated oncogenic activity is linked to its ability to promote cell survival. However, the mechanisms by which PKCvarepsilon signals cell survival remain elusive. We found that signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3), which is constitutively activated in a wide variety of human cancers, is a protein partner of PKCvarepsilon. Stat3 has two conserved amino-acid (Tyr705 and Ser727) residues, which are phosphorylated during Stat3 activation. PKCvarepsilon interacts with Stat3alpha isoform, which has Ser727, and not with Stat3beta isoform, which lacks Ser727. PKCvarepsilon-Stat3 interaction and Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation was initially observed during induction of squamous cell carcinomas and in prostate cancer. Now we present that (1) PKCvarepsilon physically interacts with Stat3alpha isoform in various human cancer cells: skin melanomas (MeWo and WM266-4), gliomas (T98G and MO59K), bladder (RT-4 and UM-UC-3), colon (Caco-2), lung (H1650), pancreatic (PANC-1), and breast (MCF-7 and MDA:MB-231); (2) inhibition of PKCvarepsilon expression using specific siRNA inhibits Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation, Stat3-DNA binding, Stat3-regulated gene expression as well as cell invasion; and (3) PKCvarepsilon mediates Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation through integration with the MAPK cascade (RAF-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2).

MDA-9/syntenin affects cancer cell motility and invasion through distinct biochemical and signaling pathways, including focal adhesion kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), resulting in activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway. MDA-9/syntenin also promotes melanoma metastasis by activating c-Src, but how c-Src regulates NF-kappaB activation is unclear. Using a human melanoma model, we document that MDA-9/syntenin-c-Src interactions are positive regulators of NF-kappaB activation. Inhibition of c-Src by PP2 treatment, by blocking c-Src or mda-9/syntenin expression with small interfering RNA, or in c-Src (-/-) knockout cell lines, reduces NF-kappaB activation following overexpression of mda-9/syntenin or c-Src. Deletion or point mutations of the PDZ binding motif preventing MDA-9/syntenin association with c-Src reveals that both PDZ domains, with PDZ2 being the dominant module, are required for activating downstream signaling pathways, including p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB. We also document that MDA-9/syntenin-c-Src complexes functionally cooperate with NF-kappaB to promote anchorage-independent growth, motility and invasion of melanoma cells.

Traditional methods of genome wide microarray analysis, profiling steady-state levels of mRNA, may miss important mRNA targets owing to significant posttranscriptional gene regulation by RNA binding proteins (RBPs).METHODS: The ribonomic approach, utilizing RNA immunoprecipitation hybridized to microarray (RIP-Chip), provides global identification of putative endogenous mRNA targets of different RBPs. HuR is an RBP that binds to the AU-rich elements (ARE) of labile mRNAs, such as proto-oncogenes, facilitating their translation into protein. HuR has been shown to play a role in cancer progression and elevated levels of cytoplasmic HuR directly correlate with increased invasiveness and poor prognosis for many cancers, including those of the breast. HuR has been described to control genes in several of the acquired capabilities of cancer and has been hypothesized to be a tumor-maintenance gene, allowing for cancers to proliferate once they are established.RESULTS: We used HuR RIP-Chip as a comprehensive and systematic method to survey breast cancer target genes in both MCF-7 (estrogen receptor positive, ER+) and MDA-MB-231 (estrogen receptor negative, ER-) breast cancer cell lines. We identified unique subsets of HuR-associated mRNAs found individually or in both cell types. Two novel HuR targets, CD9 and CALM2 mRNAs, were identified and validated by quantitative RT-PCR and biotin pull-down analysis.CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a side-by-side genome-wide comparison of HuR-associated targets in wild type ER+ and ER- breast cancer. We found distinct, differentially expressed subsets of cancer related genes in ER+ and ER- breast cancer cell lines, and noted that the differential regulation of two cancer-related genes by HuR was contingent upon the cellular environment."

The reason for this association is unclear. We have previously shown that cadherin-11 (also known as OB-cadherin), a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that mediates osteoblast adhesion, plays a role in the metastasis of PCa to bone. Here, we report that androgen-deprivation therapy up-regulates cadherin-11 expression in PCa. In human PCa specimens, immunohistochemical staining showed that 22/26 (85%) primary PCa tumours from men with castration-resistant PCa expressed cadherin-11. In contrast, only 7/50 (14%) androgen-dependent PCa tumours expressed cadherin-11. In the MDA-PCa-2b xenograft animal model, cadherin-11 was expressed in the recurrent tumours following castration. In the PCa cell lines, there is an inverse correlation between expression of cadherin-11 and androgen receptor (AR), and cadherin-11 is expressed in very low levels or not expressed in AR-positive cell lines, including LNCaP, C4-2B4 and VCaP cells. We showed that AR likely regulates cadherin-11 expression in PCa through an indirect mechanism. Although re-expression of AR in the AR-negative PC3 cells led to the inhibition of cadherin-11 expression, depletion of androgen from the culture medium or down-regulation of AR by RNA interference in the C4-2B4 cells or VCaP cells only produced a modest increase of cadherin-11 expression. Promoter analysis indicated that cadherin-11 promoter does not contain a typical AR-binding element, and AR elicits a modest inhibition of cadherin-11 promoter activity, suggesting that AR does not regulate cadherin-11 expression directly. Together, these results suggest that androgen deprivation up-regulates cadherin-11 expression in prostate cancer, and this may contribute to the metastasis of PCa to bone. Our study suggests that therapeutic strategies that block cadherin-11 expression or function may be considered when applying androgen-ablation therapy."

TNFα is a major inflammatory cytokine present in the tumor microenvironment and has a profound influence on the progression of tumor development. This study was aimed to investigate the role of BM-MSCs in tumor promotion in response to TNFα. Quantitative real-time PCR arrays show that diverse cytokines/chemokines were induced in TNFα-treated BM-MSCs; in particular, CXCR3 ligand chemokines, including CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, were potently induced. A serial and site-directed mutation analysis in the CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 promoters revealed that NF-κB binding elements were responsible for TNFα-induced promoter activation of CXCR3 ligand chemokines. TNFα stimulated NF-κB activity, and ectopic expression of NF-κB enhanced TNFα-induced promoter activities of the CXCR3 ligand chemokines. Gel shift and supershift assays showed that NF-κB was associated with CXCR3 ligand chemokine promoters in response to TNFα treatment. All three CXCR3 ligand chemokines enhanced the migration and invasive motility of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells expressing CXCR3. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with CXCL10 activated small GTPase of Rho family proteins, such as RhoA and Cdc42. CXCL9-, CXCL10-, or CXCL11-induced invasive capability of MDA-MB-231 cells was completely abrogated in the presence of a neutralizing anti-CXCR3 antibody in the culture medium. Moreover, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 stimulated the expression of MMP-9, but not MMP-2, in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results suggest that BM-MSCs promote the locomotion of breast cancer cells through CXCR3 ligand-mediated actin rearrangement by TNFα in the tumor microenvironment."

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of capsaicin-induced autophagy in malignant (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and normal (MCF10A) human breast cells. Capsaicin caused nonapoptotic cell cycle arrest of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells but induced apoptosis in MCF10A cells. In MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, capsaicin induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via inositol-requiring 1 and Chop and induced autophagy, as demonstrated by microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain-3 (LC3) conversion. Autophagy blocking by 3-methyladenine (3MA) or bafilomycin A1 (BaF1) activated caspase-4 and -7 and enhanced cell death. In MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, p38 was activated for more than 48 h by capsaicin treatment, but extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation decreased after 12 h, and LC3II levels continuously increased. Furthermore, treatment with 3MA markedly down-regulated capsaicin-induced p38 activation and LC3 conversion, and BaF1 completely down-regulated ERK activation and led to LC3II accumulation. In addition, pharmacological blockade or knockdown of the p38 gene down-regulated Akt activation and LC3II levels but did not affect ERK, and pharmacological blockade or knockdown of the ERK gene up-regulated LC3II induction by capsaicin. Knockdown of inositol-requiring 1 down-regulated p38-Akt signaling. In MCF10A cells, capsaicin did not elicit p38 activation and LC3 conversion and caused the sustained activation of caspase-4. Collectively, capsaicin-induced autophagy is regulated by p38 and ERK; p38 controls autophagy at the sequestration step, whereas ERK controls autophagy at the maturation step, and that autophagy is involved in the retardation of cell death by blocking capsaicin-induced ER stress-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-321 cells."

In reporter assays, SRA ncRNA enhances nuclear receptor and myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD)-mediated transcription but also participates in specific corepressor complexes, serving as a distinct scaffold. That SRA RNA levels might affect some biological functions, such as proliferation, apoptosis, steroidogenesis, and myogenesis, has been reported. However, the breadth of endogenous target genes that might be regulated by SRA RNAs remains largely unknown. To address this, we depleted SRA RNA in two human cancer cell lines with small interfering RNAs and then assayed for changes in gene expression by microarray analyses. The majority of significantly changed genes were reduced upon SRA knockdown, implicating SRA RNAs as endogenous coactivators. Unexpectedly, only a small subset of direct estrogen receptor-alpha target genes was affected in estradiol-treated MCF-7 cells. Eight bona fide SRA downstream target genes were identified (SLC2A3, SLC2A12, CCL20, TGFB2, DIO2, TMEM65, TBL1X, and TMPRSS2), representing entirely novel SRA targets, except for TMPRSS2. These data suggest unanticipated roles for SRA in glucose uptake, cellular signaling, T(3) hormone generation, and invasion/metastasis. SRA depletion in MDA-MB-231 cells reduced invasiveness and expression of some genes critical for this process. Consistent with the knockdown data, overexpressed SRA ncRNA coactivates certain target promoters and may enhance the activity of some coregulatory proteins. This study is a valuable resource because it represents the first genome-wide analysis of a mammalian RNA coregulator."

Detection of their expression may lead to identifying novel markers for breast cancer.METHODS: We profiled miRNA expression in three breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468) and then focused on one miRNA, miR-339-5p, for its role in regulation of tumor cell growth, migration, and invasion and target gene expression. We then analyzed miR-339-5p expression in benign and cancerous breast tissue specimens.RESULTS: A number of miRNAs were differentially expressed in these cancer cell lines. Real-time PCR indicated that miR-339-5p expression was downregulated in the aggressive cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 and in breast cancer tissues compared with benign tissues. Transfection of miR-339-5p oligonucleotides reduced cancer cell growth only slightly but significantly decreased tumor cell migration and invasion capacity compared with controls. Real-time PCR analysis showed that BCL-6, a potential target gene of miR-339-5p, was downregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by miR-339-5p transfection. Furthermore, the reduced miR-339-5p expression was associated with an increase in metastasis to lymph nodes and with high clinical stages. Kaplan-Meier analyses found that the patients with miR-339-5p expression had better overall and relapse-free survivals compared with those without miR-339-5p expression. Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that miR-339-5p expression was an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients.CONCLUSIONS: MiR-339-5p may play an important role in breast cancer progression, suggesting that miR-339-5p should be further evaluated as a biomarker for predicting the survival of breast cancer patients."

However, the MCF-7 cell line, which has a luminal epithelial-like phenotype and lacks a CD44+/CD24- subpopulation, has rare cell populations with higher Matrigel invasive ability. Thus, what are the potentially important differences between invasive and non-invasive breast cancer cells, and are the differences related to EMT or CD44/CD24 expression?METHODS: Throughout the sequential selection process using Matrigel, we obtained MCF-7-14 cells of opposite migratory and invasive capabilities from MCF-7 cells. Comparative analysis of epithelial and mesenchymal marker expression was performed between parental MCF-7, selected MCF-7-14, and aggressive mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, using microarray expression profiles of these cells, we selected differentially expressed genes for their invasive potential, and performed pathway and network analysis to identify a set of interesting genes, which were evaluated by RT-PCR, flow cytometry or function-blocking antibody treatment.RESULTS: MCF-7-14 cells had enhanced migratory and invasive ability compared with MCF-7 cells. Although MCF-7-14 cells, similar to MCF-7 cells, expressed E-cadherin but neither vimentin nor fibronectin, beta-catenin was expressed not only on the cell membrane but also in the nucleus. Furthermore, using gene expression profiles of MCF-7, MCF-7-14 and MDA-MB-231 cells, we demonstrated that MCF-7-14 cells have alterations in signaling pathways regulating cell migration and identified a set of genes (PIK3R1, SOCS2, BMP7, CD44 and CD24). Interestingly, MCF-7-14 and its invasive clone CL6 cells displayed increased CD44 expression and downregulated CD24 expression compared with MCF-7 cells. Anti-CD44 antibody treatment significantly decreased cell migration and invasion in both MCF-7-14 and MCF-7-14 CL6 cells as well as MDA-MB-231 cells.CONCLUSIONS: MCF-7-14 cells are a novel model for breast cancer metastasis without requiring constitutive EMT and are categorized as a &quot;metastable phenotype&quot;, which can be distinguished from both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The alterations and characteristics of MCF-7-14 cells, especially nuclear beta-catenin and CD44 upregulation, may characterize invasive cell populations in breast cancer."

Mice were divided into normal group, colitis control group, low-dose Res-treated group (RLD-treated group), and high-dose Res-treated group (RHD-treated group). Inhibitory effects of concomitant treatment with Res were assessed daily using a Disease Activity Index (DAI) and severity of histological changes. MDA, MPO, SOD and GSH-PX activity of colonic tissue were determined in colon samples by chemical colorimetry. TNF-alpha, IL-8, IFN-gamma, p22(phox) and gp91(phox) expression levels were detected using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), ELISA, and Western blot analysis.RESULT: Administration of Res significantly inhibited the severity of UC compared to the colitis control group. Colonic tissue MDA and MPO activities decreased significantly in Res-treated groups compared to colitis control groups. Furthermore, colonic tissue SOD and GSH-Px activities increased significantly in Res-treated groups compared to colitis control groups.

RAR beta 2 promoter in the tested fragment was partially methylated in MCF-7 cells and non-methylated in MDA-MB-231 cells. In MCF-7 cells, all compounds, except for resveratrol, inhibited promoter methylation and increased expression of RAR beta 2. All natural compounds improved the action of 2CdA and F-ara-A on RAR beta 2 methylation and/or expression. Combination of ATRA or vitamin D(3) with 2CdA was the most effective. In MDA-MB-231 cells, only 2CdA, F-ara-A, and ATRA induced RAR beta 2 expression without any notable effects in combined treatment. Our results demonstrate that both natural compounds and adenosine analogues are able to reduce promoter methylation and/or induce expression of RAR beta 2 in non-invasive MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the natural compounds improve effects of adenosine analogues, however only at early non-invasive stages of carcinogenesis."

Overexpression of Id proteins, especially Id1, correlates with unfavorable clinical prognosis. Thus, they are attractive molecular targets for anticancer therapy. Overexpression of Id proteins mediates breast cancer metastasis to lung. Targeting Id1 and Id3 expression in breast cancer cells reduces breast cancer metastasis in animal models. Different breast tumors failed to grow and/or metastasize in Id1 (+/-) Id3 (-/-) mice. Id1 and Id3 preferentially dimerize with the key regulatory E-proteins which inhibit the expression of different tumor suppressor genes. Nevertheless, the inhibition of tumorigenic activities of Id1 and Id3 at protein level has never been studied. Here, we isolated a novel peptide aptamer, Id1/3-PA7, specifically interacting with Id1 and Id3 from randomized combinatorial expression library using yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems. Intracellular delivered Id1/3-PA7 co-localized to Id1 and Id3 and interfered with their functions. It repressed E47 protein sequestration by Id1 and Id3, activated the E-box promoter and increased the expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKN1A and CDKN1B) in a dose-dependent fashion, paralleled by the cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). These effects were counteracted by ectopically overexpressed Id1 and Id3. Peptide aptamer Id1/3-PA7 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. In conclusion, Id1/3-PA7 could represent a nontoxic exogenous agent that can significantly provoke antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in breast cancer cells, which are associated with deregulated expression of Id1 and Id3."

Fibroblast primary cultures were established from negative and positive lymph nodes from breast cancer patients and a similar gene expression pattern was identified, following cell culture. Fibroblasts and breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231, MDA-MB435, and MCF7) were cultured alone or co-cultured separated by a porous membrane (which allows passage of soluble factors) for comparison. Each breast cancer lineage exerted a particular effect on fibroblasts viability and transcriptional profile. However, fibroblasts from positive and negative nodes had a parallel transcriptional behavior when co-cultured with a specific breast cancer cell line. The effects of nodal fibroblasts on breast cancer cells were also investigated. MDA MB-231 cells viability and migration were enhanced by the presence of fibroblasts and accordingly, MDA-MB435 and MCF7 cells viability followed a similar pattern. MDA-MB231 gene expression profile, as evaluated by cDNA microarray, was influenced by the fibroblasts presence, and HNMT, COMT, FN3K, and SOD2 were confirmed downregulated in MDA-MB231 co-cultured cells with fibroblasts from both negative and positive nodes, in a new series of RT-PCR assays. In summary, transcriptional changes induced in breast cancer cells by fibroblasts from positive as well as negative nodes are very much alike in a specific lineage. However, fibroblasts effects are distinct in each one of the breast cancer lineages, suggesting that the inter-relationships between stromal and malignant cells are dependent on the intrinsic subtype of the tumor."

This study investigated whether/how PTHrP (1-34) signaling regulates expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced by BC cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mouse model of bone metastasis was prepared by inoculating mice with tumour cell suspensions of the human BC cell line MDA-MB-231 via the left cardiac ventricle. VEGF expression was examined by Western blot and real-time RT-PCR analysis, as well as by confocal microscopy in the bone microenvironment.RESULTS: PTHrP was expressed in cancer cells producing PTH/PTHrP receptor and VEGF that had invaded the bone marrow, and PTHrP was up-regulated VEGF in MDA-MB-231 in vitro. The culture medium conditioned by PTHrP-treated MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated angiogenesis and osteoclastogenesis compared with control medium, giving a response that was inhibited by VEGF-neutralizing antibody treatment. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) prevented PTHrP-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38 activation, and PTHrP-induced VEGF expression.CONCLUSION: PTHrP plays an important role in modulating the angiogenic and bone osteolytic actions of VEGF through PKC-dependent activation of an ERK1/2 and p38 signaling pathway during bone metastasis by breast cancer cells."

A previous study identified the transcription factor NR4A1 as a gene upregulated in primary breast cancer compared with normal tissue by microarray analysis and sequencing technologies. The purpose of the study was to identify the role of NR4A1 in normal mammary epithelial and breast cancer cell biology.METHODS: NR4A1 expression in breast tumours was assessed by semiquantitative and real-time PCR using RNA from normal and tumour samples or breast cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays was performed to check NR4A1 protein expression in breast tumours. MCF-10A and 226L normal mammary epithelial cells as well as the tumour lines PMC42, ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-231 were transduced with full-length NR4A1, and the ability of NR4A1-overexpressing cells to migrate was tested using scratch wound or transwell migration assays. Proliferation was measured using the MTT and BrdU assays, while apoptosis was determined by the Annexin V assay. The ability of the cells to adhere to extracellular matrix was tested by adhesion assays and integrin cell surface expression was measured by flow cytometry. Activation of the FAK as well as ERK1/2 and PI3K pathways was checked by western blotting.RESULTS: Breast tissue microarray analysis showed NR4A1 expression in primary tumours, which was reduced in higher grade and metastatic tumours. Ectopic expression of NR4A1 in MCF-10A, 226L, PMC42 and ZR-75-1 cells led to reduced ability of the cells to migrate, while no differences were observed in their proliferation and apoptotic index. NR4A1 expression altered the ability of the MCF-10A cells to adhere to the extracellular matrix and affected cell surface expression of integrins.CONCLUSIONS: NR4A1 acts as an antimigratory factor in two normal mammary epithelial and two breast cancer cell lines tested. It is therefore possible that NR4A1 acts as an antimigratory factor in breast tumours, and further studies should be conducted to understand the mechanisms involved."

A growing body of evidence suggests that deregulation of histone modification patterns, upstream or downstream of DNA methylation, is a critical event in cancer initiation and progression. However, a comprehensive description of how histone modifications, singly or in combination, is disrupted in transformed cells is missing; consequently the issue whether and how specific changes in histone PTMs patterns correlate to particular tumor features is still elusive. In the present study, we focused on human breast cancer and comprehensively analyzed PTMs on histone H3 and H4 from four cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB231, MDA-MB453 and T-47D), in comparison with normal epithelial breast cells. We performed high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis of histones, in combination with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), to quantitatively track the modification changes in cancer cells, as compared to their normal counterpart. Our investigation focuses on lysine acetylation and methylation on fourteen distinct sites in H3 and H4. We observed significant changes for several modifications in cancer cells: while in a few cases those modifications had been previously described as a hallmark of human tumors, we could identify novel modifications, whose abundance is significantly altered in breast cancer cells. Overall, these modifications may represent part of a &quot;breast cancer-specific epigenetic signature&quot;, with implications in the characterization of histone-related biomarkers. This work demonstrates that SILAC-based proteomics is a powerful tool to study qualitatively and quantitatively histone PTMs patterns, contributing significantly to the comprehension of epigenetic phenomena in cancer biology."

The aim of our study was to investigate more specifically whether periostin expression is associated with bone metastases from breast cancer and to determine its source in the affected bone. Nude mice were inoculated with human MDA-B02 breast cancer cells. Bone metastases-bearing mice were treated with zoledronic acid-an antiresorptive drug-or vehicle. Bone metastases were examined for tumor- and stroma-derived periostin expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction with human- and mouse-specific primers and immunohistochemistry. Serum periostin and conventional bone turnover markers were also measured. MDA-B02 cells did not express periostin both in vitro and in vivo. However, mouse-derived periostin was markedly overexpressed (eightfold) in metastatic legs compared to noninoculated mice. Serum periostin levels were also markedly increased in metastatic mice and correlated with in situ expression levels. Immunostaining showed that periostin derived from the environing stromal cells of bone metastasis. Bone turnover blockade by zoledronic acid markedly decreased osteolytic lesions but only slightly modulated serum periostin levels. Bone metastases from breast cancer induce overexpression of periostin by surrounding stromal cells. Periostin could be a biochemical marker of the early stromal response associated to breast cancer bone metastasis formation."

Two public breast tumor datasets were analysed to identify PTPs/DSPs differentially expressed in HER2-positive tumors.RESULTS: In cells (1) HER2-inhibition up-regulated 4 PTPs (PTPRA, PTPRK, PTPN11, PTPN18) and 11 DSPs (7 MKPs [MAP Kinase Phosphatases], 2 PTP4, 2 MTMRs [Myotubularin related phosphatases]) and down-regulated 7 DSPs (2 MKPs, 2 MTMRs, CDKN3, PTEN, CDC25C); (2) HER2-activation with EGF affected 10 DSPs (5 MKPs, 2 MTMRs, PTP4A1, CDKN3, CDC25B) and PTPN13; 8 DSPs were found in both groups. Furthermore, 7 PTPs/DSPs displayed also altered protein level. Analysis of 2 breast cancer datasets identified 6 differentially expressed DSPs: DUSP6, strongly up-regulated in both datasets; DUSP10 and CDC25B, up-regulated; PTP4A2, CDC14A and MTMR11 down-regulated in one dataset.CONCLUSIONS: Several DSPs, mainly MKPs and, unexpectedly, MTMRs, were altered following HER2-modulation in cells and 3 DSPs (DUSP6, CDC25B and MTMR11) were altered in both cells and tumors. Among these, DUSP6, strongly up-regulated in HER2-positive tumors, would deserve further investigation as tumor marker or potential therapy target."

Finding protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPs) that can specifically regulate the function of ErbB should help design novel therapies for treatment. By performing a small interfering RNA screen against 43 human PTPs, we find that knockdown of protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN9 significantly increases ErbB2 tyrosyl phosphorylation in the SKBR3 breast cancer cell line. In addition, knockdown of PTPN9 expression also enhances tyrosyl phosphorylation of the ErbB1/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Conversely, increasing expression of PTPN9 wild type (WT) inhibits tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB2 and EGFR. To test whether ErbB2 and EGFR are substrates of PTPN9, PTPN9 WT, and a substrate trapping mutant (PTPN9 DA) are overexpressed in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Compared with vector control, expression of PTPN9 WT significantly inhibits whereas expression of PTPN9 DA dramatically enhances tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB2 and EGFR, respectively. In contrast, expression of PTPN9 WT or DA mutant does not affect tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB3 and Shc. Importantly, coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase fusion protein pulldown experiments show that tyrosol-phosphorylated ErbB2 or EGFR is preferentially associated with PTPN9 DA compared with PTPN9 WT, indicating that ErbB2 and EGFR are substrates of PTPN9. Furthermore, PTPN9 WT expression specifically impairs EGF-induced STAT3 and STAT5 activation, and inhibits the cell growth in soft agar. Last, PTPN9 WT expression also reduces invasion and MMP2 expression of MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data suggest PTPN9 as a negative regulator of breast cancer cells by targeting ErbB2 and EGFR and inhibiting STAT activation."

A pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide that targets the activator protein-1 (AP-1)-binding site of the MMP-9 promoter was designed and synthesized as a gene-silencing agent for tumor metastases. The synthesized product showed selective DNA binding ability. The MMP-9 PI polyamide significantly inhibited MMP-9's mRNA expression, protein level, and enzymatic activity in human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231). Furthermore, the MMP-9 PI polyamide inhibited migration and invasion by in vitro wound-healing and matrigel-invasion assay. The FITC-labeled PI polyamide was localized in nuclei in 45 min of incubation with an MDA-MB-231 cell and remained in the nuclei for up to 96 h after incubation in vitro. It was also quickly localized in the mouse cellular nuclei of many tissues, including liver, kidney, and spleen, after intravenous injection without using any drug-delivery system. Moreover, the polyamide treatment significantly decreased metastasis in a mouse model of liver metastasis. Our results suggest that this PI polyamide, which targets the MMP-9 gene promoter, can be a novel MMP-9 down-regulating molecule for antimetastasis."

At least part of this effect is mediated by stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF1a) and activating its downstream signaling. Recent studies reported that hypoxia signaling might either antagonize or enhance c-myc activity depending on cell context. We investigated the effect of nickel on c-myc levels, and demonstrated that nickel, hypoxia, and other hypoxia mimetics degraded c-myc protein in a number of cancer cells (A549, MCF-7, MDA-453, and BT-474). The degradation of the c-Myc protein was mediated by the 26S proteosome. Interestingly, knockdown of both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha attenuated c-Myc degradation induced by Nickel and hypoxia, suggesting the functional HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha was required for c-myc degradation. Further studies revealed two potential pathways mediated nickel and hypoxia induced c-myc degradation. Phosphorylation of c-myc at T58 was significantly increased in cells exposed to nickel or hypoxia, leading to increased ubiquitination through Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase. In addition, nickel and hypoxia exposure decreased USP28, a c-myc de-ubiquitinating enzyme, contributing to a higher steady state level of c-myc ubiquitination and promoting c-myc degradation. Furthermore, the reduction of USP28 protein by hypoxia signaling is due to both protein degradation and transcriptional repression. Nickel and hypoxia exposure significantly increased the levels of dimethylated H3 lysine 9 at the USP28 promoter and repressed its expression. Our study demonstrated that Nickel and hypoxia exposure increased c-myc T58 phosphorylation and decreased USP28 protein levels in cancer cells, which both lead to enhanced c-myc ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation."

We describe a new tool for dissecting ERα action in breast cancer, p-fluoro-4-(1,2,3,6,-tetrahydro-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxo-6-thionpurin-8-ylthio) (TPSF), a potent small-molecule inhibitor of estrogen receptor α that does not compete with estrogen for binding to ERα. TPSF noncompetitively inhibits estrogen-dependent ERα-mediated gene expression with little inhibition of transcriptional activity by NF-κB or the androgen or glucocorticoid receptor. TPSF inhibits E(2)-ERα-mediated induction of the proteinase inhibitor 9 gene, which is activated by ERα binding to estrogen response element DNA, and the cyclin D1 gene, which is induced by tethering ERα to other DNA-bound proteins. TPSF inhibits anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent E(2)-ERα-stimulated growth of MCF-7 cells but does not inhibit growth of ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. TPSF also inhibits ERα-dependent growth in three cellular models for tamoxifen resistance; that is, 4-hydroxytamoxifen-stimulated MCF7ERαHA cells that overexpress ERα, fully tamoxifen-resistant BT474 cells that have amplified HER-2 and AIB1, and partially tamoxifen-resistant ZR-75 cells. TPSF reduces ERα protein levels in MCF-7 cells and several other cell lines without altering ERα mRNA levels. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 abolished down-regulation of ERα by TPSF. Thus, TPSF affects receptor levels at least in part due to its ability to enhance proteasome-dependent degradation of ERα. TPSF represents a novel class of ER inhibitor with significant clinical potential."

RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor gene. However, very little is known about the function of RASSF1C both in normal and transformed cells.METHODS: Gene silencing and over-expression techniques were used to modulate RASSF1C expression in human breast cancer cells. Affymetrix-microarray analysis was performed using T47D cells over-expressing RASSF1C to identify RASSF1C target genes. RT-PCR and western blot techniques were used to validate target gene expression. Cell invasion and apoptosis assays were also performed.RESULTS: In this article, we report the effects of altering RASSF1C expression in human breast cancer cells. We found that silencing RASSF1C mRNA in breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB231 and T47D) caused a small but significant decrease in cell proliferation. Conversely, inducible over-expression of RASSF1C in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231 and T47D) resulted in a small increase in cell proliferation. We also report on the identification of novel RASSF1C target genes. RASSF1C down-regulates several pro-apoptotic and tumor suppressor genes and up-regulates several growth promoting genes in breast cancer cells. We further show that down-regulation of caspase 3 via overexpression of RASSF1C reduces breast cancer cells' sensitivity to the apoptosis inducing agent, etoposide. Furthermore, we found that RASSF1C over-expression enhances T47D cell invasion/migration in vitro.CONCLUSION: Together, our findings suggest that RASSF1C, unlike RASSF1A, is not a tumor suppressor, but instead may play a role in stimulating metastasis and survival in breast cancer cells."

Recently, reelin was found to be epigenetically silenced in gastric and pancreatic cancers in which down-regulation was associated with increased migratory ability and reduced survival. Here we analyzed reelin expression by immunohistochemistry in 17 normal breast tissue samples from reduction mammoplasties and in two independent tissue microarrays of 136 and more than 2000 breast cancer biopsy samples, respectively. Results were analyzed with regard to clinical parameters, including BRE (Bloom, Richardson, Elston) grade, nodal status, estrogen receptor and HER2 status, and overall survival. Reelin was expressed in the luminal epithelium and myoepithelium of the normal human breast but not in cancerous breasts. Loss of reelin protein expression correlated significantly with decreased survival (P=0.01) and positive lymph node status (P&lt;0.001). By measuring reelin expression and promoter methylation status in 39 primary breast tumors, as well as in breast cancer-derived cell lines before and after decitabine treatment, we established that reelin expression levels correlated inversely with promoter methylation status, whereas demethylation increased reelin mRNA expression in vitro. Reelin overexpression in MDA-MB231 cells, as well as incubation with recombinant reelin, suppressed cell migration, invadopodia formation, and invasiveness in vitro. We conclude that reelin may play an important role in controlling invasiveness and metastatic potential of breast cancer cells and that its expression is controlled by promoter methylation."

However, cell behavior is significantly impacted by signals from the local microenvironment. Therefore, we investigated how the combinatorial effect of the location of injection and procedural differences affected xenograft characteristics. Patient-derived breast cancer cells were injected into mouse abdominal or thoracic mammary glands +/- estrogen and/or etoposide pretreatment. Abdominal xenografts had increased tumor incidence and volume, and decreased latency (P &lt; 0.001) compared to thoracic tumors. No statistically significant difference in tumor volume was found in abdominal xenografts treated +/- estrogen or etoposide; however, etoposide suppressed tumor volume in thoracic xenografts (P &lt; 0.02). The combination of estrogen and etoposide significantly decreased tumor incidence in both sites. In addition, mice treated +/- estradiol were injected orthotopically or subcutaneously with well-characterized breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, ZR75-1, MDA MB-231, or MCF10Ca1h). Orthotopic injection increased tumor volume; growth varied with estrogen supplementation. Location also altered methylation status of several breast cancer-related gene promoters. Lastly, vascularization of orthotopic tumors was significantly enhanced compared to subcutaneous tumors. These data suggest that optimal xenograft success occurs with orthotopic abdominal injections and illustrate molecular details of the compelling influence of the local microenvironment on in vivo models."

In the present study, we elucidated the roles of miR-520b and miR-520e in breast cancer cells. We examined the expression levels of miR-520b and miR-520e in the immortalized breast cell line, HBL-100, and in three breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7, LM-MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. We show the expression levels of miR-520b and miR-520e in the breast cancer cell lines were lower than that in the HBL-100 cells. Furthermore, the breast cancer cell lines showed less sensitivity to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). We found that overexpression of miR-520b and miR-520e increases the sensitivity of the breast cancer cells to CDC, whereas further suppression of miR-520b and miR-520e decreases the sensitivity of the breast cancer cells to CDC. We then demonstrate that miR-520b and miR-520e are able to directly target the 3'untranslated regions (3'UTR) of the membrane-bound complement regulatory protein CD46; suggesting that miR-520b and miR-520e down-regulate CD46 at post-transcriptional level. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that overexpression of miR-520b and miR-520e results in the increased expression of C3b, which is mediated by downregulated CD46. These results suggest that miRNA-520b and miR-520e mediated down-regulation of CD46 induces opsonization of cancer cells via an alternative pathway resulting in complement activation. Thus, we conclude that miR-520b and miR-520e contribute to CDC in breast cancer cells via directly targeting the 3'UTR of CD46."

Their expression can be regulated by Endothelin1 (ET1), a peptide associated with breast cancer invasive phenotype. Deregulation of DLX gene expression was found in human solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In particular, DLX4 overexpression represents a possible prognostic marker in ovarian cancer. We have investigated the role of DLX genes in human breast cancer progression.METHODS: MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells were grown in vitro or injected in nude mice, either subcutaneously, to mimic primary tumor growth, or intravenously, to mimic metastatic spreading. Expression of DLX2, DLX5 and DLX6 was assessed in cultured cells, either treated or not with ET1, tumors and metastases by RT-PCR. In situ hybridization was used to confirm DLX gene expression in primary tumors and in lung and bone metastases. The expression of DLX2 and DLX5 was evaluated in 408 primary human breast cancers examining the GSE1456 and GSE3494 microarray datasets. Kaplan-Meier estimates for disease-free survival were calculated for the patients grouped on the basis of DLX2/DLX5 expression.RESULTS: Before injection, or after subcutaneous growth, MDA-MB-231 cells expressed DLX2 but neither DLX5 nor DLX6. Instead, in bone and lung metastases resulting from intravenous injection we detected expression of DLX5/6 but not of DLX2, suggesting that DLX5/6 are activated during metastasis formation, and that their expression is alternative to that of DLX2. The in vitro treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with ET1, resulted in switch from DLX2 to DLX5 expression. By data mining in microarray datasets we found that expression of DLX2 occurred in 21.6% of patients, and was significantly correlated with prolonged disease-free survival and reduced incidence of relapse. Instead, DLX5 was expressed in a small subset of cases, 2.2% of total, displaying reduced disease-free survival and high incidence of relapse which was, however, non-significantly different from the other groups due to the small size of the DLX+ cohort. In all cases, we found mutually exclusive expression of DLX2 and DLX5.CONCLUSIONS: Our studies indicate that DLX genes are involved in human breast cancer progression, and that DLX2 and DLX5 genes might serve as prognostic markers."

Moreover, the effects of IG (160 mg/kg and 240 mg/kg) were superior to salicylazosulfapyridine (150 mg/kg).CONCLUSION: We demonstrated for the first time that IG possessed marked protective effects on experimental colitis through its antioxidation and inhibiting inflammatory mediators by down-regulation of the expressions of NF-κBp65."

CEACAM1 expression is frequently mis-regulated in cancer, with down-regulation reported in several tumors of epithelial origin and de novo expression of CEACAM1 in lung cancer and malignant melanoma. In this report we analyzed the regulation of CEACAM1 expression in three breast cancer cell lines that varied in CEACAM1 expression from none (MCF7) to moderate (MDA-MB-468) to high (MCF10A, comparable to normal breast).RESULTS: Using in vivo footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments we show that the CEACAM1 proximal promoter in breast cells is bound in its active state by SP1, USF1/USF2, and IRF1/2. When down-regulated the CEACAM1 promoter remains accessible to USF2 and partially accessible to USF1. Interferon-γ up-regulates CEACAM1 mRNA by a mechanism involving further induction of IRF-1 and USF1 binding at the promoter. As predicted by this analysis, silencing of IRF1 and USF1 but not USF2 by RNAi resulted in a significant decrease in CEACAM1 protein expression in MDA-MB-468 cells. The inactive CEACAM1 promoter in MCF7 cells exhibits decreased histone acetylation at the promoter region, with no evidence of H3K9 or H3K27 trimethylation, histone modifications often linked to condensed chromatin structure.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that transcription activators USF1 and IRF1 interact to modulate CEACAM1 expression and that the chromatin structure of the promoter is likely maintained in a poised state that can promote rapid induction under appropriate conditions."

Indirect immunofluorescence microscopic analyses showed that PRDX1 was located in the cytoplasm and nucleus of normal and breast cancer cells, with nuclear PRDX1 associated with promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies. We demonstrated that PRDX1 association with the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in MDA-MB-231 but not in MCF7 cells contributed to PRDX1-selective recruitment to MDA-MB-231 genomic DNA. Furthermore, PRDX1 was associated with the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 upstream promoter region at sites occupied by NF-kappaB in ER- but not in ER+ breast cancer cells. PRDX1 knockdown attenuated COX-2 expression by reducing NF-kappaB occupancy at its upstream promoter element in MDA-MB-231 but not in MCF7 cells. A phosphorylated form of PRDX1 was only present in ER- breast cancer cells. Because PRDX1 phosphorylation is known to inhibit its peroxidase activity and to promote PRDX1 oligomerization, we propose that PRDX1 acts as a chaperone to enhance the transactivation potential of NF-kappaB in ER- breast cancer cells."

Originally identified as a tumor suppressor molecule, MDA-7 was renamed IL-24 and classified as a cytokine because of its chromosomal location in the IL-10 locus, its mRNA expression in leukocytes, and its secretory sequence elements. We previously reported that IL-24 is expressed by cytokine-activated monocytes and T lymphocytes. Here, we show that IL-24 is expressed in keratinocytes during wound repair. Paraffin-embedded tissues prepared from human skin sampled at days 2, 6, and 10 after wounding were examined by immunohistochemistry for the expression of IL-24. Protein expression was detected in the keratinocyte population with maximum expression at days 2 and 6, and no expression by day 10 (four of four subjects). In vitro studies showed that cytokines involved in wound repair, most notably transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha), TGFbeta, IFNgamma, and IFNbeta, upregulated IL-24 protein expression in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). Examination of the function of IL-24 in both in vitro wound repair and migration assays demonstrated that IL-24 inhibits TGFalpha-induced proliferation and migration of NHEKs. These data support the hypothesis that IL-24 functions during an inflammatory response in the skin by inhibiting the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes."

Samples were obtained from the healthy human subject without bowel preparation and frozen sections immediately prepared. Regional mucosa-associated microbes were successfully dissected using LCM with minimal contamination by host cells, their DNA extracted and subjected to phi29 MDA with a high fidelity, prior to shotgun sequencing using the GS-FLX DNA sequencer. Metagenomic analysis of approximately 67 million base pairs of DNA sequences from two samples revealed that the metabolic functional profiles in mucosa-associated microbes were as diverse as those reported in feces, specifically the representation of functional genes associated with carbohydrate, protein, and nucleic acid utilization. In summary, these studies demonstrate the feasibility of the approach to study the structure and metagenomic profiles of human intestinal mucosa-associated microbial communities at small spatial scales."

In this study, we show that the DNA methylation pattern is intimately correlated with MUC5AC expression in ten cancer cell lines (breast, lung, pancreas, and colon).METHODS: The CpG methylation status of the MUC5AC promoter from -3855 to +321 was mapped using MassARRAY analysis, which utilizes base-specific cleavage of nucleic acids. ChIP assays and micro-RNA (miRNA) microarray expression profiling were also carried out in both MUC5AC-positive cells and in those with no or low MUC5AC expression.RESULTS: In the distal region from -3718 to -3670 of the promoter, MUC5AC-negative cancer cells (e.g., MDA-MB-453) were highly methylated, whereas MUC5AC-positive cells (e.g., MCF-7) had low methylation levels. The modification status of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) was also closely related to MUC5AC expression. Expression levels of miRNAs in the cancer cells were not correlated with MUC5AC expression.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that MUC5AC is regulated by CpG methylation and histone H3-K9 modification of the MUC5AC promoter distal region, but not by miRNAs. An understanding of the epigenetic regulation of MUC5AC may be of importance for the diagnosis of carcinogenic risk in the pancreatobiliary system."

Survivin is an important cancer biomarker conferring to tumour cells increased survival potential by inhibiting apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the implication of breast cancer cells features, as hormone receptors and p53 status, in the radio-resistance of breast cancer cells and in the regulation of survivin's expression by nuclear factor (NF)-κB and c-myc. Six breast cancer cell lines Michigan Cancer Foundation (MCF-7), MCF-7/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER)2, M. D. Anderson - Metastatic Breast (MDA-MB-231), SK-BR-3, BT-474 and Human Breast Lactating (HBL-100) were irradiated and cell viability as well as cell cycle distribution were evaluated by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Survivin mRNA and protein levels were evaluated by real time PCR and Western blot analysis. Survivin and HER2 gene knockdown was performed with siRNA technology and investigation of transcription factors binding to survivin and c-myc gene promoters was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Student's t-test and F-statistics were used for statistical evaluation. Our results demonstrated that only HER2(+) breast cancer cells up-regulated survivin upon irradiation, whereas HER2 knockdown in HER2(+) cells led to survivin's down-regulation. Survivin and especially HER2 knockdown abolished the observed G2/M cell cycle checkpoint and reduced the radio-resistance of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. Additionally, HER2 was found to regulate survivin's expression through NF-κB and c-myc transcription factors. This study revealed the significance of HER2 in the radio-resistance of HER2(+) breast cancer cells through induction of transcription factors NF-κB and c-myc, leading to activation of survivin, a downstream target oncogene preventing apoptosis."

Large and highly vascularized tumors were generated by cells over-expressing wt hPar1, Y397Z hPar1, with persistent signaling, or Y381A hPar1 mutant constructs. In contrast, cells over-expressing the truncated form of hPar1, which lacks the cytoplasmic tail, developed small or no tumors, similar to cells expressing empty vector or control untreated cells. Antibody array membranes revealed essential hPar1 partners including Etk/Bmx and Shc. PAR(1) activation induces Etk/Bmx and Shc binding to the receptor C-tail to form a complex. Y/A mutations in the PAR(1) C-tail did not prevent Shc-PAR(1) association, but enhanced the number of liver metastases compared with the already increased metastases obtained with wt hPar1. We found that Etk/Bmx first binds via the PH domain to a region of seven residues, located between C378-S384 in PAR(1) C-tail, enabling subsequent Shc association. Importantly, expression of the hPar1-7A mutant form (substituted A, residues 378-384), which is incapable of binding Etk/Bmx, resulted in inhibition of invasion through Matrigel-coated membranes. Similarly, knocking down Etk/Bmx inhibited PAR(1)-induced MDA-MB-435 cell migration. In addition, intact spheroid morphogenesis of MCF10A cells is markedly disrupted by the ectopic expression of wt hPar1. In contrast, the forced expression of the hPar1-7A mutant results in normal ball-shaped spheroids. Thus, by preventing binding of Etk/Bmx to PAR(1) -C-tail, hPar1 oncogenic properties are abrogated.SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first demonstration that a cytoplasmic portion of the PAR(1) C-tail functions as a scaffold site. We identify here essential signaling partners, determine the hierarchy of binding and provide a platform for therapeutic vehicles via definition of the critical PAR(1)-associating region in the breast cancer signaling niche."

Sin3A/B are highly related, large, multidomian proteins that interact with a wide variety of transcription factors and corepressor components, and we examined whether disruption of the function of a specific domain could lead to epigenetic reprogramming and derepression of specific subsets of genes. To this end, we selected the Sin3A/B-paired amphipathic alpha-helices (PAH2) domain based on its established role in mediating the effects of a relatively small number of transcription factors containing a PAH2-binding motif known as the Sin3 interaction domain (SID). Here, we show that in both human and mouse breast cancer cells, the targeted disruption of Sin3 function by introduction of a SID decoy that interferes with PAH2 binding to SID-containing partner proteins reverted the silencing of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. In particular, the SID decoy led to epigenetic reprogramming and reexpression of the important breast cancer-associated silenced genes encoding E-cadherin, estrogen receptor alpha, and retinoic acid receptor beta and impaired tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, the SID decoy was effective in the triple-negative M.D. Anderson-Metastatic Breast-231 (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell line, restoring sensitivity to 17beta-estradiol, tamoxifen, and retinoids. Therefore, the development of small molecules that can block interactions between PAH2 and SID-containing proteins offers a targeted epigenetic approach for treating this type of breast cancer that may also have wider therapeutic implications."

We report here the characterization, in normal and cancer cells, of a new family of intracellular isoforms of VEGFR-1 resulting from alternative initiation of transcription in intronic sequences of the gene. While the classical isoforms of VEGFR-1 were barely detectable in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, one of the intracellular isoforms transcribed from intron 21 (i(21)VEGFR-1) was the main isoform expressed in these cells. The new transcript encodes for a protein that contains only the phosphotransferase domain and the carboxyterminal tail of VEGFR-1. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with siRNA specific for the tyrosine domain of VEGFR-1 suppressed the expression of i(21)VEGFR-1, downregulated phosphorylation of Src at tyrosine 418, and reduced markedly the invasion capacity of these cells in vitro. Accordingly, overexpression of transfected i(21)VEGFR-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells upregulated the active form of Src and increased invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells. The expression of i(21)VEGFR-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells was inhibited by retinoic acid. Both, activation of Src and downregulation by retinoic acid, have been reported in other intracellular members of the Fms/Kit/PDGFR family of tyrosine kinases, particularly in the intracellular isoform of c-kit, analogous structurally to i(21)VEGFR-1 and frequently expressed in cancer cells."

However, the role of CSCs in cancer metastasis, especially in metastasis to bone, has not been extensively studied. Side population (SP) has been shown to enrich CSCs in several types of cancer, including breast cancer. In the present study, we characterized the SP cells isolated from the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 in comparison to non-SP (NSP). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis demonstrated the existence of SP in MDA-MB-231 cells, which was markedly reduced in the presence of fumitremorgin C, a specific inhibitor of ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that ABCG2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in SP cells than in NSP cells. SP cells formed increased numbers of tumor-spheres in suspension culture. Furthermore, the tumor growth in the orthotopic mammary fat pad in nude mice was significantly accelerated in SP cells. On the other hand, the development of bone metastases determined by intracardiac injection into nude mice showed no difference between SP and NSP cells. SP abundance in the tumor cells isolated from the bone metastases was not increased either compared with that from the mammary tumors. These results suggest that the SP in MDA-MB-231 cells possesses some of the CSC-like properties but does not have higher metastatic potential to bone."

Despite this significance, mechanisms that regulate ALCAM gene expression and ALCAM's role in adhesion of pre-metastatic circulating tumor cells have not been defined. We studied ALCAM expression in 20 tumor cell lines by real-time PCR, western blot and immunochemistry. Epigenetic alterations of the ALCAM promoter were assessed using methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. ALCAM's role in adhesion of tumor cells to the vascular wall was studied in isolated perfused lungs.RESULTS: A common site for transcription initiation of the ALCAM gene was identified and the ALCAM promoter sequenced. The promoter contains multiple cis-active elements including a functional p65 NF-κB motif, and it harbors an extensive array of CpG residues highly methylated exclusively in ALCAM-negative tumor cells. These CpG residues were modestly demethylated after 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment. Restoration of high-level ALCAM expression using an ALCAM cDNA increased clustering of MDA-MB-435 tumor cells perfused through the pulmonary vasculature of ventilated rat lungs. Anti-ALCAM antibodies reduced the number of intravascular tumor cell clusters.CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that loss of ALCAM expression, due in part to DNA methylation of extensive segments of the promoter, significantly impairs the ability of circulating tumor cells to adhere to each other, and may therefore promote metastasis. These findings offer insight into the mechanisms for down-regulation of ALCAM gene expression in tumor cells, and for the positive prognostic value of high-level ALCAM in breast cancer."

We recently illustrated by an in vitro kinase assay that a novel peptide to YB-1 was highly phosphorylated by the serine/threonine p90 S6 kinases RSK-1 and RSK-2, and to a lesser degree PKCα and AKT. Herein, we sought to develop this decoy cell permeable peptide (CPP) as a cancer therapeutic. This 9-mer was designed as an interference peptide that would prevent endogenous YB-1(S102) phosphorylation based on molecular docking. In cancer cells, the CPP blocked P-YB-1(S102) and down-regulated both HER-2 and EGFR transcript level and protein expression. Further, the CPP prevented YB-1 from binding to the EGFR promoter in a gel shift assay. Notably, the growth of breast (SUM149, MDA-MB-453, AU565) and prostate (PC3, LNCap) cancer cells was inhibited by ∼90% with the CPP. Further, treatment with this peptide enhanced sensitivity and overcame resistance to trastuzumab in cells expressing amplified HER-2. By contrast, the CPP had no inhibitory effect on the growth of normal immortalized breast epithelial (184htert) cells, primary breast epithelial cells, nor did it inhibit differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. These data collectively suggest that the CPP is a novel approach to suppressing the growth of cancer cells while sparing normal cells and thereby establishes a proof-of-concept that blocking YB-1 activation is a new course of cancer therapeutics."

Macrophage is one of the infiltrating inflammatory cells in solid tumor and may promote tumor progression via enhancement of tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether sesamin inhibited macrophage-enhanced proangiogenic activity of breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Using vascular endothelial cell capillary tube and network formation assays, both breast cancer cell lines exhibited elevated proangiogenic activities after coculture with macrophages or pretreatment with macrophage-conditioned medium. This elevation of proangiogenic activity was drastically suppressed by sesamin. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) induced by macrophages in both cell lines were also inhibited by sesamin. Nuclear levels of HIF-1α and NF-κB, important transcription factors for VEGF and MMP-9 expression, respectively, were obviously reduced by sesamin. VEGF induction by macrophage in MCF-7 cells was shown to be via ERK, JNK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and NF-κB-mediated pathways. These signaling molecules and additional p38(MAPK) were also involved in macrophage-induced MMP-9 expression. Despite such diverse pathways were induced by macrophage, only Akt and p38(MAPK) activities were potently inhibited by sesamin. Expression of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α were substantially increased and involved in macrophage-induced VEGF and MMP-9 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells. Sesamin effectively inhibited the expression of these cytokines to avoid the reinforced induction of VEGF and MMP-9. In conclusion, sesamin potently inhibited macrophage-enhanced proangiogenic activity of breast cancer cells via inhibition of VEGF and MMP-9 induction."

Serine/threonine protein phosphatases 2C (PP2Cs) have been suggested to play an important role in stress signaling. To identify potential new member of the PP2C proteins in maize and investigate its functions for stress responses, the ZmPP2C2 gene, encoding a new PP2C protein from maize roots, was cloned by RT-PCR and RACE-PCR. Its constitutive expression in roots, stems and leaves of maize seedlings was detected by RNA gel blot, and its regulation in response to cold stress was also examined. To further evaluate its function in the cold stress response, we over-expressed the ZmPP2C2 gene in tobacco under the control of the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, and assessed a series of physiological changes in wild type and transgenic plants under low temperatures. Compared with wild type tobacco under cold stress, plants that over-expressed ZmPP2C2 displayed higher germination speed and rate, higher antioxidant enzyme (SOD, POD, CAT) activities, with lower cold-induced electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. These results show that over-expression of ZmPP2C2 in tobacco enhanced tolerance to cold stress, suggesting that this new gene, ZmPP2C2, may act as a positive regulator of cold resistance in plants."

Subcellular localisation of fluorescence labelled hGIRK1a-e and hGIRK4 and of endogenous GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits was monitored in the MCF7 cell line. All hGIRK1 splice variants and hGIRK4 were predominantly located within the endoplasmic reticulum. Heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and two electrode voltage clamp experiments together with confocal microscopy were performed. Only the hGIRK1a subunit was able to form functional GIRK channels in connection with hGIRK4. The other splice variants are expressed, but exert a dominant negative effect on heterooligomeric channel function. Hence, alternative splicing of the KCNJ3 gene transcript in the MCF7 cell line leads to a family of mRNA's, encoding truncated versions of the hGIRK1 protein. The very high abundance of mRNA's encoding GIRK1 together with the presence of GIRK1 protein suggests a pathophysiological role in breast cancer."

In the past years, several pooled large-scale shRNA screens have identified a variety of genes involved in cancer cell proliferation. All of those studies employed microarray analysis, utilizing either the shRNA's half hairpin sequence or an additional shRNA-associated 60 nt barcode sequence as a molecular tag. Here we describe a novel method to decode pooled RNAi screens, namely barcode tiling array analysis, and demonstrate how this approach can be used to precisely quantify the abundance of individual shRNAs from a pool.RESULTS: We synthesized DNA microarrays with six overlapping 25 nt long tiling probes complementary to each unique 60 nt molecular barcode sequence associated with every shRNA expression construct. By analyzing dilution series of expression constructs we show how our approach allows quantification of shRNA abundance from a pool and how it clearly outperforms the commonly used analysis via the shRNA's half hairpin sequences. We further demonstrate how barcode tiling arrays can be used to predict anti-proliferative effects of individual shRNAs from pooled negative selection screens. Out of a pool of 305 shRNAs, we identified 28 candidate shRNAs to fully or partially impair the viability of the breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231. Individual validation of a subset of eleven shRNA expression constructs with potential inhibitory, as well as non-inhibitory, effects on the cell line proliferation provides further evidence for the accuracy of the barcode tiling approach.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we present an improved method for the rapid, quantitative and statistically robust analysis of pooled RNAi screens. Our experimental approach, coupled with commercially available lentiviral vector shRNA libraries, has the potential to greatly facilitate the discovery of putative targets for cancer therapy as well as sensitizers of drug toxicity."

Functional screening for endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase, β-glucosidase, and xylanase resulted in 12 β-glucosidase-positive clones and one xylanase-positive clone. The sequencing result of the xylanase-positive clone revealed an 1,818-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 64.5-kDa multidomain endo-1,4-β-xylanase, designated Xyl6E7, which consisted of an N-terminal GH11 family catalytic domain, a CBM_4_9 domain, and a Listeria-Bacteroides repeat domain. Xyl6E7 was a highly active, substrate-specific, and endo-acting alkaline xylanase with considerably wide pH tolerance and stability but extremely low thermostability."

Cell-penetrating peptides and proteins are employed to generate formulations that overcome these challenges to facilitate DNA delivery into cells efficiently. However, these are limited by their inability to deliver nucleic acids selectively due to lack of specificity because they deliver to both cancer and normal cells. In this study, through modular design, we generated a recombinant fusion protein designated as Her-nuclear localization sequence (Her-NLS), where heregulin-α (Her), a targeting moiety, was cloned in frame with cationic NLS peptide to obtain a cell-specific targeting biomolecule for nucleic acid delivery. The heregulin-α(1) isoform possesses the epidermal growth factor-like domain and binds to HER2/3 heterodimers which are overexpressed in certain breast cancers. Purified recombinant Her-NLS fusion protein binds plasmid DNA and specifically transfects MDA-MB-453 cells overexpressing the epidermal growth factor receptors HER2/3 in vitro. The approach described would also permit replacement of heregulin ligand with other targeting moieties that would be suited to cell-specific nucleic acid delivery mediated via receptor-ligand interactions."

To understand the mechanisms involved, we examined the effect of LOXL2 overexpression in MCF-7 cells on gene expression. We found that LOXL2 up-regulated the expression of receptor activity modifying protein-3 (RAMP3). Expression of RAMP3 in MDA-MB-231 cells in which LOXL2 expression was inhibited restored vimentin expression, invasiveness, and tumor development. Inhibition of RAMP3 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells mimicked the effects produced by inhibition of LOXL2 expression and was accompanied by inhibition of p38 phosphorylation. LOXL2 overexpression in these cells did not restore invasiveness, suggesting that RAMP3 functions downstream to LOXL2. LOXL2 and RAMP3 are strongly coexpressed in human colon, breast, and gastric carcinomas but not in normal colon or gastric epithelial cells. RAMP3 associates with several G-protein-coupled receptors forming receptors for peptides, such as adrenomedullin and amylin. We hypothesized that RAMP3 could function as a transducer of autocrine signals induced by such peptides. However, the proinvasive effects of RAMP3 could not be abrogated following inhibition of the expression or activity of these peptides. Our experiments suggest that the protumorigenic effects of LOXL2 are partially mediated by RAMP3 and that RAMP3 inhibitors may function as antitumorigenic agents. -"

We previously demonstrated that ITGA5 expression was downregulated in the high invasive MDA-MB-468 cells compared with other breast cancer cell lines. In this study, we found that the methylation status in the region around transcriptional start site of ITGA5 gene was increased in MDA-MB-468 cells. Overexpression of integrin alpha5 on MDA-MB-468 cells resulted in cell growth inhibition, which could be reversed by adhesion to fibronectin. Cell adhesion and spreading to fibronectin was enhanced after ITGA5 was overexpressed in MDA-MB-468 cells, while cell migration was attenuated. Knockdown of ITGA5 in MCF-7 cells led to cell growth inhibition but had little influence on cell migration. These findings indicated the diverse roles of ITGA5 expression in breast cancer cells."

Also, significant progress has been made concerning its turn-over and associated final proteasomal degradation processes. These advances could lead in the near future to the design and the synthesis of novel receptor-interacting drugs. Recently, a number of receptor-related peptides acting as specific ER ligands have been identified and extensively studied with respect to their estrogenic/antiestrogenic activities. Among them, ERα17p, a synthetic analog of the P(295)-T(311) sequence of ERα, has been shown to exert pseudo-estrogenic effects by interacting in the close vicinity of its hinge region (BF3 domain). Remarkably, this sequence appears as the epicenter of a number of post-transcriptional modifications as well as of the recruitment of co-regulators, suggesting that it would play a key role in ERα functions. Here, we provide evidence that ERα17p induces apoptosis in ERα-positive (MCF-7, T47D) and -negative (MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3) breast cancer cells by an ERα-independent membrane mechanism, triggering major pro-apoptotic signaling cascades. Finally, ERα17p induces the regression of breast ERα-negative cancer tumor xenografts, without apparent toxicity, suggesting that it could represent a new attractive tool for the development of future promising therapeutic approaches, and providing a novel insight to ER regulation of cell fate."

Therefore, we evaluated the biologic effects of ALCAM expression in two breast cancer cell lines and a larger cohort of mammary carcinomas. By stable transfections, MCF7 cells with ALCAM overexpression and MDA-MB231 cells with reduced ALCAM levels were generated and analyzed in functional assays and cDNA microarrays. In addition, an immunohistochemical study on 347 patients with breast cancer with long-term follow-up and analysis of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) was performed. In both cell lines, high ALCAM expression was associated with reduced cell motility. In addition, ALCAM silencing in MDA-MB231 cells resulted in lower invasive potential, whereas high ALCAM expression was associated with increased apoptosis in both cell lines. Among genes which were differentially expressed in clones with altered ALCAM expression, there was an overlap of 15 genes between both cell lines, among them cathepsin D, keratin 7, gelsolin, and ets2 whose deregulation was validated by western blot analysis. In MDA-MB231 cells, we observed a correlation with VEGF expression which was validated by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). Our IHC results on primary breast carcinomas showed that ALCAM expression was associated with an estrogen receptor-positive phenotype. In addition, strong ALCAM immunostaining correlated with nodal involvement and the presence of tumor cells in bone marrow. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, strong ALCAM expression in ductal carcinomas correlated with shorter recurrence-free intervals (P=0.048) and overall survival (OAS, P=0.003). Our results indicate that the biologic role of ALCAM in breast cancer is complex, but overexpression might be relevant for outcome in ductal carcinomas."

The multidomain structure, composed of a prodomain, a metalloproteinase, disintegrin-like, epidermal growth factor-like, cysteine-rich and transmembrane domains, and a cytoplasmic tail, allows ADAM-12 to promote matrix degradation, cell-cell adhesion, and intracellular signaling capacities and thereby to play a critical role in cancer growth and metastasis. Despite ample evidence linking increased ADAM-12 expression with cancer, the mechanisms controlling its upregulation are still unknown. In the present study, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is shown to increase ADAM-12 mRNA expression in MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. We have identified a promoter element responsible for TGF-β1-mediated ADAM-12 induction. We show interaction of NF-κB with ADAM-12 promoter and that high level of NF-κB activity in breast carcinoma cells results in the upregulation of ADAM-12 expression. Site-directed mutagenesis of the NF-κB element in ADAM-12 promoter and inhibition of NF-κB activity by Bay-11-7085 and MG-132 significantly reduced TGF-β1-mediated increase of ADAM-12 promoter-driven gene expression. Transfection of cells with a dominant-negative mutant form of IκBα (IκBαΔN), which inhibits activation of NF-κB, significantly reduced transcription from ADAM-12 promoter-reporter in TGF-β1-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. In correlation, overexpression of NF-κB induced ADAM-12 expression in a dose-dependent manner. DNA-binding and ChIP assays indicated that p65 subunit of NF-κB binds to ADAM-12 promoter. Together, our study identified a cellular mechanism for induction of ADAM-12, which involves NF-κB and its activation by TGF-β1."

Many standard chemotherapeutic agents currently used to treat breast cancer are relatively non-specific and act on all rapidly dividing cells. In recent years, more specific targeted therapies have been introduced. It is known that telomerase is active in over 90% of breast cancer tumors but inactive in adjacent normal tissues. The prevalence of active telomerase in breast cancer patients makes telomerase an attractive therapeutic target. Recent evidence suggests that telomerase activity can be suppressed by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). However, its effect on telomerase regulation in breast cancer has not been investigated.METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effect of the PPARgamma ligand, troglitazone, on telomerase activity in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Real time RT-PCR and telomerase activity assays were used to evaluate the effect of troglitazone. MDA-MB-231 cells had PPARgamma expression silenced using shRNA interference.RESULTS: We demonstrated that troglitazone reduced the mRNA expression of hTERT and telomerase activity in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Troglitazone reduced telomerase activity even in the absence of PPARgamma. In agreement with this result, we found no correlation between PPARgamma and hTERT mRNA transcript levels in breast cancer patients. Statistical significance was determined using Pearson correlation and the paired Student's t test.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first time that the effect of troglitazone on telomerase activity in breast cancer cells has been investigated. Our data suggest that troglitazone may be used as an anti-telomerase agent; however, the mechanism underlying this inhibitory effect remains to be determined."

In the present study, we investigated the effects of saponin monomer 13 of dwarf lilyturf tuber (DT-13) on metastasis of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-435) during hypoxia. The effects and molecular mechanisms of DT-13 on MDA-MB-435 cells metastatic phenotype in vitro and in vivo were evaluated by RNA interference; quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot assays. DT-13 had no significant effects on cell adhesion and migration under normoxia conditions. Under hypoxic conditions, MDA-MB-435 adhesion to vitronectin was inhibited by about 43.5% or 60.8% after exposure of the cells to DT-13 at 1 microM or 10 microM, respectively. DT-13 decreased the migratory response by hypoxia at 1 or 10 microM, and inhibition ratios were 20% and 30%, respectively. DT-13 inhibited hypoxia-induced expression of alphavbeta3 integrin, tissue factor (TF) and early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) and decreased excretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) of MDA-MB-435 cells under hypoxic conditions. After Egr-1 short interference RNA (siRNA) treatment, DT-13 could still inhibit the up-regulation of TF mRNA and protein levels and its pro-coagulant activity (PCA) under hypoxia. In nude mice, DT-13 decreased extravasation of MDA-MB-435 cells in the lung after tail vein injection. Our data suggest that DT-13 inhibits MDA-MB-435 cells metastasis during hypoxia via regulation of TF, and the effect of DT-13 on TF is partly mediated by Egr-1."

Three cyclotides, vitri A, vitri F, and cycloviolacin O2, were the most cytotoxic.

Although 17beta-estradiol (E2)-induced up-regulation of KISS1 expression has been documented in anteroventral periventricular nucleus neurons, E2 down-regulates KISS1 expression in arcuate nucleus neurons via the estrogen receptor alpha by unknown molecular mechanisms. Because KISS1 was initially described as a metastasis inhibitor, notably in breast tumors, we used the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, which expresses high levels of KISS1, to characterize the molecular mechanism underlying KISS1 regulation by E2. E2 rapidly down-regulated endogenous KISS1 in a stable ERalpha-expressing MDA-MB-231 cell line. Promoter analysis revealed that E2 down-regulation was determined by a short 93-bp sequence devoid of estrogen response element and Sp1 sites. E2 down-regulation persisted with an ERalpha that was unable to bind DNA and in the presence of histone deacetylase inhibitor. In the absence of E2, unliganded ERalpha and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) were present on the proximal promoter. E2 stimulation induced recruitment of ERalpha and loss of RNAPII at the proximal promoter. Along the gene body, total RNAPII amounts were similar in E2-treated and untreated cells, whereas the active form was significantly less abundant in E2-treated cells. Thus, E2-induced down-regulation of KISS1 is mediated by a pathway combining RNAPII loss at the proximal promoter and modulation of active RNAPII along the gene body, which is a novel mechanism in the complex process of E2-induced repression of gene expression."

The high aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance of estrogen-independent breast tumors have motivated the development of new strategies for prevention and/or treatment. Combinations of two or more chemopreventive agents are currently being used to achieve greater inhibitory effects on breast cancer cells. This study reveals that both aspirin and lunasin inhibit, in a dose-dependent manner, human estrogen-independent breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. These compounds arrest the cell cycle in the S- and G1-phases, respectively, acting synergistically to induce apoptosis. To begin elucidating the mechanism(s) of action of these compounds, different molecular targets involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis and signal transduction have been evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) array. The cell growth inhibitory effect of a lunasin/aspirin combination is achieved, at least partially, by modulating the expression of genes encoding G1 and S-phase regulatory proteins. Lunasin/aspirin therapy exerts its potent pro-apoptotic effect is at least partially achieved through modulating the extrinsic-apoptosis dependent pathway. Synergistic down-regulatory effects were observed for ERBB2, AKT1, PIK3R1, FOS and JUN signaling genes, whose amplification has been reported as being responsible for breast cancer cell growth and resistance to apoptosis. Therefore, our results suggest that a combination of these two compounds is a promising strategy to prevent/treat breast cancer."

This study is focused on the functional role of unliganded VDR by investigating the correlation between the expression of VDR protein and basal mRNA levels of CYP24 in breast cancer cell lines. Analyses of multiple breast cancer cell lines demonstrated an inverse correlation between VDR protein expression and CYP24 mRNA expression levels; while in the presence of ligand, VDR protein level was positively correlated with CYP24 expression. In MCF-7 cells, VDR was mainly distributed in the nuclei in the absence of ligand. VDR overexpression in MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB231 cells decreased CYP24 mRNA expression levels and CYP24 promoter activity. Conversely, knock-down of VDR using siRNA techniques in MCF-7 and T47D cells significantly increased CYP24 mRNA expression. We also found that overexpression of VDR with a polymorphic site (FokI-FF) at its AF-1 domain, which makes VDR shorter by three amino acids, failed to repress CYP24 promoter activity. This report provides conclusive evidence for the repressive action of unliganded VDR on the expression of its target gene CYP24 and the importance of an intact VDR AF-1 domain for its repressive action."

Whereas, the PCI P1 mutant (R354A) inhibits cathepsin L at rates similar to wild-type PCI, mutating the P2 residue results in a slight decrease in the rate of inhibition. We then assessed the effect of PCI and cathepsin L on the migration of human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells. Cathepsin L was expressed in both the cell lysates and conditioned media of MDA-MB-231 cells. Wound-induced and transwell migration of MDA-MB-231 cells was inhibited by exogenously administered wtPCI and PCI P1 but not PCI P14 mutant. In addition, migration of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing wtPCI was significantly decreased compared to non-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells or MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the PCI P14 mutant. Downregulation of cathepsin L by either a specific cathepsin L inhibitor or siRNA technology also resulted in a decrease in the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data show that PCI regulates tumor cell migration partly by inhibiting cathepsin L.GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Consequently, inhibiting cathepsin L by serpins like PCI may be a new pathway of regulating hemostasis, cardiovascular and metastatic diseases."

The radiation-enhancement ratio was calculated as the ratio of the surviving fraction (SF) of cells treated with (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab alone to that of cells treated concurrently with (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab and methotrexate, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin.RESULTS: A reduction in the SF in HER2-positive 231-H2N (55.7% +/- 1.3%) and TrR1 (62.6% +/- 6.5%) cells was demonstrated after exposure to (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab (approximately 0.2 MBq/microg, 100 nmol/L) but not in MDA-MB-231 or TrR2 cells expressing low levels of HER2 (SF &gt; 90%, P &gt; 0.05). Coadministration of methotrexate, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin enhanced the cytotoxicity of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab toward 231-H2N and TrR1 cells but not toward MDA-MB-231 or TrR2 cells. The radiation-enhancement ratios for methotrexate, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin for 231-H2N or TrR1 cells were 2.0-2.2, 1.6-1.8, and 2.7-2.8, respectively. Methotrexate or doxorubicin combined with (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab, compared to treatment with (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab alone, significantly increased residual gammaH2AX foci in 231-H2N and TrR1 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 or TrR2 cells or in any cell line treated concurrently with paclitaxel and (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab. Cells exposed to low-dose methotrexate accumulated in the G(1)/S phase of the cell cycle, whereas low-dose paclitaxel or doxorubicin caused cells to arrest in the G(2)/M phase.CONCLUSION: Low-dose methotrexate, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin potently sensitized HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells, with and without acquired trastuzumab-resistance, to the Auger electron emissions from (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab through cell cycle distribution changes and in part through the inhibitory effects of these agents on DNA damage repair."

In this work, these two proteins were expressed in mitochondria of Cos-7 cells and tested for their efficacy to protect these cells from oxidative stress in vitro.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cos-7/pFNR and Cos-7/pFld cell lines expressing FNR and Fld, respectively, showed a significantly higher resistance to 24 h exposure to 300-600 µM hydrogen peroxide measured by LDH retention, MTT reduction, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and lipid peroxide (LPO; FOX assay) levels. However, FNR and Fld did not exhibit any protection at shorter incubation times (2 h and 4 h) to 4 mM hydrogen peroxide or to a 48 h exposure to 300 µM methyl viologen. We found enhanced methyl viologen damage exerted by FNR that may be due to depletion of NADPH pools through NADPH-MV diaphorase activity as previously observed for other overexpressed enzymes.SIGNIFICANCE: The results presented are a first report of antioxidant function of these heterologous enzymes of vegetal and cyanobacterial origin in mammalian cells."

The transcriptional targets of CXCR4 signaling are not known. Microarray analysis of CXCR4-enriched and CXCR4-low subpopulations of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, which has a constitutively active CXCR4 signaling network, revealed differential expression of ∼ 200 genes in the CXCR4-enriched subpopulation. ITF2, upregulated in CXCR4-enriched cells, was investigated further. Expression array datasets of primary breast tumors revealed higher ITF2 expression in estrogen receptor negative tumors, which correlated with reduced progression free and overall survival and suggested its relevance in breast cancer progression. CXCL12, a CXCR4 ligand, increased ITF2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. ITF2 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that controls the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the function of the ID family (inhibitor-of-differentiation) of transcription factors, such as ID2. ID2 promotes differentiation of breast epithelial cells and its reduced expression in breast cancer is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Both CXCR4 and ITF2 repressed ID2 expression. In xenograft studies, CXCR4-enriched cells formed large tumors and exhibited significantly elevated lung metastasis. Short interfering RNA against ITF2 reduced invasion of the CXCR4-enriched MDA-MB-231 subpopulation, whereas ITF2 overexpression restored the invasive capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing CXCR4shRNA. Furthermore, overexpression of ITF2 in these cells enhanced tumor growth. We propose that ITF2 is one of the CXCR4 targets, which is involved in CXCR4-dependent tumor growth and invasion of breast cancer cells."

Leupaxin (LPXN) is a member of the paxillin family of FA proteins expressed in many cancer cell lines. We found activation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) by bombesin (BN) stimulated LPXN translocation from cytoplasm to FAs. Using mutagenesis, we identified LIM3 as the primary FA targeting domain for LPXN and showed BN-induced LPXN tyrosine phosphorylation on residues 22, 62 and 72. A LIM3 point mutant of LPXN failed to target to FAs and had no BN-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Conversely, a non-phosphorylatable mutant (Y22/62/72F) translocated to FAs after BN addition. Stimulation of FA formation using vinblastine also induced LPXN translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, dynamic LPXN tyrosine phosphorylation requires translocation to FAs. LPXN and paxillin had opposite roles in adhesion to collagen I (CNI) in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. LPXN siRNA stimulated whereas paxillin siRNA inhibited cell adhesion. Knockdown of both LPXN and paxillin behaved similarly to paxillin knockdown alone, suggesting LPXN’s function in adhesion might depend on paxillin. Additionally, LPXN regulated cell spreading on CNI but not on fibronectin whereas paxillin knockdown suppressed spreading on both substrates. These results demonstrate that although LPXN and paxillin’s FA targeting and tyrosine phosphorylation are similar, each protein has distinct functions."

Thus, it is important to identify the regulatory mechanisms of TSP50 for tumor therapy. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism underlying TSP50 downregulation by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). We used MDA-MB-231 and HEK293T cell lines to address this issue. RT-PCR and promoter activity assays indicated that bFGF downregulates TSP50 expression via transcriptional activation. We next investigated the signaling pathway that mediated the effect of bFGF on TSP50 transcription, and identified that bFGF induced the phosphorylation of ERK and Sp1. An ERK inhibitor suppressed Sp1 phosphorylation and bFGF-reduced TSP50 expression at the mRNA level. In addition, the dominant negative (DN) mutants of ERK and Sp1 both suppressed the reduction of TSP50 by bFGF. Deletion and mutation analyses indicated that the Sp1 site, located within the +237/+239 region of the human TSP50 promoter, is the major responsive element for bFGF. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that bFGF mediates TSP50 downregulation by ERK activation, leading to the phosphorylation of Sp1 in this process."

Seventeen new macrocycles were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against RPMI 8402, KB-3, and KB-3 cell lines that overexpress the efflux transporters MDR1 (KBV-1) and BCRP (KBH5.0). Macrocycles in which the pyridyl-polyoxazole moiety is linked by a 1,3-bis(aminomethyl)phenyl group with a 5-(2-aminoethyl)- (18) or a 5-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)- substituent (19) displayed the greatest cytotoxic potency. These compounds exhibit exquisite selectivity for stabilizing G-quadruplex DNA with no stabilization of duplex DNA or RNA. Compound 19 stabilizes quadruplex mRNA that encodes the cell-cycle checkpoint protein kinase Aurora A to a greater extent than the quadruplex DNA of a human telomeric sequence. These data may suggest a role for G-quadruplex ligands interacting with mRNA being associated with the biological activity of macrocyclic polyoxazoles.

We have characterized TTN-1's sarcomere distribution, protein interaction with key myofibrillar proteins as well as the conformation malleability of representative motifs of five classes of short repeats. We report that two antibodies developed to portions of TTN-1 detect an approximately 2-MDa polypeptide on Western blots. In addition, by immunofluorescence staining, both of these antibodies localize to the I-band and may extend into the outer edge of the A-band in the obliquely striated muscle of the nematode. Six different 300-residue segments of TTN-1 were shown to variously interact with actin and/or myosin in vitro. Conformations of synthetic peptides of representative copies of each of the five classes of repeats--39-mer PEVT, 51-mer CEEEI, 42-mer AAPLE, 32-mer BLUE and 30-mer DispRep--were investigated by circular dichroism at different temperatures, ionic strengths and solvent polarities. The PEVT, CEEEI, DispRep and AAPLE peptides display a combination of a polyproline II helix and an unordered structure in aqueous solution and convert in trifluoroethanol to alpha-helix (PEVT, CEEEI, DispRep) and beta-turn (AAPLE) structures, respectively. The octads in BLUE motifs form unstable alpha-helix-like structures coils in aqueous solution and negligible heptad-based, alpha-helical coiled-coils. The alpha-helical structure, as modeled by threading and molecular dynamics simulations, tends to form helical bundles and crosses based on its 8-4-2-2 hydrophobic helical patterns and charge arrays on its surface. Our finding indicates that APPLE, PEVT, CEEEI and DispRep regions are all intrinsically disordered and highly reminiscent of the conformational malleability and elasticity of vertebrate titin PEVK segments. The proposed presence of long, modular and unstable alpha-helical oligomerization domains in the BLUE region of TTN-1 could bundle TTN-1 and stabilize oblique striation of the sarcomere."

The biogenetic relationship between the TRAP isoforms was assessed in a stably transfected breast cancer epithelial MDA-MB-231 cell subline overexpressing 5a- and 5b-like TRAP isoforms intracellularly, with only the monomeric 5a-like isoform being secreted. As judged by immunolocalization and comparative N-glycan profiling by Con A lectin chromatography and glycanase analysis, the majority of the intracellular monomeric TRAP was destined for secretion, while a minor portion provided the putative precursor for the intracellular 5b-like isoform. Brefeldin A blocked secretion of 5a-like TRAP isoform as well as appearance of its putative intracellular precursor, and augmented the intracellular level of proteolytically processed 5b-like isoform, indicating a common early biosynthetic precursor for TRAP isoforms 5a and 5b. The cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64 partially blocked formation of the 5b-like isoform while augmenting the level of its putative monomeric precursor, but did not alter the levels of secreted TRAP or its intracellular precursor, suggesting that distinct precursors for secreted TRAP 5a and intracellular 5b-like isoform are segregated in the ER or Golgi prior to proteolytic processing. In conclusion, these data provide evidence that distinct monomeric TRAP populations are diverted early in the secretory pathway either giving rise to a secreted, monomeric 5a-like TRAP isoform or to an intracellular, proteolytically processed 5b-like TRAP isoform."

Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, has been implicated as a major mediator of bone resorption, suggesting that agents that can suppress RANKL signaling might inhibit osteoclastogenesis, a process closely linked to bone resorption. We therefore investigated whether butein, a tetrahydroxychalcone, could inhibit RANKL signaling and suppress osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL or tumor cells. We found that human multiple myeloma cells (MM.1S and U266), breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231) and prostate tumor cells (PC-3) induced differentiation of macrophages to osteoclasts, as indicated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells, and that butein suppressed this process. The chalcone also suppressed the expression of RANKL by the tumor cells. We further found that butein suppressed RANKL-induced NF-κB activation and that this suppression correlated with the inhibition of IκBα kinase and suppression of phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB. Finally, butein also suppressed the RANKL-induced differentiation of macrophages to osteoclasts in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Collectively, our results indicate that butein suppresses the osteoclastogenesis induced by tumor cells and by RANKL, by suppression of the NF-κB activation pathway."

However, ACC-HGT can also undergo transformation to adenocarcinomas which are not poorly differentiated. ACC-HGT is generally considered to be an aggressive variant of ACC, even more than solid ACC. This study was aimed to describe the genetic changes of ACC-HGT in relation to clinico-pathological features and to compare results to solid ACC.METHODS: genome-wide DNA copy number changes were analyzed by microarray CGH in ACC-HGT, 4 with transformation into moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (MDA) and two into poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC), 5 solid ACC. In addition, Ki-67 index and p53 immunopositivity was assessed.RESULTS: ACC-HGT carried fewer copy number changes compared to solid ACC. Two ACC-HGT cases harboured a breakpoint at 6q23, near the cMYB oncogene. The complexity of the genomic profile concurred with the clinical course of the patient. Among the ACC-HGT, p53 positivity significantly increased from the conventional to the transformed (both MDA and PDC) component.CONCLUSION: ACC-HGT may not necessarily reflect a more advanced stage of tumor progression, but rather a transformation to another histological form in which the poorly differentiated forms (PDC) presents a genetic complexity similar to the solid ACC."

Expression of cell cycle regulatory genes were determined by DNA-microarray analysis. Effect of BD on invasiveness was assessed by cellular adhesion, migration, and invasion assays.RESULTS: BD treatment of cells MDA-MB-231 resulted in the cytostatic inhibition of cell proliferation with IC(50) 22.2, 19.1, and 17.5 μg/mL for 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively. The inhibition of proliferation was mediated by the upregulation expression of CCNG1, CHEK1, CDKN1C, GADD45A, and E2F2, whereas BD downregulated expression of CCNA1 and CDK6 genes. The induction of expression of GADD45A and inhibition of expression of cyclin A1 (gene CCNA1) by BD was also confirmed on the protein level. BD treatment suppressed the invasive behavior of MDA-MB-231 cells by the inhibition of cellular adhesion, migration, and invasion.

EPLIN expression is frequently reduced in a variety of cancer cells and tissues and this loss may account for increased invasive traits in cancer cells. The current study aimed to assess the role of EPLIN in endothelial cells and the angiogenic process.METHODS: EPLINα expression was enhanced in HECV endothelial cells through transfection with a pEF6 expression plasmid containing the full coding sequence of EPLINα. The impact of EPLINα on HECV cells was then assessed using a range of in vitro and in vivo models.RESULTS: transfection and over-expression of HECV cells with EPLINα expression plasmid resulted in a significant reduction in cell-matrix adhesion (P = 0.003), the rate of migration (P = 0.009) and tubule formation (P = 0.007) and also enhanced paxillin staining compared to transfection controls. Additionally, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells co-injected with HECV(EPLIN exp) cells developed at a slower rate than those co-injected with HECV(pEF6) cells (day 26, P = 0.05; day 33, P = 0.065, overall deviation over time P &lt; 0.001). Treatment of HECV(EPLIN exp) cells with ERK inhibitor could rescue HECV cells from the inhibitory effect of EPLINα over-expression on tubule formation, returning these cells to control levels.CONCLUSIONS: EPLINα over-expression can regulate HECV cell motility, matrix adhesion and tubule formation in vitro and slow in vivo tumour formation, suggesting an anti-angiogenic role for EPLINα. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) also appears to be linked to the ability of EPLINα to inhibit tubule formation in vitro."

The relative binding affinity of the cells for different peptides with respect to a lead 12-mer p160 peptide, identified by phage display, was evaluated using the CyQUANT fluorescence of the bound cells. Screening allowed identification of at least five new peptides that displayed higher affinity (up to 3-fold) for MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 human cancer cells compared to the p160 peptide. These peptides showed very little binding to the control (noncancerous) human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Three of these peptides were synthesized separately and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to study their uptake and interaction with the cancer and control cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. The results confirmed the high and specific affinity of an 11-mer peptide 11 (RGDPAYQGRFL) and a 10-mer peptide 18 (WXEAAYQRFL) for the cancer cells versus HUVECs. Peptide 11 binds different receptors on target cancer cells as its sequence contains multiple recognition motifs, whereas peptide 18 binds mainly to the putative p160 receptor.

We purified a 37 kDa antigen by affinity chromatography from MDA-MB-231, and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was homologous to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Therefore, immunohistochemical experiments, using specific monoclonal antibodies, evidenced a co-localization of GAPDH and Na+/K+-ATPase on the surface of commercially available and recently established breast cancer cell lines. It is of note that Na+/K+-ATPase was used as a plasma membrane marker.

The well characterized E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strain (Sakai) and its pO157-cured derivative (Sakai-Cu) were compared for phenotypic differences. Sakai-Cu had enhanced survival in synthetic gastric fluid, did not colonize cattle as well as wild-type Sakai, and had unchanged growth rates and tolerance to salt and heat. These results are consistent with our previous findings with another E. coli O157:H7 disease outbreak isolate ATCC 43894 and its pO157-cured (43894-Cu). However, despite the essentially sequence identical pO157 in these strains, Sakai-Cu had changes in antibiotic susceptibility and motility that did not occur in the 43894-Cu strain.

Its transcription from alternative promoters leads to two products, lactoferrin (Lf) and delta-lactoferrin (DeltaLf) mRNAs the expressions of which are altered during oncogenesis. The comparison of the two enhancer/promoter regions revealed that the two isoforms might be differentially trans-activated. Nevertheless, concomitant expression of both transcripts has been found in some normal tissues and in a subset of breast cancer cell lines and biopsies. Moreover, we found putative inflammatory response elements in both P1 and P2 promoter regions suggesting that both Lf and DeltaLf might be upregulated under inflammatory stimuli. Therefore, a duplex Taqman gene expression assay has been developed and used to profile mRNA expression of the Lf gene in the case of cancer and under inflammatory conditions. Discrimination between the two transcripts is achieved by using a primer pairs/probe set within exon 1beta for DeltaLf and a primer pairs/probe set within exon 1 and exon 2 for Lf. In this study, we confirmed that Lf/DeltaLf Taqman gene expression assay is a powerful tool to investigate the expression of both Lf and DeltaLf transcripts. We also showed that lymphocytes and leukocytes isolated from fresh human blood expressed an extremely high level of DeltaLf messengers. An extensive series of cancer cell lines has been studied confirming that both P1 and P2 promoter regions of the Lf gene are downregulated or silenced in the case of cancer. Furthermore, using stimulation by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), we showed that in MDA-MB-231 and HT-29 epithelial cells, Lf expression is strongly increased with a higher expression level in MDA-MB-231 whereas DeltaLf expression is not. These results suggest that the NF-kappaB/cRel response elements present in the P1 promoter region are functional whereas those present in the P2 promoter region are not and show that DeltaLf is not regulated in inflammatory conditions."

Resulting LC-MRM transitions were then used to measure changes in the glycolytic proteome in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-stimulated MCF-7 cells and other breast cell lines. Increases in the expression of glycolysis proteins leading to lactic acid production were observed common to IGF-1-stimulated MCF-7 cells and the invasive MDA-MB-231 cell line. Preliminary analysis of lung tumors with varied states of differentiation demonstrated the clinical applicability of LC-MRM and showed decreased levels of PGK1 in poorly differentiated tumors."

We previously found that cell growth suppressing retinoid CD437 enhanced expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 and DNA damage inducible GADD45 proteins in part by elevating their mRNA stability.RESULTS: Here, we investigated molecular mechanisms of CD437-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. By utilizing MDA-MB-468 HBC cells expressing chimeric rabbit beta-globin-p21WAF1/CIP1 transcripts we mapped multiple CD437-responsive sequences located within positions 1195 to 1795 of the 3'-untranslated region of p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA. Several cytoplasmic proteins present in MDA-MB-468, MCF-7 HBC as well as HL-60R leukemia cells bound specifically, in vitro, with these CD437-responsive sequences. CD437 treatment of cells resulted in elevated binding of ~85 kD and ~55 kD cytoplasmic proteins with putative CD437-responsive sequences. A 12 nt RNA sequence (5'-UGUGGUGGCACA-3') present within CD437-responsive region of p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA displayed specific and elevated binding with the above noted proteins. Treatment of cells with ActD or CHX prior to CD437 exposure did not abrogate RNA-protein interactions. However, treatment of cytoplasmic protein extracts with proteinase K or alkaline phosphatase resulted in loss of RNA-protein interactions.CONCLUSIONS: CD437 regulates cell growth in part by regulating stability of p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA that involves specific RNA-protein interactions that are phosphorylation-dependent, while not requiring nascent transcription or protein synthesis."

Cd exposure caused a down-regulation of SelP and GPx4 gene expression and a significant decrease in plasma and testicular concentrations of Se. These changes were accompanied by decreased plasma testosterone level, sperm count and motility, GSH content, protein-bound sulfhydryl concentration (PSH), enzymatic activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) as well as by increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, lipid peroxidation (as malondialdehyde, MDA) and proteins carbonyls (PC). The decrease of testicular SelP and GPx4 gene expression under Cd influence was significantly restored in Cd+Se group. Co-treatment with Cd and Se also totally reversed the Cd-induced depletion of Se, decrease in plasma testosterone level and partially restored Cd-induced oxidative stress and decrease in sperm count and motility. Taken together, these data suggest that down-regulation of SelP and GPx4 gene expression induces plasma and testicular Se depletion leading, at least in part, to Cd-induced testicular pathophysiology."

Novel gene Rab-like 3 (Rabl3), which we originally reported as a new member belonging to this subfamily, may participate in other processes in human cancer cell lines based on our research. In order to investigate the function of Rabl3 and the basic mechanism which regulates cancer cell survival and motility, we constructed the Rabl3-pcDNA3.1 fusion plasmid, also, the specific siRNA against Rabl3 was used. We detected cellular viability and motility changes in Rabl3 overexpressed or si-Rabl3 transfected cancer cell lines. Overexpression of Rabl3 resulted in the enhancement of cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis and paclitaxel resistance in human cancer cell lines. Rabl3 also promoted cell motility activity. Next, we silenced Rabl3 in order to determine its exact physiological function. We found that processes which are associated with tumor formation and metastasis were inhibited. These included an increased incidence of apoptosis, abrogated cellular proliferation and mobility. Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed that the function of Rabl3 was closely associated with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation, both in HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cell lines at the sites of Tyr 397/576/577. Our results suggested that Rabl3 may be a novel oncogene which regulates the oncological behavior of human cancer cells. As a consequence, Rabl3 can be considered as a novel candidate in the control of tumorigenesis and as a new target for anti-tumor treatment."

In order to better understand the importance of BRCA1 function and the role of other genes involved around BRCA1 in the phytoestrogen pathways, we have exploited the BRCA1-specific knockdown by RNA interference using double stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) in breast tumor cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) and a fibrokystic breast cell line (MCF-10a) and treated with 18.5 microM genistein or 78.5 microM daidzein for 72 h. We used pangenomic microarrays and subsequently TLDA analysis and demonstrated that cumulated BRCA1 knockdown with soy isoflavone supplementations in breast cell lines seems to modulate apoptosis, MAPK pathway, cell communication, xenobiotic metabolism, and sterol metabolism. Also, transient BRCA1 deficiency in breast cell lines significantly diminished or reversed gene expression after phytoestrogen supplementation. We observed that the significant decrease expression of apoptosis-related genes such as BAX, and the increase expression of BCL2, under BRCA1 knockdown condition, were completely reversed after phytoestrogen treatments. These results underlined the role of BRCA1 expression in breast carcinogenesis and suggested that soy phytoestrogen supplementation could play a role in cancer."

As one of the main causes of end-stage renal disease, the prevention and treatment of DN in early stage, and the slowing down of DN progression are of utmost importance and are topics of several ongoing research studies. Nutraceuticals endowed with antioxidant-anti-inflammatory properties may offer an opportunity of integrative treatment for this condition. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to two groups. One group of rats (diabetic group) received a single tail-vein injection of STZ compound (50 mg/kg) under light anaesthesia. A protective dose of 0.5 ml of 5 percent dextrose was given intraperitoneally 30 min before the administration of STZ. One diabetic group was fed a normal pellet diet (group A) while group B was fed the diet added with DTS (panax pseudoginseng, eucommia ulmoides), (Kyotsu Jigyo, Tokyo, Japan) in the proportion of 50/25 (percent weight/weight), at the dose of 50 mg/kg/day throughout the experimental period. At the end of 8 weeks, 24-hour urine was collected for the measurement of the albumin concentration: blood samples were collected for serum biochemistry and the rats were sacrificed for kidney measurement of oxidative stress and histomorphological features. Nephrin and Macrophage Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) gene expression were also assessed by fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR after RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. STZ-treated animals showed significantly increased in lipid peroxidation in the kidney and in proteinuria. DTS supplementation did not affect plasma glucose but significantly decreased malonyldialdehyde (MDA) plasma level and the overall redox parameters together with a partial mitigation of proteinuria. Histological analysis showed also that DTS significantly reduced the glomerular volume together with glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis score (p less than 0.05), the latter two being correlated to proteinuria (p less than 0.05). DTS supplementation also enabled a reduction of diabetes-induced decrease of nephrin mRNA expression and a 67 percent reduction of MCP-1 mRNA up-regulation (p less than 0.01). Taken altogether, these data show that, besides the mandatory control of glycemia, intervention with a nutraceutical with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may have beneficial effects when integrated in the mainstream of the therapeutic regimen."

In an attempt to develop an efficient peptide-based radiopharmaceutical for targeting bombesin (BN) receptor-expressing tumors (i.e., breast and prostate), we have prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis, a novel BN analog derived from the universal sequence of BN and conjugated to a widely characterized antineoplastic agent, methotrexate (MTX). MTX-BN, after radiolabeling with (99m)Tc via stannous-tartrate exchange, showed a good stability against cysteine and histidine transchelation as well as a high in vitro metabolic stability in human plasma. In vitro cell-binding and internalization on MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, T47-D breast cancer and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated high affinity and specificity of (99m)Tc-MTX-BN towards both human breast and prostate cancer cells (binding affinities in nanomolar range). In addition, the radioconjugate displayed a significant internalization (values ranged between 19-35%) into the tumor cells. In vivo biodistribution and clearance kinetics in Balb/c mice are characterized by an efficient clearance from the blood and excretion mainly through the renal-urinary pathway with some elimination via the hepatobiliary system. In vivo tumor uptake in nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 cells was 2.70+/-0.44% ID/g at 1 h, whereas in nude mice with human epidermoid KB cells the accumulation in the tumor was found to be 1.48+/-0.31% ID/g at 1 h post injection. The tumor uptake was always higher than in the blood and muscle, with good tumor retention and good tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios. The accumulation/retention in the major organs (i.e., lungs, stomach, liver, intestines, etc.) was low to moderate (&lt;6% ID/g) in both healthy and tumor-bearing mice. However, the uptake/retention in the kidneys was rather high (up to 11.05+/-1.80% ID/g), which is of a concern, particularly for radionuclide therapy. This initial study towards the development of a novel cytotoxic BN conjugate suggest that the combination of favorable in vitro and in vivo properties may render (99m)Tc-MTX-BN a potential candidate for the targeted imaging and eventually for radionuclide therapy (when labeled with an appropriate radionuclide) of BN receptor-positive tumors and deserves further evaluation."

The molecular function of human LFG and its regulation in carcinogenesis is uncertain. In our study, we investigated the potential regulation of LFG expression by Akt/LEF-1 pathway. The Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) can be regulated by different signaling pathways including those mediated by protein kinase Akt. Inhibition of GSK3beta subunits activity results in the stabilisation of the beta-catenin protein and its accumulation in the nucleus, where it associates with members of the TCF/LEF-1 family of transcription factors to mediate gene transcription. In Western blots, RT-PCR and by small interfering RNA directed against LEF-1, we demonstrated that LFG expression correlates with GSK3beta and LEF-1 activation. Moreover, we showed that LFG mRNA was down-regulated after transfection with siRNA against LEF-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results therefore identify LFG as a target of the Akt/LEF-1 pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast tumour cells, a regulation which could play a key role in breast tumour progression."

Automated capillary electrophoresis using a high resolution kit and amplicon sequencing confirmed variations in the cagA EPIYA motif region. In nine cases, sequencing revealed the presence of AB, ABC, or ABCC (Western type) cagA EPIYA motif, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to determine the tumor-suppressive potential of XEDAR in the development of breast cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed the expression of XEDAR in breast cancer cell lines and tumor samples using quantitative real-time PCR analysis and immunoblotting. We analyzed the human XEDAR gene promoter for the presence of any CpG island and examined its methylation status using methylation-specific real-time PCR. We examined the effect of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine on the expression of XEDAR and sensitivity to EDA-A2-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines.RESULTS: Expression of XEDAR, but not EDA-A2, was downregulated in most tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines and tumor samples. Loss of XEDAR expression correlated with the hypermethylation of its promoter. Ectopic expression of XEDAR in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in significant induction of apoptosis and reduction in colony formation. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored XEDAR expression in breast cancer cell lines with methylated XEDAR promoter and sensitized them to EDA-A2-induced cell death.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that XEDAR expression is downregulated in most breast cancers via promoter methylation, which may contribute to accelerated tumor development by blocking EDA-A2-induced cell death. XEDAR may represent a novel breast tumor suppressor gene, and restoration of its expression by treatment with DNA demethylating agents may represent an attractive approach for the treatment of breast cancer."

In order to obtain genetic information from uncultured magnetotactic bacteria, a genome preparation method that involves magnetic separation of cells, flow cytometry, and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) using phi29 polymerase was used in this study. The conditions for the MDA reaction using samples containing 1 to 100 cells were evaluated using a pure-culture magnetotactic bacterium, &quot;Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1,&quot; whose complete genome sequence is available. Uniform gene amplification was confirmed by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) when 100 cells were used as a template. This method was then applied for genome preparation of uncultured magnetotactic bacteria from complex bacterial communities in an aquatic environment. A sample containing 100 cells of the uncultured magnetotactic coccus was prepared by magnetic cell separation and flow cytometry and used as an MDA template. 16S rRNA sequence analysis of the MDA product from these 100 cells revealed that the amplified genomic DNA was from a single species of magnetotactic bacterium that was phylogenetically affiliated with magnetotactic cocci in the Alphaproteobacteria. The combined use of magnetic separation, flow cytometry, and MDA provides a new strategy to access individual genetic information from magnetotactic bacteria in environmental samples."

The MDA step generates sufficient DNA from labelled nucleic acid for metagenomic library construction. Subsequently, genome fragments can be subjected to a variety of screens for phylogenetic or functional genes relevant to active community members. The MDA-generated DNA can also serve as template for direct high-throughput sequencing to aid reconstruction of metabolic pathways of those active organisms.

Heat environmental stress (HES) induced changes in gene expression transcript profiles, including those related to fatty acid synthase activity, oxidoreductase activity and lipid peroxidation (LPO). We observed dramatically increased malonaldehyde (MDA) levels after HES, which indicates that HES caused LPO through the regulation of oxidative stress and LPO-related transcripts, as revealed by microarray. When ASE was orally administered to the HES group, the number of candidate validation genes as well as the MDA content decreased in comparison to rats that did not receive ASE. Furthermore, rats in the HES group that received orally administered ASE experienced significantly lower oxidative stress, as indicated by the expression of certain genes. Based on the combined results of this study, we concluded that a number of the functional responses to HES at the RNA expression level were revealed by the increased MDA content, which supports the use of rodent models for the study of heat environmental stress.

Many filamentous fungi are slow growing or even unculturable and current DNA isolation methods are often unsatisfactory. Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is a technique that can be employed to reliably amplify whole genomes from such recalcitrant species. Template DNA obtained using traditional DNA extraction methods, glass bead-mediated disruption of fungal spores or alkaline lysis of mycelium can be used to produce DNA of sufficient quality to be used as a substrate in MDA. With the advent of next generation sequencing methods, the ability to utilize relatively small samples of DNA to achieve complete genome sequencing is now a possibility."

However, use of high resolution array CGH in the clinical setting is plagued by the problem of widespread copy number variations (CNV) in the human genome. Constitutional microarray, containing only clones that interrogate regions of known constitutional syndromes, may circumvent the dilemma of detecting CNV of unknown clinical significance.METHODS: The present study investigated the efficacy of constitutional microarray in the diagnosis of trisomy. Test samples included genomic DNA from trisomic cell lines, amplification products of 50 ng of genomic DNA and whole genome amplification products of single cells. DNA amplification was achieved by means of multiple displacement amplification (MDA) over 16 h.RESULTS: The trisomic and sex chromosomes copy number imbalances in the genomic DNA were correctly identified by the constitutional microarrays. However, there was a failure to detect the trisomy in the amplification products of 50 ng of genomic DNA and whole genome amplification products of single cells.CONCLUSION: Using carefully selected clones, Spectral Genomics constitutional microarray was able to detect the chromosomal copy number imbalances in genomic DNA without the confounding effects of CNV. The diagnostic failure in amplified DNA samples could be attributed to the amplification process. The MDA duration of 16 h generated excessive amount of biases and shortening the duration might minimize the problem."

In the present study, we took advantage of a cationic liposome as gene carrier and targeted FAK function through both in vitro and in vivo approaches.METHODS: We utilized a plasmid-encoded hairpin RNA targeting the human FAK mRNA (pGensil2-shRNA/FAK), as a means to inhibit FAK expression for evaluating its anti-tumor effect in vitro and in vivo. Human MDA-MB-435S breast cancer cells were transfected with pGensil2-shRNA/FAK and examined for apoptosis by propidium iodide staining, DNA ladder, and flow cytometric analysis. For in vivo study, subcutaneous breast carcinomatosis models in nude mice were established to evaluate the therapeutic potential of pGensil2-shRNA/FAK. Assessments of proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (TUNEL) and angiogenesis (CD31) were done using immunohistochemical analysis.RESULTS: Transcripts expressed from plasmid both in vitro and in vivo were identified by northern blot analysis. pGensil2-shRNA/FAK effectively down-regulated the expression of FAK as demonstrated in vitro by real time RT-PCR and western blot analysis, whereas by real time RT-PCR and IHC staining of MDA-MB-435S tumors growing subcutaneously. Breast cancer cells lacking FAK expression undergo apoptosis in vitro. Systemic delivery of cationic liposome-complexed plasmids targeting FAK, resulted in the diminishment of subcutaneous tumor growth beyond the effects observed with liposomes carrying a non-specific shRNA. This diminishment in growth was associated with elevated levels of apoptosis (TUNEL staining), decreased cell proliferation (Ki-67 staining) and diminished endothelial cell density (CD31 staining).CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the systemic delivery of plasmid DNA targeting FAK function using cationic liposome as a gene carrier, represents a promising avenue for breast cancer therapy."

Originally described as a human breast cancer cell line, subsequent expression array studies instead suggested a gene expression profile consistent with a melanoma origin. Subsequent karyotype and comparative genomic hybridization studies supported the idea that current stocks of both MDA-MB-435 cells and M14 melanoma cells must be identical cell lines, and the conclusion was drawn that both cell lines were in fact M14 melanoma cells. However, an alternate conclusion based on these data is that both cell lines are indeed identical, but are in fact MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. There is evidence that many cell lines can display &quot;lineage infidelity&quot; and that assignment to tissue type is unreliably made based on expression patterns. Evidence from the literature is presented here that is inconsistent with both lines being of M14 melanoma origin, but rather is consistent with both cell lines being of MDA-MB-435 breast cancer origin."

As protein kinases reside at the nodes of phosphorylation-based signal transmission, comprehensive analysis of their cellular expression and site-specific phosphorylation can provide important insights into the architecture and functionality of signaling networks. However, in global proteome studies, low cellular abundance of protein kinases often results in rather minor peptide species that are occluded by a vast excess of peptides from other cellular proteins. These analytical limitations create a rationale for kinome-wide enrichment of protein kinases prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Here, we employed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to compare the binding characteristics of three kinase-selective affinity resins by quantitative mass spectrometry. The evaluated pre-fractionation tools possessed pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based kinase inhibitors as immobilized capture ligands and retained considerable subsets of the human kinome. Based on these results, an affinity resin displaying the broadly selective kinase ligand VI16832 was employed to quantify the relative expression of more than 170 protein kinases across three different, SILAC-encoded cancer cell lines. These experiments demonstrated the feasibility of comparative kinome profiling in a compact experimental format. Interestingly, we found high levels of cytoplasmic and low levels of receptor tyrosine kinases in MV4-11 leukemia cells compared with the adherent cancer lines HCT116 and MDA-MB-435S. The VI16832 resin was further exploited to pre-fractionate kinases for targeted phosphoproteomics analysis, which revealed about 1200 distinct phosphorylation sites on more than 200 protein kinases. This hitherto largest survey of site-specific phosphorylation across the kinome significantly expands the basis for functional follow-up studies on protein kinase regulation. In conclusion, the straightforward experimental procedures described here enable different implementations of kinase-selective proteomics with considerable potential for future signal transduction and kinase drug target analysis."

We previously demonstrated that VP35 inhibits the virus-induced activation of the IFN-beta promoter by blocking the phosphorylation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a transcription factor that is crucial for the induction of IFN-alpha/beta expression. Furthermore, VP35 blocks IFN-beta promoter activation induced by any of several components of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5)-activated signaling pathways including RIG-I, IFN-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1), and IkappaB kinase epsilon (IKKepsilon). These results suggested that VP35 may target the IRF kinases TBK-1 and IKKepsilon. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments now demonstrate physical interactions of VP35 with IKKepsilon and TBK-1, and the use of an IKKepsilon deletion construct further demonstrates that the amino-terminal kinase domain of IKKepsilon is sufficient for interactions with either IRF-3 or VP35. In vitro, either IKKepsilon or TBK-1 phosphorylates not only IRF-3 but also VP35. Moreover, VP35 overexpression impairs IKKepsilon-IRF-3, IKKepsilon-IRF-7, and IKKepsilon-IPS-1 interactions. Finally, lysates from cells overexpressing IKKepsilon contain kinase activity that can phosphorylate IRF-3 in vitro. When VP35 is expressed in the IKKepsilon-expressing cells, this kinase activity is suppressed. These data suggest that VP35 exerts its IFN-antagonist function, at least in part, by blocking necessary interactions between the kinases IKKepsilon and TBK-1 and their normal interaction partners, including their substrates, IRF-3 and IRF-7."

Because many laboratories around the world rely on data from the NCI-60 cells, confirmation of their genetic identities represents an essential step in validating results from them. Given the consequences of cell line contamination or misidentification, quality control measures should routinely include DNA fingerprinting. We have, therefore, used standard DNA microsatellite short tandem repeats to profile the NCI-60, and the resulting DNA fingerprints are provided here as a reference. Consistent with previous reports, the fingerprints suggest that several NCI-60 lines have common origins: the melanoma lines MDA-MB-435, MDA-N, and M14; the central nervous system lines U251 and SNB-19; the ovarian lines OVCAR-8 and OVCAR-8/ADR (also called NCI/ADR); and the prostate lines DU-145, DU-145 (ATCC), and RC0.1. Those lines also show that the ability to connect two fingerprints to the same origin is not affected by stable transfection or by the development of multidrug resistance. As expected, DNA fingerprints were not able to distinguish different tissues-of-origin. The fingerprints serve principally as a barcodes."

The mechanical and chemical features of 3D microenvironments play important roles in tissue engineering, tumor growth and metastasis, and in defining stem cell niches, and it is increasingly recognized that cells behave much differently when surrounded by a 3D ECM than when anchored to a 2D substrate. To create microenvironments that more closely mimic in vivo settings, here we describe a novel microfluidic device that allows multiple discrete constructs of 3D cell-laden hydrogels to be patterned in a sequence of simple steps. The microfluidic platform allows for real-time imaging of the interactions between multiple cell types exposed to both autocrine and paracrine signaling molecules, all within a 3D ECM environment. Detailed modeling determined that surface tension, hydrophobic interactions, and spatial geometry were important factors in containing the gels within distinct separate channels during the filling process. This allowed us to pattern multiple gel types side-by-side and pattern 3D gels spatially with tight dimensional control. Cells embedded in gels could be patterned by culturing MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cells and RAW 264.1 macrophage cells within distinct collagen type I and Matrigel ECM environments, respectively. Over a 7 day culture experiment, RAW cells invaded into neighboring gels containing MDA-MB-231 cells, but not into gels lacking cells. These studies demonstrate the versatility and potential of this new microfluidic platform to engineer 3D microscale architectures to investigate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions."

The loss of E-cadherin expression in human tumors, including breast cancer, has been attributed to promoter CpG island hypermethylation and direct inhibition by transcriptional repressors. Recent evidence demonstrates that up-regulation of E-cadherin by microRNA-200b (miR-200b) and miR-200c through direct targeting of transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin, ZEB1, and ZEB2, inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a crucial process in the tumor progression. We demonstrate that microRNA miR-200 family-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of E-cadherin in mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells is associated directly with translational repression of ZEB1 and indirectly with increased acetylation of histone H3 at the E-cadherin promoter. The increase in histone H3 acetylation may be attributed to the disruption of repressive complexes between ZEB1 and histone deacetylases and to the inhibition of SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase. These events inhibit EMT and reactivate a less aggressive epithelial phenotype in cancer cells. Additionally, disruption of ZEB1-histone deacetylase repressor complexes and down-regulation of SIRT1 histone deacetylase up-regulate proapoptotic genes in the p53 apoptotic pathway resulting in the increased sensitivity of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin."

A9 neurons form the nigrostriatal pathway and are involved in regulating voluntary movements and postural reflexes. Their selective degeneration leads to Parkinson's disease. Here, we report that gene expression analysis of A9 dopaminergic neurons (DA) identifies transcripts for alpha- and beta-chains of hemoglobin (Hb). Globin immunoreactivity decorates the majority of A9 DA, a subpopulation of cortical and hippocampal astrocytes and mature oligodendrocytes. This pattern of expression was confirmed in different mouse strains and in rat and human. We show that Hb is expressed in the SN of human postmortem brain. By microarray analysis of dopaminergic cell lines overexpressing alpha- and beta-globin chains, changes in genes involved in O(2) homeostasis and oxidative phopshorylation were observed, linking Hb expression to mitochondrial function. Our data suggest that the most famed oxygen-carrying globin is not exclusively restricted to the blood, but it may play a role in the normal physiology of the brain and neurodegenerative diseases."

Consequently, identifying cancer stem cells is crucial to our understanding of cancer progression and for the development of novel therapeutic agents. In this study, we demonstrate that the overexpression of Twist in breast cells can promote the generation of a breast cancer stem cell phenotype characterized by the high expression of CD44, little or no expression of CD24, and increased aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 activity, independent of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In addition, Twist-overexpressing cells exhibit high efflux of Hoechst 33342 and Rhodamine 123 as a result of increased expression of ABCC1 (MRP1) transporters, a property of cancer stem cells. Moreover, we show that transient expression of Twist can induce the stem cell phenotype in multiple breast cell lines and that decreasing Twist expression by short hairpin RNA in Twist-overexpressing transgenic cell lines MCF-10A/Twist and MCF-7/Twist as well as in MDA-MB-231 partially reverses the stem cell molecular signature. Importantly, we show that inoculums of only 20 cells of the Twist-overexpressing CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) subpopulation are capable of forming tumors in the mammary fat pad of severe combined immunodeficient mice. Finally, with respect to mechanism, we provide data to indicate that Twist transcriptionally regulates CD24 expression in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate the direct involvement of Twist in generating a breast cancer stem cell phenotype through down-regulation of CD24 expression and independent of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition."

In this study, we assessed AR status in a cohort of 215 invasive ductal breast carcinomas. AR and (ER(alpha)) were coexpressed in the majority (80-90%) of breast tumor cells. Kaplan-Meier product limit analysis and multivariate Cox regression showed that AR is an independent prognostic factor in (ER(alpha))-positive disease, with a low level of AR (less than median of 75% positive cells) conferring a 4.6-fold increased risk of cancer-related death (P = 0.002). Consistent with a role for AR in breast cancer outcome, AR potently inhibited (ER(alpha))transactivation activity and 17beta-estradiol-stimulated growth of breast cancer cells. Transfection of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with either functionally impaired AR variants or the DNA-binding domain of the AR indicated that the latter is both necessary and sufficient for inhibition of (ER(alpha)) signaling. Consistent with molecular modeling, electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed binding of the AR to an estrogen-responsive element (ERE). Evidence for a functional interaction of the AR with an ERE in vivo was provided by chromatin immunoprecipitation data, revealing recruitment of the AR to the progesterone receptor promoter in T-47D breast cancer cells. We conclude that, by binding to a subset of EREs, the AR can prevent activation of target genes that mediate the stimulatory effects of 17beta-estradiol on breast cancer cells."

These mechanisms were studied in A2058 melanoma cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-361 breast, SKOV-3 ovarian and UT-SCC118 squamous carcinoma cells by analysing hyaluronan synthesis, UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) content, and hyaluronan synthase (HAS) mRNA levels. The maximal inhibition in hyaluronan synthesis ranged 22-80% in the cell lines tested. Active glucuronidation of 4-MU produced large quantities of 4-MU-glucuronide, depleting the cellular UDP-GlcUA pool. The maximal reduction varied between 38 and 95%. 4-MU also downregulated HAS mRNA levels: HAS3 was 84-60% lower in MDA-MB-361, A2058 and SKOV-3 cells. HAS2 was the major isoenzyme in MCF-7 cells and lowered by 81%, similar to 88% in A2058 cells. These data indicate that both HAS substrate and HAS2 and/or HAS3 mRNA are targeted by 4-MU. Despite different target point sensitivities, the reduction of hyaluronan caused by 4-MU was associated with a significant inhibition of cell migration, proliferation and invasion, supporting the importance of hyaluronan synthesis in cancer, and the therapeutic potential of hyaluronan synthesis inhibition."

Ectopic expression of miR-193b repressed the expression of sensor constructs harboring the 3'UTR of uPA in breast cancer cell lines. Anti-miR-193b treatment led to an increase of uPA protein and increased cell invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells.

In an immunodeficient mouse model, miR-193b significantly inhibited the growth and dissemination of xenograft tumors. Immunohistochemical staining and real-time PCR assays showed that miR-193b was a negative regulator of the uPA gene in primary breast tumors.

Here we show in MDA-MB453 breast cancer cells that the natural VDR ligand 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) causes cyclical transcription factor binding and chromatin looping of distal VDREs to the transcription start site (TSS) of the p21 gene, leading to cyclical accumulation of the p21 mRNA. At the chromatin level, association of the mediator protein MED1 precedes both the peaks of VDR binding to VDREs and phosphorylated RNA polymerase (p-Pol II) to the TSS. The loss of co-repressor NCoR1-histone deacetylase (HDAC) 3 complex and inhibitory chromatin looping from VDREs to the TSS are also initial events followed by increased acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 at the TSS prior to initiation of transcription. Simultaneous to VDR and p-Pol II peaks, chromatin loops between VDREs and the TSS are formed, and the lysine demethylase LSD1 and the histone acetyltransferase CBP are enriched in both regions. This is followed by a moderate peak in p21 transcript accumulation, repeated in cycles of 45-60 min. The transcript accumulation pattern is disturbed by siRNA inhibition of the mediator protein MED1, LSD1, NCoR1, or various HDACs, whereas CBP appears unnecessary for the response. Inhibition of MED1, HDAC4, or LSD1 by siRNA also attenuates ligand-induced chromatin looping. In conclusion, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) regulates p21 transcription by inducing cyclical chromatin looping that depends on both histone deacetylation and demethylation."

Metastatic disease in the brain is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We present the first gene expression analysis of laser-captured epithelial cells from resected human brain metastases of breast cancer compared with unlinked primary breast tumors. The tumors were matched for histology, tumor-node-metastasis stage, and hormone receptor status. Most differentially expressed genes were down-regulated in the brain metastases, which included, surprisingly, many genes associated with metastasis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed statistically significant differences or strong trends in the expression of six genes: BMP1, PEDF, LAMgamma3, SIAH, STHMN3, and TSPD2. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) was also of interest because of its increased expression in brain metastases. HK2 is important in glucose metabolism and apoptosis. In agreement with our microarray results, HK2 levels (both mRNA and protein) were elevated in a brain metastatic derivative (231-BR) of the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 relative to the parental cell line (231-P) in vitro. Knockdown of HK2 expression in 231-BR cells using short hairpin RNA reduced cell proliferation when cultures were maintained in glucose-limiting conditions. Finally, HK2 expression was analyzed in a cohort of 123 resected brain metastases of breast cancer. High HK2 expression was significantly associated with poor patient survival after craniotomy (P = 0.028). The data suggest that HK2 overexpression is associated with metastasis to the brain in breast cancer and it may be a therapeutic target."

To assess dependence on MUC1, we synthesized an inhibitor, designated GO-201, which interacts directly with the MUC1-C subunit at its oligomerization domain. Treatment of MUC1-positive DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells with GO-201, and not an altered version, resulted in inhibition of proliferation. GO-201 also induced necrotic cell death that was associated with increases in reactive oxygen species, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and depletion of ATP. By contrast, GO-201 had no effect against MUC1-negative LNCaP, CWR22Rv1, and MDA-PCa-2b prostate cancer cells. Significantly, GO-201 treatment of DU145 and PC3 xenografts growing in nude mice resulted in complete tumor regression and prolonged lack of recurrence.

In weakly metastatic MCF7 cells, histone H3 K9 methylation, HP1 binding, and weak recruitment of AP-1 Fra-1/c-Jun, NF-kappaB p65 transcription factors, and coactivators is indicative of low chromatin accessibility and gene transcription at the IL-6 gene promoter. In highly metastatic MDA-MB231 cells, strong DNase, MNase, and restriction enzyme accessibility, as well potent constitutive transcription of the IL-6 gene promoter, coincide with increased H3 S10 K14 phosphoacetylation and promoter enrichment of AP-1 Fra-1/c-Jun and NF-kappaB p65 transcription factors and MSK1, CBP/p300, Brg1, and Ezh2 cofactors.

Recent literature implicates multiple chemokines in the formation of bone metastases in breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of metastatic bone disease in breast cancer remains unknown. We have recently made the novel observation of the BST2 protein expression in human breast cancer cell lines. The purpose of our present study is to investigate the expression and the role of BST2 in bone metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: cDNA microarray analysis was used to compare the BST2 gene expression between a metastatic to bone human breast cancer cell line (MDA-231BO) and a primary human breast cancer cell line (MDA-231). The BST2 expression in one bone metastatic breast cancer and seven non-bone metastatic breast cancer cell lines were also determined using real-time RT-PCR and Western blot assays. We then employed tissue array to further study the BST2 expression in human breast cancer using array slides containing 20 independent breast cancer tumors that formed metastatic bone lesions, 30 non-metastasis-forming breast cancer tumors, and 8 normal breast tissues. In order to test the feasibility of utilizing BST2 as a serum marker for the presence of bone metastasis in breast cancer, we had measured the BST2 expression levels in human serums by using ELISA on 43 breast cancer patients with bone metastasis, 43 breast cancer patients without bone metastasis, and 14 normal healthy controls. The relationship between cell migration and proliferation and BST2 expression was also studied in a human breast recombinant model system using migration and FACS analysis.RESULTS: The microarray demonstrated over expression of the BST2 gene in the bone metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-231BO) compared to the primary human breast cancer cell line (MDA-231). The expression of the BST2 gene was significantly increased in the bone metastatic breast cancer cell lines and tumor tissues compared to non-bone metastatic breast cancer cell lines and tumor tissues by real time RT-PCR, Western blot and TMA. Furthermore, serum levels of BST2 measured by ELISA were also significantly higher among patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone compared to breast cancer patients without metastatic to bone (P &lt; .0001). Most importantly, the breast cancer cell line that transfected with BST2 demonstrated increased BST2 expressions, which was associated with increased cancer cell migration and cell proliferation.CONCLUSION: These results provide novel data indicating the BST2 protein expression is associated with the formation of bone metastases in human breast cancer. We believe that BST2 may be a potential biomarker in breast cancer with bone metastasis."

The stable, approximately 15-20-MDa scaffold ring of the NPC is built from two multiprotein complexes arranged around a central 8-fold axis. Here we present crystal structures of two large architectural units, yNup170(979-1502) and hNup107(658-925) x hNup133(517-1156), each a constituent of one of the two multiprotein complexes. Conservation of domain arrangement and of tertiary structure suggests that Nup157/170 and Nup133 derived from a common ancestor. Together with the previously established ancestral coatomer element (ACE1), these two elements constitute the major alpha-helical building blocks of the NPC scaffold and define its branched, lattice-like architecture, similar to vesicle coats like COPII. We hypothesize that the extant NPC evolved early during eukaryotic evolution from a rudimentary structure composed of several identical copies of a few ancestral elements, later diversified and specified by gene duplication."

The purpose of this study was to design a peptide-based therapy that would block these intracellular protein-protein interactions as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The amino acid residues responsible for these interactions lie in tandem in the cytoplasmic domain of MUC1, and we have targeted this sequence to produce a MUC1 peptide that blocks the protumorigenic functions of MUC1. We designed the MUC1 inhibitory peptide (MIP) to block the intracellular interactions between MUC1/beta-catenin and MUC1/EGFR. To allow for cellular uptake we synthesized MIP adjacent to the protein transduction domain, PTD4 (PMIP).RESULTS: We have found that PMIP acts in a dominant-negative fashion, blocking both MUC1/beta-catenin and MUC1/EGFR interactions. In addition, PMIP induces ligand-dependent reduction of EGFR levels. These effects correspond to a significant reduction in proliferation, migration, and invasion of metastatic breast cancer cells in vitro, and inhibition of tumor growth and recurrence in an established MDA-MB-231 immunocompromised (SCID) mouse model. Importantly, PMIP also inhibits genetically driven breast cancer progression, as injection of tumor-bearing MMTV-pyV mT transgenic mice with PMIP results in tumor regression and a significant inhibition of tumor growth rate.CONCLUSIONS: These data show that intracellular MUC1 peptides possess significant antitumor activity and have important clinical applications in the treatment of cancer."

Additional functional experiments with cycloheximide, Brefeldin A, or vincristine were done to analyze the biology of the CK19-release. CK19-EPISPOT was used to detect disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow (BM) of 45 breast cancer patients who were then followed up over a median of 6 years.RESULTS: CK19 was expressed and released by colorectal (HT-29, HCT116, Caco-2) and breast (MCF-7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines. The CK19-EPISPOT was more sensitive than the CK19-ELISA. Dual fluorescent EPISPOT with antibodies against different CK19 epitopes showed the release of the full-length CK19, which was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Functional experiments indicated that CK19 release was an active process and not simply the consequence of cell death. CK19-releasing cells (RCs) were detectable in BM of 44% to 70% of breast cancer patients. This incidence and the number of CK19-RCs were correlated to the presence of overt metastases, and patients with CK19-RCs had a reduced survival as compared with patients without these cells (P = 0.025, log-rank test; P = 0.0019, hazard ratio, 4.7; multivariate analysis).CONCLUSIONS: Full-length CK19 is released by viable epithelial tumor cells, and CK19-RCs might constitute a biologically active subset of breast cancer cells with high metastatic properties."

Cell adhesion molecules play a pivotal role in this phenomenon by regulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. CD146 (MCAM) is associated with an advanced tumor stage in melanoma, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer. Studies of CD146 expression and function in breast cancer remain scarce except for a report concluding that CD146 could act as a tumor suppressor in breast carcinogenesis.METHODS: To resolve these apparent discrepancies in the role of CD146 in tumor cells, we looked at the association of CD146 expression with histoclinical features in human primary breast cancers using DNA and tissue microarrays. By flow cytometry, we characterized CD146 expression on different breast cancer cell lines. Using siRNA or shRNA technology, we studied functional consequences of CD146 downmodulation of MDA-MB-231 cells in migration assays. Wild-type, mock-transfected and downmodulated transfected cells were profiled using whole-genome DNA microarrays to identify genes whose expression was modified by CD146 downregulation.RESULTS: Microarray studies revealed the association of higher levels of CD146 with histoclinical features that belong to the basal cluster of human tumors. Expression of CD146 protein on epithelial cells was detected in a small subset of cancers with histoclinical features of basal tumors. CD146+ cell lines displayed a mesenchymal phenotype. Downmodulation of CD146 expression in the MDA-MB-231 cell line resulted in downmodulation of vimentin, as well as of a set of genes that include both genes associated with a poor prognosis in a variety of cancers and genes known to promote cell motility. In vitro functional assays revealed decreased migration abilities associated with decreased CD146 expression.CONCLUSIONS: In addition to its expression in the vascular compartment, CD146 is expressed on a subset of epithelial cells in malignant breast. CD146 may directly or indirectly contribute to tumor aggressiveness by promoting malignant cell motility. Changes in molecular signatures following downmodulation of CD146 expression suggest that CD146 downmodulation is associated with the reversal of several biological characteristics associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and the phenomenon associated with the metastatic process."

Herein, we report on a genomics approach to elucidate mechanisms downstream of JAG1 that promote breast cancer growth. In a survey of 46 breast cancer cell lines, we found that triple negative (TN; basal and mesenchymal ER-, PR-, and Her2-negative) lines express JAG1 at significantly higher levels than do HER2(+) or luminal (ER(+)) Her2(-) cell lines. In contrast to the luminal lines tested (T47D and MCF7), TN breast cancer cell lines (HCC1143 and MDA MB231) display high-level JAG1 expression and growth inhibition with RNA interference-induced JAG1 down-regulation. We used microarray profiling of TN tumor cells transfected with JAG1 siRNA to identify JAG1-regulated genes (P &lt;or= 0.005; fold change &gt;or=1.5). Among JAG1-regulated genes identified, cyclin D1 was found to be a direct target of NOTCH1 and NOTCH3. We show that JAG1 down-regulation reduces direct binding of Notch to the cyclin D1 promoter, reduced cyclin D1 expression and inhibition of cell cycle progression through the cyclin D1-dependant G1/S checkpoint. Furthermore, we show that cyclin D1 and JAG1 expression correlate in TN breast cancer expression datasets. These data suggest a model whereby JAG1 promotes cyclin D1-mediated proliferation of TN breast cancers."

As migration is required for tumor cell invasion and metastasis, we sought to elucidate the role of JAM-A in invasive breast cancer. A breast cancer tissue microarray was analyzed for JAM-A protein expression, in parallel with analysis of JAM-A gene expression data from a breast cancer clinical dataset. Our data demonstrate a novel association between JAM-A gene and protein upregulation and poor prognosis in breast cancer. To mechanistically dissect this process, we used lentiviral technology to stably knock down JAM-A gene expression by shRNA in MCF7 breast cancer cells, which express high-endogenous levels of JAM-A. We also antagonized JAM-A function in wild-type MCF7 cells using an inhibitory antibody that blocks JAM-A dimerization. Knockdown or functional antagonism of JAM-A decreased breast cancer cell migration in scratch-wound assays. Reductions in beta1-integrin protein levels were observed after JAM-A-knockdown in MCF7 cells, suggesting a mechanism for reduced motility after loss of JAM-A. Consistent with this hypothesis, tissue microarray analysis of beta1-integrin protein expression in invasive breast cancer tissues revealed a trend toward high beta1-integrin protein levels being indicative of poor prognosis. Twenty-two percent of patients were observed to coexpress high levels of JAM-A and beta1-integrin protein, and MDA-MB-231 breast cells stably overexpressing JAM-A showed an increase in beta1-integrin protein expression. Our results are consistent with a previously unreported role for JAM-A overexpression as a possible mechanism contributing to progression in primary breast cancer; and a potential therapeutic target."

The formation of new vessels is tightly regulated by a balance between endogenous proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors to maintain homeostasis in tissue; tumor progression and metastasis in breast cancer have been shown to be angiogenesis-dependent. We previously introduced a systematic methodology to identify putative endogenous antiangiogenic peptides and validated these predictions in vitro in human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation and migration assays. These peptides are derived from several protein families including type IV collagen, CXC chemokines, and thrombospondin-1 domain-containing proteins. On the basis of the results from the in vitro screening, we have evaluated the ability of one peptide selected from each family named pentastatin-1, chemokinostatin-1, and properdistatin, respectively, to suppress angiogenesis in an MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer orthotopic xenograft model in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Peptides were administered intraperitoneally once per day. We have demonstrated significant suppression of tumor growth in vivo and subsequent reductions in microvascular density, indicating the potential of these peptides as therapeutic agents for breast cancer."

In this study, we studied the role of cancer cell mutant mtDNA in tumorigenesis. We sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome of three different breast cancer cell lines and found that all three, MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, contained mutations in mtDNA. MDA-MB-435 cells contained a mutation in the tRNA(Leu(CUN)) gene known to be involved in pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases. We generated a mutant cybrid (cytoplasmic hybrid) by repopulating the recipient rho(0) (completely devoid of mtDNA) cells with donor mtDNA derived from an enucleated MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell line. An isogenic wild-type cybrid was produced by transfer of normal mtDNA from a healthy donor. When compared to the wild type, we found that mutant mtDNA increases mitochondrial membrane potential. However, this increase in mitochondrial membrane potential was not associated with increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. MtDNA mutations conferred resistance to apoptosis triggered by etoposide. Our study also revealed that mutations in mtDNA increase metastatic potential. Using a tail-vein model of metastasis in a mouse model, we show that the mutant cybrid metastatizes to the lungs and forms macrometastic foci. Additionally we found that mutations in mtDNA constitutively activate the PI3/Akt pathway that contributes to increased metastatis. Together our study demonstrates that mutant mtDNA promotes apoptotic resistance and metastasis in a mouse model."

Because many known disease biomarkers are both glycoproteins and membrane bound, we chose the hydrazide method to specifically target, enrich, and identify glycosylated proteins from breast cancer cell membrane fractions using the LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Our initial goal was to select membrane proteins from breast cancer cell lines and then to use the hydrazide method to identify the N-linked proteome as a prelude to evaluation of plasma/serum proteins from cancer patients. A combination of steps facilitated identification of the glycopeptides and also defined the glycosylation sites. In MCF-7, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468 cell membrane fractions, use of the hydrazide method facilitated an initial enrichment and site mapping of 27 N-linked glycosylation sites in 25 different proteins. However, only three N-linked glycosylated proteins, galectin-3 binding protein, lysosome associated membrane glycoprotein 1, and oxygen regulated protein, were identified in all three breast cancer cell lines. In addition, MCF-7 cells shared an additional 3 proteins with MDA-MB-453. Interestingly, the hydrazide method isolated a number of other N-linked glycoproteins also known to be involved in breast cancer, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), CD44, and the breast cancer 1, and early onset isoform 1 (BRCA1) biomarker. Analyzing the N-glycoproteins from membranes of breast cancer cell lines highlights the usefulness of the procedure for generating a practical set of potential biomarkers."

Although ERalpha is a successful target for treating breast cancer, there remains an unmet medical need especially for estrogen-independent breast cancer. Although estradiol is not an ERR ligand, ER and ERR share many commonalities and overlapping signaling pathways. An endogenous ERR ligand has not been identified; however, novel synthetic ERRalpha subtype-specific antagonists have started to emerge. In particular, we recently identified a novel compound, N-[(2Z)-3-(4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)-1,3-thiazolidin-2-yl idene]-5H dibenzo[a,d][7]annulen-5-amine (termed compound A) that acts specifically as an ERRalpha antagonist. Here, we show that compound A inhibited cell proliferation in ERalpha-positive (MCF-7 and T47D) and ERalpha-negative (BT-20 and MDA-MD-231) breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we report the differential expression of 83 genes involved in ERRalpha signaling in MCF-7 and BT-20 breast cancer cell lines. We show that compound A slowed tumor growth in MCF-7 and BT-20 mouse xenograft models, and displayed antagonistic effects on the uterus. Furthermore, a subset of genes involved in ERRalpha signaling in vitro were evaluated and confirmed in vivo by studying uterine gene expression profiles from xenograft mice. These results suggest for the first time that inhibition of ERRalpha signaling via a subtype-specific antagonist may be an effective therapeutic strategy for ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers."

This polymorphism is associated with changes in intracellular folate cofactors, which may affect DNA methylation and synthesis via altered one-carbon transfer reactions. We investigated the effect of this mutation on DNA methylation and uracil misincorporation and its interaction with exogenous folate in further modulating these biomarkers of one-carbon transfer reactions in an in vitro model of the MTHFR 677T mutation in HCT116 colon and MDA-MB-435 breast adenocarcinoma cells. In HCT116 cells, the MTHFR 677T mutation was associated with significantly increased genomic DNA methylation when folate supply was adequate or high; however, in the setting of folate insufficiency, this mutation was associated with significantly decreased genomic DNA methylation. In contrast, in MDA-MB-435 cells, the MTHFR 677T mutation was associated with significantly decreased genomic DNA methylation when folate supply was adequate or high and with no effect when folate supply was low. The MTHFR 677T mutation was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward decreased and increased uracil misincorporation in HCT116 and MDA-MB-435 cells, respectively. Our data demonstrate for the first time a functional consequence of changes in intracellular folate cofactors resulting from the MTHFR 677T mutation in cells derived from the target organs of interest, thus providing a plausible cellular mechanism that may partly explain the site-specific modification of colon and breast cancer risks associated with the MTHFR C677T mutation."

To understand mechanisms underlying docetaxel resistance in breast cancer, we used an insertional mutagenesis strategy to identify proteins whose overexpression confers resistance. A strong promoter was inserted approximately randomly into the genomes of tumor-derived breast cancer cells, using a novel lentiviral vector. We isolated a docetaxel-resistant clone in which the level of the kinesin KIFC3 was elevated. When KIFC3 or the additional kinesins KIFC1, KIF1A, or KIF5A were overexpressed in the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB 468, the cells became more resistant to docetaxel. The binding of kinesins to microtubules opposes the stabilizing effect of docetaxel that prevents cytokinesis and leads to apoptosis. Our finding that kinesins can mediate docetaxel resistance might lead to novel therapeutic approaches in which kinesin inhibitors are paired with taxanes."

To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant (MCF10A) and a breast cancer derived (MDA-MB231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues (NAF) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In MDA-MB231 highly represented genes downregulated by CAF derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between ER and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of MCF10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While NAF downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in MDA-MB231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in MCF10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. NAFs responded to coculture with MDA-MB231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by TGFbeta1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in NAFs gene expression profile influenced by MCF10A. CAFs responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation. Our data indicate that interactions between breast fibroblasts and basal epithelial cells resulted in alterations in the genomic profiles of both cell types which may help to clarify some aspects of this heterotypic signaling."

Despite this decrease, breast cancer continues to be the leading cause of death among women between 40 and 55 years of age and is the second overall cause of death among women. Hence, the aim of the present study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of deguelin, a rotenoid isolated from several plant species, which has been reported to have chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic effects in skin, mammary, colon, and lung cancers. The effect of deguelin on cell proliferation was evaluated using four human breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7, BT474, T47D, and MDA-MB-231) by cell count and MTT. Moreover, apoptosis was evaluated by acridine/ethidium staining and DNA laddering. Gene expression changes following deguelin treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells was assessed through microarray analysis. Deguelin at 1 mumol/L was found to inhibit the growth of the breast cancer cell lines tested with a range of 37% to 87%.

An arrest at the S phase of the cell cycle and apoptosis were shown in the MDA-MB-231 cells treated with deguelin. The microarray profile indicated differential expression of two independent pathways, including clusters of apoptosis and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling genes in cells as a result of deguelin treatment. These studies support the antiproliferative effects of deguelin in human breast cancer cells and, perhaps more importantly, illustrate novel actions by deguelin in the Wnt signaling pathway."

Since TGF-beta's prometastatic role may be linked to its ability to induce tumor cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we explored TGF-beta's EMT-promoting pathways by analysing the transcriptome changes occurring in BRI-JM01 mammary tumor epithelial cells undergoing a TGF-beta-induced EMT. We found the clusterin gene to be the most highly upregulated throughout most of the TGF-beta time course, and showed that this results in an increase of the secreted form of clusterin. By monitoring several hallmark features of EMT, we demonstrated that antibodies targeting secreted clusterin inhibit the TGF-beta-induced EMT of BRI-JM01 cells, as well as the invasive phenotype of several other breast and prostate tumor cell lines (4T1, NMuMG, MDA-MB231LM2 and PC3), without affecting the proliferation of these cells. These results indicate that secreted clusterin is a functionally important EMT mediator that lies downstream within TGF-beta's EMT-promoting transcriptional cascade, but not within its growth-inhibitory pathways. To further investigate the role played by secreted clusterin in tumor metastasis, we assessed the effect of several anti-clusterin monoclonal antibodies in vivo using a 4T1 syngeneic mouse breast cancer model and found that these antibodies significantly reduce lung metastasis. Taken together, our results reveal a role for secreted clusterin as an important extracellular promoter of EMT, and suggest that antibodies targeting clusterin may inhibit tumor metastasis without reducing the beneficial growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta."

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is believed to be both source and target of ROS. mtDNA unlike nuclear DNA is not compactly packed and hence more susceptible to oxidative stress (OS) than nuclear DNA. In the present study, the role of OS in mitochondrial genome changes was studied in men with idiopathic infertility. The study included 33 infertile oligo-asthenozoospermic (OA) men and 30 fertile controls. Semen analyses were performed and OS was measured by estimating the level of malondialdehye (MDA) in the seminal plasma and ROS in the sperm. Sperm mtDNA was sequenced by standard PCR-DNA sequencing protocol for ATPase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ND) groups of genes. Sperm count and progressive motility were found to be significantly lower in infertile group than the fertile controls. Semen MDA and ROS levels of infertile group were significantly higher (p&lt;0.0001), when compared to the control group. However, catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels were significantly lower in infertile group, compared to controls, but no significant difference in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was observed between control and cases. This might be due to higher expression of SOD alone in order to overcome OS in the semen. mtDNA analysis showed significant and high frequency of nucleotide changes in the ATPase (6 and 8), ND (2, 3, 4 and 5) genes of infertile cases compared to the controls. Hence excess ROS and low antioxidant levels in the semen might cause mtDNA mutations and vice versa in OA men that might impair the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa. Thus, it is important to understand the etiology of mitochondrial genome mutations in idiopathic OA cases for better diagnostic and prognostic value in infertility treatment/assisted reproductive technique."

Western blots and real-time PCR indicated that REST expression in breast cancer cells was inversely proportional to the cells' aggressiveness, for both cell lines and primary breast cancer cells. REST knockdown in low-metastatic T47D cells and nontumorigenic MCF12A cells resulted in increases in TAC1 induction, proliferation, and migration. These parameters were negatively affected by ectopic expression of REST in highly aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells. Together, these findings show a central role for REST in the oncogenic function of TAC1 and suggest a tumor-suppressor role for REST in breast cancer."

However, little is known about how Treg cell function is inhibited on viral infection to allow the development of a protective immune response. As viral RNA is a crucial mediator for activation of antiviral immunity, we examined the effects of immunostimulatory RNA and infection with RNA viruses on Treg cell function. We show that synthetic RNA oligonucleotides potently inhibit Treg cell-induced suppression in a sequence-dependent manner. This effect is entirely dependent on TLR7 activation of APCs and subsequent IL-6 production. In addition, stimulation with the RNA viruses encephalomyocarditis virus and Sendai virus that specifically activate the RNA-sensing helicases melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) also blocks Treg cell function. Interestingly, this effect is seen even in the absence of APCs. Consistent with this, both Treg and T effector cells express RIG-I and MDA-5. Using MDA-5-deficient mice, we demonstrate that the loss of Treg cell function on infection with encephalomyocarditis virus is strictly dependent on MDA-5 expression by Treg cells. Thus, we show in this study for the first time that activation of a RIG-I-like helicase on Treg cells blocks their suppressive function."

Preclinical and clinical studies suggest synergy between some chemotherapeutic agents and the humanized anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). This study investigated the effects of etoposide and cisplatin on the repair of DNA damage in breast cancer cell lines. We examined the potential significance of HER2 nuclear expression in DNA repair. MCF-7, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-453 cells were treated with cisplatin and etoposide. Repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL) and strand breaks, following incubation with cisplatin and etoposide, respectively, were quantitated by the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. Intrastrand crosslinks produced by cisplatin were assessed by ELISA. The effects of trastuzumab were measured in combination with these drugs. Similar experiments were done using HER2-negative MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with HER2 and a construct lacking the nuclear localization sequence. Incubation of breast cancer cell lines with trastuzumab delayed the repair of ICL produced by cisplatin. There were no effects on the repair of intrastrand crosslinks produced by cisplatin, or repair of DNA strand breaks following etoposide treatment. Transfection of HER2 into MDA-MB-468 cells inhibited the repair of cisplatin-induced ICL, whereas transfection of a HER2 construct lacking the nuclear localization sequence did not affect DNA repair. These results indicate that HER2 expression modulates the repair of specific DNA lesions produced by chemotherapy. The effect on ICL repair requires nuclear expression of HER2. Understanding the mechanisms of interaction between DNA-interacting agents and HER2 inhibitors will inform the design of clinical trials and optimize the therapeutic effects of these combinations."

PGI/AMF has been correlated significantly with breast cancer progression and poor prognosis in breast cancer. We show here that ectopic expression of PGI/AMF induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MCF10A normal human breast epithelial cells, and inhibition of PGI/AMF expression triggered mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in aggressive mesenchymal-type human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. EMT in MCF10A cells was shown by morphologic changes and loss of E-cadherin/beta-catenin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, which is concomitant with the induction of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressor Snail and proteosome-dependent degradation of beta-catenin protein. Molecular analysis showed that PGI/AMF suppressed epithelial marker expressions and enhanced mesenchymal marker expressions. Silencing of PGI/AMF expression by RNA interference in MDA-MB-231 cells induced the reverse processes of EMT including altered cell shape, gain of epithelial marker, and reduction of mesenchymal marker, e.g., MET. Taken together, the results show the involvement of PGI/AMF in both EMT and MET: overexpression of PGI/AMF induces EMT in normal breast epithelial cells and reduction of PGI/AMF expression led to MET in aggressive breast cancer cells. These results suggest for the first time that PGI/AMF is a key gene to both EMT in the initiating step of cancer metastasis and MET in the later stage of metastasis during breast cancer progression."

Attempts to induce endogenous ERalpha expression in ERalpha-negative breast carcinomas by forced overexpression of TFAP2C have not been successful. We hypothesize that epigenetic chromatin structure alters the activity of TFAP2C at the ERalpha promoter.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and chromatin accessibility were examined at the ERalpha promoter in a panel of breast carcinoma cell lines. TFAP2C and polymerase II binding were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Epigenetic chromatin structure was altered using drug treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AZA) and trichostatin A (TSA).RESULTS: The ERalpha promoter in the ERalpha-negative lines MDA-MB-231, MCF10A, and MCF7-5C show CpG island methylation, histone 3 lysine 9 deacetylation, and decreased chromatin accessibility compared with ERalpha-positive cell lines MCF7 and T47-D. Treatment with AZA/TSA increased chromatin accessibility at the ERalpha promoter and allowed TFAP2C to induce ERalpha expression in ERalpha-negative cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that binding of TFAP2C to the ERalpha promoter is blocked in ERalpha-negative cells but that treatment with AZA/TSA enabled TFAP2C and polymerase II binding.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the activity of TFAP2C at specific target genes depends upon epigenetic chromatin structure. Furthermore, the combination of increasing chromatin accessibility and inducing TFAP2C provides a more robust activation of the ERalpha gene in ERalpha-negative breast cancer cells."

Here, we investigated the mechanism(s) underlying the silencing of KLK6 gene in metastatic breast cancer and its putative implications for tumor progression. We present evidence that tumor-specific loss of KLK6 expression is due to hypermethylation of specific CpGs located in the KLK6 proximal promoter. Methylation-dependent binding of methyl CpG-binding protein 2 and the formation of repressive chromatin mediated by localized histone deacetylation are critical components of KLK6 silencing in breast tumors. Re-expression of KLK6 in nonexpressing MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells by stable cDNA transfection resulted in marked reversal of their malignant phenotype, manifested by lower proliferation rates and saturation density, marked inhibition of anchorage-independent growth, reduced cell motility, and their dramatically reduced ability to form tumors when implanted in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Interestingly, inhibition of tumor growth was observed at physiologic concentrations of KLK6, but not when KLK6 was highly overexpressed, as observed in a subset of breast tumors. Differential proteomic profiling revealed that KLK6 re-expression results in significant down-regulation of vimentin which represents an established marker of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of tumor cells and in concomitant up-regulation of calreticulin and epithelial markers cytokeratin 8 and 19, indicating that KLK6 may play a protective role against tumor progression that is likely mediated by inhibition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. We suggest that KLK6 is an epigenetically regulated tumor suppressor in human breast cancer and provide ways of pharmacologic modulation."

However, the in vivo antitumor effect of anti-OPN antibodies on breast cancer has not been reported. In this study, a mouse anti-human OPN antibody (1A12) was humanized by complementarity-determining region grafting method based on computer-assisted molecular modeling. A humanized version of 1A12, denoted as hu1A12, was shown to possess affinity comparable to that of its parental antibody. The ability of hu1A12 to inhibit cell migration, adhesion, invasion and colony formation was assessed in a highly metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435S. The results indicated that hu1A12 was effective in inhibiting the cell adhesion, migration, invasion and colony formation of MDA-MB-435S cells in vitro. hu1A12 also showed significant efficacy in suppressing primary tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis in a mouse lung metastasis model of human breast cancer. The specific epitope recognized by hu1A12 was identified to be (212)NAPSD(216), adjacent to the calcium binding domain of OPN. Our data strongly support that OPN is a potential target for the antibody-based therapies of breast cancer. The humanized anti-OPN antibody hu1A12 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of human breast cancer."

It has been reported that hypothyroidism might be a possible risk factor for liver and breast cancer in humans, but a lower incidence of breast carcinoma has been also reported in hypothyroid patientsPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this work we have analyzed the influence of hypothyroidism on tumor progression and metastasis development using xenografts of parental and TRbeta1-expressing human hepatocarcinoma (SK-hep1) and breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468). In agreement with our previous observations tumor invasiveness and metastasis formation was strongly repressed when TRbeta-expressing cells were injected into euthyroid nude mice. Whereas tumor growth was retarded when cells were inoculated into hypothyroid hosts, tumors had a more mesenchymal phenotype, were more invasive and metastatic growth was enhanced. Increased aggressiveness and tumor growth retardation was also observed with parental cells that do not express TRs.SIGNIFICANCE: These results show that changes in the stromal cells secondary to host hypothyroidism can modulate tumor progression and metastatic growth independently of the presence of TRs on the tumor cells. On the other hand, the finding that hypothyroidism can affect differentially tumor growth and invasiveness can contribute to the explanation of the confounding reports on the influence of thyroidal status in human cancer."

We have developed a multimodality imaging approach to monitor the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling pathway in bone metastases, sequentially over time in the same animal. As model systems, two MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells lines with different metastatic tropisms, SCP2 and SCP3, were transduced with constitutive and TGFbeta-inducible reporter genes and were tested in vitro and in living animals. The sites and expansion of metastases were visualized by bioluminescence imaging using a constitutive firefly luciferase reporter, while TGFbeta signaling in metastases was monitored by microPET imaging of HSV1-TK/GFP expression with [(18)F]FEAU and by a more sensitive and cost-effective bioluminescence reporter, based on nonsecreted Gaussia luciferase. Concurrent and sequential imaging of metastases in the same animals provided insight into the location and progression of metastases, and the timing and course of TGFbeta signaling. The anticipated and newly observed differences in the imaging of tumors from two related cell lines have demonstrated that TGFbeta signal transduction pathway activity can be noninvasively imaged with high sensitivity and reproducibility, thereby providing the opportunity for an assessment of novel treatments that target TGFbeta signaling."

New treatment strategies are therefore required. Loss of Wnt-5a has previously been correlated with loss of ERalpha in clinical breast cancer samples, and we sought to investigate this association further. Three breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and 4T1) lacking expression of ERalpha and Wnt-5a, and one breast cancer cell line (T47D) expressing both proteins were used in this study. Wnt-5a signaling was generated in ERalpha-negative cell lines via stimulation with either recombinant Wnt-5a protein or a Wnt-5a-derived hexapeptide (Foxy-5) possessing Wnt-5a signaling properties. ERalpha expression was restored at both mRNA and protein level, after treatment with recombinant Wnt-5a or Foxy-5. This restoration of expression occurred in parallel with a reduction in methylation of the ERalpha promoter. Up-regulated ERalpha could be activated, initiate transcription of progesterone receptor and pS2, and activate an estrogen response element reporter construct. Significantly, breast cancer cells re-expressing ERalpha responded to treatment with the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, as measured by induction of apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. Finally, Foxy-5 also increased ERalpha expression in an in vivo model of ERalpha-negative breast cancer. This represents the first evidence that Wnt-5a signaling acts to re-establish ERalpha expression in ERalpha-negative breast cancer cells. Our data suggest that combinatorial therapy with Foxy-5 and tamoxifen should be considered as a future treatment possibility for ERalpha-negative breast cancer patients."

Tensin expression is suppressed in cancer, especially metastatic cancer. The N-terminal domain of tensin1 associates with protein phosphatase-1alpha (PP1alpha) and mediates PP1alpha localization to adhesions. Here, we show F302A mutation in a KVXF motif of tensin1 abrogates binding to PP1alpha. The SH2 domain in tensin family member c-ten requires R474 to bind a RhoGAP called DLC-1 (deleted in liver cancer). We mutated the corresponding residue in tensin1, R1488A, and showed this reduces association with DLC-1. Unexpectedly, tensin1 F302A also had reduced association with DLC-1. Expression of tensin1 F302A or R1488A showed similar dominant phenotypes, with reduced cell polarization, lowered MLC20 phosphorylation and reduced levels of RhoA(GTP) compared with cells expressing tensin1 WT. However, migration and invasion of metastatic MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells were differentially affected by tensin1 mutated at F302A or R1488A. Cancer cells stably expressing F302A tensin1 showed increased migration and invasion compared with cells stably expressing either R1488A tensin1 or WT tensin1. This suggests that PP1alpha bound to tensin1 has additional effects in reducing migration and invasion that are not mediated through DLC-1. Our results show the importance of PP1alpha binding to tensin1 for the regulation of cell polarization, migration, and invasion."

Pitx3 has been implicated in the proper development of mDA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which are selectively lost in Parkinson's disease. However, the basic mechanisms underlying its role in mDA neuron development and/or survival are poorly understood. Toward this goal, we sought to identify downstream target genes of Pitx3 by comparing gene expression profiles in mDA neurons of wild-type and Pitx3-deficient aphakia mice. This global gene expression analysis revealed many potential target genes of Pitx3; in particular, the expression of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 and dopamine transporter, responsible for dopamine storage and reuptake, respectively, is greatly reduced in mDA neurons by Pitx3 ablation. In addition, gain-of-function analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation strongly indicate that Pitx3 may directly activate transcription of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 and dopamine transporter genes, critically contributing to neurotransmission and/or survival of mDA neurons. As the two genes have been known to be regulated by Nurr1, another key dopaminergic transcription factor, we propose that Pitx3 and Nurr1 may coordinately regulate mDA specification and survival, at least in part, through a merging and overlapping downstream pathway."

In contrast, the naturally occurring SV5 variant Wake Forest parainfluenza virus (WF-PIV) activates the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and beta interferon (IFN-beta). Comparison of SV5 and WF-PIV genome sequences revealed nine nucleotide differences within the viral genomic promoter, including two substitutions (U5C and A14G) in the most highly conserved 3'-end promoter element. To test the consequences of these promoter variations, a recombinant SV5 mutant [Le-(U5C, A14G)] was engineered to harbor the two WF-PIV genomic promoter substitutions in an otherwise wild-type (WT) SV5 background. Human lung epithelial cells infected with the Le-(U5C, A14G) mutant had higher rates of viral protein synthesis and levels of mRNA than cells infected with WT SV5, but levels of genomic RNA were not changed. Unlike WT SV5, the Le-(U5C, A14G) mutant was a potent inducer of interleukin-6 and IFN-beta synthesis, despite expressing a functional V protein antagonist. Cytokine responses to Le-(U5C, A14G) infection were reduced either by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) or after infection of cells that were engineered to express the reovirus sigma3 double-stranded RNA-binding protein. Le-(U5C, A14G) induced cytopathic effects not seen with WT SV5, and the extent of cell killing correlated with elevated levels of viral F protein and cell-cell fusion. Our results support a model whereby the SV5 promoter has evolved to function at an attenuated level in order to limit (i) synthesis of aberrant RNAs which induce RIG-I-mediated responses and (ii) overproduction of mRNA for potentially toxic gene products, such as the F protein. Control of genomic promoter activity may be particularly important for viruses such as SV5, that express a V protein targeting mda-5 but do not encode antagonists such as the paramyxovirus C proteins, that specifically target RIG-I."

Over-expression of AND-34/BCAR3/NSP2 (BCAR3), but not NSP1 or NSP3, induces anti-estrogen resistance in human breast cancer cell lines. BCAR3 over-expression in epithelial MCF-7 cells augments levels of a phosphorylated p130Cas species that migrates more slowly on SDS-PAGE while NSP1 and NSP3 induce modest or no phosphorylation, respectively. Conversely, reduction in BCAR3 expression in mesenchymal MDA-231 cells by inducible shRNA results in loss of such p130Cas phosphorylation. Replacement of NSP3's serine/proline-rich domain with that of AND-34/BCAR3 instills the ability to induce p130Cas phosphorylation. Phospho-amino acid analysis demonstrates that BCAR3 induces p130Cas serine phosphorylation. Mass spectrometry identified phosphorylation at p130Cas serines 139, 437 and 639. p130Cas serine phosphorylation accumulates for several hours after adhesion of MDA-231 cells to fibronectin and is dependent upon BCAR3 expression. BCAR3 knockdown alters p130Cas localization and converts MDA-231 growth to an epithelioid pattern characterized by striking cohesiveness and lack of cellular projections at colony borders. These studies demonstrate that BCAR3 regulates p130Cas serine phosphorylation that is adhesion-dependent, temporally distinct from previously well-characterized rapid Fak and Src kinase-mediated p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and that correlates with invasive phenotype."

Briefly, after a tandem digestion of genomic DNA with a methylation-sensitive mapping enzyme and a fragmenting enzyme, short sequence tags are obtained. These tags are amplified, followed by direct, massively parallel sequencing (Solexa 1G Genome Analyzer). This method allows high-throughput and low-cost genome-wide DNA methylation mapping. We applied this method to investigate global DNA methylation profiles for widely used breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, which are representatives for luminal-like and mesenchymal-like cancer types, respectively. By comparison, a highly similar overall DNA methylation pattern was revealed for the two cell lines. However a cohort of individual genomic loci with significantly different DNA methylation status between two cell lines was identified.

Using a SALL4-luciferase reporter gene assay, we found that modulation of the STAT3 activity significantly up-regulated the luciferase activity. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, the segment of the SALL4 promoter showing the highest affinity to STAT3 was localized to -366 to -163, in which there was only one putative STAT3 binding site starting at -199.

However, a major difficulty in understanding how IGFBP5 functions in this capacity is the paradoxical observation that ectopic overexpression of IGFBP5 in breast cancer cell lines results in suppressed cellular proliferation. In cancer tissues, IGFBP5 resides mainly in the cytoplasm; however, in transfected cells, IGFBP5 is mainly located in the nucleus. We hypothesized that subcellular localization of IGFBP5 affects its functions in host cells.METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we generated wild-type and mutant IGFBP5 expression constructs. The mutation occurs within the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the protein and is generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the wild-type IGFBP5 expression construct as a template. Next, we transfected each expression construct into MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells to establish stable clones overexpressing either wild-type or mutant IGFBP5.RESULTS: Functional analysis revealed that cells overexpressing wild-type IGFBP5 had significantly lower cell growth rate and motility than the vector-transfected cells, whereas cells overexpressing mutant IGFBP5 demonstrated a significantly higher ability to proliferate and migrate. To illustrate the subcellular localization of the proteins, we generated wild-type and mutant IGFBP5-pDsRed fluorescence fusion constructs. Fluorescence microscopy imaging revealed that mutation of the NLS in IGFBP5 switched the accumulation of IGFBP5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the protein.CONCLUSION: Together, these findings imply that the mutant form of IGFBP5 increases proliferation and motility of breast cancer cells and that mutation of the NLS in IGFBP5 results in localization of IGFBP5 in the cytoplasm, suggesting that subcellular localization of IGFBP5 affects its cell growth and migration functions in the breast cancer cells."

Inherent radiosensitivities were examined using a clonogenic survival assay. It was revealed that each cell line differed in their response to radiotherapy. These parental breast cancer cell lines were used to establish novel derivatives (MCF7RR, MDA-MB-231RR, and T47DRR) displaying significant resistance to ionizing radiation. Derivative cells were compared with parental cells to identify putative biomarkers associated with the radioresistant phenotype. To identify these biomarkers, complementary proteomic screening approaches were exploited encompassing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and quantitative proteomics using iTRAQ technology.RESULTS: A large number of potential biomarkers were identified, and several of these were confirmed using Western blot analysis. In particular, a decrease in the expression of the 26S proteasome was found in all radioresistant derivatives when compared with the respective parent cells. Decreased expression of this target was also found to be associated with radioresistant laryngeal tumors (P = .05) in a small pilot immunohistochemical study.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the 26S proteasome may provide a general predictive biomarker for radiotherapy outcome."

To restrict viral replication in breast tumor cells, we constructed mhTERTAd.sTbetaRFc, a 01/07-based adenoviral vector expressing the soluble form of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) receptor II fused with the human Fc IgG1 (sTGFbetaRIIFc) gene, in which viral replication is under the control of a modified human telomerase reverse transcriptase (mhTERT) promoter. In addition, mhTERTAd.sTbetaRFc-mediated sTGFbetaRIIFc production targets the TGFbeta pathway known to contribute to the tumor progression of breast cancer metastasis. We chose to use the mhTERT promoter because it was found to be relatively more active (approximately 20 times) in breast cancer cells compared with normal human cells. We showed that infection of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells for 48 h with mhTERTAd.sTbetaRFc produced high levels of sTGFbetaRIIFc (greater than 1 microg ml(-1)) in the medium. Breast cancer cells produced nearly a 6000-fold increase in viral titers during the 48 h infection period. However, mhTERTAd.sTbetaRFc replication was attenuated in normal cells. Infection of breast cancer cells with a replication-deficient virus Ad(E1(-)).sTbetaRFc also produced high levels of sTGFbetaRIIFc, but under these conditions, no detectable viral replication was observed. Adenoviral-mediated production of sTGFbetaRIIFc was shown to bind with TGFbeta-1, and to abolish the effects of TGFbeta-1 on downstream SMAD-3 phosphorylation. The administration of mhTERTAd.sTbetaRFc intravenously into MDA-MB-231 human xenograft-bearing mice resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth and production of sTGFbetaRIIFc in the blood. Conversely, intravenous injection of Ad(E1(-)).sTbetaRFc did not show a significant inhibition of tumor growth, but resulted in sTGFbetaRIIFc in the blood, suggesting that viral replication along with sTGFbetaRIIFc protein production is critical in inducing the inhibition of tumor growth. These results warrant future investigation of mhTERTAd.sTbetaRFc as an antitumor agent in vivo."

Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) has been reported to generate large quantity of products from small amount of templates. Here, we evaluated the fidelity of whole-genome amplification MDA from single or a few cells and determined the accuracy of chromosome copy number assessment on these MDA products using an Affymetrix 10K 2.0 SNP Mapping Array. An average coverage rate (86.2%) from single cells was obtained and the rates increased significantly when five or more cells were used as templates. Higher concordance for chromosome copy number from single cells could be achieved when the MDA amplified product was used as reference (93.1%) than when gDNA used as reference (82.8%). The present study indicates that satisfactory genome coverage can be obtained from single-cell MDA which may be used for studies where only a minute amount of genetic materials is available. Clinically, MDA coupled with SNP mapping array may provide a reliable and accurate method for chromosome copy number analysis and most likely for the detection of single-gene disorders as well."

Isothermal methods for faithfully copying DNA have the potential to revolutionize studies of such organisms. We evaluated the fidelity of multiple displacement amplification (MDA) for amplifying DNA extracted from a single miracidium of Schistosoma mansoni. To do this we genotyped DNA extracted from 28 F1 miracidia following MDA using 56 microsatellite markers. Because these miracidia were obtained from a cross between a male and female worm of known genotypes, we were able to predict the alleles present in the progeny and quantify the genotyping error rate. We found just 8/1568 genotypes deviated from Mendelian expectations. Furthermore, because 1 of these resulted from a genuine mutation, the error rate due to MDA is 7/1568 (0.45%). We conclude that many hundreds of microsatellites or other genetic markers can be accurately genotyped from a single miracidium using this method, greatly expanding the scope of population genetic, epidemiological and evolutionary studies on this parasite."

There is great clinical interest in uPAR in the cancer field as numerous reports have demonstrated that up-regulation of the uPA system is correlated with malignancy of various carcinomas. Using both stable cell lines overexpressing uPAR and transient gene transfer, here we provide evidence for a non-reported role of uPAR in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, a process that has recently been termed efferocytosis. When uPAR was expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, hamster melanoma cells, or breast cancer cells (BCCs), there was a robust enhancement in the efferocytosis of apoptotic cells. uPAR-expressing cells failed to stimulate engulfment of viable cells, suggesting that uPAR enhances recognition of one or more determinant on the surface of the apoptotic cell. uPAR-mediated engulfment was not inhibited by expression of mutant beta5 integrin, nor was alphavbeta5 integrin-mediated engulfment modulated by cleavage of uPAR by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Further, we found that the more aggressive BCCs had a higher phagocytic capacity that correlated with uPAR expression and cleavage of membrane-associated uPAR in MDA-MB231 BCCs significantly impaired phagocytic activity. Because efferocytosis is critical for the resolution of inflammation and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, overexpression of uPAR in tumor cells may promote a tolerogenic microenvironment that favors tumor progression."

The complete coding sequence of ALDH1A1 was cloned from human lens cDNA library by using PCR methods and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The cloned human lens ALDH1A1 cDNA encodes a 501-amino-acid protein (molecular mass = 54.8 kD) that is 100% identical to human liver ALDH1A1 and shares significant identity with the same isozyme from other tissues and species. The purified recombinant human lens ALDH1A1 exhibited optimal catalytic activity at pH 8 and preferred NAD(+) as cofactor and specifically catalyzed the oxidation of toxic lipid aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE; K(m) = 4.8 microM) and malonaldehyde (K(m) MDA = 3.5 microM). Citral, disulfiram, and cyanamide were found to inhibit human lens ALDH1A1 at IC50 values of 55, 101, and 22610 microM, respectively, whereas diethylstilbestrol (DES) was found to be an activator (EC(50), 1.3 microM). Further, modification of recombinant human lens ALDH1A1 with nitric oxide donors such as S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) significantly inhibited the enzyme activity. It therefore appears that activation of ALDH1A1, which efficiently catalyzes the detoxification of lipid-derived toxic aldehydes, and/or prevention of its oxidative modification may be novel therapeutic interventions against oxidative stress-induced lens pathologies."

AP-2gamma has been found to be overexpressed in most breast cancers, and have a dual role to inhibit tumor initiation and promote tumor progression afterwards during mammary tumorigensis.METHODS: To identify the gene targets that mediate its effects, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to isolate AP-2gamma binding sites on genomic DNA from human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453.RESULTS: 20 novel DNA fragments proximal to potential AP-2gamma targets were obtained. They are categorized into functional groups of carcinogenesis, metabolism and others. A combination of sequence analysis, reporter gene assays, quantitative real-time PCR, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays and immunoblot analysis further confirmed the four AP-2gamma target genes in carcinogenesis group: ErbB2, CDH2, HPSE and IGSF11. Our results were consistent with the previous reports that ErbB2 was the target gene of AP-2gamma. Decreased expression and overexpression of AP-2gamma in human breast cancer cells significantly altered the expression of these four genes, indicating that AP-2gamma directly regulates them.CONCLUSION: This suggested that AP-2gamma can coordinate the expression of a network of genes, involving in carcinogenesis, especially in breast cancer. They could serve as therapeutic targets against breast cancers in the future."

Marfan syndrome has a variable phenotype, even within families carrying the same FBN1 mutation. Differences in gene expression resulting from sequence differences in the promoter region of the FBN1 gene are likely to be involved in causing this phenotypic variability. In this report, we present an analysis of FBN1 transcription start site (TSS) use in mouse and human tissues. We found that transcription of FBN1 initiated primarily from a single CpG-rich promoter which was highly conserved in mammals. It contained potential binding sites for a number of factors implicated in mesenchyme differentiation and gene expression. The human osteosarcoma line MG63 had high levels of FBN1 mRNA and secreted fibrillin-1 protein to form extracellular matrix fibres. The human embryonic kidney line HEK293 and two breast cancer lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 had levels of FBN1 mRNA 1000 fold lower and produced negligible amounts of fibrillin-1 protein. Therefore MG63 appears to be the optimal cell line for examining tissue-specific, biologically relevant promoter activity for FBN1. In reporter assays, the conserved promoter region was more active in MG63 cells than in non-FBN1-expressing lines but additional elements outside the proximal promoter are probably required for optimal tissue-specific expression. Understanding the regulation of the FBN1 gene may lead to alternative therapeutic strategies for Marfan syndrome."

Moreover, the plant derived polyphenol has been reported to be able to overcome drug resistance to classical chemotherapy. These features render the drug a promising candidate for tumor therapy especially for cancers known for their high rates concerning therapy resistance like melanoma.RESULTS: We show here that the melanoma cell line M14 is resistant to Curcumin induced apoptosis, which correlates with the absence of any effect on NFkappaB signaling. We show that CXCL1 a chemokine that is down regulated in breast cancer cells by Curcumin in an NFkappaB dependent manner is expressed at variable levels in human melanomas. Yet in M14 cells, CXCL1 expression did not change upon Curcumin treatment. Following the hypothesis that Curcumin is rapidly removed from the resistant cells, we analyzed expression of known multi drug resistance genes and cellular transporters in M14 melanoma cells and in the Curcumin sensitive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1, a gene involved in the cellular lipid removal pathway is over-expressed in resistant M14 melanoma as compared to the sensitive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Gene silencing of ABCA1 by siRNA sensitizes M14 cells to the apoptotic effect of Curcumin most likely as a result of reduced basal levels of active NFkappaB. Moreover, ABCA1 silencing alone also induces apoptosis and reduces p65 expression.CONCLUSION: Resistance to Curcumin thus follows classical pathways and ABCA1 expression should be considered as response marker."

Sulforaphane (SFN) is one of naturally occurring cancer chemopreventive isothiocyanates found in cruciferous vegetables, consumption of which has been associated with reduced risk of cancer. In this study, we describe effect of SFN on various aspects determining invasive behavior of MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells. We studied modulation of molecules associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxic marker CA IX and mitochondrially located peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) using flow cytometry, gene expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP1, 3, 7, 9, 14, transcription factors POU5F1 and Twist1 mRNA by RT PCR, and cytokine production by multiplex bead assay. SFN downregulated PBR and vimentin expression in a dose dependent manner, but significantly affected neither HIF-1alpha, nor CA IX protein expression, nor VEGF and GLUT1 mRNA levels. Among studied MMPs, MMP7 and MMP14 mRNA were downregulated while no apparent effect on MMP1, MMP3 and MMP9 was observed. Further, we found significant down regulation of Twist1 and POU5F1, transcription factors that mediate EMT and the self-renewal of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells. SFN reduced also the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, immunomodulating cytokine IL-4 and growth factors involved in angiogenesis PDGF and VEGF. Our study shows that SFN efficacy is associated with the reversal of several biological characteristics connected with EMT or implicated in the matrix degradation and extracellular proteolysis, as well as with reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-angiogenic growth factors in MDA-MB-231 cells."

To be catalytically competent, the FAS must be activated by a posttranslational modification of the central acyl carrier domain (ACP) by an intrinsic phosphopantetheine transferase (PPT). However, recent X-ray structures of the fungal FAS revealed a barrel-shaped architecture, with PPT located at the outside of the barrel wall, spatially separated from the ACP caged in the inner volume. This separation indicated that the activation has to proceed before the assembly to the mature complex, in a conformation where the ACP and PPT domains can meet. To gain insight into the auto-activation reaction and also into the fungal FAS assembly pathway, we structurally and functionally characterized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae FAS type I PPT as part of the multienzyme protein and as an isolated domain."

This in turn allows radioiodine imaging and therapy for thyroid cancer. To extend the use of NIS-mediated radioiodine therapy to other types of cancer, we successfully transferred and expressed the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) gene in prostate, colon, and breast cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro by using non-replicating adenoviral vectors.METHODS: To improve virotherapy efficiency, we developed a conditionally replicating adenovirus (CRAd) in which the transcriptional cassette RSV promoter-human NIScDNA-bGH polyA was also inserted at the E3 region. The E1a gene is driven by the tumor-specific promoter MUC-1 in the CRAd Ad5AMUCH_RSV-NIS.RESULTS: In vitro infection of the MUC-1-positive breast cell line T47D resulted in virus replication, cytolysis, and release of infective viral particles. Conversely, the MUC-1-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was refractory to the viral cytopathic effect and did not support viral replication. The data indicate that Ad5AMUCH_RSV-NIS activity is stringently restricted to MUC-1-positive cancer cells. Radioiodine uptake was readily measurable in T47 cells infected with Ad5AMUCH_RSV-NIS 24 hours after infection, thus confirming NIS expression before viral-induced cell death.CONCLUSIONS: This construct may allow multimodal therapy, combining virotherapy with radioiodine therapy to be developed as a novel treatment for breast and other MUC1-overexpressing cancers."

There are three isoforms of HP1 in mammals: HP1alpha, beta, and gamma. Studies have shown that the level of HP1alpha is reduced in invasive human breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 and HS578T compared with non-invasive cell lines such as MCF7 and T47D. It is hypothesized that reduced HP1alpha expression may lead to impaired epigenetic silencing of genes that are important in the acquisition of an invasive phenotype. We set out to determine whether reduced expression of HP1alpha in invasive breast cancer cell lines occurs at the level of transcription.METHODS: We used transient transfection assays to investigate the mechanism of differential transcriptional activity of the human HP1alpha gene promoter in different cell lines. Mutational analysis of putative transcription factor binding sites in an HP1alpha gene reporter construct was performed to identify transcription factors responsible for the differential activity. SiRNA-mediated knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine the role of a specific transcription factor in regulating the HP1alpha gene.RESULTS: The transcription factor yin yang 1 (YY1) was found to play a role in differential transcriptional activity of the HP1alpha gene. Examination of the YY1 protein and mRNA levels revealed that both were reduced in the invasive cell line HS578T compared with MCF7 cells. YY1 knockdown in MCF7 cells resulted in a decreased level of HP1alpha mRNA, indicating that YY1 positively regulates HP1alpha expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments verified YY1 occupancy at the HP1alpha gene promoter in MCF7 cells but not HS578T cells. Overexpression of YY1 in HS578T cells decreased cell migration in a manner independent of HP1alpha overexpression.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that a reduction of YY1 expression in breast cancer cells could contribute to the acquisition of an invasive phenotype through increased cell migration as well as by reduced expression of HP1alpha."

Recent work has shown that Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and their receptors may be involved in the progression of breast cancer. The aim of the current study is to identify the role of BMPR-IB, one of these receptors, in breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of BMPR-IB was examined in a cohort of breast tissue samples. The transcript level was determined using quantitative real time-PCR and protein levels were assessed with immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Constructed ribozyme transgenes were used to knock-down BMPR-IB in MDA-MB-231 cells, and the effect this had on in vitro cell growth was examined.RESULTS: Decreased staining of BMPR-IB was seen in most of the breast tumour samples examined compared to normal breast tissues. Q-PCR analysis revealed lower expression levels of BMPR-IB transcript in patient samples with a predicted poor prognosis (Nottingham prognosis index (NPI) &gt;5.4) (8.2+/-17, p=0.03) compared to samples with a good prognosis (NPI &lt;3.4) (469+/-244). Higher BMPR-IB expression was seen in samples from disease free patients compared to those with poorer prognosis; including patients with metastasis, local recurrence and breast cancer deaths, (p=0.026). Furthermore, down-regulation of BMPR-IB in MDA-MB-231cells led to a promotion of in vitro cell growth.CONCLUSION: This study shows that decreased expression of BMPR-IB correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients and leads to increased cell proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro. This suggests that BMPR-IB mediates an inhibitory effect on breast cancer cells."

However, it has not been used to date because any amplification bias generated may complicate the interpretation of results. Our aim in this paper was to assess the applicability of MDA to forensic SNP genotyping by performing a comparative analysis of genomic and amplified DNA samples. A 26-SNPs TaqMan panel specifically designed for low copy number (LCN) and/or severely degraded genomic DNA was typed on 100 genomic as well as amplified DNA samples.RESULTS: Aliquots containing 1, 0.1 and 0.01 ng each of 100 DNA samples were typed for a 26-SNPs panel. Similar aliquots of the same DNA samples underwent multiple displacement amplification (MDA) before being typed for the same panel. Genomic DNA samples showed 0% PCR failure rate for all three dilutions, whilst the PCR failure rate of the amplified DNA samples was 0% for the 1 ng and 0.1 ng dilutions and 0.077% for the 0.01 ng dilution. The genotyping results of both the amplified and genomic DNA samples were also compared with reference genotypes of the same samples obtained by direct sequencing. The genomic DNA samples showed genotype concordance rates of 100% for all three dilutions while the concordance rates of the amplified DNA samples were 100% for the 1 ng and 0.1 ng dilutions and 99.923% for the 0.01 ng dilution. Moreover, ten artificially-degraded DNA samples, which gave no results when analyzed by current forensic methods, were also amplified by MDA and genotyped with 100% concordance.CONCLUSION: We investigated the suitability of MDA material for forensic SNP typing. Comparative analysis of amplified and genomic DNA samples showed that a large number of SNPs could be accurately typed starting from just 0.01 ng of template. We found that the MDA genotyping call and accuracy rates were only slightly lower than those for genomic DNA. Indeed, when 10 pg of input DNA was used in MDA, we obtained 99.923% concordance, indicating a genotyping error rate of 1/1299 (7.7 x 10(-4)). This is quite similar to the genotyping error rate of STRs used in current forensic analysis. Such efficiency and accuracy of SNP typing of amplified DNA suggest that MDA can also generate large amounts of genome-equivalent DNA from a minimal amount of input DNA. These results show for the first time that MDA material is suitable for SNP-based forensic protocols and in general when samples fail to give interpretable STR results."

We investigated the in vitro activity of BA-TPQ on the survival, proliferation, and apoptosis of breast cancer cells using the MTT and BrdUrd assays, and Annexin/Annexin-PI staining and flow cytometry. The in vivo anti-cancer effects of BA-TPQ were evaluated in xenograft models of breast cancer. Finally, the mechanisms of action of the compound were also assessed by cDNA microarrays, RT-PCR and Western blotting. In a dose-dependent manner, BA-TPQ inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in vitro, and showed in vivo efficacy in mice bearing MCF-7 or MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors. We demonstrated that BA-TPQ modifies the expression of numerous molecules involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Similar changes in protein expression were observed in vitro and in vivo, as determined by examination of cells and excised xenograft tumors. Our preclinical data indicate that BA-TPQ is a potential therapeutic agent for breast cancer that has multiple hormone-, Her2-, and p53-independent mechanisms of action, providing a basis for further development of the compound as a novel anticancer agent."

Thus, genomic and proteomic methodologies have been used in an effort to identify biomarkers that can differentiate tumor subtypes to improve therapeutic outcome. Here, we report a generally applicable strategy to generate tumor type-specific peptide ligand arrays. Peptides that specifically recognize breast tumor-derived cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and T47-D) were identified using cell-displayed peptide libraries carrying an intrinsic fluorescent marker allowing for sorting and characterization with quantitative flow cytometry. Tumor cell specificity was achieved by depleting libraries of ligands binding to normal mammary epithelial cells (HMEC and MCF-10A). Although integrin binding RGD motifs were favored by some cell lines, screening with RGD competitors yielded several novel consensus motifs exhibiting improved tumor specificity. The resultant peptide array contained multiple consensus motifs exhibiting strong similarity to breast tumor-associated proteins. Profiling a panel of breast cancer cell lines with the peptide array revealed receptor expression patterns distinctive for luminal or basal tumor subtypes. In addition, peptide displaying bacteria and peptide functionalized microparticles enabled fluorescent labeling of tumor cells and frozen tumor tissue sections. Our results indicate that cell surface profiling using highly specific breast tumor cell binding ligands may provide an efficient route for tumor subtype classification, biomarker identification, and for the development of targeted diagnostics and therapeutics."

Biodistribution data was collected at 1, 4, and 24 h postinjection of (111)In-DOTA-peptide, and compared with data obtained using a scrambled control peptide as well as with data obtained using wild-type ATF radiolabeled with I-125. Biodistribution studies showed rapid elimination of the (111)-labeled peptide from the blood pool, with 0.12 +/- 0.06% ID/g remaining in blood at 4 h pi. Elimination was seen primarily via the renal/urinary route, with 83.9 +/- 2.2% ID in the urine at the same time point. Tumor uptake at this time was 0.53 +/- 0.11% ID/g, resulting in tumor/blood and tumor/muscle ratios of 4.2 and 9.4, respectively. Uptake in tumor was significantly higher than that obtained using a scrambled control peptide that showed no specific binding to uPAR (p &lt; 0.05).

ERs modulate the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation, motility, and death. The regulation of transcription by E2-ERalpha through binding to estrogen-responsive elements (EREs) in DNA constitutes the ERE-dependent signaling pathway. E2-ERalpha also modulates gene expression by interacting with transregulators bound to cognate DNA-regulatory elements, and this regulation is referred to as the ERE-independent signaling pathway. The relative importance of the ERE-independent pathway in E2-ERalpha signaling is unclear. To address this issue, we engineered an ERE-binding defective ERalpha mutant (ERalpha(EBD)) by changing residues in an alpha-helix of the protein involved in DNA binding to render the receptor functional only through the ERE-independent signaling pathway. Using recombinant adenovirus-infected ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells derived from a breast adenocarcinoma, we found that E2-ERalpha(EBD) modulated the expression of a subset of ERalpha-responsive genes identified by microarrays and verified by quantitative PCR. However, E2-ERalpha(EBD) did not affect cell cycle progression, cellular growth, death, or motility in contrast to E2-ERalpha.ERalpha(EBD) in the presence of E2 was also ineffective in inducing phenotypic alterations in ER-negative U-2OS cells derived from an osteosarcoma. E2-ERalpha, on the other hand, effectively repressed growth in this cell line.

Previously, we demonstrated that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition by roscovitine induces a radiosensitization and a synergistic antitumoral effect in human carcinoma but its effect on the microenvironment and tumour angiogenesis remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of the combination roscovitine and ionizing radiation (IR) on normal cells in vitro and on tumour angiogenesis in MDA-MB 231 tumour xenografts. We observed that the combination roscovitine and IR induced a marked reduction of angiogenic hot spot and microvascular density in comparison with IR or roscovitine treatments alone. The Ang-2/Tie-2 ratio was increased in presence of reduced vascular endothelial growth factor level suggesting vessel destabilization. In vitro, no radiosensitization effect of roscovitine was found in endothelial, fibroblast, and keratinocyte cells. IR potentiated the antiproliferative effect of roscovitine without inducing apoptosis in endothelial cells. Roscovitine decreased IR-stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor secretion of MDA-MB 231 and endothelial cells. A reduction in the endothelial cells invasion and the capillary-like tube formation in Matrigel were observed following the combination roscovitine and IR. This combined treatment targets angiogenesis resulting in microvessel destabilization without inducing normal cell toxicity."

However, this also complicates the characterization of allergoids using techniques as for native allergen extracts.OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to analyse the molecular size of Betula alba depigmented allergoids, conservation of major allergens in the allergoids and in vivo antibody response to immunization.METHODS: The molecular size of depigmented allergoids was evaluated by high performance-size exclusion chromatography and light scattering techniques. Protein composition was compared with native extracts by capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry based peptide mapping. Rabbits were immunized with depigmented allergoid of Betula pollen adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide (Depigoid). IgG antibodies against individual allergens were determined by ELISA and immunoblot.RESULTS: Depigmented allergoids contained a range of high molecular weight particles, approximately 60% of which had a molecular weight of 1-3 MDa. Peptide sequencing confirmed the preservation of five isoforms of Bet v 1, as well as Bet v 2, Bet v 6 and Bet v 7. Sera from immunized rabbits showed high levels of specific IgG to rBet v 1.0101 and rBet v 2.CONCLUSIONS: The mean protein content was 544+/-106 microg per mg of freeze-dried material for depigmented allergoids and 434+/-71 for native extracts. They retain the capacity to induce specific IgG antibodies against individual allergens present in the native extract. These findings confirm the immunogenicity of depigmented allergoids and may explain why patients treated with these vaccines are protected against the native allergens. Analysis of molecular size and allergen content may be useful techniques for characterization and standardization of allergoid products."

Here, we have investigated the inhibitory effect of GSE on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the mechanism underlying this action. We found that GSE inhibited VEGF messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in U251 human glioma cells and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. GSE inhibited transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene through reducing protein but not mRNA expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1alpha. The inhibitory effect of GSE on HIF-1alpha expression was mainly through inhibiting HIF-1alpha protein synthesis rather than promoting protein degradation. Consistent with this result, GSE-suppressed phosphorylation of several important components involved in HIF-1alpha protein synthesis, such as Akt, S6 kinase and S6 protein. Furthermore, in the MDA-MB-231 tumor, we found that GSE treatment inhibited the expression of VEGF and HIF-1alpha and the phosphorylation of S6 kinase without altering the subcellular localization of HIF-1alpha, correlating with reduced vessel density and tumor size. Depletion of polyphenol with polyvinylpyrrolidone abolished the inhibitory activity of GSE, suggesting a water-soluble fraction of polyphenol in GSE is responsible for the inhibitory activity. Taken together, our results indicate that GSE inhibits VEGF expression by reducing HIF-1alpha protein synthesis through blocking Akt activation. This finding provides new insight into the mechanisms of anticancer activity of GSE and reveals a novel molecular mechanism underlying the antiangiogenic action of GSE."

MDA-MB-231 breast tumors were established in BALB/c mice by subcutaneous injection of 2 × 10(6) MDA-MB-231 cells. Mice were intratumorally injected with recombinant retrovirus and imaged with MR using Tf-USPIO. Western blot, Prussian blue, and immunohistochemical staining were performed to validate the magnetic resonance imaging results. The antitumor effect of retro-endostatin (ES)-TfR was also evaluated by intratumoral injection of the viral vector.RESULTS: The expression of both endostatin and TfR genes in MDA-MB-231 cells after retroviral transfection was confirmed by Western blot and flow cytometry. Tf-USPIO conjugate binds specifically to cells stably transfected with retro-ES-TfR. After intravenous injection of the Tf-USPIO conjugate, there was a more pronounced decrease in T2 relaxation time in tumors treated with retro-ES-TfR than in tumors treated with empty retrovirus retro-LNCX. The expression of ES gene significantly delayed the growth of MDA-MB-231 tumor and reduction of microvessel density and VEGF level as compared to those without viral transfection or transfected with empty retro-LNCX vector.CONCLUSIONS: Endostatin therapeutic gene expression was visualized successfully using TfR reporter gene and Tf-USPIO MR reporter probe, which indicates that MR reporter gene imaging may be valuable in gene therapy to evaluate therapeutic gene expression and treatment efficacy."

Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) retain the anabolic properties of androgens in bone and muscle while having reduced effects in other tissues. We describe two structurally similar 4-aza-steroidal androgen receptor (AR) ligands, Cl-4AS-1, a full agonist, and TFM-4AS-1, which is a SARM. TFM-4AS-1 is a potent AR ligand (IC(50), 38 nm) that partially activates an AR-dependent MMTV promoter (55% of maximal response) while antagonizing the N-terminal/C-terminal interaction within AR that is required for full receptor activation. Microarray analyses of MDA-MB-453 cells show that whereas Cl-4AS-1 behaves like 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), TFM-4AS-1 acts as a gene-selective agonist, inducing some genes as effectively as DHT and others to a lesser extent or not at all. This gene-selective agonism manifests as tissue-selectivity: in ovariectomized rats, Cl-4AS-1 mimics DHT while TFM-4AS-1 promotes the accrual of bone and muscle mass while having reduced effects on reproductive organs and sebaceous glands. Moreover, TFM-4AS-1 does not promote prostate growth and antagonizes DHT in seminal vesicles. To confirm that the biochemical properties of TFM-4AS-1 confer tissue selectivity, we identified a structurally unrelated compound, FTBU-1, with partial agonist activity coupled with antagonism of the N-terminal/C-terminal interaction and found that it also behaves as a SARM. TFM-4AS-1 and FTBU-1 represent two new classes of SARMs and will allow for comparative studies aimed at understanding the biophysical and physiological basis of tissue-selective effects of nuclear receptor ligands."

The experience in veterinary field has shown that there can be a rapid development of resistance to this drug, which therefore, needs to be monitored regularly in GPELF. Hence, we investigated the nucleotide polymorphism in the albendazole-binding domain of the isotype 1 beta-tubulin gene from several populations of Wuchereria bancrofti and developed an AS-PCR assay useful in screening for sensitive/resistance alleles among parasite populations and also evaluated its utility.METHODS: For studying the polymorphism of isotype 1 beta-tubulin gene, a 475 bp fragment spanning exon 5 and 6 of the gene was amplified and sequenced from the genomic DNA of W. bancrofti collected from six geographic regions of India. An allele specific (AS) PCR for screening albendazole sensitivity/resistance was developed and a total of 55 mf samples from blood smears on slides collected from Thiruvannamalai, Thanjavur and Puducherry were screened. Selective therapy with DEC was in place in three areas, mass drug administration (MDA) with DEC alone was implemented in four areas, while DEC plus albendazole was administered in one district.RESULTS: The analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the fragment from 20 W. bancrofti populations showed the domain to be highly conserved. An allele-specific PCR assay developed was used to detect sensitive/resistance alleles among 55 isolates of W. bancrofti and no albendazole resistance alleles were detected among the populations tested.INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: The drug-binding domain of isotype 1 beta-tubulin gene of W. bancrofti from different geographical locations was highly conserved. The AS-PCR developed showed potential application as a tool for monitoring albendazole sensitivity/resistance alleles among W. bancrofti populations, in areas where combination therapy of DEC-albendazole is being mass administered in the LF elimination programme."

These two targets were identified simultaneously, and their absolute quantities were estimated by a SERS strategy utilizing the inherent plasmon-phonon Raman mode of gold nanoparticle probes as a self-referencing standard to correct for the variability in surface enhancement.

For established methods like matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI), the mass analysis of oligonucleotides or of noncovalent oligonucleotide-protein complexes, in particular of very large ones, still represents a considerable challenge either due to the lack of native solutions or nonspecific adduct formation or due to a reduced salt tolerance or a high charge state of the ions. With LILBID, oligonucleotides, solvated in micro-droplets of aqueous buffer at certain pH and ion strength, are brought into the gas phase by laser ablation. We show that our method is able to detect single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides with high softness, demonstrated by the buffer dependence of the melting of a duplex. The absolute sensitivity is in the attomole range concomitant with a total analyte consumption in the femtomole region. The upper mass limit of oligonucleotides still detected with good signal-to-noise ratio with LILBID is the 1.66 MDa plasmid pUC19. With DNA ladders from short duplexes with sticky ends, we show that LILBID correctly reflects the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the ladders. Moreover, as an example for a specific DNA-protein complex we show that a NF-kappaB p50 homodimer binds sequence specifically to its match DNA. In summary we demonstrate that LILBID, although presently performed only with low mass resolution, due to these advantages, is an alternative mass spectrometric method for the analysis of oligonucleotides in general and of specific noncovalent nucleic acid-protein complexes in particular."

We investigated whether cyPGs facilitated GSH efflux and if members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family mediated the efflux. Four human cell lines were treated with 1-6 microM cyPGs for 48 h. Media and cells were harvested for GSH measurements using HPLC-EC. CyPG treatment increased extracellular GSH levels two- to threefold over controls in HN4 and C38 cells and five- to sixfold in SAEC and MDA 1586 cells and was dependent on increased GSH synthesis. Our studies show that prostaglandin D(2) and its metabolites, prostaglandin J(2) and 15dPGJ(2), specifically induce GSH efflux compared to other eicosanoids. These higher extracellular GSH levels were associated with protection from tert-butylhydroperoxide. Superarray analysis of ABC transporters suggested only ABCG2 expression had a positive relationship in the four cell types compared with extracellular GSH increases after cyPG treatment. The ABCG2 substrate Hoechst 33342 inhibited extracellular GSH increase after 15dPGJ(2) treatment. We report for the first time that ABCG2 may play a role in GSH efflux in response to cyPG treatment and may link inflammatory signaling with antioxidant adaptive responses."

Antagonists of these cadherins can therefore be envisaged as therapeutically useful drugs. We have used phage display technology to discover such antagonists. A peptide phage library was screened against a chimeric protein composed of the human E-cadherin ectodomain fused to the Fc fragment of human immunoglobulin G1 (E-cad/Fc). All of the phage clones that were isolated also bound a chimeric protein composed of the human N-cadherin ectodomain fused to the Fc fragment of human immunoglobulin G1 (N-cad/Fc). A peptide displayed by several of the isolated phage clones was synthesized (H-SWELYYPLRANL-NH2) and found to bind both E- and N-cad/Fc chimeric proteins with affinities (K(D)) of 9.4 microM and 323 nM, respectively, as judged by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. This peptide was also capable of blocking the aggregation of E- and N-cad/Fc chimeric protein-coated beads, as well as the aggregation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB435 human breast cancer cells (these cells express E- and N-cadherin, respectively). Finally, we showed that the peptide disrupted MCF-7 and MDA-MB435 cell monolayers. The peptide, H-SWELYYPLRANL-NH(2) thus proved to be a biologically active, dual E- and N-cadherin antagonist.

Aberrant FGF signalling is implicated in tumourigenesis, with several cancer studies reporting FGF-10 or FGFR2B upregulation or identifying activating mutations in Fgfr2. We used 5' RACE to identify a novel transcription start site for murine Fgf-10. Conventional in silico analysis predicted multiple binding sites for the transcription factor PEA3 upstream of this site. Binding was confirmed by chromatin immunopreciptation, and functional significance was studied by both RNAi knockdown and transient over-expression of PEA3. Knockdown of PEA3 message led to increased Fgf-10 expression, whereas overexpression of PEA3 resulted in decreased Fgf-10 expression. Thus, we have identified PEA3 as a negative regulator of Fgf-10 expression in a murine cell line and confirmed that activity also is seen in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). Furthermore, over-expression of PEA3 in these cells resulted in impaired cell migration, which was rescued by treatment with FGF-10. Thus, PEA3 can regulate the transcription of Fgf-10 and such modulation can control breast cancer cell behaviour."

The leptin promoter polymorphism Lep-2548G/A can be associated with increased leptin secretion by adipocytes and elevated cancer risk. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the link between Lep-2548G/A and breast cancer have never been addressed. Lep-2548G/A is proximal to a binding site for the transcriptional factor Sp1. Furthermore nucleolin, a transcriptional repressor, can bind Sp1 or its consensus site. Consequently, we focused on the impact of Lep-2548G/A on Sp1- and nucleolin-dependent leptin transcription in breast cancer cells. The Lep-2548G/A was identified in a homozygous conformation in BT-474 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells, in a heterozygous conformation in MDA-MB-231 cells, and a wild-type Lep-2548G/G sequence was present in MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells. The occurrence of Lep-2548A/A and Lep-2548G/A coincided with high and intermediate leptin mRNA expression, respectively, while cells containing Lep-2548G/G expressed low leptin mRNA levels. We demonstrated that the existence of Lep-2548G/A improved efficient recruitment of Sp1 to DNA under insulin treatment, while Sp1 loading on DNA containing Lep-2548G/G was not insulin-dependent. In contrast, nucleolin binding to Lep-2548G/A was downregulated in response to insulin, while it was not regulated on Lep-2548G/G. The presence of Lep-2548G/A was studied in breast cancer epithelial cells by IHC and LCM. Interestingly, all 14 tumors expressing high leptin levels contained Lep-2548A/A. In conclusion, the occurrence of Lep-2548G/A can enhance leptin expression in breast cancer cells via Sp1- and nucleolin-dependent mechanisms and possibly contribute to intratumoral leptin overexpression."

However, its role in breast cancer progression remains unknown. We had established a stable CK19-expressing clone in the CK19-negative BT549 human breast cancer cell line and found that CK19 expression in the BT549 cells caused cell cycle arrest, reduced cell motility and increased drug resistance. Further study revealed that CK19 expression regulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling by up-regulating p38/RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK)/p-eIF2alpha and 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (Bip/GRP78), and down-regulating focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The level of ER protein 29 (ERp29) was shown to be decreased in the CK19-expressing BT549 cells by proteomic analyses and verified by Western blotting and RT-PCR. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 signaling by its specific inhibitor SB203580 or knockdown of p38 and transcription factor XBP-1 by siRNA in BT549/CK19 and MDA-MB-231 cells revealed that p38/XBP-1 signaling negatively regulated ERp29 expression.

The clinical significance of maspin expression in breast cancer, especially in the sequence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-invasive cancer-lymph node metastasis is well known in the Western countries, but its status in the rapidly increasing breast cancers in India remains unknown. The present study was designed to determine the clinical significance of maspin expression in invasive ductal carcinomas of breast (IDCs) in North Indian population and modulation of its expression by curcumin. Immunohistochemical analysis of maspin showed loss or reduced cytoplasmic expression in 36 of 59 (61%) tumors. Furthermore, breast cancer cells (MCF-7 (wild type p53) and MDA-MB-231 (mutant p53)) were treated with curcumin and the effect on expression of maspin gene at transcription and translation levels was analyzed by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Maspin expression was also correlated with p53 and Bcl-2 levels. Curcumin inhibited cell growth, induced apoptosis and upregulated maspin gene expression in MCF-7 cells and these findings were further correlated with the upregulation of p53 protein and downregulation of Bcl-2, suggesting maspin mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. To our knowledge this is the first report showing the upregulation of maspin expression by curcumin in breast cancer cells and taken together with the clinical data suggests a potential therapeutic role for curcumin in inducing maspin mediated inhibition of invasion of breast carcinoma cells."

Here, we identify a novel human MKP-2 variant (MKP-2-S) lacking the MAP kinase binding site but retaining the phosphatase catalytic domain. Endogenous MKP-2-S transcripts and proteins were found in PC3 prostate and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and also human prostate biopsies. Cellular transfection of MKP-2-S gave rise to a nuclear protein of 33kDa which displayed phosphatase activity comparable to the formerly described long form of MKP-2 (MKP-2-L). Due to its lack of a kinase interacting motif (KIM), MKP-2-S did not bind to JNK or ERK; MKP-2-L bound ERK and to a lesser extent JNK. Protein turnover of adenoviral expressed MKP-2-S was accelerated relative to MKP-2-L, with a greater susceptibility to proteosomal-mediated degradation. MKP-2-S retained its ability to deactivate JNK in a similar manner as MKP-2-L and was an effective inhibitor of LPS-stimulated COX-2 induction. However, unlike MKP-2-L, MKP-2-S was unable to reverse serum-induced ERK activation or significantly inhibit endothelial cell proliferation. These findings reveal the occurrence of a novel splice variant of MKP-2 which is unable to bind ERK and may be significant in the dysregulation of MAP kinase activity in certain disease states, particularly in breast and prostate cancers."

However, the best characterized HDAC function concerns the control of gene expression via the regulation of transcription activation or repression. To understand the genome-wide effects of HDAC inhibition on gene regulation, we performed serial gene expression analyses from 0 to 48 h after treating MDA-MB-435, a melanoma-derived highly metastatic tumor cell line, with Apicidin, a HDAC inhibitor. Combined-transcriptomic analysis of large-scale molecular changes induced by Apicidin resulted in the identification of 631 outlier genes that were continuously up- or down-regulated during the 48 h study period. When the 631 outlier genes were mapped to known biological processes, cell-cycle suppression emerged as the function most elicited by Apicidin. In addition comprehensive negative cell-cycle regulation by Apicidin was dissected using gene expression data and validated by Western blot analysis. We suggest the 631 outlier genes as a characteristic molecular signature for Apicidin, and propose concurrent transcriptional suppression of major components of cell-cycle regulatory circuit as potent anti-tumor mechanism of Apicidin. Genetic elements identified during this study also provide the possibility of novel therapeutic interventions in tumor metastasis."

Metagenomics have been applied to various studies, with objectives ranging from genome reconstruction, gene prospecting and ecology. However, the use of metagenomics in comparative studies has been constrained by sequencing costs and computational limitations. Efforts are underway to improve current sequencing methods and reduce the expense involved. We suggest an alternative approach - pretreatment of the sample of interest to enrich for desired subsets prior to deep sequencing. In this study, we tested the use of suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) for in vitro separation of metagenomic samples based on temporal variance. Faecal samples were taken from pigs at different timepoints and extracted DNA was whole genome-amplified using multiple displacement amplification (MDA). A sample collected at 31 days of age was designated the tester while a 24 day sample was denoted the driver. Following hybridisation and subtraction, tester-specific sequences are expected to be enriched in the final sample while driver-specific and common sequences are removed. Using denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE), we found that driver-specific bands were completely removed from all final profiles while an average of 70% of common bands were successfully subtracted. Final profiles retained an average of 70% of tester-specific sequences and new sequences contributed an average of 36% of the band mobilities found in the final profiles. Tester-unique sequences were inferred to make up 78% of the final profile after SSH. We expect that using subtractive hybridisation for separation of metagenomic samples into desired subsets will provide a more effective and targeted approach to comparative studies."

The receptors for HER2/neu and MUC1 are overexpressed in various human cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancer. The relatively low expression of these antigens on normal tissues makes them attractive targets for tumor imaging. In addition, antitumor-antibody-derived peptides based on the Glu-Pro-Pro-Thr (EPPT) sequence were prepared for the detection of breast cancer. It has been shown that the EPPT peptide has high affinity for the MUC1-derived peptide. The peptides were prepared by solid-phase synthesis and radiolabeled efficiently with (99m)Tc via ligand exchange. They exhibited good stability in vitro in human plasma and against cysteine and histidine challenge. The peptides displayed high affinities (in nanomolar range) for MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and T47-D breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Additionally, they exhibited a rapid internalization into tumor cells. In vivo biodistribution in mice showed rapid and efficient blood clearance and excretion mainly through the renal-urinary route, with some elimination via the hepatobiliary pathway. However, the extent of urinary excretion was found to be variable for radiopeptides, with the highest being observed for antitumor-antibody-derived peptide. The peptides showed moderate tumor uptake (up to 2.2+/-0.98% ID/g) in nude mice carrying breast tumor xenografts. The uptake in the tumor was always higher than in the blood and muscle. A fast clearance from the blood and low accumulation (&lt;6% ID/g) by the major organs was obtained in nude mice resulting in favorable tumor/blood and tumor/muscle ratios as early as 1 h after injection. The combination of favorable in vitro and in vivo characteristics makes this new and interesting class of peptides potential candidates for the diagnosis of breast cancer in vivo."

To test this assumption, we have examined the effects of DAC in two human cancer cell lines of differing INK4a/ARF promoter methylation status: MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in which INK4a/ARF is unmethylated and normally expressed, and DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells in which INK4a/ARF is methylated and repressed. In MDA-MB-468 cells, DAC induces cytotoxicity in the absence of any detectable increase of p14 or p16 expression, whereas small interfering RNA knockdown of p16/p14 expression fails to attenuate DAC cytotoxicity. In DLD-1 cells, DAC demethylates INK4a/ARF and restores both p16 and p14 expression at concentrations that fail to cause detectable growth inhibition or apoptosis; moreover, neither ARF nor INK4a transgene expression inhibits DLD-1 cell growth despite normalization of p14 and p16 expression. These data imply that neither of these cell lines depends on up-regulated expression of INK4a/ARF for DAC cytotoxicity. We propose that optimal anticancer use of this drug will await unambiguous identification of those DAC target genes primarily responsible for triggering growth inhibition, followed by clarification as to whether these upstream events are caused by hypomethylation or DNA damage."

Although CNAs are thought to affect gene expression, there is no platform currently available for the integrated CNA-expression analysis. To achieve high-resolution copy number analysis integrated with expression profiles, we established human 30k oligoarray-based genome-wide copy number analysis system and explored the applicability of this system for integrated genome and transcriptome analysis using MDA-MB-231 cell line. We compared the CNAs detected by the oligoarray with those detected by the 3k BAC array for validation. The oligoarray identified the single copy difference more accurately and sensitively than the BAC array. Seventeen CNAs detected by both platforms in MDA-MB-231 such as gains of 5p15.33-13.1, 8q11.22-8q21.13, 17p11.2, and losses of 1p32.3, 8p23.3-8p11.21, and 9p21 were consistently identified in previous studies on breast cancer. There were 122 other small CNAs (mean size 1.79 mb) that were detected by oligoarray only, not by BAC-array. We performed genomic qPCR targeting 7 CNA regions, detected by oligoarray only, and one non-CNA region to validate the oligoarray CNA detection. All qPCR results were consistent with the oligoarray-CGH results. When we explored the possibility of combined interpretation of both DNA copy number and RNA expression profiles, mean DNA copy number and RNA expression levels showed a significant correlation. In conclusion, this 30k oligoarray-CGH system can be a reasonable choice for analyzing whole genome CNAs and RNA expression profiles at a lower cost."

In particular, chain migration of cross-border Myanmar workers at risk for nocturnally periodic Wuchereria bancrofti infection can lead to imported bancroftian filariasis (IBF) in Thailand. IBF is targeted for multiple-dose MDA with 300 mg DEC, in addition to what is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The dynamic Myanmar migrants in Phang-nga, southern Thailand were sampled to test whether the responsible W. bancrofti has a genetic predisposition of benzimidazole exposure, and IBF exhibits DEC susceptibility. The long-term migrants had more access to DEC. IBF in W. bancrofti antigenemic (microfilaremic vs. amicrofilaremic) short-term migrants exhibited susceptibility to a 300-mg single-dose DEC treatment. During the course of a 3-month follow-up, antigenemia was significantly reduced, but microfilaremia was fluctuated. Surprisingly, a newly recognized Mansonella infection co-existing among W. bancrofti-affected Myanmar migrants elicited microfilaremia clearance within a month after treatment. As a result of the presence of genetically stable W. bancrofti beta-tubulin (Wbtubb) gene responsible for benzimidazole susceptibility, IBF did not possess a genetic predisposition for benzimidazole exposure. Point mutations at positions Phe167Tyr and Phe200Tyr were not detected by Wbtubb locus-specific nested PCR and sequencing. This study has the potential to help guide not only the Thai/Myanmar PELF surveillance and monitoring of mass treatment impacts on W. bancrofti, but also the other endemic countries allied with the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF)."

KBH-A145 markedly inhibited histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in vitro and in vivo to an extent comparable to suberoyl-anilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). The proliferation of various types of cancers was significantly suppressed by KBH-A145, among which MDA-MB-231 and MCF, human breast cancer cells and ACHN human renal cancer cells, were most sensitive. This was accompanied by induction of p21(WAF1/Cip1) through compromised recruitment of HDAC1, which leads to hyperacetylation of its promoter region and thus arrested both cells in the G(2)/M phase. Interestingly, this compound induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells, but not ACHN cells, through cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Taken together, these results show that this novel gamma-lactam-based HDAC inhibitor potently inhibits the growth of human breast and renal cancer cells. Thus KBH-A145 is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of these types of cancer."

Emerging evidence indicates a mode of EGF signaling in which growth factor signals are transmitted via EGFR nuclear transport. The aim of this study was to determine whether EGF promotes EGFR nuclear accumulation and the role of clathrin-coated pits, EGFR kinase activity, caveolae microdomains and cytoskeleton integrity in breast cancer cells.METHODS: MCF-7 cells were treated without or with 100 ng/ml EGF for various times and nuclear extracts were obtained. Nuclear accumulation of EGFR was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting of nuclear extracts using an anti-EGFR Ab or with a phosphospecific Ab against the Tyr-1068 of EGFR and with anti-Rb Ab as the loading control. DNA binding activity of EGFR was analyzed by EMSA using nuclear extracts and a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe representing the AT-rich minimal sequence (ATRS).RESULTS: EGF induces the nuclear accumulation of EGFR, an increase in EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-1068 and the formation of the complex EGFR-DNA in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. In addition, EGFR nuclear accumulation is dependent of clathrin-coated pits, EGFR kinase activity, caveolae microdomains and cytoskeleton integrity.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that in breast cancer cells EGF promotes nuclear accumulation of EGFR and is dependent on clathrin-coated pits, EGFR kinase activity, caveolae microdomains and cytoskeleton integrity."

We have previously demonstrated that ECRG2 inhibits migration/invasion of lung cancer PG cells. However, the mechanism by which ECRG2 performs these activities is a compelling question. Urokinase-type plasmin activator (uPA) binding to uPAR induces migration/invasion through multiple interactors including integrins. In this study, we found that ECRG2 binds specifically to the kringle domain of uPA. Moreover, we demonstrated that ECRG2 forms a complex with uPA.uPAR, that such a complex modifies the dynamical association of uPAR with beta1 integrins, and that disruption inhibits Src/MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase pathway, resulting in suppression of cell migration/invasion in an in vitro Matrigel migration/invasion assay. Conversely, depletion of ECRG2 markedly enhanced the association of uPAR with beta1 integrins, elevated basal Src/MAP kinase activation, and stimulated HT1080, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cell migration/invasion. Together, our results provide evidence that ECRG2 is involved in the regulation of migration/invasion through uPA/uPAR/beta1 integrins/Src/MAP kinase pathway and may represent a novel therapeutic target for cancer."

The molecular mechanisms of how TGF-beta1 mediates these effects have yet to be completely determined. We have found that activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3) is strongly stimulated and its level is sustained by TGF-beta1 in highly invasive and metastatic human breast cancer (MDA-MB231) and in mouse mammary pad tumor cells (r3T). ATF-3 is also overexpressed in human primary breast cancer tissue. Overexpression of ATF-3 increased normal human mammary epithelial cell number and DNA synthesis suggesting a role for ATF-3 in cell proliferation. The functional role of ATF-3 in breast cancer progression was determined by the RNA interference technique. Knockdown of ATF-3 by ATF-3 shRNA in MDA-MB231 cells decreased expression of cell cycle gene, cyclin A1 in MDA-MB231 cells. ATF-3 shRNA also decreased expression of an invasive and metastatic gene, matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13; collagenase-3) in these cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments identified the direct physical interaction of ATF-3 protein on the human MMP-13 promoter. Thus, the dysregulation of ATF-3 by TGF-beta1 is likely to activate cyclin A1 and MMP-13 genes in breast cancer cells and that would be key to the subsequent cancer cell invasion and metastasis."

In breast cancer, KAI1 is preferentially lost in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors. Interestingly, most ER-negative primary breast cancers retain KAI1 expression. This study aimed to evaluate whether or not KAI1 is downregulated during progression to metastasis of these carcinomas. Expression of KAI1, ER, progesterone receptor, c-ErbB2, and Ki67 was analyzed in tissue microarrays comprising a large collection of distant organ metastases from human breast cancers (n = 92) by immunohistochemistry. Results were compared with a previously characterized set of primary breast tumors (n = 209). Immunoreactivity for KAI1 was observed in one-third of the metastases and was associated with lack of ER expression (P = 0.005). The high frequency of KAI1-positive cases in ER-negative primary tumors was maintained in ER-negative metastases. Expression of KAI1 was also observed in MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR-3, two ER-negative breast cancer cell lines of metastatic origin. Moreover, a reanalysis of independent microarray gene expression data indicated maintenance of KAI1 mRNA expression in metastases from ER-negative breast cancers. Furthermore, in a series of matched pairs of mammary carcinomas and metachronous distant metastases, all metastases from KAI1-positive/ER-negative primary tumors were KAI1-positive as well. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the expression of KAI1 is maintained during progression to metastasis in a large proportion of ER-negative mammary carcinomas. This has significant implications for the use of KAI1 as a clinical marker and the understanding of the metastatic process in human breast cancer."

Their role during mitosis has made them a target for anti-cancer drugs. However development of resistance has limited their use. It has been established that enhanced beta3-tubulin expression is correlated with reduced response to antimicrotubule agent-based chemotherapy or worse outcome in a variety of tumor settings. However little is known regarding the regulation of beta3-tubulin expression. We investigated the regulatory mechanisms of expression of beta3-tubulin in the MCF-7 cell line, a model of hormone-dependent breast cancer. Exposure of MCF-7 cells to estradiol was found to induce beta3-tubulin mRNA as well as beta3-tubulin protein expression. Conversely, we did not observe induction of beta3-tubulin mRNA by estradiol in MDA-MB-231 cells which are negative for the estrogen receptor (ER). In order to determine whether beta3-tubulin up-regulation is mediated through the ER pathway, MCF-7 cells were exposed to two ER modulators. Exposure to tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, completely abolished the beta3-tubulin mRNA induction due to estradiol in MCF-7 cells. This result was confirmed with fulvestrant, a pure antagonist of ER. These results demonstrate that the effect of estradiol on beta3-tubulin transcription is mediated through an ER dependent pathway."

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether these isoforms were differentially expressed and functional. Our data show that the TMSB15A and TMSB15B isoforms have distinct expression patterns in different tumor cell lines and tissues. TMSB15A was expressed at higher levels in HCT116, DU145, LNCaP, and LNCaP-LN3 cancer cells. In MCF-7, SKOV-3, HT1080, and PC-3MLN4 cells, TMSB15A and TMSB15B showed approximately equivalent levels of expression, while TMSB15B was the predominant isoform expressed in PC-3, MDA-MB-231, NCI-H322, and Caco-2 cancer cells. In normal human prostate and prostate cancer tissues, TMSB15A was the predominant isoform expressed. In contrast, normal colon and colon cancer tissue expressed predominantly TMSB15B. The two gene isoforms are also subject to different transcriptional regulation. Treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with transforming growth factor beta 1 repressed TMSB15A expression but had no effect on TMSB15B. siRNA specific to the TMSB15B isoform suppressed cell migration of prostate cancer cells to epidermal growth factor, suggesting a functional role for this second isoform. In summary, our data reveal different expression patterns and regulation of a new thymosin beta 15 gene paralog. This may have important consequences in both tumor and neuronal cell motility."

To evaluate whether the mode of action of SNAI1P is similar to those of the other predominant members of the SNAI family, we studied its action on human claudin 7 (CLDN7) gene promoter which has seven E2-boxes. We over-expressed FLAG-tagged SNAI1P in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. SNAI1P inhibited the expression of CLDN7 in these recombinant cells. SNAI1P also inhibited cloned CLDN7 gene promoter activity in human breast cancer cells. ChIP assays revealed that SNAI1P is recruited on the CLDN7 gene promoter along with the co-repressor CtBP1 and the effector HDAC1. Treatment of the cells with trichostatin A, an inhibitor of HDAC1, abrogated the repressor activity of SNAI1P. These data suggest that SNAI1P inhibits CLDN7 gene promoter epigenetically in breast cancer cells through chromatin remodeling."

The expression of WWOX protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 2 breast cancer cell lines.RESULTS: WWOX mRNA expression was reduced in breast cancer tissues as compared to adjacent tissues (p &lt; 0.001). WWOX mRNA and protein expression was significantly reduced in breast cancer tissues with methylated WWOX CpG islands when compared to tissues without methylation (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively). Immunohistochemical analysis also showed that WWOX levels were significantly decreased in tissues with WWOX methylation (p = 0.001). WWOX mRNA and protein expression was greatly reduced in MDA-MB-231 cells, partly due to the methylation of WWOX CpG islands, and recovered after hydralazine treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Differential regulation of the WWOX gene plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of breast cancer, due partially to methylation of the WWOX DNA CpG islands."

The scFv DNA fragment was then cloned into pCANTAB-5E, and a phage displaying the scFv was produced. Antigen-positive phage clones were successfully selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The scFv was modified with FLAG and His tags for detection and purification. The scFv reacted strongly with m(5)dCyd and weakly with 5-methylcytidine (m(5)Cyd) but not with cytidine (Cyd) and 1-methyladenosine in a manner similar to the monoclonal antibody (MoAb).

As a biochemical application of this scFv, we quantified the m(5)dCyd content of genomic DNA by enzymatic hydrolysis using inhibition ELISA. The cancer cell lines HeLa, HeLa S3 and MDA-MB-453 contained approximately 1% of the methylated DNA in total genomic DNA, as did peripheral blood cell genomic DNA from healthy volunteers, but HT29 and T-47D showed hypomethylation compared with the HeLa, HeLa S3 and MDA-MB-453 cell lines. The scFv generated here may be applicable to the assessment of cellular DNA methylation levels and is more sensitive than the MoAb."

The size and quality of both libraries were comparable to the standards of other reported phage display systems. Using the single-round panning method based on phage DNA recovery, we identified several beta-lactamase fusion peptides that specifically bind to live human breast cancer MDA-MB-361 cells. The beta-lactamase fusion to the peptides helped in conducting the enzyme activity-based clone normalization and cell-binding screening in a very time- and cost-efficient manner. The methods were suitable for 96-well readout as well as microscopic imaging. The success of the biopanning was indicated by the presence of approximately 40% cancer cell-specific clones among recovered phages. One of the binding clones appeared multiple times. The cancer cell-binding fusion peptides also shared several significant motifs. This opens a new way of preparing and selecting phage display libraries. The cancer cell-specific beta-lactamase-linked affinity reagents selected from these libraries can be used for any application that requires a reporter for tracking the ligand molecules.

The aim of this study was to develop a radioimmunoconjugate (RIC) to monitor trastuzumab-induced p27(kip1) protein up-regulation in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-p27(kip1) IgG was purified, and conjugated to diethylenetriaminopentaacetate, to allow radiolabeling with (111)In for in vivo detection. Then tat peptide (GRKKRRQRRRPPQGYG), containing a nuclear localization sequence (underlined), was conjugated to the Fc-domain of IgG, using NaIO(4) oxidation of carbohydrates and the resulting Schiff base stabilized with NaCNBH(3). The conjugate was radiolabeled with (111)In, yielding [(111)In]-anti-p27(kip1)-tat. (111)In labeling efficiency, purity and p27(kip1) binding were measured. Trastuzumab-induced p27(kip1) up-regulation was assessed in a panel of breast cancer cell lines by Western blot analysis. Uptake and retention of [(111)In]-anti-p27(kip1)-tat were measured in MDA-MB-361 and SKBr3 cells after exposure to trastuzumab. Uptake of [(111)In]-anti-p27(kip1)-tat was determined at 72 h postintravenous injection in MDA-MB-361 xenografts in athymic mice treated with trastuzumab or saline.RESULTS: [(111)In]-anti-p27(kip1)-tat was synthesized to 97% purity. The RIC was able to bind to p27(kip1) protein and internalized in the cells and was transported to the nuclei of MDA-MB-361 cells. The level of p27(kip1) protein in MDA-MB-361 cells was increased after exposure to clinically relevant doses of trastuzumab for 3 days. Trastuzumab-mediated induction of p27(kip1) was not associated with increased cellular uptake or nuclear localization of [(111)In]-anti-p27(kip1)-tat (6.53+/-0.61% vs. 6.98+/-1.36% internalized into trastuzumab-treated vs. control cells, respectively). However, retention of [(111)In]-anti-p27(kip1)-tat at 72 h was increased approximately twofold (13.5+/-1.3% vs. 6.6+/-0.6% of internalized [(111)In]-anti-p27(kip1)-tat was retained in trastuzumab-treated vs. control cells, respectively; P=.016). Immunohistochemistry showed up-regulation of p27(kip1) in trastuzumab-treated xenografts. Tumour uptake of [(111)In]-anti-p27(kip1)-tat was significantly higher in trastuzumab-treated compared to control animals (6.5+/-0.9 vs. 4.8+/-0.1 %ID/g at 72 h postinjection, respectively; P=.0065).CONCLUSION: [(111)In]-Anti-p27(kip1)-tat may be useful for monitoring changes in the expression of the intranuclear protein, p27(kip1). Up-regulation of p27(kip1) resulted in increased retention of [(111)In]-anti-p27(kip1)-tat in cells treated with trastuzumab. Modest, but statistically significantly higher, retention was also observed in tumours in mice treated with trastuzumab. Since responsiveness to trastuzumab correlated to up-regulation of p27(kip1), it may be possible to use [(111)In]-anti-p27(kip1)-tat to guide treatment with Herceptin and other drugs which alter p27(kip1) expression."

In order to determine if polymorphisms of the CYP19 gene are associated with breast cancer risk, we analyzed the frequency of tetranucleotide (TTTA) tandem repeats and a 3-bp insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism in intron 4 of the CYP19 gene in genomic DNA from 70 Korean breast cancer patients and 102 age-matched, healthy women. The 3-bp deletion allele was found more frequently in the breast cancer group than in the control group (p=0.001). Logistic regression analysis of the CYP 19 insertion/deletion (I/D) genotype showed a strong association between ID polymorphisms and breast cancer. The frequency of DD and ID alleles was significantly increased in the breast cancer group (DD genotype p=0.004, OR=12.81; and ID genotype p=0.005, OR=2.62). However, there were no differences in the genotype distributions of the (TTTA)n polymorphism of CYP19 between breast cancer patients and healthy controls. A positive association was noted between TTTA polymorphisms with 10 or more repeats and ER-negative tumors, as well as between lower repeat polymorphisms and ER-positive tumors (p=0.019). With respect to TTTA polymorphisms, we confirmed that the expression of aromatase in ER-positive MCF7 cells with 7-3 and 11 allele heterozygosity was significantly higher than in ER-negative MDA-MB231 cells with 11 allele homozygosity. These results suggest that 3-bp I/D polymorphisms of the CYP19 gene may be associated with breast cancer and that the (TTTA)n repeat genotype would be useful in selecting candidates for tamoxifen therapy, as well as predicting breast cancer risk in Korean women."

Activin interacts with its type I and type II receptors to induce phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules known as Smads. Previous studies showed that mouse ARIP2 can reduce activin signaling by interacting with activin type II receptors (ActRIIs); however, the activity of ARIP2 in breast cancer is still unclear. In this study, we used RT-PCR to obtain a human homologue of mouse ARIP2, human activin receptor-interacting protein 2 (hARIP2). Like murine ARIP2, hARIP2 has a PDZ domain in its NH2-terminal region and can interact specifically with ActRIIs. Overexpression of hARIP2 reduced activin-induced transcriptional activity and enhanced cell proliferation and colony formation in human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells. However, down-regulation of hARIP2 expression by RNAi enhanced activin-induced transcriptional activity and reduced cell proliferation and colony formation. Immunohistochemistry revealed that hARIP2 was expressed more frequently and much more intensely in malignant breast tissues such as simple carcinoma, invasive ductal carcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma than in benign hyperplasia or fibroadenoma cases. These results suggest that hARIP2 is a putative growth-promoting factor involved in breast tumorigenesis and tumor development."

Two novel germ line mutations (563T &gt; C and 643_660del18) were detected in two independent families. Neither of them, however, was present in the 768 normal controls. Functional assays revealed that the ability to trigger cell apoptosis and transcriptional activation of target gene under similar expression of p53 were lower in two mutants versus wild-type p53. Deleterious mutations of p53 seemed to be responsible for approximately 1% of non-BRCA1/BRCA2 hereditary breast cancer in Chinese population, and our findings suggested that p53 should be included in genetic testing of Chinese non-LFS/non-LFL high-risk breast cancer families."

Recent studies have indicated that a putative estrogen response element (ERE) is located in the promoter region of the BCRP gene. However, whether and how BCRP is regulated transcriptionally by toremifene (TOR) remains unknown. In the present study, two plasmid vectors have been designed to express the wild-type full-length BCRP cDNA enforced driven by its endogenous promoter containing a functional ERE and a constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter as control, respectively, which were transfected into estrogen-responsive MCF-7 and estrogen-independent MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines. We showed that toremifene alone significantly downregulated BCRP mRNA and protein levels in estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibitory effect was partially reversed by estrone (E(1)). Furthermore, gel shift assays demonstrated that specific binding of ERα to the ERE in the BCRP promoter is essential for transcriptional inhibition of BCRP by toremifene. Interestingly, toremifene alone increased the cellular accumulation of mitoxantrone in BCRP-transfected cells, suggesting that TOR indeed inhibits BCRP-mediated drug efflux and overcome drug resistance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing a direct effect of toremifene on BCRP. Our results thus indicate that toremifene by itself downregulates BCRP expression to reverse BCRP-mediated atypical multidrug resistance via a novel transcriptionally mechanism, which might be involved in TOR-ER complexes binding to the ERE of BCRP promoter to repress transcription of BCRP gene."

The methylation of P16 and E-CADHERIN gene promoters were measured by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The RNA transcription was determined by reverse transcription-PCR(RT-PCR).RESULTS: 1) The methylation-specific fragments of P16 gene promoter existed in T47D cells after 25, 50 and 75 micromol/L of CDP treatment for 6 days. An absolute demethylation on P16 gene occurred after treatment with 100 micromol/L of CDP. The unmethylation-specific fragments appeared in T47D cells after being treated with 25, 50, 75 and 100 micromol/L of CDP for 6 days. The RNA expression of P16 was detected after treatment with 75 and 100 micromol/L of CDP. 2) After being treated with 50 micromol/L of CDP, the methylation-specific fragments of CpG island in P16 gene promoter still existed in T47D cells. The unmethylation-specific fragments in T47D cells started to appear after 24 hours of treatment and lasted until 144 hour of treatment. The RNA expression was detected after 144 hours of treatment. 3) The demethylation on E-CADHERIN gene and genomic DNA or RNA transcription were not detected in MDA-MB-435 cells.CONCLUSION: CDP has concentration- and time-dependent demethylation effect on P16 gene in T47D cells, but not on E-CADHERIN gene in MDA-MB-435 cells, which indicates that CDP has substantial diversity in molecular activities."

Estrogen receptors (ERs), as transcription factors, mediate the effects of E2. Ablation of the circulating E2 and/or prevention of ER functions constitute approaches for ER-positive breast cancer treatments. These modalities are, however, ineffective in de novo endocrine-resistant breast neoplasms that do not express ERs. The interaction of E2-ERs with specific DNA sequences, estrogen responsive elements (EREs), of genes constitutes one genomic pathway necessary for cellular alterations. We herein tested the prediction that specific regulation of ERE-driven genes by an engineered monomeric and constitutively active transcription factor, monotransregulator, provides a basis for the treatment of ER-negative breast cancer. Using adenovirus infected ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells derived from a breast adenocarcinoma, we found that the monotransregulator, but not the ERE-binding defective counterpart, repressed cellular proliferation and motility, and induced apoptosis through expression of genes that required ERE interactions. Similarly, the monotransregulator suppressed the growth of ER-negative BT-549 cells derived from a breast-ductal carcinoma. Moreover, the ERE-binding monotransregulator repressed xenograft tumor growth in a nude mice model. Thus, specific regulation of genes bearing EREs could offer a therapeutic approach for de novo endocrine-resistant breast cancers."

Without complete optimization, quasi-IPN/GNP-PDMA yielded a readlength of 801 bases at 98% accuracy in about 64 min by using the ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer at 50 degrees C and 150 V/cm. Compared with previous quasi-IPN/GNPs, quasi-IPN/GNP-PDMA can further improve DNA sequencing performances. This is because the presence of GNP-PDMA can improve the compatibility of GNPs with the whole sequencing system, enhance the entanglement degree of networks, and increase the GNP concentration in system, which consequently lead to higher restriction and stability, higher apparent molecular weight (MW), and smaller pore size of the total sieving networks. Furthermore, the composite matrix was also compared with quasi-IPN containing higher-MW LPA and commercial POP-6. The results indicate that the composite matrix is a promising one for DNA sequencing to achieve full automation due to the separation provided with high resolution, speediness, excellent reproducibility, and easy loading in the presence of GNP-PDMA."

The injection problem could be resolved by introducing PPO side chains that can be assembled by using temperature changes but without an obvious detrimental effect on the sieving ability of the LPA. Viscosity measurement showed that these LPA-g-PPO copolymers had a transition temperature of approximately 40 degrees C, above which a significant increase in viscosity was observed.

Therefore, the antagonist of Grb2-SH2 has become a potential target for developing anticancer agents. Recently, we discovered a peptide 1 (Fmoc-Glu-Tyr-Aib-Asn-NH(2)) with high affinity for the Grb2-SH2 domain by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-biosensor technology. Herein, we report the further design of the lead peptide 1 by addition of an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence to 1 to enhance binding to Grb2-SH2 and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Both the linear and cyclic analogs of the newly designed compound were prepared along with an analog in which the N(alpha)-Fmoc group was removed. These peptide analogs were assayed for their affinity for the Grb2-SH2, their antiproliferative effect on human breast cancer cells, their specificity for cancer cells, and their effects on cytotoxicity and the cell cycle. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of each peptide. The cell viability and cytotoxicity of peptide-treated cells were determined by using the cell proliferation kit (3-[4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide, MTT) and cytotoxicity kit (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), respectively.

Rama 37-OPN was produced by stably transfecting Rama 37 with an OPN expression vector and it demonstrates increased malignant properties in vitro. Sequence and expression array analysis of the respective cDNA libraries of over 1600 subtracted cDNA fragments revealed 982 ESTs, 45 novel sequences and 659 known genes. The known up-regulated genes in the Rama 37-OPN library code for proteins with a variety of functions including those involved in metabolism, cell adhesion and migration, signal transduction and in apoptosis. Four of the most differentially expressed genes between the benign and in vitro malignant rat mammary cell lines are tumor protein translationally controlled I (TPTI), aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and RAN GTPase (RAN). The largest difference (ca 10,000 fold) between the less aggressively (MCF-7, ZR-75) and more aggressively malignant (MDA MB 231, MDA MB 435S) human breast cancer cell lines is that due to RAN, the next is that due to osteopontin itself.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that enhanced properties associated with the malignant state in vitro induced by osteopontin may be due to, in part, overexpression of RAN GTPase and these biological results are the subject of a subsequent publication 1."

Studied by DNA-microarray after treatment with L-PPMP.";"Functions of glycosphingolipids on the eukaryotic cell membranes during the onset of oncogenic processes and cell death are not well understood. Inhibitors of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis were recently found to trigger apoptosis in many carcinoma including breast cancer SKBR-3, MCF-7, and MDA-468 cells through either intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic pathways as we previously reported. These anti-cancer inhibitors could increase ceramide concentration by blocking functions of glycolipid glycosyltransferases (GLTs). In this study, using a novel fluorescent dye (ASK-0) revealed the damage of cell organelle membranes by an inhibitor of glucosylceramide biosynthesis (L-PPMP). A highly drug- and cell-dependent regulation of MAPKs was also found by cis-platin and L-PPMP when inducing apoptosis in SKBR-3, MCF-7, and MDA-468 cells. A dose and time-dependent regulation of GLTs were investigated by enzymatic assay and DNA microarray analyses. These GLTs are involved in biosynthesis of Le(X) and sialosyl-Le(X) (neolactosyl-ceramide series) such as GalT-4 (UDP-Gal: LcOse3cer beta-galactosyltransferase, GalT-5 (UDP-Gal: nLcOse4Cer alpha1, 3galactosyltransferase, FucT-3 (GDP-Fucose: LM1 alpha1, 4fucosyltransferase). A similar effect was observed with the GLTs involved in the biosyntheses of Gg-series gangliosides, such as SAT-4 (CMP-NeuAc: GgOse4Cer alpha2, 3sialyltransferase, and SAT-2 (CMP-NeuAc: GM3 alpha2, 8sialyltransferase). The glycol-related gene DNA-microarrays also suggested the transcriptional regulation of several GLTs involved in the biosynthesis of neolactosylceramide containing cell-surface antigens in these apoptotic breast carcinoma cells. In the early apoptotic stages (2 to 6 h after L-PPMP treatment) in addition to GlcT-1 gene, several genes (betaGalTs and betaGlcNAcTs) in the SA-Le(a) pathway were stimulated."

Here we demonstrate that the 2 MDa GCN5 HAT-containing metazoan TFTC/STAGA complexes contain a histone H2A and H2B deubiquitinase activity. We have identified three additional subunits of TFTC/STAGA (ATXN7L3, USP22, and ENY2) that form the deubiquitination module. Importantly, we found that this module is an enhancer of position effect variegation in Drosophila. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ATXN7L3, USP22, and ENY2 are required as cofactors for the full transcriptional activity by nuclear receptors. Thus, the deubiquitinase activity of the TFTC/STAGA HAT complex is necessary to counteract heterochromatin silencing and acts as a positive cofactor for activation by nuclear receptors in vivo."

The challenge for crystallographers, however, remains the growing of a diffracting crystal. Here we report the 4.5-A resolution structure of a 22-MDa macromolecular assembly, the capsid of the infectious epsilon15 (epsilon15) particle, by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. From this density map we constructed a complete backbone trace of its major capsid protein, gene product 7 (gp7). The structure reveals a similar protein architecture to that of other tailed double-stranded DNA viruses, even in the absence of detectable sequence similarity. However, the connectivity of the secondary structure elements (topology) in gp7 is unique. Protruding densities are observed around the two-fold axes that cannot be accounted for by gp7. A subsequent proteomic analysis of the whole virus identifies these densities as gp10, a 12-kDa protein. Its structure, location and high binding affinity to the capsid indicate that the gp10 dimer functions as a molecular staple between neighbouring capsomeres to ensure the particle's stability. Beyond epsilon15, this method potentially offers a new approach for modelling the backbone conformations of the protein subunits in other macromolecular assemblies at near-native solution states."

Identifying mechanisms regulating the switch from dormancy to proliferative metastatic growth has been elusive due to the lack of experimental models of tumor cell dormancy. We characterized the in vitro growth characteristics of cells that exhibit either dormant (D2.0R, MCF-7, and K7M2AS1.46) or proliferative (D2A1, MDA-MB-231, and K7M2) metastatic behavior in vivo. Although these cells proliferate readily in two-dimensional culture, we show that when grown in three-dimensional matrix, distinct growth properties of the cells were revealed that correlate to their dormant or proliferative behavior at metastatic sites in vivo. In three-dimensional culture, cells with dormant behavior in vivo remained cell cycle arrested with elevated nuclear expression of p16 and p27. The transition from quiescence to proliferation of D2A1 cells was dependent on fibronectin production and signaling through integrin beta1, leading to cytoskeletal reorganization with filamentous actin (F-actin) stress fiber formation. We show that phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) by MLC kinase (MLCK) through integrin beta1 is required for actin stress fiber formation and proliferative growth. Inhibition of integrin beta1 or MLCK prevents transition from a quiescent to proliferative state in vitro. Inhibition of MLCK significantly reduces metastatic outgrowth in vivo. These studies show that the switch from dormancy to metastatic growth may be regulated, in part, through epigenetic signaling from the microenvironment, leading to changes in the cytoskeletal architecture of dormant cells. Targeting this process may provide therapeutic strategies for inhibition of the dormant-to-proliferative metastatic switch."

We previously showed that the I4 lines had dramatically elevated levels of Twist compared with their parental lines. In this study, we observed significantly increased STAT3 Tyr(705) phosphorylation, but not the STAT3 protein levels, in the I4 lines. Activation of STAT3 by interleukin-6 or expression of activated Src induced Twist expression at protein and mRNA levels. Inhibiting STAT3 by a small molecule inhibitor, JSI-124, STAT3 small hairpin RNAs, or dominant negative STAT3 resulted in significant reduction of Twist protein and mRNA expression. STAT3 directly bound to the second proximal STAT3-binding site on the human Twist promoter and activated its transcriptional activity. Inhibition of STAT3 reduced migration, invasion, and colony formation of the I4 cells. Ectopic expression of Twist significantly rescued those phenotypes. Ten normal and 46 tumor specimens of breast tissues were examined for activation of STAT3 and expression of Twist. There was a strong correlation between Tyr(705) p-STAT3 and Twist level in the late stage tumor tissues. Our results indicate that activated STAT3 transcriptionally induces Twist, which plays an important role in promoting migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. Together with our previous observation that Twist transcriptionally induces AKT2 to mediate Twist-promoted oncogenic functions, we conclude that STAT3, Twist, and AKT2 form a functional signaling axis to regulate pivotal oncogenic properties of cancer cells."

Here, we show that galectin-3 binding to Mgat5-modified N-glycans functions together with pY14Cav1 to stabilize focal adhesion kinase (FAK) within FAs, and thereby promotes FA disassembly and turnover. Expression of the Mgat5/galectin lattice alone induces FAs and cell spreading. However, FAK stabilization in FAs also requires expression of pY14Cav1. In cells lacking the Mgat5/galectin lattice, pY14Cav1 is not sufficient to promote FAK stabilization, FA disassembly, and turnover. In human MDA-435 cancer cells, Cav1 expression, but not mutant Y14FCav1, stabilizes FAK exchange and stimulates de novo FA formation in protrusive cellular regions. Thus, transmembrane crosstalk between the galectin lattice and pY14Cav1 promotes FA turnover by stabilizing FAK within FAs defining previously unknown, interdependent roles for galectin-3 and pY14Cav1 in tumor cell migration."

An immediate consequence of single-cell sequencing is that it provides an alternative to culturing organisms as a prerequisite for genomic sequencing. The microgram amounts of DNA required as template are amplified from a single bacterium by a method called multiple displacement amplification (MDA) avoiding the need to grow cells. The ability to sequence DNA from individual cells will likely have an immense impact on microbiology considering the vast numbers of novel organisms, which have been inaccessible unless culture-independent methods could be used. However, special approaches have been necessary to work with amplified DNA. MDA may not recover the entire genome from the single copy present in most bacteria. Also, some sequence rearrangements can occur during the DNA amplification reaction. Over the past two years many research groups have begun to use MDA, and some practical approaches to single-cell sequencing have been developed. We review the consensus that is emerging on optimum methods, reliability of amplified template, and the proper interpretation of 'composite' genomes which result from the necessity of combining data from several single-cell MDA reactions in order to complete the assembly. Preferred laboratory methods are considered on the basis of experience at several large sequencing centers where &gt;70% of genomes are now often recovered from single cells.

To identify genes regulated by the alpha6beta4 integrin, we compared gene expression profiles of MDA-MB-435 cells that stably express integrin alpha6beta4 (MDA/beta4) and vector-only-transfected cells (MDA/mock) using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis. Our results show that integrin alpha6beta4 altered the expression of 538 genes (p &lt; 0.01). Of these genes, 36 are associated with pathways implicated in cell motility and metastasis, including S100A4/metastasin. S100A4 expression correlated well with integrin alpha6beta4 expression in established cell lines. Suppression of S100A4 by small interference RNA resulted in a reduced capacity of alpha6beta4-expressing cells to invade a reconstituted basement membrane in response to lysophosphatidic acid. Using small interference RNA, promoter analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that S100A4 is regulated by NFAT5, thus identifying the first target of NFAT5 in cancer. In addition, several genes that are known to be regulated by DNA methylation were up-regulated dramatically by integrin alpha6beta4 expression, including S100A4, FST, PDLIM4, CAPG, and Nkx2.2. Notably, inhibition of DNA methyltransferases stimulated expression of these genes in cells lacking the alpha6beta4 integrin, whereas demethylase inhibitors suppressed expression in alpha6beta4 integrin-expressing cells. Alterations in DNA methylation were confirmed by bisulfate sequencing, thus suggesting that integrin alpha6beta4 signaling can lead to the demethylation of select promoters. In summary, our data suggest that integrin alpha6beta4 confers a motile and invasive phenotype to breast carcinoma cells by regulating proinvasive and prometastatic gene expression."

We adopted multiple-displacement amplification (MDA), an isothermal whole-genome amplification method with phi29 polymerase and random hexamers, to amplify viral DNA and construct clone libraries for metagenome sequencing. By the MDA method, the diversity of both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses and double-stranded DNA viruses could be investigated at the same time. On the contrary, by eliminating the denaturing step in the MDA reaction, only ssDNA viral diversity could be explored selectively. Irrespective of the denaturing step, more than 60% of the soil metagenome sequences did not show significant hits (E-value criterion, 0.001) with previously reported viral sequences. Those hits that were considered to be significant were also distantly related to known ssDNA viruses (average amino acid similarity, approximately 34%). Phylogenetic analysis showed that replication-related proteins (which were the most frequently detected proteins) related to those of ssDNA viruses obtained from the metagenomic sequences were diverse and novel. Putative circular genome components of ssDNA viruses that are unrelated to known viruses were assembled from the metagenomic sequences. In conclusion, ssDNA viral diversity in soil is more complex than previously thought. Soil is therefore a rich pool of previously unknown ssDNA viruses."

This region consists of a polypurine (guanine) tract that contains four runs of at least three contiguous guanines separated by one or more bases, thus conforming to a general motif capable of forming an intramolecular G-quadruplex. Here, we show that the G-rich strand in this region is able to form an intramolecular propeller-type parallel-stranded G-quadruplex structure in vitro by using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, dimethyl sulfate footprinting technique, the DNA polymerase stop assay, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and computer-aided molecular modeling. Two well-known G-quadruplex-interactive agents, TMPyP4 and Se2SAP, stabilize G-quadruplex structures formed by this sequence in the presence of a potassium ion, although Se2SAP is at least 10-fold more effective in binding to the G-quadruplex than TMPyP4. Between these two agents, Se2SAP better suppresses VEGF transcription in different cancer cell lines, including HEC1A and MDA-MB-231. Collectively, our results provide evidence that specific G-quadruplex structures can be formed in the VEGF promoter region, and that the transcription of this gene can be controlled by ligand-mediated G-quadruplex stabilization. Our results also provide further support for the idea that G-quadruplex structures may play structural roles in vivo and therefore might provide insight into novel methodologies for rational drug design."

We studied genetic signatures of basal breast cancer potentially suitable for therapeutic intervention.METHODS: We analyzed protein expression of the Notch-1 intracellular domain and survivin by immunohistochemistry in a series of basal breast cancer patients. A hierarchical clustering and overall survival analysis was carried out on a microarray mRNA database of 232 breast cancer patients. Fifteen published mRNA datasets containing estrogen receptor-negative or estrogen receptor-positive samples were subjected to meta-analysis for co-segregated gene expression. Experiments of plasmid transfection and gene silencing were carried out in estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.RESULTS: The developmental signaling regulator Notch-1 was highly expressed in breast cancer, compared with normal tissue, and was segregated with basal disease. Higher Notch-1 levels correlated with progressively abbreviated overall survival, and with increased expression of survivin, a tumor-associated cell death and mitotic regulator implicated in stem cell viability. Analysis of Pearson's correlation coefficient indicated that Notch-1 and survivin co-segregated in basal breast cancer. Notch-1 stimulation in MDA-MB-231 cells increased survivin expression, whereas silencing Notch reduced survivin levels.CONCLUSIONS: A Notch-1-survivin functional gene signature is a hallmark of basal breast cancer, and may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Antagonists of Notch and survivin currently in the clinic may be tested as novel molecular therapy for these recurrence-prone patients."

To gain further insight into the degradome of MMP-14 (membrane type 1 MMP) an MMPI, prinomastat (drug code AG3340), was used to reduce proteolytic processing and ectodomain shedding in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transfected with MMP-14. We report a quantitative proteomic evaluation of the targets and effects of the inhibitor in this cell-based system. Proteins in cell-conditioned medium (the secretome) and membrane fractions with levels that were modulated by the MMPI were identified by isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) labeling and tandem mass spectrometry. Comparisons of the expression of MMP-14 with that of a vector control resulted in increased MMP-14/vector ICAT ratios for many proteins in conditioned medium, indicating MMP-14-mediated ectodomain shedding. Following MMPI treatment, the MMPI/vehicle ICAT ratio was reversed, suggesting that MMP-14-mediated shedding of these proteins was blocked by the inhibitor. The reduction in shedding or the release of substrates from pericellular sites in the presence of the MMPI was frequently accompanied by the accumulation of the protein in the plasma membrane, as indicated by high MMPI/vehicle ICAT ratios. Considered together, this is a strong predictor of biologically relevant substrates cleaved in the cellular context that led to the identification of many undescribed MMP-14 substrates, 20 of which we validated biochemically, including DJ-1, galectin-1, Hsp90alpha, pentraxin 3, progranulin, Cyr61, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A, and dickkopf-1. Other proteins with altered levels, such as Kunitz-type protease inhibitor 1 and beta-2-microglobulin, were not substrates in biochemical assays, suggesting an indirect affect of the MMPI, which might be important in drug development as biomarkers or, in preclinical phases, to predict systemic drug actions and adverse side effects. Hence, this approach describes the dynamic pattern of cell membrane ectodomain shedding and its perturbation upon metalloproteinase drug treatment."

We investigated the effects of clinically achievable doses of doxorubicin (Dox) and Zol, given alone, in sequence, and in combination, on the growth of established breast tumors in vivo.METHODS: Female MF1 nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 5 x 10(5) human breast cancer MDA-MB-436 cells that stably expressed green fluorescent protein (ie, MDA-G8 cells). Beginning on day 7 after tumor cell injection, the mice were injected weekly for 6 weeks with saline, Dox (2 mg/kg body weight via intravenous injection), Zol (100 microg/kg body weight via intraperitoneal injection), Dox plus Zol, Zol followed 24 hours later by Dox, or Dox followed 24 hours later by Zol (n = 8-9 mice per group). The effects of treatment on tumor growth were determined by measuring tumor volume; on tumor cell apoptosis and proliferation by immunohistochemistry using antibodies for caspase-3 and Ki-67, respectively; and on bone by microcomputed tomography and bone histomorphometry. All P values are two-sided.RESULTS: Treatment with Dox or Zol alone or Zol followed 24 hours later by Dox did not statistically significantly decrease final tumor volume compared with saline. Mice treated with Dox plus Zol had statistically significantly smaller final tumor volumes than those treated with Dox alone (mean = 122 mm(3) vs 328 mm(3), difference = 206 mm(3), 95% confidence interval [CI] = 78 to 335 mm(3), P &lt; .001), with Zol alone (122 mm(3) vs 447 mm(3), difference = 325 mm(3), 95% CI = 197 to 454 mm(3), P &lt; .001), or with Zol followed 24 hours later by Dox (122 mm(3) vs 418 mm(3), difference = 296 mm(3), 95% CI = 168 to 426 mm(3), P &lt; .001). Treatment with Dox followed 24 hours later by Zol almost completely abolished tumor growth. Tumors from mice that were treated with Dox followed by Zol had more caspase-3-positive cells than tumors from mice treated with saline (mean number of caspase-3-positive cells per square millimeter: 605.0 vs 82.19, difference = 522.8, 95% CI = 488.2 to 557.4, P &lt; .001), with Zol alone (605.0 vs 98.44, difference = 506.6, 95% CI = 472.0 to 541.2, P &lt; .001), or with Zol followed by Dox (605.0 vs 103.1, difference = 501.9, 95% CI = 467.3 to 536.5, P &lt; .001). The treatment-induced increase in the number of caspase-3-positive cells was mirrored by a decrease in the number of tumor cells positive for the proliferation marker Ki-67. No evidence of bone disease was detected in any of the treatment groups following microcomputed tomography and histological analysis of bone.CONCLUSION: Sequential treatment with Dox followed by Zol elicited substantial antitumor effects in subcutaneous breast tumors in vivo, in the absence of bone disease."

We report a pivotal role for the fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) receptor in this process. We examined whether Fn14 and its ligand tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) were expressed in breast tumors and whether deregulation of Fn14 levels affected malignant behavior of breast cancer cell lines. Analysis of TWEAK and Fn14 in publicly available gene expression data indicated that high Fn14 expression levels significantly correlated with several poor prognostic indicators (P &lt; 0.05). Fn14 expression was highest in the HER2-positive/estrogen receptor-negative (HER2(+)/ER(-)) intrinsic subtype (P = 0.0008). An association between Fn14 and HER2 expression in breast tumors was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Fn14 levels were elevated in invasive, ER(-) breast cancer cell lines. Overexpression of Fn14 in weakly invasive MCF7 and T47D cells resulted in a marked induction of invasion and activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling. Ectopic expression of Fn14tCT, a Fn14 deletion mutant that cannot activate NF-kappaB signaling, was not able to induce invasion. Moreover, ectopic expression of Fn14tCT in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells reduced their invasive capability. RNA interference-mediated inhibition of Fn14 expression in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells reduced invasion. Expression profiling of the Fn14-depleted cells revealed deregulation of NF-kappaB activity. Our findings support a role for Fn14-mediated NF-kappaB pathway activation in breast tumor invasion and metastasis."

However, the counterreceptor for E-selectin and its role in mediating breast cancer cell transendothelial migration remain unknown.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By assessing migration of various breast cancer cells across TNF-alpha pre-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we found that breast cancer cells migrated across HUVEC monolayers differentially and that transmigration was E-selectin dependent. Cell surface labeling with the E-selectin extracellular domain/Fc chimera (exE-selectin/Fc) showed that the transmigration capacity of breast cancer cells was correlated to both the expression level and localization pattern of E-selectin binding protein(s) on the tumor cell surface. The exE-selectin/Fc strongly bound to metastatic MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells, but not non-metastatic MCF-7 and T47D cells. Binding of exE-selectin/Fc was abolished by removal of tumor cell surface sialyl lewis x (sLe(x)) moieties. Employing an exE-selectin/Fc affinity column, we further purified the counterreceptor of E-selectin from metastatic breast cancer cells. The N-terminal protein sequence and cDNA sequence identified this E-selectin ligand as a approximately 170 kD human CD44 variant 4 (CD44v4). Purified CD44v4 showed a high affinity for E-selectin via sLe(x) moieties and, as expected, MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion to and migration across HUVEC monolayers were significantly reduced by down-regulation of tumor cell CD44v4 via CD44v4-specific siRNA.SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrated, for the first time, that breast cancer cell CD44v4 is a major E-selectin ligand in facilitating tumor cell migration across endothelial monolayers. This finding offers new insights into the molecular basis of E-selectin-dependent adhesive interactions that mediate breast cancer cell transendothelial metastasis."

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are circulating and tissue-resident sentinels capable of making large quantities of IFN-alpha upon recognizing viruses through TLRs 7 and 9. In this study, we show that Pg inhibits TLR9-induced IFN-alpha production by human and mouse pDCs and that DMPA impairs TLR9- and virus-induced IFN-alpha production by pDCs in mice, providing a potential explanation for how DMPA impairs innate antiviral immunity in women. Pg failed to inhibit the Mda-5 pathway of IFN-alpha induction in dendritic cells, suggesting that Pg regulates select antiviral DC programs. This may occur through selective blockade of IFN regulatory factor-7 activation, a novel steroid action. Thus, through inhibition of TLR-mediated IFN-alpha production by pDCs, Pg may regulate antiviral immunity."

Digestion with TspRI and methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII, followed by ExoIII and single-strand DNA nuclease allowed removal of DNA fragments containing unmethylated HpaII sites. We then used array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to map the sequences depleted by these procedures in human genomes derived from five human tissues, a primary breast tumor, and two breast tumor cell lines. Analysis of methylation patterns of the normal tissue genomes indicates that the hypomethylated sites are enriched in the 5' end of widely expressed genes, including promoter, first exon, and first intron. In contrast, genomes of the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines show extensive hypomethylation in the intragenic and intergenic regions whereas the primary tumor exhibits a pattern between those of the normal tissue and the cell lines. A striking characteristic of tumor cell lines is the presence of megabase-sized hypomethylated zones. These hypomethylated zones are associated with large genes, fragile sites, evolutionary breakpoints, chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints, tumor suppressor genes, and with regions containing tissue-specific gene clusters or with gene-poor regions containing novel tissue-specific genes. Correlation with microarray analysis shows that genes with a hypomethylated sequence 2 kb up- or downstream of the transcription start site are highly expressed, whereas genes with extensive intragenic and 3' untranslated region (UTR) hypomethylation are silenced. The method described herein can be used for large-scale screening of changes in the methylation pattern in the genome of interest."

It is a potential therapeutic target for the regulation of cancer metastasis. RNA aptamer technology targeting OPN may represent a clinically viable therapy. In this study, we characterize the critical sequence of an RNA aptamer, termed OPN-R3, directed against human OPN. It has a K(d) of 18 nmol/l and binds specifically to human OPN as determined by RNA electrophoretic mobility assays. In MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cells examined under fluorescence microscopy, OPN-R3 ablates cell surface binding of OPN to its cell surface CD44 and alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptors. Critical enzymatic components of the OPN signal transduction pathways, PI3K, JNK1/2, Src and Akt, and mediators of extracellular matrix degradation, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and uroplasminogen activator (uPA), are significantly decreased following exposure to OPN-R3. OPN-R3 inhibits MDA-MB231 in vitro adhesion, migration, and invasion characteristics by 60, 50, and 65%, respectively. In an in vivo xenograft model of breast cancer, OPN-R3 significantly decreases local progression and distant metastases.

Overexpression of c-myc in humans correlates with metastases, but transgenic mice only show low rates of micrometastases. We have generated transgenic mice that overexpress both c-myc and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Myc/VEGF) in the mammary gland, which develop high rates of pulmonary macrometastases. Gene expression profiling revealed a set of deregulated genes in Myc/VEGF tumors compared to Myc tumors associated with the increased metastatic phenotype. Cross-comparisons between this set of genes with a human breast cancer lung metastasis gene signature identified five common targets: tenascin-C(TNC), matrix metalloprotease-2, collagen-6-A1, mannosidase-alpha-1A and HLA-DPA1. Signaling blockade or knockdown of TNC in MDA-MB-435 cells resulted in a significant impairment of cell migration and anchorage-independent cell proliferation. Mice injected with clonal MDA-MB-435 cells with reduced expression of TNC demonstrated a significant decrease (P&lt;0.05) in (1) primary tumor growth; (2) tumor relapse after surgical removal of the primary tumor and (3) incidence of lung metastasis.

Almost all data on endocrine resistance has been obtained in models of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). However, invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) comprise up to 15% of newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers each year and, whereas the incidence of IDC has remained relatively constant during the last 20 years, the prevalence of ILC continues to increase among postmenopausal women. We report a new model of Tamoxifen (TAM)-resistant invasive lobular breast carcinoma cells that provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of endocrine resistance. SUM44 cells express ER and are sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of antiestrogens. Selection for resistance to 4-hydroxytamoxifen led to the development of the SUM44/LCCTam cell line, which exhibits decreased expression of ERalpha and increased expression of the estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma). Knockdown of ERRgamma in SUM44/LCCTam cells by siRNA restores TAM sensitivity, and overexpression of ERRgamma blocks the growth-inhibitory effects of TAM in SUM44 and MDA-MB-134 VI lobular breast cancer cells. ERRgamma-driven transcription is also increased in SUM44/LCCTam, and inhibition of activator protein 1 (AP1) can restore or enhance TAM sensitivity. These data support a role for ERRgamma/AP1 signaling in the development of TAM resistance and suggest that expression of ERRgamma may be a marker of poor TAM response."

In this article, we have investigated the influence of epigenetic modifications on ATF-mediated regulation of maspin by challenging MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, comprising a methylated maspin promoter, with different doses of ATFs and chromatin remodeling drugs: the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid. We found that the ATFs synergized with both inhibitors in reactivating endogenous maspin expression. The strongest synergy was observed with the triple treatment ATF-126 + 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine + suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, in which the tumor suppressor was reactivated by 600-fold. Furthermore, this combination inhibited tumor cell proliferation by 95%. Our data suggest that ATFs enhance the efficiency of chromatin remodeling drugs in reactivating silenced tumor suppressors.

To demonstrate IL-8-specificity of this newly engineered Ad-based shRNA, we also manufactured replication-incompetent Ads (Ad-DeltaE1-CMVshIL8 and Ad-DeltaE1-U6shIL8) under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) and U6 promoters, respectively. Ad-DeltaE1-U6shIL8 was highly effective in reducing IL-8 expression, and was much more effective in driving IL-8-specific shRNA than the CMV promoter-driven vector. The reduced IL-8 expression then translated into decreased angiogenesis in vitro as measured by migration, tube formation and rat aortic ring sprouting assays. In addition to its effect on endothelial cells, Ad-DeltaE1-U6shIL8 also effectively suppressed the migration and invasion of cancer cells. In vivo, intratumoral injection of Ad-DeltaB7-U6shIL8 significantly inhibited the growth of Hep3B and A549 human tumor xenografts. Histopathological analysis of Ad-DeltaB7-U6shIL8-treated tumors revealed an increase in apoptotic cells and a reduction in vessel density.

Genetic mutations along with epigenetic alterations in the form of DNA methylation patterns and histone modifications contribute to metastasis-related gene expression changes and genomic instability. So far, these epigenetic contributions to breast cancer metastasis have not been well characterized, and there is only a limited understanding of the functional mechanisms affected by such epigenetic alterations. Furthermore, no genome-wide assessments have been undertaken to identify altered DNA methylation patterns in the context of metastasis and their effects on specific functional pathways or gene networks.METHODS: We have used a human gene promoter tiling microarray platform to analyze a cell line model of metastasis to lymph nodes composed of a poorly metastatic MDA-MB-468GFP human breast adenocarcinoma cell line and its highly metastatic variant (468LN). Gene networks and pathways associated with metastasis were identified, and target genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition were validated with respect to DNA methylation effects on gene expression.RESULTS: We integrated data from the tiling microarrays with targets identified by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software and observed epigenetic variations in genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and with tumor cell migration. We identified widespread genomic hypermethylation and hypomethylation events in these cells and we confirmed functional associations between methylation status and expression of the CDH1, CST6, EGFR, SNAI2 and ZEB2 genes by quantitative real-time PCR. Our data also suggest that the complex genomic reorganization present in cancer cells may be superimposed over promoter-specific methylation events that are responsible for gene-specific expression changes.CONCLUSION: This is the first whole-genome approach to identify genome-wide and gene-specific epigenetic alterations, and the functional consequences of these changes, in the context of breast cancer metastasis to lymph nodes. This approach allows the development of epigenetic signatures of metastasis to be used concurrently with genomic signatures to improve mapping of the evolving molecular landscape of metastasis and to permit translational approaches to target epigenetically regulated molecular pathways related to metastatic progression."

Important cancer-related genes such as p16 and E-cadherin are controlled epigenetically; however, MUC1 has been overlooked in epigenetics. Herein, we provide the first report that MUC1 gene expression is regulated by DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) modification of the MUC1 promoter. The recently developed MassARRAY assay was performed to investigate the DNA methylation status of 184 CpG sites from -2,753 to +263. Near the transcriptional start site, the DNA methylation level of MUC1-negative cancer cell lines (e.g., MDA-MB-453) was high, whereas that of MUC1-positive cell lines (e.g., MCF-7) was low. Histone H3-K9 modification status was also closely related to MUC1 gene expression. Furthermore, MUC1 mRNA expression in MUC1-negative cells was restored by treatment with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Our results indicate that DNA methylation and histone H3-K9 modification in the 5' flanking region play a critical role in MUC1 gene expression, and this study defines MUC1 as a new member of the class of epigenetically controlled genes.

The smaller isoform, MRJ(S), is studied mainly for its possible role in Huntington's disease. There are no reports of any biologic activity of the longer isoform, MRJ(L). We investigated whether this molecule plays any role in breast cancer. Our studies were prompted by interesting observations we made regarding the expression of MRJ in breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer tissue microarrays, as described below.METHODS: Expression of MRJ(L) from several breast cancer cell lines was evaluated using real-time PCR. Relative levels of the small and large isoforms in breast cancer cell lines were studied using Western blot analysis. A breast cancer progression tissue microarray was probed using anti-MRJ antibody. MRJ(L) was ectopically expressed in two breast cancer cell lines. These cell lines were evaluated for their in vitro correlates of tumor aggressiveness, such as invasion, migration, and anchorage independence. The cell lines were also evaluated for in vivo tumor growth and metastasis. The secreted proteome of the MRJ(L) expressors was analyzed to elucidate the biochemical changes brought about by re-expression of MRJ(L).RESULTS: We found that MRJ(L) is expressed at a significantly lower level in aggressive breast cancer cell lines compared with normal breast. Furthermore, in clinical cases of breast cancer expression of MRJ is lost as the grade of infiltrating ductal carcinoma advances. Importantly, MRJ staining is lost in those cases that also had lymph node metastasis. We report that MRJ(L) is a protein with a functional nuclear localization sequence. Expression of MRJ(L) via an exogenous promoter in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and in MDA-MB-435 (a cell line that metastasizes from the mammary fat pad) decreases their migration and invasion, reduces their motility, and significantly reduces orthotopic tumor growth in nude mice. Moreover, the secreted proteome of the MRJ(L)-expressing cells exhibited reduced levels of tumor progression and metastasis promoting secreted proteins, such as SPP1 (osteopontin), AZGP1 (zinc binding alpha2-glycoprotein 1), SPARC (osteonectin), NPM1 (nucleophosmin) and VGF (VGF nerve growth factor inducible). On the other hand, levels of the secreted metastasis-suppressor KiSS1 (melanoma metastasis suppressor) were increased in the secreted proteome of the MRJ(L)-expressing cells. We confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis that the secreted profile reflected altered transcription of the respective genes.CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data indicate an important role for a totally uncharacterized isoform of DNAJB6 in breast cancer. We show that MRJ(L) is a nuclear protein that is lost in breast cancer, that regulates several key players in tumor formation and metastasis, and that is functionally able to retard tumor growth."

To develop an approach to effectively treat this aggressive disease, we constructed a conditionally replication-competent adenovirus in which expression of the adenoviral E1A gene, necessary for replication, is driven by the cancer-specific promoter of progression-elevated gene-3 (PEG-3) and which simultaneously expresses mda-7/IL-24 in the E3 region of the adenovirus (Ad.PEG-E1A-mda-7), a cancer terminator virus (CTV). This CTV produces large quantities of MDA-7/IL-24 protein as a function of adenovirus replication uniquely in cancer cells. Infection of Ad.PEG-E1A-mda-7 (CTV) in normal human immortal melanocytes and human melanoma cells demonstrates cancer cell-selective adenoviral replication, mda-7/IL-24 expression, growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. Injecting Ad.PEG-E1A-mda-7 CTV into xenografts derived from MeWo human metastatic melanoma cells in athymic nude mice completely eliminated not only primary treated tumors but also distant non-treated tumors (established in the opposite flank), thereby implementing a cure. These provocative findings advocate potential therapeutic applications of this novel virus for treating patients with advanced melanomas with metastases."

Subsequent genome sequencing projects have revealed the presence of tc orthologues in a range of bacterial pathogens known to be associated with insects. Interestingly, members of the mammalian-pathogenic yersiniae have also been shown to encode Tc orthologues. Studies in Yersinia enterocolitica have shown that divergent tc loci either encode insect-active toxins or play a role in colonization of the gut in gastroenteritis models of rats. So far little is known about the activity of the Tc proteins in the other mammalian-pathogenic yersiniae. Here we present work to suggest that Tc proteins in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia pestis are not insecticidal toxins but have evolved for mammalian pathogenicity. We show that Tc is secreted by Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32953 during growth in media at 28 degrees C and 37 degrees C. We also demonstrate that oral toxicity of strain IP32953 to Manduca sexta larvae is not due to Tc expression and that lysates of Escherichia coli BL21 expressing the Yersinia Tc proteins are not toxic to Sf9 insect cells but are toxic to cultured mammalian cell lines. Cell lysates of E. coli BL21 expressing the Y. pseudotuberculosis Tc proteins caused actin ruffles, vacuoles and multi-nucleation in cultured human gut cells (Caco-2); similar morphology was observed after application of a lysate of E. coli BL21 expressing the Y. pestis Tc proteins to mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells, but not Caco-2 cells. Finally, transient expression of the individual Tc proteins in Caco-2 and NIH3T3 cell lines reproduced the actin and nuclear rearrangement observed with the topical applications. Together these results add weight to the growing hypothesis that the Tc proteins in Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis have been adapted for mammalian pathogenicity. We further conclude that Tc proteins from Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis display differential mammalian cell specificity in their toxicity."

We showed previously that treatment with the TLR9-agonistic ODN M362 (a CpG sequence containing oligonucleotide) induces matrix metalloproteinase-13-mediated invasion in TLR9-expressing human cancer cell lines. Here, we further characterized the role of the TLR9 pathway in this process. We show that CpG oligonucleotides induce invasion in macrophages from wild-type C57/B6 and MyD88 knockout mice and in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells lacking MyD88 expression. This effect was significantly inhibited in macrophages from TLR9 knockout mice and in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells stably expressing TLR9 small interfering RNA or dominant-negative tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Sequence modifications to the CpG oligonucleotides that targeted the stem loop and other secondary structures were shown to influence the invasion-inducing effect in MDA-MB-231 cells. In contrast, methylation of the cytosine residues of the parent CpG oligonucleotide did not affect the TLR9-mediated invasion compared with the unmethylated parent CpG oligonucleotide. Finally, expression of TLR9 was studied in clinical breast cancer samples and normal breast epithelium with immunohistochemistry. TLR9 staining localized in epithelial cells in both cancer and normal samples. The mean TLR9 staining intensity was significantly increased in the breast cancer cells compared with normal breast epithelial cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that TLR9 expression is increased in breast cancer and CpG oligonucleotide-induced cellular invasion is mediated via TLR9 and TRAF6, independent of MyD88. Further, our findings suggest that the structure and/or stability of DNA may influence the induction of TLR9-mediated invasion in breast cancer."

Uncultivated methanotrophs from seven European peatlands were studied using a combination of molecular methods. Screening for methanotroph diversity using a particulate methane monooxygenase-based diagnostic gene array revealed that Methylocystis-related species were dominant in six of the seven peatlands studied. The abundance and methane oxidation activity of Methylocystis spp. were further confirmed by DNA stable-isotope probing analysis of a sample taken from the Moor House peatland (England). After ultracentrifugation, (13)C-labelled DNA, containing genomic DNA of these Methylocystis spp., was separated from (12)C DNA and subjected to multiple displacement amplification (MDA) to generate sufficient DNA for the preparation of a fosmid metagenomic library. Potential bias of MDA was detected by fingerprint analysis of 16S rRNA using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for low-template amplification (0.01 ng template). Sufficient template (1-5 ng) was used in MDA to circumvent this bias and chimeric artefacts were minimized by using an enzymatic treatment of MDA-generated DNA with S1 nuclease and DNA polymerase I. Screening of the metagenomic library revealed one fosmid containing methanol dehydrogenase and two fosmids containing 16S rRNA genes from these Methylocystis-related species as well as one fosmid containing a 16S rRNA gene related to that of Methylocella/Methylocapsa. Sequencing of the 14 kb methanol dehydrogenase-containing fosmid allowed the assembly of a gene cluster encoding polypeptides involved in bacterial methanol utilization (mxaFJGIRSAC). This combination of DNA stable-isotope probing, MDA and metagenomics provided access to genomic information of a relatively large DNA fragment of these thus far uncultivated, predominant and active methanotrophs in peatland soil."

While only a handful of autoantibody specificities have proved useful for clinical diagnosis, to characterize complex lupus-associated autoantibody profiles more fully we have applied proteome microarray technology. Our multiplex microarrays included control ligands and 65-autoantigens, which represent diverse nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens recognized by disease-associated and natural autoantibodies. From longitudinal surveys of unrelated SLE patients, we found that autoantibody profile patterns can be patient-specific and highly stable overtime. From profiles of 38 SLE patients that included 14 sets of SLE twins, autoantibodies to the phospholipid neo-determinants, malondialdehyde (MDA) and phosphorylcholine (PC), which are exposed on apoptotic but not healthy cells, were among the most prevalent and highly expressed. We also found that immunoglobulin M (IgM) reactivity to MDA and PC ligands had significant direct correlations with DNA-containing antigens, while such a general relationship was not found with a panel of RNA-related antigens, or for IgG-autoantibodies. Significantly, hierarchical analysis revealed co-distribution/clustering of the IgM autoantibody repertoire patterns for six of 14 twin sets, and such patterns were even more common (10 of 14) for IgG autoantibody profiles. Our findings highlight the potentially distinct roles of IgM and IgG autoantibodies, as we postulate that the direct correlations for IgM autoantibodies to DNA antigens with apoptosis-related determinants may be due to co-expression arising from common pro-homeostatic protective roles. In contrast, the sharing of IgG autoantibody fingerprints by monozygotic twins suggests that lupus IgG autoantibodies can arise in predisposed individuals in genetically determined patterns."

A rat strain is described with an autosomal dominant mutation that alters the isoform expression of titin. While wild type animals go through a developmental program where the 3.0 MDa N2B becomes the major isoform expressed by two to three weeks after birth (approximately 85%), the appearance of the N2B is markedly delayed in heterozygotes and never reaches more than 50% of the titin in the adult. Homozygote mutants express a giant titin of the N2BA isoform type (3.9 MDa) that persists as the primary titin species through ages of more than one and a half years. The mutation does not affect the isoform switching of troponin T, a protein that is also alternatively spliced with developmental changes. The basis for the apparently greater size of the giant titin in homozygous mutants was not determined, but the additional length was not due to inclusion of sequence from larger numbers of PEVK exons or the Novex III exon. Passive tension measurements using isolated cardiomyocytes from homozygous mutants showed that cells could be stretched to sarcomere lengths greater than 4 mum without breakage. This novel rat model should be useful for exploring the potential role of titin in the Frank-Starling relationship and mechano-sensing/signaling mechanisms."

In the case of large population cohorts, selecting samples based on their DNA yield can lead to biased sample selection. In addition, many valuable clinical and research sample collections exist in which the amount of DNA is very small. Unbiased whole genome amplification (WGA) of such unique samples enables genomewide scale genetic studies that would have been impossible otherwise. Multiply primed rolling circle amplification (MPRCA) and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) methods are based on the same principle. The DNA amplification is non-PCR based and uses Phi29 DNA polymerase and random hexamer primers for unbiased whole genome amplification. MDA is used for linear DNA molecules, such as genomic DNA. This chapter reviews the various applications in which whole genome amplified DNA can be used, the types of commercial kits available, and the quality control steps necessary before using the DNA in the genetic studies."

MIF is identified as an intracellular signaling molecule and is implicated in the process of tumor progression, and also strongly enhances neovascularization. Overexpression of MIF has been observed in tumors from various organs. MIF is one of the genes induced by hypoxia in an hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-dependent manner.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The effect of MIF on HIF-1 activity was investigated in human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells. We demonstrate that intracellular overexpression or extracellular administration of MIF enhances activation of HIF-1 under hypoxic conditions in MCF-7 cells. Mutagenesis analysis of MIF and knockdown of 53 demonstrates that the activation is not dependent on redox activity of MIF but on wild-type p53. We also indicate that the MIF receptor CD74 is involved in HIF-1 activation by MIF at least when MIF is administrated extracellularly.SIGNIFICANCE: MIF regulates HIF-1 activity in a p53-dependent manner. In addition to MIF's potent effects on the immune system, MIF is linked to fundamental processes conferring cell proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis, and tumor invasiveness. This functional interdependence between MIF and HIF-1alpha protein stabilization and transactivation activity provide a molecular mechanism for promotion of tumorigenesis by MIF."

However, following completion of the sequence of the highly heterozygous genome of Pinot Noir, it has been possible to identify millions of electronic SNPs (eSNPs) thus providing a valuable source for high-throughput genotyping methods.RESULTS: Herein we report the first application of the SNPlexgenotyping system in grapevine aiming at the anchoring of an eukaryotic genome. This approach combines robust SNP detection with automated assay readout and data analysis. 813 candidate eSNPs were developed from non-repetitive contigs of the assembled genome of Pinot Noir and tested in 90 progeny of Syrah x Pinot Noir cross. 563 new SNP-based markers were obtained and mapped. The efficiency rate of 69% was enhanced to 80% when multiple displacement amplification (MDA) methods were used for preparation of genomic DNA for the SNPlex assay.CONCLUSION: Unlike other SNP genotyping methods used to investigate thousands of SNPs in a few genotypes, or a few SNPs in around a thousand genotypes, the SNPlex genotyping system represents a good compromise to investigate several hundred SNPs in a hundred or more samples simultaneously. Therefore, the use of the SNPlex assay, coupled with whole genome amplification (WGA), is a good solution for future applications in well-equipped laboratories."

However, TIMP-1 is overexpressed in many malignancies and is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. The mechanisms by which TIMP-1 promotes tumorigenesis are unclear. Reduced levels of TIMP-1 mediated by shRNA in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells had no effect on cellular physiology in vitro or tumor growth in SCID mice compared to vector control MDA-MB-231 cells. However, overexpression of TIMP-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in inhibition of cell invasion and enhanced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and AKT in vitro. Additionally, treatment of parental MDA-MB-231 cells with purified TIMP-1 protein led to activation of p38 MAPK and MKK 3/6. cDNA array analysis demonstrated that high expression of TIMP-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in alterations in expression of approximately 200 genes, 1.5 fold or greater compared to vector control cells (P &lt; 0.1). Real-time RT-PCR confirmed changes in expression of several genes associated with cancer progression including DAPK1, FGFR4 and MAPK13. In vivo, high TIMP-1 expression induced tumor growth in SCID mice compared to vector control cells and increased tumor vessel density. Affymetrix array analysis of vector control and TIMP-1 MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors revealed that TIMP-1 altered expression of approximately 600 genes in vivo, including MMP1, MMP13, S100A14, S100P, Rab25 and ID4. These combined observations suggest that the effects of TIMP-1 differ significantly in a 2-D environment compared to the 3-D environment and that TIMP-1 stimulates tumor growth."

Here, we demonstrate that ETV1 downregulation suppresses proliferation of HER2/Neu-positive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro and tumor formation in vivo, proving for the first time the existence of a critical role of ETV1 in breast cancer cell physiology. A screen for novel ETV1 target genes hinted at Rcl, an enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolism. To characterize the human Rcl gene, we cloned its promoter and found that ETV1 and HER2/Neu cooperated in activating the Rcl promoter, whereas a dominant-negative ETV1 molecule suppressed the Rcl promoter. Moreover, ETV1 and HER2/Neu synergized to upregulate the endogenous Rcl gene. ETV1 also bound to the Rcl promoter in vivo, indicating that Rcl is a bona fide target gene of ETV1. Hybridization of Rcl cDNA to a breast cancer array revealed that Rcl is overexpressed in approximately 40% of all breast tumors. Importantly, its expression significantly escalates with increasing tumor grade, strongly implicating that Rcl contributes to breast tumorigenesis. Since joint overexpression of Rcl with vascular endothelial growth factor, another target gene of ETV1, has been shown to induce tumor formation, Rcl may be one crucial effector of ETV1 and HER2/Neu in breast tumors. Furthermore, given its expression pattern and enzymatic function in nucleotide metabolism, Rcl presents itself as a novel target in breast cancer therapy via modulation of its activity by small molecule drugs."

In this regard, past comparative assaying of the two agents against a range of human tumor cell lines has revealed that typically (-)-agelastatin A is 1.5 to 16 times more potent than cisplatin at inhibiting cell growth, its effects being most pronounced against human bladder, skin, colon, and breast carcinomas. In this study, we have investigated the effects of (-)-agelastatin A on OPN-mediated malignant transformation using mammary epithelial cell lines. Treatment with (-)-agelastatin A inhibited OPN protein expression and enhanced expression of the cellular OPN inhibitor, Tcf-4. (-)-Agelastatin A treatment also reduced beta-catenin protein expression and reduced anchorage-independent growth, adhesion, and invasion in R37 OPN pBK-CMV and C9 cell lines. Similar effects were observed in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435s human breast cancer cell lines exposed to (-)-agelastatin A. Suppression of Tcf-4 by RNA interference (short interfering RNA) induced malignant/invasive transformation in parental benign Rama 37 cells; significantly, these events were reversed by treatment with (-)-agelastatin A. Our study reveals, for the very first time, that (-)-agelastatin A down-regulates beta-catenin expression while simultaneously up-regulating Tcf-4 and that these combined effects cause repression of OPN and inhibition of OPN-mediated malignant cell invasion, adhesion, and colony formation in vitro.

Ankyrin repeat domain 11, ANKRD11 (also known as ANR11 or ANCO1), was found to be a novel p53-interacting protein that enhanced the transcriptional activity of p53. ANKRD11 expression was shown to be downregulated in breast cancer cell lines. Restoration of ANKRD11 expression in MCF-7 (wild-type p53) and MDA-MB-468 (p53(R273H) mutant) cells suppressed their proliferative and clonogenic properties through enhancement of CDKN1A (p21(waf1)/CIP1) expression. ShRNA-mediated silencing of ANKRD11 expression reduced the ability of p53 to activate CDKN1A expression. ANKRD11 was shown to associate with the p53 acetyltransferases and cofactors, P/CAF and hADA3. Exogenous ANKRD11 expression enhanced the levels of acetylated p53 in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. ANKRD11 enhanced the DNA-binding properties of mutant p53(R273H) to the CDKN1A promoter, suggesting that ANKRD11 can mediate the restoration of normal p53 function in some cancer-related p53 mutations. In addition, ANKRD11 itself was found to be a novel p53 target gene.

The results demonstrated for the first time high-efficiency infection and replication of DENV in human primary muscle satellite cells. Changes in global gene expression were also examined in these cells following DENV infection using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis. The differentially regulated genes belonged to two main functional categories: cell growth and development, and antiviral type I interferon (IFN) response genes. Increased expression of the type I IFN response genes for tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), melanoma-derived antigen 5 (MDA-5), IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), galectin 3 soluble binding protein (LGals3BP) and IFN response factor 7 (IRF7) was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR.

Structural characterisation of this stalk complex is difficult, primarily due to its dynamics. Here, we apply mass spectrometry to follow post-translational modifications and their effect on structural changes of the stalk proteins on intact ribosomes. Our results show that increased acetylation of L12 occurs during the stationary phase on ribosomes harvested from cells grown under optimal conditions. For cells grown in minimal medium, L12 acetylation and processing is altered, resulting in deficient removal of N-terminal methionine in approximately 50% of the L12 population, while processed L12 is almost 100% acetylated. Our results show also that N-acetylation of L12 correlates with an increased stability of the stalk complex in the gas phase. To investigate further the basis of this increased stability, we applied a solution phase hydrogen deuterium exchange protocol to compare the rate of deuterium incorporation in the proteins L9, L10, L11 and L12 as well as the acetylated form of L12 (L7), in situ on the ribosome. Results show that deuterium incorporation is consistently slower for L7 relative to L12 and for L10 when L7 is predominant. Our results imply a tightening of the interaction between L7 and L10 relative to that between L12 and L10. Since acetylation is predominant when cells are grown in minimal medium, we propose that these modifications form part of the cell's strategy to increase stability of the stalk complex under conditions of stress. More generally, our results demonstrate that it is possible to discern the influence of a 42 Da post-translational modification by mass spectrometry and to record subtle changes in hydrogen/deuterium exchange within the context of an intact 2.5 MDa particle."

To directly identify peptide epitopes unique to cancerous cells, secreted human class I HLA molecules (sHLA) were constructed by deletion of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of HLA A*0201. The resulting sHLA-A*0201 was transferred and expressed in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and BT-20 as well as in the immortal, nontumorigenic cell line MCF10A. Stable transfectants were seeded into bioreactors for production of &gt; 25 mg of sHLA-A*0201. Peptides eluted from affinity purified sHLA were analyzed by mass spectroscopy.

Here, we demonstrate a novel proof of concept: using environmentally-relevant substrate concentrations in stable-isotope probing (SIP) incubations to yield sufficient DNA for large-insert metagenomic analysis through multiple displacement amplification (MDA). A marine surface-water sample was labelled sufficiently by incubation with near in situ concentrations of methanol.

Molluscan hemocyanins are decamers, didecamers, or multidecamers of a 340- to 400-kDa polypeptide subunit containing seven or eight globular functional units (FUs; FU-a to FU-h), each with an oxygen-binding site. The decamers are short 35-nm hollow cylinders, with their lumen narrowed by a collar complex. Our recently published 9-A cryo-electron microscopy/crystal structure hybrid model of a 3.4-MDa cephalopod hemocyanin decamer [Nautilus pompilius hemocyanin (NpH)] revealed the pathway of the seven-FU subunit (340 kDa), 15 types of inter-FU interface, and an asymmetric collar consisting of five &quot;arcs&quot; (FU-g pairs). We now present a comparable hybrid model of an 8-MDa gastropod hemocyanin didecamer assembled from two asymmetric decamers [isoform keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) 1 of the established immunogen KLH]. Compared to NpH, the KLH1 subunit (400 kDa) is C-terminally elongated by FU-h, which is further extended by a unique tail domain. We have found that the wall-and-arc structure of the KLH1 decamer is very similar to that of NpH. We have traced the subunit pathway and how it continues from KLH1-g to KLH1-h to form an annulus of five &quot;slabs&quot; (FU-h pairs) at one cylinder edge. The 15 types of inter-FU interface detected in NpH are also present in KLH1. Moreover, we have identified one arc/slab interface, two slab/slab interfaces, five slab/wall interfaces, and four decamer/decamer interfaces. The 27 interfaces are described on the basis of two subunit conformers, yielding an asymmetric homodimer. Six protrusions from the cryo-electron microscopy structure per subunit are associated with putative attachment sites for N-linked glycans, indicating a total of 120 sugar trees in KLH1. Also, putative binding sites for divalent cations have been detected. In conclusion, the present 9-A data on KLH1 confirm and substantially broaden our recent analysis of the smaller cephalopod hemocyanin and essentially solve the gastropod hemocyanin structure."

(2006) Adiponectin modulates the glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway and attenuates mammary tumorigenesis of MDA-MB-231 cells in nude mice. Cancer Res., 66, 11462-11470]. Here, we extended our studies to elucidate the effects of ADN on regulating the expressions of Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF1), a Wnt antagonist frequently silenced in human breast tumors. Our results showed that ADN time dependently stimulated WIF1 gene and protein expressions in MDA-MB-231 cells. Overexpression of WIF1 exerted similar inhibitory effects to those of ADN on cell proliferations, nuclear beta-catenin activities, cyclin D1 expressions and serum-induced phosphorylations of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta. Blockage of WIF1 activities significantly attenuated the suppressive effects of ADN on MDA-MB-231 cell growth. Furthermore, our in vivo studies showed that both supplementation of recombinant ADN and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of this adipokine substantially enhanced WIF1 expressions in MDA-MB-231 tumors implanted in nude mice. More interestingly, we found that ADN could alleviate methylation of CpG islands located within the proximal promoter region of WIF1, possibly involving the specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factor and its downstream target DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). Upon ADN treatment, the protein levels of both Sp1 and DNMT1 were significantly decreased. Using silencing RNA approaches, we confirmed that downregulation of Sp1 resulted in an increased expression of WIF1 and decreased methylation of WIF1 promoter. Taken together, these data suggest that ADN might elicit its antitumor activities at least partially through promoting WIF1 expressions."

Here, we studied molecular mechanisms by which insulin activates the expression of leptin, an obesity hormone that has been shown to promote breast cancer progression in an autocrine or paracrine way. Using MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, we found that (a) insulin stimulated leptin mRNA and protein expression, which was associated with increased activation of the leptin gene promoter; (b) insulin increased nuclear accumulation of transcription factors hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and Sp1 and their loading on the leptin promoter; (c) small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of either HIF-1alpha or Sp1 significantly down-regulated insulin-induced leptin mRNA and protein expression; further inhibition of leptin expression was observed under the combined HIF-1alpha and Sp1 siRNA treatment; (d) inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI-3K) pathways significantly, albeit partially, decreased insulin-dependent leptin mRNA and protein expression, which coincided with reduced association of HIF-1alpha and/or Sp1 with specific leptin promoter regions; and (e) inhibition of ERK1/2 reduced recruitment of both HIF-1alpha and Sp1 to the leptin promoter, whereas down-regulation of PI-3K influenced only HIF-1alpha binding. In summary, our data suggest that hyperinsulinemia could induce breast cancer progression through leptin-dependent mechanisms. In MDA-MB-231 cells, this process requires Sp1- and HIF-1alpha-mediated leptin gene transcription and is partially regulated by the PI-3K and ERK1/2 pathways."

Here, we show tumor-specific methylation of the PTPRO CpG island in primary human breast cancer. PTPRO expression was significantly reduced in established breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 due to promoter methylation compared with its expression in normal human mammary epithelial cells (48R and 184). Further, the silenced gene could be demethylated and reactivated in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells upon treatment with 5-Azacytidine, a DNA hypomethylating agent. Because PTPRO promoter harbors estrogen-responsive elements and 17beta-estradiol (E2) plays a role in breast carcinogenesis, we examined the effect of E2 and its antagonist tamoxifen on PTPRO expression in human mammary epithelial cells and PTPRO-expressing breast cancer cell line Hs578t. Treatment with E2 significantly curtailed PTPRO expression in 48R and Hs578t cells, which was facilitated by ectopic expression of estrogen receptor (ER)beta but not ERalpha. On the contrary, treatment with tamoxifen increased PTPRO expression. Further, knockdown of ERbeta by small interfering RNA abolished these effects of E2 and tamoxifen. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed association of c-Fos and c-Jun with PTPRO promoter in untreated cells, which was augmented by tamoxifen-mediated recruitment of ERbeta to the promoter. Estradiol treatment resulted in dissociation of c-Fos and c-Jun from the promoter. Ectopic expression of PTPRO in the nonexpressing MCF-7 cells sensitized them to growth-suppressive effects of tamoxifen. These data suggest that estrogen-mediated suppression of PTPRO is probably one of the early events in estrogen-induced tumorigenesis and that expression of PTPRO could facilitate endocrine therapy of breast cancer."

We have previously shown that silencing of COX-2 in the poorly differentiated metastatic breast cell line MDA-MB-231 by RNA interference markedly delayed tumor onset and inhibited metastasis. To understand the functional effects of COX-2 silencing underlying the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis previously reported, we investigated changes in these cells for a number of cancer-associated phenotypes. Cyclooxygenase-2-silenced cells were less able to acidify tissue culture medium, a response that could partly be attributed to decreased lactate production or export detected by reduced lactate in the medium. Consistent with the significantly reduced transcript levels of hyaluronan synthase 2, an enzyme responsible for the total level of hyaluronan secreted by these cells, COX-2 silencing resulted in lower hyaluronan levels secreted in culture medium. Inhibition of human umbilical vein endothelial cell network association in a coculture assay was also observed in COX-2-silenced cells. These data highlight the functional role of COX-2 in pathways that mediate increased malignancy."

Defining the signaling mechanisms that regulate this process is important in understanding the role of MSCs in tumor growth. Using a combination of chromatography and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry we have identified novel soluble signaling molecules that induce MSC chemotaxis present in conditioned medium of the breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB231. Previous work has employed survey strategies using ELISA assay to identify known chemokines that promote MSC chemotaxis. While these studies provide valuable insights into the intercellular signals that impact MSC behavior, many less well-described, but potentially important soluble signaling molecules could be overlooked using these methods. Through the less directed method of column chromatography we have identified novel candidate MSC chemotactic peptides. Two proteins, cyclophilin B and hepatoma-derived growth factor were then further characterized and shown to promote MSC chemotaxis."

Herein, we demonstrated that TGF-beta1 induces the expression of connexin43 (Cx43) in normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cell lines at the protein and mRNA levels, and transcriptionally. Using overexpression of a truncated dominant-negative form of Cx43, we determined that the modulation of gap junctional communication by TGF-beta1 plays a key role in the control of NMuMG cells proliferation by TGF-beta1. In addition, using overexpression of truncated dominant-negative forms of either Smad2 or Smad3, and MDA-MB-468 human breast carcinoma cells deficient for Smad4, we determined that the Smad cascade is not implicated in TGF-beta1 effect on Cx43 expression. Using specific pharmacologic inhibitors for JNK, ERK, p38, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, we demonstrated the cooperative role of p38 and PI3K/AKT signaling in TGF-beta1-induced Cx43 expression and gap junctional communication. Furthermore, transfection of a c-jun antisense expression vector significantly prevented TGF-beta1-induced Cx43 gene expression demonstrating the involvement of c-Jun/AP-1 pathway together with p38 and PI3K/AKT pathways in mediating TGF-beta1-induced Cx43 gene expression."

Although these pathways have been thought to interact indirectly, the present study is the first to observe direct interactions between these pathways that involves the regulation of slug expression. Specifically we report that ligand-activated ERalpha suppressed slug expression directly by repression of transcription and that knockdown of ERalpha with RNA interference increased slug expression. More specifically, slug expression was down-regulated in ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with ERalpha after treatment with E2 (17beta-oestradiol). The down-regulation of slug in the ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cell line was mediated by direct repression of slug transcription by the formation of a co-repressor complex involving ligand-activated ERalpha protein, HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) and N-CoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor). This finding was confirmed by sequential ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) studies. In the MCF-7 cell line, slug expression normally was low. In addition, knockdown of ERalpha with RNA interference in this cell line increased slug expression. This effect could be partially reversed by treatment of the cells with E2. The efficacy of the effect of ERalpha on slug repression was dependent on the overall level of ERalpha. These observations confirmed that slug was an E2-responsive gene."

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of developmental, physiological and pathological neovascularization, especially involved in tumor growth. Recent studies indicate that 17beta-estradiol (E2) modulates VEGF expression in breast cancer cells through transcriptional activation. We have investigated both the molecular mechanisms of E2-induction of VEGF expression and of VEGF control of breast cancer angiogenesis. In transient transfection assays using the VEGF promoter-luciferase construct, E2 increased VEGF transcriptional activity in MCF-7 cells and in MDA-MB-231 cotransfected with estrogen receptor (ERalpha or ERbeta). The positive effect was abolished when MCF-7 cells were treated with the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 or the agonist/antagonist tamoxifen. We further identified an imperfect estrogen responsive element (ERE1520) in the VEGF promoter, which formed a complex with ERalpha or ERbeta proteins in gel shift assay using MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts; the ERE sequence is involved in the transcriptional regulation of VEGF in our experimental conditions. These results demonstrate that in breast cancer (BC) cells VEGF is a target gene for ERalpha or ERbeta. To determine the role of VEGF in the progression of human breast carcinoma, we generated stable human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) overexpressing VEGF165 (V165 clones). Cells or control vector clones were implanted subcutaneously in athymic mice. Our in vivo findings show that overexpression of VEGF significantly decreased tumor uptake and increased tumor growth and angiogenesis in a murine model of BC."

For this purpose, we developed histidine-lysine-rich (HK) polymers with specific sequences and branching. We have found that branched HK polymers in complex with Raf-1 siRNA markedly decreased Raf-1 mRNA and induced apoptosis in cell lines in vitro. The primary focus of the present study was to determine an effective carrier to deliver siRNA systemically to tumor xenografts. After comparing HK:Raf-1 polyplexes for their in-vivo efficacy, we investigated in greater detail whether one of these polymers, H3K(+H)4b, in complex with Raf-1 siRNA, inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-435 xenografts. H3K(+H)4b is a four-branched HK peptide whose predominant repeating sequence within the terminal arm is -HHHK-. After the first tail-vein injection in a mouse model, there was a statistically significant reduction in tumor size between the H3K(+H)4b:Raf-1 siRNA-treated and the control groups (P&lt;0.01). By the third injection, there was nearly a 50% reduction in the Raf-1 siRNA-treated group compared to the control siRNA-treated or -untreated group. Consistent with a significant effect of the HK:Raf-1 polyplex on the tumor, there were marked histological changes, increased apoptosis and fewer vessels in the Raf-1 siRNA-treated group. Raf-1 protein within the tumor was significantly decreased after treatment with the HK:Raf-1 siRNA polyplex compared to the control treatment groups. Despite the striking effect on the tumor by the HK Raf-1 siRNA, there was little evidence of toxicity in normal tissues with this therapy. By harnessing the ability to modify the amino-acid sequence and branching of HK polymers, we expect continued development of HK polymers as in-vivo carriers of siRNA."

RNAi induction can be used as an alternative approach for selective tumor cell killing. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules targeting BORIS were generated and their efficacy was tested in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and non-malignant epithelial cell lines. Treatment with BORIS-specific siRNA, but not control siRNA led to a concentration-dependent reduction in BORIS expression and proportional apoptotic death of the cancer but not control cells. To our knowledge this is first report demonstrating a critical role of BORIS in maintaining tumor cell viability."

Recent studies have defined a role for TbetaRIII in the pathogenesis of human cancers, with frequent loss of TbetaRIII expression at the message and protein level. Mechanisms for the loss of TbetaRIII expression remain to be fully defined. Advanced human cancers often have elevated circulating levels of TGF-beta1. Here, we define a specific role for TGF-beta1 in negatively regulating TbetaRIII at the message level in breast and ovarian cancer models. TGF-beta1 decreased TbetaRIII message and protein levels in ovarian (Ovca420) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. TGF-beta1-mediated TbetaRIII repression is mediated by the type I TGF-beta receptor/Smad2/3 pathway as the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) inhibitor, SB431542, abrogated this effect, while the expression of constitutively active ALK5 was sufficient to repress TbetaRIII expression. Mechanistically, TGF-beta1 does not affect TbetaRIII messenger RNA (mRNA) stability, but instead directly regulates the TbetaRIII promoter. We define alternative promoters for the TGFBR3 gene, a distal and proximal promoter. Although both promoters are active, only the proximal promoter was responsive and negatively regulated by TGF-beta1 and constitutively active ALK5. Taken together, these studies define TGF-beta1-mediated downregulation of TbetaRIII mRNA expression through effects on the ALK5/Smad2/3 pathway on the TGFBR3 gene proximal promoter as a potential mechanism for decreased TbetaRIII expression in human cancers."

Here, we report that the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGFR is shed from the cell surface of human carcinoma cell lines that express 7x10(5) receptors/cell or more. We purified this proteolytic isoform of EGFR (PI-sEGFR) from the CCM of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. The amino acid sequence of PI-sEGFR was determined by reverse-phase HPLC nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry of peptides generated by trypsin, chymotrypsin or GluC digestion. The PI-sEGFR protein is identical in amino acid sequence to the EGFR ECD. The release of PI-sEGFR from MDA-MB-468 cells is enhanced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, pervanadate, and EGFR ligands (i.e., EGF and TGF-alpha). In addition, 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate, an activator of metalloproteases, increased PI-sEGFR levels in the CCM of MDA-MB-468 cells. Inhibitors of metalloproteases decreased the constitutive shedding of EGFR while the PMA-induced shedding was inhibited by metalloprotease inhibitors, by the two serine protease inhibitors leupeptin and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI), and by the aspartyl inhibitor pepstatin. These results suggest that PI-sEGFR arises by proteolytic cleavage of EGFR via a mechanism that is regulated by both PKC- and phosphorylation-dependent pathways. Our results further suggest that when proteolytic shedding of EGFR does occur, it is correlated with a highly malignant phenotype."

Molecular factors that may contribute to the propensity of LCs to aggregate in vivo, such as the protein primary structure or local environment, are intensive areas of study. Herein, we show that the aggregation of a human antibody kappa-(kappa-MJM) and lambda-(lambda-L155) light chain (1 mg/mL) can be accelerated in vitro when they are incubated under physiologically relevant conditions, PBS, pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C, in the presence of a panel of biologically relevant lipid-derived aldehydes, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA), glyoxal (GLY), atheronal-A (KA), and atheronal-B (ALD). Thioflavin-T (ThT) and Congo Red (CR) binding assays coupled with turbidity studies reveal that this aldehyde-induced aggregation can be associated with alteration of protein secondary structure to an increased beta-sheet conformation. We observed that the nature of the conformational change is primarily dependent upon the lipidic aldehyde studied, not the protein sequence. Thus, the cholesterol 5,6-secosterols, KA and ALD, cause an amorphous-type aggregation which is ThT and CR negative for both the kappa-MJM and lambda-L155 light chains, whereas 4-HNE, MDA, and GLY induce aggregates that bind both ThT and CR. TEM analysis revealed that amyloid fibrils were formed during the 4-HNE-mediated aggregation of kappa-MJM and lambda-L155 light chains, whereas ALD-induced aggregates of these LCs where amorphous in nature. Kinetic profiles of LC aggregation reveal clear differences between the aldehydes, KA and ALD, causing a classic nucleated polymerization-type aggregation, with a lag phase (of approximately 150 h) followed by a growth phase that plateaus, whereas 4-HNE, MDA, and GLY trigger a seeded-type aggregation process that has no lag phase. In-depth studies of the 4-HNE-accelerated aggregation of kappa-MJM and lambda-L155 reveal a clear aldehyde concentration dependence and a process that can be inhibited by the naturally occurring osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Given these data, we feel our recently discovered paradigm of inflammatory aldehyde-induced protein misfolding may now extend to LC aggregation."

Recently, each of these genes was found to play a role in mediating breast cancer metastasis to the lungs, but their potential interdependence was not evaluated. Hence, the main objective of the current study was to determine whether COX-2-derived prostaglandin (PGE(2)) activated Id-1 transcription, leading in turn to increased invasiveness of mammary epithelial cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, treatment with PGE(2) induced Id-1, an effect that was mimicked by an EP(4) agonist. PGE(2) via EP(4) activated the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) --&gt; ERK1/2 pathway, which led to increased expression of Egr-1. PGE(2) stimulated EGFR signaling by inducing the release of amphiregulin, an EGFR ligand. The ability of PGE(2) to activate Id-1 transcription was mediated by enhanced binding of Egr-1 to the Id-1 promoter. Silencing of COX-2 or pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 led to reduced PGE(2) production, decreased Id-1 expression, and reduced migration of cells through extracellular matrix. A similar decrease in cell migration was found when Id-1 was silenced. The interrelationship between COX-2, PGE(2), Id-1, and cell invasiveness was also compared in nontumorigenic SCp2 and tumorigenic SCg6 mammary epithelial cells. Consistent with the findings in MDA-MB-231 cells, COX-2-derived PGE(2) induced Id-1, leading in turn to increased cell invasiveness. Taken together, these results suggest that PGE(2) via EP(4) activated the EGFR --&gt; ERK1/2 --&gt; Egr-1 pathway, leading to increased Id-1 transcription and cell invasion. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between COX-2 and Id-1 and their potential role in metastasis."

In addition, Poly E inhibited VEGF-induced neovascularization in vivo. We also demonstrate that Poly E blocked signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling by suppressing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced gene transcription via IFN-gamma-activating sequence (GAS) elements and downstream STAT3 activation by inhibiting STAT1 and STAT3 dimerization in MDA-MB231 cells.

We and others have implicated free radical mediated peroxidative damage in the pathogenesis of SLE. Since harmful free radical products are formed during this oxidative process, including 4-hydroxy 2-nonenol (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA), we hypothesized that specific HNE-protein adducts would be present in SLE red blood cell (RBC) membranes. Catalase is located on chromosome 11p13 where linkage analysis has revealed a marker in the same region of the genome among families with thrombocytopenia, a clinical manifestation associated with severe lupus in SLE affected pedigrees. Moreover, SLE afflicts African-Americans three times more frequently than their European-American counterparts. Hence we investigated the effects of a genetic polymorphism of catalase on risk and severity of SLE in 48 pedigrees with African American ancestry.METHODS: Tryptic digestion followed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) analysis was used to identify the protein modified by HNE, following Coomassie staining to visualize the bands on the acrylamide gels. Genotyping analysis for the C --&gt; T, -262 bp polymorphism in the promoter region of catalase was performed by PCR-RFLP and direct PCR-sequencing. We used a &quot;pedigree disequilibrium test&quot; for the family based association analysis, implemented in the PDT program to analyze the genotyping results.RESULTS: We found two proteins to be HNE-modified, migrating around 80 and 50 kD respectively. Tryptic digestion followed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) analysis of the Coomassie stained 80 kD band revealed that the target of HNE modification was catalase, a protein shown to associate with RBC membrane proteins. All the test statistics carried out on the genotyping analysis for the C --&gt; T, -262 bp polymorphism in the promoter region of catalase were non-significant (p &gt; 0.05) in our data, which suggested that this SNP is not associated with SLE.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that catalase is one of the proteins modified due to oxidative stress. However, catalase may not be a susceptibility gene for SLE. Nonetheless, catalase is oxidatively modified among SLE patients. This suggests a possible role between oxidative modification of catalase and its affects on enzymatic activity in SLE. An oxidatively modified catalase could be one of the reasons for lower enzymatic activity among SLE subjects, which in turn could favor the accumulation of deleterious hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, HNE-products are potential neoantigens and could be involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. Decrease in catalase activity could affect the oxidant-antioxidant balance. Chronic disturbance of this balance in patients with SLE may work favorably for the premature onset of atherogenesis with severe vascular effect."

In this report, we have analyzed the efficacy of a chemopreventive agent, curcumin, in blocking RON tyrosine kinase-mediated invasion of breast cancer cells. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western analysis indicated the down-regulation of the RON message and protein, respectively, in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Significantly, curcumin-mediated inhibition of RON expression resulted in the blockade of RON ligand, MSP-induced invasion of breast cancer cells. We have identified two putative nuclear factor-kappaB p65 subunit binding sites on the RON promoter. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the RON promoter, we have confirmed the binding of p65 to the RON promoter. Our data show that curcumin reduces RON expression by affecting p65 protein expression and transcriptional activity. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, an inhibitor of p65, or small interfering RNA knockdown of p65, blocked RON gene expression and MSP-mediated invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. This is the first report showing the regulation of human RON gene expression by nuclear factor-kappaB and suggests a potential therapeutic role for curcumin in blocking RON tyrosine kinase-mediated invasion of carcinoma cells."

However, the molecular mechanism of its potent anticancer activity remains poorly understood and warrants further investigations. In this study, we examined the anti-invasive activities of endostar in vitro. The results showed that endostar suppressed MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion to the fibronectin-coated substrate in a concentration-dependent manner. It could inhibit the wound healing migration of MDA-MB-435 cells and invasion of MDA-MB-435 cells through reconstituted ECM (matrigel). Zymography revealed that endostar decreased the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Endostar could also inhibit the expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in MDA-MB-435 cells. Additionally, endostar exerted an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Collectively, these data provided a molecular basis for the anti-invasive effects of endostar."

Galectin-3 is overexpressed in a wide range of neoplasms and is associated with tumor growth and metastases. Given this fact, radiolabeled galectin-3-targeting molecules may be useful for the noninvasive imaging of tumors expressing galectin-3, as well as for targeted radionuclide therapy. In this study, the tumor cell-targeting and SPECT properties of a galectin-3-avid peptide identified from bacteriophage display were evaluated in human breast carcinoma cells and in human breast tumor-bearing mice.METHODS: The galectin-3-avid peptide G3-C12 (ANTPCGPYTHDCPVKR) was synthesized with a Gly-Ser-Gly (GSG) linker at the amino terminus. After conjugation with 1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-N,N',N''N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), the peptide was labeled with (111)In. The radiochemical purity and stability of the compound was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography. MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells expressing galectin-3 were used to characterize the in vitro binding properties of the radiolabeled compound. SCID mice bearing MDA-MB-435 xenografts were used as an in vivo model for biodistribution and imaging studies with the (111)In-labeled peptide.RESULTS: (111)In-DOTA(GSG)-G3-C12 bound specifically to galectin-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells. The radiolabeled peptide was stable in serum and was found intact in excreted urine for at least 1 h. Competitive binding experiments indicated that the radiolabeled peptide exhibited an inhibitory concentration of 50% of 200.00+/-6.70 nM for cultured breast carcinoma cells. In vivo biodistribution studies revealed that tumor uptake was 1.2+/-0.24, 0.75+/-0.05, and 0.6+/-0.04 (mean +/- SD) percentage injected dose per gram at 30 min, 1.0 h, and 2.0 h after injection of the radiotracer, respectively. SPECT/CT studies with (111)In-DOTA(GSG)-G3-C12 showed excellent tumor uptake and contrast in the tumor-bearing mice. Specificity of peptide binding was demonstrated by successful blocking (52%) of in vivo tumor uptake of (111)In-DOTA(GSG)-G3-C12 in the presence of its nonradiolabeled counterpart at 2 h after injection.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the successful use of a new radiolabeled peptide for the noninvasive imaging of galectin-3-positive breast tumors. This peptide may be a promising candidate for future clinical applications."

Fas ligand (FasL), a trans-membrane protein, induces apoptosis by crosslinking with the Fas receptor. Despite the FasL relevance, little is available on the regulation of its expression. In the current study, we explored for the first time the potential role of PPARgamma in triggering apoptotic events through the Fas/FasL pathway in breast cancer cells. In MCF7 cells, by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, we showed that the synthetic PPARgamma ligand rosiglitazone (BRL) enhanced FasL expression, that was abrogated by a specific PPARgamma antagonist GW9662. Transient transfection assays demonstrated that BRL transactivated human FasL promoter gene in a PPARgamma-dependent manner. Progressive 5' deletion analysis has identified a minimal promoter fragment spanning nucleotides from -318 to -237 bp, which is still sensitive to BRL treatment. FasL promoter activity was abrogated by mithramycin, suggesting an involvement of Sp1 transcription factor in PPARgamma action. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immuno-precipitation assays demonstrated that BRL increased the binding of PPARgamma and Sp1 to the Sp1 sequence located within the FasL gene promoter. The role of PPARgamma and Fas/FasL pathways in BRL-induced apoptotic events was assessed by caspase 8 cleavage in the presence of GW as well as PPARgamma and FasL RNA interferences. Our results indicate that PPARgamma positively regulates the FasL gene expression also in MDA-MB231 and in BT20, revealing a new molecular mechanism by which BRL induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells."

VIP treatment slowly increased the expression levels of EGFR but it rapidly augmented phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 in both cell lines. This pattern of HERs transactivation was blocked by the specific VIP antagonist JV-1-53, supporting the direct involvement of VIP receptors in formation of P-EGFR and P-HER2. VIP-induced transactivation was also abolished by H89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), PP2 (Src inhibitor) or TAPI-1 (inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases), following a differential pattern. These results shed a new light on the specific signalling pathways involved in EGFR/HER2 transactivation by VPAC receptors and suggest the potential usefulness of VIP receptor antagonists together with current antibodies against EGFR/HER2 and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitors for breast cancer therapy."

The Plasminogen Activation (PA) system, including urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), its receptor and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1(PAI-1), also plays a key role in cancer invasion and metastasis, either through proteolytic degradation or by non-proteolytic modulation of cell adhesion and migration. Thus, Snail and the PA system are both over-expressed in cancer and influence this process. In this study we aimed to determine if the activity of SNAI1 (a member of the Snail family) is correlated with expression of the PA system components and how this correlation can influence tumoural cell migration.METHODS: We compared the invasive breast cancer cell-line MDA-MB-231 expressing SNAI1 (MDA-mock) with its derived clone expressing a dominant-negative form of SNAI1 (SNAI1-DN). Expression of PA system mRNAs was analysed by cDNA microarrays and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Wound healing assays were used to determine cell migration. PAI-1 distribution was assessed by immunostaining.RESULTS: We demonstrated by both cDNA microarrays and real-time quantitative RT-PCR that the functional blockade of SNAI1 induces a significant decrease of PAI-1 and uPA transcripts. After performing an in vitro wound-healing assay, we observed that SNAI1-DN cells migrate more slowly than MDA-mock cells and in a more collective manner. The blockade of SNAI1 activity resulted in the redistribution of PAI-1 in SNAI1-DN cells decorating large lamellipodia, which are commonly found structures in these cells.CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of functional SNAI1, the expression of PAI-1 transcripts is decreased, although the protein is redistributed at the leading edge of migrating cells in a manner comparable with that seen in normal epithelial cells."

In order to identify genes required for the stresses responses in the grass crop Zea mays, an ALDH (ZmALDH22A1) gene was isolated and characterized. ZmALDH22A1 belongs to the family ALDH22 that is currently known only in plants. The ZmALDH22A1 encodes a protein of 593 amino acids that shares high identity with the orthologs from Saccharum officinarum (95%), Oryza sativa (89%), Triticum aestivum (87%) and Arabidopsis thaliana (77%), respectively. Real-time PCR analysis indicates that ZmALDH22A1 is expressed differentially in different tissues. Various elevated levels of ZmALDH22A1 expression have been detected when the seedling roots exposed to abiotic stresses including dehydration, high salinity and abscisic acid (ABA). Tomato stable transformation of construct expressing the ZmALDH22A1 signal peptide fused with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) driven by the CaMV35S-promoter reveals that the fusion protein is targeted to plastid. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing ZmALDH22A1 shows elevated stresses tolerance. Stresses tolerance in transgenic plants is accompanied by a reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) derived from cellular lipid peroxidation."

Defective drug uptake in association with decreased RFC expression is a common mechanism of MTX resistance in many tumor types. Heavy promoter methylation was previously identified as a basis for the complete silencing of RFC in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, its role and prevalence in RFC transcription regulation are, however, not widely studied.METHODS: In the current study, RFC promoter methylation was assessed using methylation specific PCR in a panel of malignant cell lines (n = 8), including MDA-MB-231, and M805, a MTX resistant cell line directly established from the specimen of a patient with malignant fibrohistocytoma, whom received multiple doses of MTX. A quantitative approach of real-time PCR for measuring the extent of RFC promoter methylation was developed, and was validated by direct bisulfite genomic sequencing. RFC mRNA levels were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and were related to the extent of promoter methylation in these cell lines.RESULTS: A partial promoter methylation and RFC mRNA down-regulation were observed in M805. Using the quantitative approach, a reverse correlation (correlation coefficient = -0.59, p &lt; 0.05) was identified between the promoter methylation and RFC mRNA levels in this a panel of malignant cell lines.CONCLUSION: This study further suggests that promoter methylation is a potential basis for MTX resistance. The quantitative correlation identified in this study implies that promoter methylation is possibly a mechanism involved in the fine regulation of RFC transcription."

We investigated the structure of this giant molecule by X-ray crystallography, circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The crystal structure of two repeats showed that each repeat consists of two distinct three-helix bundles, and two such repeats are connected along the long axis, resulting in a rod-like structure that is 120 A in length. CD and SAXS analyses of the samples with longer repeats suggested that each repeat has an identical structure, and that such repeats are connected tandemly to form a rod-like structure in solution, the length of which increased proportionately with the number of repeating units. On the basis of these results, it was proposed that Ebh is a 320 nm rod-like molecule with some plasticity at module junctions."

Cancer cells develop drug resistance through dysregulation of one or more genes or cellular pathways. To isolate efficient regulators of drug resistance in tumor cells, we have adopted a genome-wide scanning approach based on the screening of large libraries of artificial transcription factors (ATFs) made of three and six randomly assembled zinc finger domains. Zinc finger libraries were linked to a VP64 activation domain and delivered into a paclitaxel-sensitive tumor cell line. Following drug treatment, several ATFs were isolated that promoted drug resistance. One of these ATFs, 3ZF-1-VP, promoted paclitaxel resistance in cell lines having mutated or inactivated p53, such as MDA-MB-435 and Kaposi's sarcoma cell lines. 3ZF-1-VP also induced strong resistance to etoposide, vincristine, and cisplatinum. Linkage of a repression domain to the selected ATF resulted in enhanced sensitivity to multiple drugs, particularly vincristine, cisplatinum, and 5-fluorouracil. Small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of p53 revealed that 3ZF-1-VP activated both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms to promote survival, whereas other ATF required intact p53. Real-time expression analysis and DNA microarrays showed that several ATFs up-regulated targets of p53, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1), and genes participating in the p14(ARF)-MDM2-p53 tumor suppressor pathway, such as hDMP1. Thus, ATF can be used to map genes and pathways involved in drug resistance phenotypes and have potential as novel therapeutic agents to inhibit drug resistance."

Our study provides new insights into the mechanism allowing hormone-activated expression of ERalpha target genes silenced in ERalpha-negative mammary tumor cells. In cell lines derived from ERalpha-negative MDA-MB231 cells, stable expression of different levels of ERalpha from a transgene did not result in transcription of PR. A quantitative comparative analysis demonstrates that inhibiting DNA methyltransferases using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or specific disruption of DNMT1 by small interfering RNAs and treatment with the histone-deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A enabled ERalpha-mediated hormone-dependent expression of endogenous PR. We show that demethylation of a CpG island located in the first exon of PR was a prerequisite for ERalpha binding to these regulatory sequences. Although not a general requirement, DNA demethylation is also necessary for derepression of a subset of ERalpha target genes involved in tumorigenesis. PR transcription did not subsist 4 days after removal of the DNA methyltransferase blocking agents, suggesting that hormone-induced expression of ERalpha target genes in ERalpha-negative tumor cells is transient. Our observations support a model where an epigenetic mark confers stable silencing by precluding ERalpha access to promoters."

The estrogenic response is complex and not completely understood, including in terms of the involved responsive genes. Here we show that Hsp22 (synonyms: HspB8, E2lG1, H11), a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) superfamily, was induced by E2 in estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, resulting in an elevated Hsp22 protein level, whereas it was not induced in estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. This induction was prevented by the pure anti-estrogen ICI182780 (faslodex, fulvestrant), whereas tamoxifen, a substance with mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties, had no major inhibitory effect on this induction, nor did it induce Hsp22 on its own. Cadmium (Cd) is an environmental pollutant with estrogenic properties (metalloestrogen) that has been implicated in breast cancer. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with Cd also resulted in induction of Hsp22, and this induction was also inhibited by ICI182780. In live MCF-7 cells, Hsp22 interacted at the level of dimers with Hsp27, a related sHSP, as was shown by quantitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements. In cytosolic extracts of MCF-7 cells, most of the E2- and Cd-induced Hsp22 was incorporated into high-molecular mass complexes. In part, Hsp22 and Hsp27 were components of distinct populations of these complexes. Finally, candidate elements in the Hsp22 promoter were identified by sequence analysis that could account for the induction of Hsp22 by E2 and Cd. Taken together, Hsp22 induction represents a new aspect of the estrogenic response with potential significance for the biology of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells."

To study regulation of CD24, we queried a number of publicly available expression array studies in breast cancer cells and found that CD24 was downregulated upon estrogen treatment. We confirmed this estrogen-mediated repression of CD24 mRNA by quantitative real-time PCR in MCF7, T47D and ZR75-1 cells. Repression was also seen at the protein level as measured by flow cytometry. CD24 was not downregulated in the ER alpha negative MDA-MB-231 cells suggesting that ER alpha was necessary. This was further confirmed by ER alpha silencing in MCF7 cells resulting in increased CD24 levels and by reintroduction of ER alpha into C4-12 cells resulting in decreased CD24 levels. Estrogen treatment did not alter half-life of CD24 mRNA and new protein synthesis was not essential for repression, suggesting a primary transcriptional effect. Histone deacetylase inhibition by Trichostatin A completely abolished the repression, but decrease of the ER alpha corepressors NCoR, LCoR, RIP140, silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors, SAFB1 and SAFB2 by siRNA or overexpression of SAFB2, NCoR and silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors had no effect. In silico promoter analyses led to the identification of two estrogen responsive elements in the CD24 promoter, one of which was able to bind ER alpha as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Together, our results show that CD24 is repressed by estrogen and that this repression is a direct transcriptional effect depending on ER alpha and histone deacetylases."

However, the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully delineated. This study demonstrates for the first time that CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), a member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, is induced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and is a potent enhancer of VDR transcription in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) was found to induce C/EBPalpha as well as VDR expression in MCF-7 cells. C/EBPalpha was not detected in MDA-MB-231 cells that are poorly responsive to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and induction of VDR were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with C/EBPalpha, and knockdown of C/EBPalpha suppressed VDR and antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in MCF-7 cells. Transfection of C/EBPalpha in MCF-7 cells resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of hVDR transcription. Our studies show that C/EBPalpha can bind to Brahma (Brm), an ATPase that is a component of the SWI/SNF complex, and cooperate with Brm in the regulation of hVDR transcription in MCF-7 cells. Because the levels of VDR in MCF-7 breast cancer cells correlate with the antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and because C/EBPalpha has been suggested as a potential tumor suppressor in breast cancer, these findings provide important mechanisms whereby 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) may act to inhibit growth of breast cancer cells. These findings also identify C/EBPalpha as a 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) target in breast cancer cells and provide evidence for C/EBPalpha as a candidate for breast cancer treatment."

Here, we identified as the most potent, P. ostreatus (oyster mushroom) which suppressed proliferation of breast cancer (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) and colon cancer (HT-29, HCT-116) cells, without affecting proliferation of epithelial mammary MCF-10A and normal colon FHC cells. Flow cytometry revealed that the inhibition of cell proliferation by P. ostreatus was associated with the cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in MCF-7 and HT-29 cells. Moreover, P. ostreatus induced the expression of the tumor suppressor p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1), whereas inhibited the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma Rb protein in MCF-7 cells. In addition, P. ostreatus also up-regulated expression of p21 and inhibited Rb phosphorylation in HT-29 cells, suggesting that that P. ostreatus suppresses the proliferation of breast and colon cancer cells via p53-dependent as well as p53-independent pathway. In conclusion, our results indicated that the edible oyster mushroom has potential therapeutic/preventive effects on breast and colon cancer."

Our previous study indicates that BMP-6 restores E-cadherin-mediated EMT through repressing deltaEF1 in breast cancer. However, the mechanism by which BMP-6 regulates deltaEF1 expression remains unclear. In this study, we confirmed the significant role of BMP-6 in inhibiting MDA-MB-231 migration through decreasing deltaEF1 expression which subsequently relieves deltaEF1-mediated invasion. The inhibitory effect of BMP-6 through deltaEF1 regulation was supported by an inverse correlation of BMP-6/miR-192 and deltaEF1 expressions observed in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells and clinical tumor specimens. Moreover, BMP-6 treatment or miR-192 transfection decreased the reporter activity of the deltaEF1 3'-UTR-luc, validating that deltaEF1 is a target of miR-192. Meanwhile, we also found that BMP-6 acted as a potent transcriptional repressor of the human deltaEF1 promoter. Mutation of the AP-1 binding site on this promoter abolished BMP-6-induced transrepression of deltaEF1. Depletion of BMP-6 expression by RNAi resulted in a significant increase in the promoter activity of deltaEF1. Our study has provided novel findings of a dual mechanism for BMP-6-regulated deltaEF1 expression in breast cancer cells, involving cross-talks between AP-1-mediated transcriptional repression and miRs-mediated translational inhibition."

Tumor cells infected with Adeno-hTERT-E1A expressed dramatically higher levels of E1A oncoprotein, underwent enhanced lysis, and displayed an earlier and higher apoptotic index than cells infected with ONYX-015. Despite the increase in virus-induced apoptotic death, Adeno-hTERT-E1A replicated and produced functional progeny leading to viral spread, but with reduced efficiency compared with ONYX-015, in particular in A549 cells. Virus-induced E1A expression, host cell apoptosis, viral hexon protein production, and DNA synthesis were markedly reduced in primary human hepatocytes after infection with Adeno-hTERT-E1A as compared with ONYX-015. The strong oncolytic activity of Adeno-hTERT-E1A in tumor cell culture translated into superior antitumor activity in vivo in an MDA-MB-231 solid tumor xenograft model.

We will refer to them as upstream cancer-progression determinants (UCPDs, for brevity). MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-11, MMP-13, MMP-14, MMP-16, and MMP-19 are enhancers of cancer cell invasiveness and other traits of cancer progression, in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We are interested in pathway links from UCPDs to gene expression of cancer cell MMPs in MDA-MB-231 cells. To test models about these links, wild-type copies of UCPDs were transiently overexpressed and then MMP mRNAs were measured by reverse transcription real-time PCR. The present results show that each of eight UCPDs is linked to the gene expression of a unique set of MMPs. This indicates that the effects are sequence-specific and that each UCPD reaches these MMP expressions through different sets of signaling pathways. We have detected 20 new pathway links, 11 are downregulatory and nine are upregulatory; 15 are new links in any cell, and five are new links in breast cancer. In seven links, three cancer-progression suppressing UCPDs unexpectedly enhance the gene expression of five cancer-progression promoting MMPs."

To develop such an expression vector, we searched for genes over-expressed and/or specifically expressed in cancer cells using bioinformatics and have selected genes coding for protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1) and ribonuclease reductase 2 (RRM2) as candidates. Their cancer-specific expressions were confirmed in both breast cancer cell lines and patient tissues. We compared each promoter's cancer-specific activity in the breast normal and cancer cell lines using the luciferase gene as a reporter and confirmed cancer-specific expression of both PRC1 and RRM2 promoters. To test activities of these promoters in viral vectors, the promoters were also cloned into an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector containing green fluorescence protein (GFP) as the reporter. The GFP expression levels by these promoters were various depending on cell lines tested and, in MDA-MB-231 cells, GFP activities derived from the PRC1 and RRM2 promoters were as strong as that from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Our result showed that a vector containing the PRC1 or RRM2 promoter could be used for breast cancer specific overexpression in gene therapy."

Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of these compounds employing an MTT assay and inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells demonstrated that compound 3, the most active of the series, proved to be only slightly less potent than proscillaridin A. We evaluated the effects of these compounds 1-3 on change in intracellular Ca2+, appearance of apoptosis, inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I and II, and the activity of caspase-3 in breast cancer cells. These studies indicate that the increase in potency for 3 may be related, in part, to an activation of caspase-3, increasing free calcium concentration and topoisomerase II inhibition. All these data emphasize the potential usefulness of these derivatives of cardiac glycosides as anticancer agents."

In this study, constitutive expression of ZmPP2C in Arabidopsis thaliana under the control of the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter decreased plant tolerance to salt and drought during seed germination and vegetative growth. When growing on media with NaCl or mannitol, the ZmPP2C-overexpressed plants displayed more severe damages, with weaker growth phenotypes corresponding to a series of physiological changes: lower net photosynthesis rate (Pn) and free proline content, higher malondialdehyde (MDA) level, higher relative membrane permeability (RMP), and water loss. Under these stress conditions, they also showed decreased transcription of the stress-related genes RD29A, RD29B, P5CS1, and P5CS2, and ABA-related genes ABI1 and ABI2. Further, the transgenic plants became less sensitive to abscisic acid (ABA). ZmPP2C over-expression significantly attenuated ABA inhibition on seed germination and root growth of the transgenic plants. These results demonstrate that ZmPP2C is involved in plant stress signal transduction, and ZmPP2C gene over-expression in Arabidopsis thaliana may be exploited to study its potential roles in stress-induced signaling pathway."

However, it was not investigated how this important oncogene is regulated. We show that MSP promotes invasion of MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 but not MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western analysis indicated the expression of RON message and protein, respectively, in MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 cells but not in MCF-7 cells. RON expression correlated with Sp1 expression. Initial analysis of a 1.2-kb and 400-bp RON promoter in MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 468 cells suggested the presence of all the necessary regulatory elements within 400 bp from the transcription start site. Site-directed mutagenesis of the 400-bp RON promoter revealed that the overlapping Sp1 sites at-94 (Sp1-3/4) and Sp1 site at -113 (Sp1-5) are essential for RON gene transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that Sp1 binding to these sites is required for RON promoter activity. Ectopic Sp1 expression in Sp1 null SL2 cells confirmed the involvement of these Sp1 sites in the regulation of oncogenic RON tyrosine kinase. Treatment of MDA MB 231 cells with mithramycin A, an inhibitor of Sp1 binding, or siRNA knock-down of Sp1 blocked RON gene expression and MSP-mediated invasion of MDA MB 231 cells.

However, difficulties in obtaining sufficient amount of bacterial and cellular DNA extracted from the same human biopsy specimens is often a limiting factor. In this study, total DNA (host and bacterial DNA) was isolated from minute amounts of gastric biopsy specimens and amplified by means of whole genome amplification using the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) technique. Subsequently, MDA-DNA was used for concurrent Helicobacter pylori and human host cellular DNA genotyping analysis using PCR-based methods.RESULTS: Total DNA was isolated from gastric biopsy specimens of 12 subjects with gastritis and 16 control subjects having a normal mucosa. The DNA was amplified using a multiple displacement amplification (MDA) kit. Next, concurrent genotyping was performed using H. pylori-specific virulence gene PCR amplification assays, pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rDNA and PCR characterisation of various host genes. This includes Interleukin 1-beta (IL1B) and Interferon-gamma receptor (IFNGR1) SNP analysis, and Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) variable tandem repeats (VNTR) in intron 2. Finally, regions of the vacA-gene were PCR amplified using M13-sequence tagged primers which allowed for direct DNA sequencing, omitting cloning of PCR amplicons. H. pylori specific multiplex PCR assays revealed the presence of H. pylori cagA and vacA genotypic variations in 11 of 12 gastritis biopsy specimens. Using pyrosequencing, 16S rDNA variable V3 region signatures of H. pylori were found in 11 of 12 individuals with gastritis, but in none of the control subjects. Similarly, IL1B and IFNGR1-SNP and IL1RN-VNTR patterns could be established in all individuals. Furthermore, sequencing of M13-sequence tagged vacA-PCR amplicons revealed the presence of highly diverse H. pylori vacA-s/i/m regions.CONCLUSION: The PCR-based molecular typing methods applied, using MDA-amplified DNA derived from small amounts of gastric biopsy specimens, enabled a rapid and concurrent molecular analysis of bacterial and host genes in the same biopsy specimen. The principles and technologies used in this study could also be applied to any situation in which human host and microbial genes of interest in microbial-host interactions would need to be sequenced."

The NblA protein (approximately 6 kDa) has been identified as an essential component in this process. We have used structural, biochemical, and genetic methods to obtain molecular details on the mode of action of the NblA protein. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the NblA protein from both the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus and the mesophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus sp. PCC 7942. The NblA monomer has a helix-loop-helix motif which dimerizes into an open, four-helical bundle, identical to the previously determined NblA structure from Anabaena. Previous studies indicated that mutations to NblA residues near the C terminus impaired its binding to phycobilisome proteins in vitro, whereas the only mutation known to affect NblA function in vivo is located near the protein N terminus. We performed random mutagenesis of the S. elongatus nblA gene which enabled the identification of four additional amino acids crucial for NblA function in vivo. This data shows that essential amino acids are not confined to the protein termini. We also show that expression of the Anabaena nblA gene complements phycobilisome degradation in an S. elongatus NblA-null mutant despite the low homology between NblAs of these cyanobacteria. We propose that the NblA interacts with the phycobilisome via &quot;structural mimicry&quot; due to similarity in structural motifs found in all phycobiliproteins. This suggestion leads to a new model for the mode of NblA action which involves the entire NblA protein."

Although Na-solute cotransport has been shown to exist in the brush border membrane (BBM) of the absorptive villus cells, the identity of Na-glutamine cotransport in rabbit small intestinal villus cells was unknown. Na-dependent glutamine uptake is present in villus BBM vesicles. An intravesicular proton gradient did not stimulate this Na-dependent glutamine uptake, whereas Li+ did not significantly suppress this uptake. These observations in concert with amino acid substitution studies suggested that Na-glutamine cotransporter in the villus cell BBM was the newly identified cotransporter B0AT1 (SLC6A19). Quantitative real-time PCR identified the message for this cotransporter in villus cells. Thus a full-length cDNA of B0AT1 was cloned and expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells. This expressed cotransporter exhibited characteristics similar to those observed in villus cells from the rabbit small intestine. Antibody was generated for B0AT1 that demonstrated the presence of this cotransporter protein in the villus cell BBM. Kinetic studies defined the kinetic parameters of this cotransporter. Thus this study describes the identification, cloning, and characterization of the Na-amino acid cotransporter responsible for the assimilation of a critical amino acid by the absorptive villus cells in the mammalian small intestine."

Both cell lines have multiple chromosome aberrations, but differ in the types of rearrangements and their breakpoints. The MDA-MB-468 karyotype identified in the present study differs from that previously reported, which suggests that this cell line is unstable. Neither cell line exhibited amplification of ERBB2 (alias HER-2) by FISH. MDA-MB-468 cells have a modal number of 60, with 42 types of aberrations: 11 numerical and 31 structural. 468LN cells have a modal number of 55, with 37 types of aberrations: 10 numerical and 27 structural.

Here, we present a summary of a DNA microarray-based study that identified the genes that are up- and down-regulated in a human MDA-361 pLKO control clone and three clones expressing short hairpin RNA against three different regions of DCD mRNA. A list of 235 genes was differentially expressed among independent clones (&gt; 3-fold change and p &lt; 0.005). The gene expression of 208 was reduced and of 27 was increased in the three DCD-RNAi clones compared to pLKO control clone. The expression of 77 genes (37%) encoding for enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, glucose metabolism and oxidoreductase activity and several genes required for cell survival and DNA repair were decreased. The expression of EGFR/ErbB-1 gene, an important predictor of outcome in breast cancer, was reduced together with the genes for betacellulin and amphiregulin, two known ligands of EGFR/ErbB receptors. Many of the 27 genes up-regulated by DCD-RNAi expression have not yet been fully characterized; among those with known function, we identified the calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II delta and calcineurin A alpha. We compared 132 up-regulated and 12 down-regulated genes in our dataset with those genes up- and down-regulated by inhibitors targeting various signaling pathway components. The analysis showed that the genes in the DCD pathway are aligned with those functionally influenced by the drugs sirolimus, LY-294002 and wortmannin. Therefore, DCD may exert its function by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Together, these bioinformatic approaches suggest the involvement of DCD in the regulation of genes for breast cancer cell metabolism, proliferation and survival."

We designed a membrane lytic peptide cyclized with a linker cleavable by membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP). We showed that the cyclic peptide could be restored to the linear state on MT1-MMP digestion, and it preferentially killed MMP-overexpressing cells above a threshold concentration. Circular dichroism indicated that cyclization resulted in a more rigid structure, making it more difficult for the lytic peptide to transit from random coil to alpha-helix in a membrane-mimicking environment. Selective membrane activity of the cyclic peptide was shown by comparing cytotoxicity results on RBC and two human breast cancer cell lines of different malignancy and MT1-MMP expression: highly invasive MDA-MB-435 and noninvasive MCF-7. Above a concentration of 5 micromol/L, suppressed activity to MCF-7 and RBC was observed, whereas the toxicity against MDA-MB-435 was maintained.

We observed that the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 expressing transmembrane TNF-alpha (tmTNF-alpha) at high level was resistant to soluble TNF-alpha (sTNF-alpha)-induced cytotoxicity, accompanied by constitutive NF-kappaB activation. In contrast, MCF-7 cells expressing tmTNF-alpha at very low level were sensitive to sTNF-alpha-induced cell death and had no detectable NF-kappaB activation. Consistently, siRNA-mediated tmTNF-alpha knockdown blocked NF-kappaB activation and rendered MDA-MB-231 sensitive. To test our hypothesis that TNF-LS may play an important role in determining the sensitivity of tumor cells to sTNF-alpha, we stably transfected MCF-7 cells with TNF-LS. We found that transfection of TNF-LS or wild-type TNF-alpha containing LS constitutively activated NF-kappaB and conferred the cytotoxic resistance of MCF-7 cells, while transfection of a mutant tmTNF-alpha lacking the cytoplasmic segment of LS neither activated NF-kappaB nor affected the sensitivity. However, NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC suppressed NF-kappaB activation and reconstituted sensitivity of TNF-LS/MCF-7 cells. To check whether TNF-LS is required to be cleaved or internalized for NF-kappaB activation to occur, we used signal peptide peptidase inhibitor (Z-LL)(2)-ketone and receptor internalization inhibitor MDC to treat cells. Interestingly, both inhibitors increased TNF-LS expression on the cell surface and enhanced NF-kappaB activation. These results indicate that membrane-anchored TNF-LS contributes to constitutive activation of NF-kappaB and resistance to sTNF-alpha-induced cell death. Therefore, TNF-LS appears to be responsible for tmTNF-alpha-induced resistance in the breast cancer cells."

Chronic alcohol administration resulted in significantly increase in the levels of transaminase (AST and ALT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) but decrease of glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the serum and liver. Hepatic triglyceride (TG) also increased. When mice ingested high doses of SP (0.75 and 1.50 g/kg b.w.) the levels of antioxidant enzymes in the serum were restored to normal. However, hepatic CAT and GSH were still below normal, although a trend of significant increases was observed in comparison with alcohol treatment group.CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that SP was able to hasten the alcohol elimination through urine directly and enhance the ethanol oxidation rate in liver. Simultaneously, SP may exert a protective effect against lipid peroxidation by scavenging reactive oxygen species and elevating the activity of antioxidant enzymes, in consequence prevented the peroxidative deterioration of structural lipids in membranous organelles, especially mitochondria and karyon."

The purposes of this study were to investigate whether Pacl inhibits the expression of HSP27 in breast cancer cells, whether Pacl can sensitize breast cancer cells with HSP27 overexpression to Dox, and to define a more effective schedule for the combination of Dox with Pacl.METHODS: The HSP27 high-expressing human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435, and the HSP27 low-expressing cell line, MDA-MB-231, were used in this study. The level of HSP27, topoisomerase (Topo) IIalpha and beta expression were assessed by Western blotting. The cytotoxic activities of Dox, Pacl and combination of these two drugs were evaluated by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and flow cytometric assays.RESULTS: Pacl (0.1 micromol/L) inhibited HSP27 expression by approximately 2-fold in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 cells, while up-regulating the level of topo IIalpha and beta. In contrast, expression of HSP27 in MDA-MB-231 did not change significantly following Pacl treatment. There were synergistic effects in both treatment sequences (Pacl-Dox and Dox-Pacl) when Pacl was combined with Dox. Compared with those treated with the Dox-Pacl sequence, the Pacl-Dox sequence had a stronger effect in cancer cells with HSP27 overexpression, as MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 treated with the Pacl-Dox sequence had lower viabilities and a higher apoptotic rate.CONCLUSIONS: Paclitaxel significantly decreases the level of HSP27 in breast cancer cells overexpressing HSP27.

Present study revealed that Phalaenopsis flower undergo senescence due to over activation of O(2) (.-)generating xanthine oxidase (XO), which consequently increases the concentrations of O(2) (.-) leading to enhanced oxidative damage and disturbed cellular redox environment as indicated by increased lipid peroxidation and DHA/AsA + DHA ratio, respectively. While activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and non-specific peroxidase (POD) were enhanced in sepals and petals of old flower, activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) were decreased. Exogenous application of nitric oxide (NO) retarded H(2)O(2)-induced senescence of Phalaenopsis flower by downregulating activity of XO and concentrations of O(2) (.-), H(2)O(2) and malondialdehyde (MDA, an index of lipid peroxidation). Exogenous application of NO also downregulated SOD activity and upregulated antioxidant enzymes involved in the detoxification of H(2)O(2) (CAT and APX), and in the regulation of redox couples viz, monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and GR, together with the modulation in non-protein thiol status and DHA/AsA + DHA ratio."

To initiate signaling, pro-HGF must be proteolytically activated to reveal a secondary Met binding site within the serine protease-like beta-chain of HGF. Although HGF/Met is a large complex, we sought to discover relatively small antagonists that might interfere with this critical Met binding region. Pools of disulfide-constrained random peptide libraries displayed on phage were selected for binding to HGF, ultimately resulting in a disulfide-constrained 15-mer peptide (VNWVCFRDVGCDWVL) termed HB10, which bound to the recombinant human HGF beta-chain (HGF beta) and competitively inhibited binding to Met with an IC(50) of 450 nM. In MDA-MB435 cells, HB10 reduced HGF-dependent Met phosphorylation by 70%, and phosphorylation of downstream kinases AKT and ERK1/ERK2 by 74% and 69%, respectively. Addition of HB10 also inhibited HGF-dependent migration of these cells with an IC(50) of approximately 20 microM. The 2D (1)H-NMR structure of HB10 revealed a beta-hairpin loop stabilized by the disulfide bond and cross-strand pairing of Trp3 and Trp13. HGF beta mutants deficient in Met binding also have reduced HB10 binding, suggesting an overlapping binding site. Notably HB10 did not inhibit full length HGF binding to Met. Thus steric hindrance of the interaction between HGF beta domain binding to Met is sufficient for inhibiting full-length HGF-dependent Met signaling and cell migration that is consistent with a noncompetitive inhibitory mechanism of Met signal transduction."

We determined that the enzyme also is a target of the structurally-related triterpene glycoside actein, present in the herb black cohosh. Actein's inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase activity was less potent than that of digitoxin, but actein potentiated digitoxin's inhibitory effect on Na+-K+-ATPase activity and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cell growth. We observed different degrees of signal amplification for the two compounds. Actein's inhibitory effect on ATPase activity was amplified 2-fold for cell growth inhibition, whereas digitoxin's signal was amplified 20-fold. Actein induced a biphasic response in proteins downstream of ATPase: low dose and short duration of treatment upregulated NF-kappaB promoter activity, p-ERK, p-Akt and cyclin D1 protein levels, whereas higher doses and longer exposure inhibited these activities. Actein and digitoxin may be a useful synergistic combination for cancer chemoprevention and/or therapy."

The beacon contains a single-stranded oligonucleotide linker that forms a stem-loop structure (hairpin) in which the sequence is an antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ON) complementary to a target mRNA. The stem is formed by the annealing of two complementary arm sequences that are on either side of the loop sequence. A photosensitizer molecule (PS) is attached to the end of one arm and a quencher (Q) is similarly attached to the other end. The conformationally-restricted hairpin forces Q to efficiently silence the photoreactivity of PS. In the presence of target mRNA, the hairpin opens and the PS is no longer silenced. Upon irradiating with light, the PS then emits fluorescence and generates cytotoxic (1)O(2). To show proof of concept, we have synthesized a c-raf-1 mRNA-triggered PMB using pyropheophorbide (Pyro) as PS, carotenoid as Q and c-raf-1 mRNA-targeted AS-ON as the loop sequence. We show that the (1)O(2) production of Pyro is quenched in its native state by 15-fold and is restored 9-fold by the addition of the target RNA. Comparing this to our recently reported self-folding peptide linker-based PMB, the hairpin effect results in an enhanced (1)O(2) quenching efficiency that decreases the residual (1)O(2) production by over 3-fold, thus providing enhanced control of (1)O(2) production upon target-linker interactions. When incubated with c-raf-1 expressing MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, the PMB displayed efficient cellular uptake and subsequently effective PDT activation in targeted cells."

On the basis of the amino acid sequence similarity and conserved residues, it is suggested that SPD1 is a member of the plant defensin family. Recombinant SPD1 protein overproduced in Escherichia coli was purified by Ni (2+)-chelated affinity chromatography. A recombinant protein from the storage root cDNA clone effectively inhibited the trypsin activity in a dose-dependent manner. Both the corresponding mRNA and protein level were found to be highest in the storage roots, followed by sprout. SPD1 reduced dehydroascorbate (DHA) in the presence of glutathione to regenerate l-ascorbic acid (AsA). However, without glutathione, SPD1 has very low DHA reductase activity, and AsA was oxidized by AsA oxidase to generate monodehydroascorbate (MDA) free radical. MDA was also reduced by SPD1 to AsA in the presence of NADH, mimicking the MDA reductase catalyzed reaction. These data suggest that SPD1 has both DHA reductase and MDA reductase activities. SPD1 was also shown to inhibit the growth of both fungi and bacteria. SPD1 is apparently the first reported plant defensin exhibiting DHA and MDA activities in vitro."

The ectodomain of human E-cadherin contains four potential N-glycosylation sites at Asn residues 554, 566, 618, and 633. We investigated the role of E-cadherin N-glycosylation in cell cycle progression by site-directed mutagenesis. We showed previously that all four potential N-glycosylation sites of E-cadherin were N-glycosylated in human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-435 cells. Removal of N-glycan at Asn633 dramatically affected E-cadherin stability. In this study we showed that E-cadherin mutant missing N-glycans at Asn554, Asn566 and Asn618 failed to induce cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and to suppress cell proliferation in comparison with wild-type E-cadherin. Moreover, N-glycans at Asn554 and Asn566, but not at Asn618, seemed to be indispensable for E-cadherin-mediated suppression of cell cycle progression. Removal of N-glycans at either Asn554 or Asn566 of E-cadherin was accompanied with the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase signaling pathway. After treatment with PD98059, an inhibitor of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase signaling pathway, wild-type E-cadherin transfected MDA-MB-435 and E-cadherin N-glycosylation-deficient mutant transfected MDA-MB-435 cells had equivalent numbers of cells in G1 phase.

An imbalance between these cathepsins and their endogenous inhibitors, the cystatins, has been associated with development of the metastatic phenotype. Accordingly, many studies have indicated potential use of cystatins in therapeutic approaches. We report a novel cystatin from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), CaneCPI-4, with strong inhibitory activity against cathepsins B (K(i) = 0.83 nM) and L (K(i) = 0.021 nM). The invasive ability of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells expressing CaneCPI-4 was only slightly decreased. In contrast, addition of low, non-toxic concentrations of recombinant His-tagged CaneCPI-4 significantly reduced invasion through a Matrigel matrix. Immunoblot analyses failed to detect the recombinant protein inside cells, indicating that the cystatin was not internalized by endocytosis, but exerted its anti-invasive effect mainly through inhibition of extracellular cathepsins. Our findings open the possibility of considering phytocystatins for anti-cancer strategies."

To determine functionality, MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells were stimulated with ethanol, known to open GIRK channels. Decreased GIRK1 protein levels were seen after treatment with 0.12% ethanol. In addition, serum-free media completely inhibited GIRK1 protein expression. This data indicates that there are functional GIRK channels in breast cancer cells and that these channels are involved in cellular signaling. In the present research, to further define the signaling pathways involved, we performed RNA interference (siRNA) studies. Three stealth siRNA constructs were made starting at bases 1104, 1315, and 1490 of the GIRK1 sequence. These constructs were transfected into MDA-MB-453 cells, and both RNA and protein were isolated. GIRK1, β(2)-adrenergic and 18S control levels were determined using real-time PCR 24 hours after transfection. All three constructs decreased GIRK1 mRNA levels. However, β(2) mRNA levels were unchanged by the GIRK1 knockdown. GIRK1 protein levels were also reduced by the knockdown, and this knockdown led to decreases in beta-adrenergic, MAP kinase and Akt signaling."

Here, we describe a systematic study to investigate the effects of varying the amounts of two different average molar mass polymers on the DNA sequencing ability of poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (pDMA) sequencing matrices in microfluidic chips. Two polydisperse samples of pDMA, with weight-average molar masses of 3.5 MDa and 770 kDa, were mixed at various fractional concentrations while maintaining the overall polymer concentration at 5% w/v. We show that although the separation of short DNA fragments depends strongly on the overall solution concentration of the polymer, inclusion of the high-molar mass polymer is essential to achieve read lengths of interest (&gt;400 bases) for many sequencing applications. Our results also show that one of the blended matrices, comprised of 3% 3.5 MDa pDMA and 2% 770 kDa pDMA, yields similar sequencing read lengths (&gt;520 bases on average) to the high-molar mass matrix alone, while also providing a fivefold reduction in zero-shear viscosity. These results indicate that the long read lengths achieved in a viscous, high-molar mass polymer matrix are also possible to achieve in a tuned, blended matrix of high- and low-molar mass polymers with a much lower overall solution viscosity."

Therefore, TGF-beta signaling has emerged as an attractive target for the development of new cancer therapeutics. In a search for metabolites from fungi inhibiting the TGF-beta dependent expression of a reporter gene in HepG2 cells, we found that trichodimerol, a previously isolated bisorbicillinoid, inhibited serine phosphorylation of the TGF-beta activated Smad2/3 transcription factors and antagonized the cellular effects of TGF-beta including reporter gene activation and expression of TGF-beta inducible genes in HepG2 and MDA-MB-231 cells.

However, it is unknown which YB-1 activity is required for this resistance. To identify the mechanism(s) by which nuclear YB-1 confers cisplatin resistance, we generated several YB-1 mutants and tested their impact on resistance in the mammary tumor cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. Transfection of wild type YB-1 bestowed cisplatin resistance in such cells but a mutant YB-1 with a point mutation at position 175 (YB-1(E175A)) did not. A truncated YB-1(1-205) increased cisplatin resistance above the levels conferred by wild type YB-1. The truncated YB-1(1-205) has intact nuclease activities but could not separate a DNA duplex containing a Y-box sequence (activities associated with DNA repair). Moreover, this truncated YB-1(1-205) did not alter splicing of the adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA minigene as it had low binding affinity for several splicing factors. In contrast, the mutant YB-1(E175A) protein behaved like wild type YB-1 regarding all these activities but yet did not confer cisplatin resistance. Finally, transfection of mutant YB-1(E175A) had low impact on overall transcription. The wild type and truncated YB-1(1-205) induced important but different alterations in gene expression as revealed by microarray analyses. Our results indicate that the splicing and the nuclease activities associated with YB-1 have minor impact on cisplatin resistance.

Transient expression of the chimeric therapeutic gene in breast and prostate cancer cell lines resulted in efficient cell death under hypoxia-mimetic conditions. Stable MDA-MB-435 cells expressing the chimeric therapeutic gene under 1% O2 showed an increase in stable HIF-1alpha protein levels and synthesis of the endonuclease G protein in a time-dependent manner. In normoxic conditions, these stable transgenic cells exhibited no change in growth rate, invasion and motility when compared to parental cells. Moreover, xenografts generated using the transgenic cells exhibited highly significant suppression of tumor growth in a preclinical cancer model compared to the parental cell line. Thus, the hypoxia-modulated endonuclease G expression has the potential to be used as a gene-based-therapy system to kill malignant cells within hypoxic regions of tumors."

Here, we report that Gsc is post-translationally modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier proteins (SUMO). Members of the PIAS family of proteins enhance Gsc sumoylation and this modification occurs on at least six lysine residues. Stable expression of a SUMO-defective Gsc mutant (Gsc 6Km) in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells results in morphological changes giving rise to cells with increased cell area. We demonstrate that Gsc 6Km can effectively repress Foxh1-mediated induction of the Mixl1 promoter, indicating that sumoylation is not required for Gsc-mediated repression of promoters where recruitment occurs through Foxh1. In contrast, Gsc 6Km exhibits a decreased ability to repress the induction of promoters to which it is directly recruited through paired-homeodomain binding sites, including its own promoter and that of the Xenopus Brachyury gene. Taken together, our data suggests that regulation of Gsc repressive activity by SUMO modification is promoter specific and may serve to differentially regulate genes that function to control cell morphology during early development and cancer."

In general, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers have a better prognosis and are often more responsive to anti-estrogen therapy. Unfortunately, ER-negative breast cancers are more aggressive and unresponsive to anti-estrogens. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and methotrexate (MTX) combination to determine the most effective regimen considering the mechanism of action in treating ER-negative human breast cancer cells and at the same time mitigating methotrexate cytotoxicity in human bone marrow cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to determine the sequence-dependent interaction between MTX and 5-FU on proliferation, cell viability was carried out using the Quick Cell Proliferation Assay by exposing the human estrogen negative (MDA-MB-436 and Hs-578T) and bone marrow (HS-5) cells to: (i) MTX and 5-FU alon; (ii) MTX 2 h prior to 5-FU (MTX/5-FU; (iii) 5-FU 2 h prior to MTX (5-FU/MTX).RESULTS: The growth rate in MDA-MB-436 was 23.5 +/- 3.98%, in Hs-578T 30 +/- 5.9% and HS-5 32 +/- 3.1% of the control for MTX/5-FU.

The later combination exhibits significant protection against MTX cytotoxicity in bone marrow and at same time maintained maximum cytotoxicity in estrogen negative breast cancer cell lines. The findings were further supported by cell flow cytometry, apoptosis and Western blot analysis data.CONCLUSION: The combination of 5-FU/MTX effectively maintains the maximum inhibitory effect of MTX in ER-negative breast cancer and protects against MTX cytotoxicity in human bone marrow."

This study examined whether miR-206, previously shown to be elevated in estrogen receptor (ER)alpha-negative breast cancer, regulates the expression of ERalpha. Two putative miR-206 sites, (hERalpha1 and hERalpha2), were found in silico within the 3'-untranslated region of human ERalpha mRNA. Transfection of MCF-7 cells with pre-miR-206 or 2'-O-methyl antagomiR-206 specifically decreased or increased, respectively, ERalpha mRNA levels. Overexpression of pre-miR-206 reduced ERalpha and beta-actin protein levels, with no effect on ERbeta, E-cadherin, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Reporter constructs containing the hERalpha1 or hERalpha2 binding sites inserted into the 3'-untranslated region of the luciferase mRNA conferred a 1.6- and 2.2-fold repression of luciferase activity, respectively, in HeLa cells. Both miR-206 sites responded accordingly to exogenous hsa-pre-miR-206 and 2'-O-methyl antagomiR-206, and both sites were rendered inactive by mutations that disrupted hybridization to the 5'-seed of miR-206. A C--&gt;T single nucleotide polymorphism in the hERalpha1 site increased repression of luciferase activity to approximately 3.3-fold in HeLa cells. MiR-206 levels were higher in ERalpha-negative MB-MDA-231 cells than ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cells, but only the ERalpha1 site mediated significantly more repression in reporter constructs. MiR-206 expression was strongly inhibited by ERalpha agonists, but not by an ERbeta agonist or progesterone, indicating a mutually inhibitory feedback loop. These findings provide the first evidence for the posttranscriptional regulation of ERalpha by a micro-RNA in the context of breast cancer."

To understand the basis for metastasis, we systematically selected for highly invasive cells from breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-453, with moderate to low invasive ability using Boyden chamber invasion assay. The four-cycle selected invasive lines, named MCF7-I4 and MDA-MB-453-I4, respectively, displayed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and dramatically enhanced invasive ability. EMT changes were corroborated with decreased level of E-cadherin and increased vimentin, fibronectin, and beta(1) integrin. Twist, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and AKT2, a known proto-oncogene, were found to be elevated in the invasive cells compared with the parental. Ectopic expression and knockdown of Twist by short interference RNA resulted in significant increase and reduction, respectively, of AKT2 protein and mRNA expression. Twist bound to E-box elements on AKT2 promoter and enhanced its transcriptional activity. Moreover, silencing AKT2 decreased Twist-promoted migration, invasion, and paclitaxel resistance. Reintroducing AKT2 largely rescued the phenotype resulted from knockdown of Twist in I4 cells, suggesting that AKT2 is a downstream target and functional mediator of Twist. Finally, we observed a 68.8% correlation of elevated Twist and AKT2 expression in late-stage breast cancers as oppose to 13% in early-stage breast cancers. Our study identifies Twist as a positive transcriptional regulator of AKT2 expression, and Twist-AKT2 signaling is involved in promoting invasive ability and survival of breast cancer cells."

We report results from the direct analysis of multiple genes in individual marine bacteria cells, demonstrating the potential for high-throughput metabolic assignment of yet-uncultured taxa. The protocol uses high-speed fluorescence-activated cell sorting, whole-genome multiple displacement amplification (MDA), and subsequent PCR screening. A pilot library of 11 single amplified genomes (SAGs) was constructed from Gulf of Maine bacterioplankton as proof of concept. The library consisted of five flavobacteria, one sphingobacterium, four alphaproteobacteria, and one gammaproteobacterium. Most of the SAGs, apart from alphaproteobacteria, were phylogenetically distant from existing isolates, with 88-97% identity in the 16S rRNA gene sequence. Thus, single-cell MDA provided access to the genomic material of numerically dominant but yet-uncultured taxonomic groups. Two of five flavobacteria in the SAG library contained proteorhodopsin genes, suggesting that flavobacteria are among the major carriers of this photometabolic system. The pufM and nasA genes were detected in some 100-cell MDA products but not in SAGs, demonstrating that organisms containing bacteriochlorophyll and assimilative nitrate reductase constituted &lt;1% of the sampled bacterioplankton. Compared with metagenomics, the power of our approach lies in the ability to detect metabolic genes in uncultured microorganisms directly, even when the metabolic and phylogenetic markers are located far apart on the chromosome."

These were also characterized by gene expression analysis and found to represent all five recently described breast cancer subtypes using the &quot;intrinsic gene set&quot; and centroid correlation. Three cell lines, HCC1937 and L56BrC1 derived from BRCA1 mutation carriers and MDA-MB-231, were of basal-like subtype and characterized by a high frequency of low-level gains and losses of typical pattern, including limited deletions on 5q. Four estrogen receptor positive cell lines were of luminal A subtype and characterized by a different pattern of aberrations and high-level amplifications, including ERBB2 and other 17q amplicons in BT474 and MDA-MB-361. SK-BR-3 cells, characterized by a complex genome including ERBB2 amplification, massive high-level amplifications on 8q and a homozygous deletion of CDH1 at 16q22, had an expression signature closest to luminal B subtype. The effects of gene amplifications were verified by gene expression analysis to distinguish targeted genes from silent amplicon passengers. JIMT1, derived from an ERBB2 amplified trastuzumab resistant tumor, was of the ERBB2 subtype. Homozygous deletions included other known targets such as PTEN (HCC1937) and CDKN2A (MDA-MB-231, MCF10A), but also new candidate suppressor genes such as FUSSEL18 (HCC1937) and WDR11 (L56Br-C1) as well as regions without known genes.

However, whether there are EGFR signalling pathways specifically used for tumour invasion still remains elusive. Overexpression of Arf6 and its effector, AMAP1, correlates with and is crucial for the invasive phenotypes of different breast cancer cells. Here we identify the mechanism by which Arf6 is activated to induce tumour invasion. We found that GEP100/BRAG2, a guanine nucleotide exchanging factor (GEF) for Arf6, is responsible for the invasive activity of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, whereas the other ArfGEFs are not. GEP100, through its pleckstrin homology domain, bound directly to Tyr1068/1086-phosphorylated EGFR to activate Arf6. Overexpression of GEP100, together with Arf6, caused non-invasive MCF7 cells to become invasive, which was dependent on EGF stimulation. Moreover, GEP100 knockdown blocked tumour metastasis. GEP100 was expressed in 70% of primary breast ductal carcinomas, and was preferentially co-expressed with EGFR in the malignant cases. Our results indicate that GEP100 links EGFR signalling to Arf6 activation to induce invasive activities of some breast cancer cells, and hence may contribute to their metastasis and malignancy."

Sufficient DNA for sequencing can be obtained from one cell by the Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) method, thereby eliminating the need to develop culture methods. Here we used a microfluidic device to isolate individual Escherichia coli and amplify genomic DNA by MDA in 60-nl reactions. Our results confirm a report that reduced MDA reaction volume lowers nonspecific synthesis that can result from contaminant DNA templates and unfavourable interaction between primers. The quality of the genome amplification was assessed by qPCR and compared favourably to single-cell amplifications performed in standard 50-microl volumes. Amplification bias was greatly reduced in nanoliter volumes, thereby providing a more even representation of all sequences. Single-cell amplicons from both microliter and nanoliter volumes provided high-quality sequence data by high-throughput pyrosequencing, thereby demonstrating a straightforward route to sequencing genomes from single cells."
"17430586";"MDA";"MDA AND (sequence OR sequencing) AND (RNA OR DNA OR Protein) ";"BMC biotechnology";49;2007;"Mechanism of chimera formation during the Multiple Displacement Amplification reaction.";"BACKGROUND: Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) is a method used for amplifying limiting DNA sources. The high molecular weight amplified DNA is ideal for DNA library construction. While this has enabled genomic sequencing from one or a few cells of unculturable microorganisms, the process is complicated by the tendency of MDA to generate chimeric DNA rearrangements in the amplified DNA. Determining the source of the DNA rearrangements would be an important step towards reducing or eliminating them.RESULTS: Here, we characterize the major types of chimeras formed by carrying out an MDA whole genome amplification from a single E. coli cell and sequencing by the 454 Life Sciences method. Analysis of 475 chimeras revealed the predominant reaction mechanisms that create the DNA rearrangements. The highly branched DNA synthesized in MDA can assume many alternative secondary structures. DNA strands extended on an initial template can be displaced becoming available to prime on a second template creating the chimeras. Evidence supports a model in which branch migration can displace 3'-ends freeing them to prime on the new templates. More than 85% of the resulting DNA rearrangements were inverted sequences with intervening deletions that the model predicts. Intramolecular rearrangements were favored, with displaced 3'-ends reannealing to single stranded 5'-strands contained within the same branched DNA molecule. In over 70% of the chimeric junctions, the 3' termini had initiated priming at complimentary sequences of 2-21 nucleotides (nts) in the new templates.CONCLUSION: Formation of chimeras is an important limitation to the MDA method, particularly for whole genome sequencing. Identification of the mechanism for chimera formation provides new insight into the MDA reaction and suggests methods to reduce chimeras. The 454 sequencing approach used here will provide a rapid method to assess the utility of reaction modifications."

We found that (i) virus-induced signaling to IFN-beta depended predominantly on RIG-I (as opposed to mda-5) for both SeV infections, i.e., that RIG-I senses both pppRNAs and dsRNA without 5'-triphosphorylated ends, and (ii) it is the viral C protein (as opposed to V) that is primarily responsible for countering RIG-I-dependent signaling to IFN-beta. Nondefective SeV that cannot specifically express C proteins not only cannot prevent the effects of transfected poly(I-C) or (ppp)RNAs on IFN-beta activation but also synergistically enhances these effects. SeV-V(minus) infection, in contrast, behaves mostly like wt SeV and counteracts the effects of transfected poly(I-C) or (ppp)RNAs."

Virotherapy is a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer in which the replicating virus itself is the anticancer agent. However, the success of virotherapy has been limited due to inefficient virus delivery to the tumor site. The present study addresses the utility of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) as intermediate carriers for conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAds) to target metastatic breast cancer in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HMSC were transduced with CRAds. We used a SCID mouse xenograft model to examine the effects of systemically injected CRAd loaded hMSC or CRAd alone on the growth of MDA-MB-231 derived pulmonary metastases (experimental metastases model) in vivo and on overall survival.RESULTS: Intravenous injection of CRAd loaded hMSCs into mice with established MDA-MB-231 pulmonary metastatic disease homed to the tumor site and led to extended mouse survival compared to mice treated with CRAd alone.CONCLUSION: Injected hMSCs transduced with CRAds suppressed the growth of pulmonary metastases, presumably through viral amplification in the hMSCs. Thus, hMSCs may be an effective platform for the targeted delivery of CRAds to distant cancer sites such as metastatic breast cancer."

The cellular level of S1P is low and tightly regulated in a spatio-temporal manner through its synthesis catalyzed by two sphingosine kinases, denoted SphK1 and SphK2. Many stimuli activate and translocate SphK1 to the plasma membrane by mechanisms that are dependent on its phosphorylation. Much less is known about activation of SphK2. Here we demonstrate that epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as the protein kinase C activator, phorbol ester, induce rapid phosphorylation of hSphK2 which was markedly reduced by inhibition of MEK1/ERK pathway. Down-regulation of ERK1 blocked EGF-induced phosphorylation of SphK2. Recombinant ERK1 phosphorylated hSphK2 in vitro and increased its enzymatic activity. ERK1 also was found to be in a complex with hSphK2 in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that hSphK2 is phosphorylated on Ser-351 and Thr-578 by ERK1 and that phosphorylation of these residues is important for EGF-stimulated migration of MDA-MB-453 cells. These studies provide the first clues to the mechanism of agonist-mediated SphK2 activation and enhance understanding of the regulation of SphK2 activity by phosphorylation and its role in movement of human breast cancer cells toward EGF."

Mutational analysis of Nm23-H1 revealed that substitution mutants P96S and S120G did not inhibit motility and invasion. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of Nm23-H1 motility suppression, expression microarray analysis of an MDA-MB-435 cancer cell line overexpressing wild-type Nm23-H1 was done and cross-compared with expression profiles from lines expressing the P96S and S120G mutants. Nine genes, MET, PTN, SMO, FZD1, L1CAM, MMP2, NETO2, CTGF, and EDG2, were down-regulated by wild-type but not by mutant Nm23-H1 expression. Reduced expression of these genes coincident with elevated Nm23-H1 expression was observed in human breast tumor cohorts, a panel of breast carcinoma cell lines, and hepatocellular carcinomas from control versus Nm23-M1 knockout mice. The functional significance of the down-regulated genes was assessed by transfection and in vitro motility assays. Only EDG2 overexpression significantly restored motility to Nm23-H1-suppressed cancer cells, enhancing motility by 60-fold in these cells. In addition, silencing EDG2 expression with small interfering RNA reduced the motile phenotype of metastatic breast cancer cells. These data suggest that Nm23-H1 suppresses metastasis, at least in part, through down-regulation of EDG2 expression."

MDA-MB-435 cells secrete very high levels of OPN. However metastasis-suppressed MDA-MB-435 cells, which were transfected with breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1), expressed significantly less OPN. BRMS1 is a member of mSin3-HDAC transcription co-repressor complex and has been shown to suppress the metastasis of breast cancer and melanoma cells in animal models. Hence we hypothesized that BRMS1 regulates OPN expression.RESULTS: The search for a BRMS1-regulated site on the OPN promoter, using luciferase reporter assays of the promoter deletions, identified a novel NF-kappaB site (OPN/NF-kappaB). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) confirmed this site to be an NF-kappaB-binding site. We also show a role of HDAC3 in suppression of OPN via OPN/NF-kappaB.CONCLUSION: Our results show that BRMS1 regulates OPN transcription by abrogating NF-kappaB activation. Thus, we identify OPN, a tumor-metastasis activator, as a crucial downstream target of BRMS1. Suppression of OPN may be one of the possible underlying mechanisms of BRMS1-dependent suppression of tumor metastasis."

We constitutively activated Notch signaling with intracellular domain (ICD) expression in the human adenocarcinoma line MDA-MB-231. Notch2 signaling increased apoptosis, whereas Notch4ICD (int3) significantly increased cell proliferation and growth. Cells with activated Notch2 or Notch4 were injected into nu/nu mice for analysis of in vivo tumor xenograft phenotype. Tumor growth was significantly altered depending on the receptor activated. Notch2ICD potently suppressed tumor take and growth, leading to a 60% decrease in tumors and significantly smaller, necrotic tumors. Despite this, Notch2ICD tumors were highly vascularized, although the vessels were smaller and comprised a more immature network compared with Notch4ICD tumors. Notch4ICD tumors were highly aggressive and well vascularized, indicating a role for Notch4 signaling in the promotion of the malignant phenotype in addition to its transforming ability. Although both NotchICD groups expressed angiogenic factors, Notch4ICD had selective vascular endothelial growth factor-D in both tumor and host stroma, suggesting a differential regulation of cytokines that may impact vascular recruitment and autocrine tumor signaling.

Expression of OPN is strongly correlated with poor prognosis in many different human cancers, suggesting an important but poorly understood role for this protein in tumorigenesis and metastasis. The protein exists in a number of different isoforms differing in the degree of post-translational modifications that are likely to exhibit different functional properties. This study examines for the first time the post-translational modifications of OPN from transformed cells and the effects of these modifications on cell biology. We have characterized the complete phosphorylation and glycosylation patterns of OPN expressed by murine ras-transformed fibroblasts (FbOPN) and differentiating osteoblasts (ObOPN) by a combination of mass spectrometric analyses and Edman degradation. Mass spectrometric analysis showed masses of 34.9 and 35.9 kDa for FbOPN and ObOPN, respectively. Enzymatic dephosphorylation, sequence, and mass analyses demonstrated that FbOPN contains approximately four phosphate groups distributed over 16 potential phosphorylation sites, whereas ObOPN contains approximately 21 phosphate groups distributed over 27 sites. Five residues are O-glycosylated in both isoforms. These residues are fully modified in FbOPN, whereas one site is partially glycosylated in ObOPN. Although both forms of OPN mediated robust integrin-mediated adhesion of mouse ras-transformed fibroblasts, the less phosphorylated FbOPN mediated binding of MDA-MD-435 human tumor cells almost 6-fold more than the heavy phosphorylated ObOPN. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the degree of phosphorylation of OPN produced by different cell types can regulate its function."

We used phosphoprotein and microarray analyses to carry out targeted pathway studies of phosphorylation and gene expression changes in human breast cancer cell lines in the presence or absence of lapatinib. Studies were done in four breast cancer cell lines, two of which were responsive and two of which were nonresponsive to lapatinib. Responsive cell lines, BT474 and SKBr3, constitutively overexpress ErbB2 and show an IC(50) of 25 or 32 nmol/L for lapatinib, respectively. In contrast, nonresponsive MDA-MB-468 and T47D cells expressed a low basal level of ErbB2 and showed IC(50) values in the micromolar range. Cells responsive to lapatinib exhibited strong differential effects on multiple genes in the AKT pathway. After 12 h of exposure to 1.0 micromol/L of lapatinib, AKT1, MAPK9, HSPCA, IRAK1, and CCND1 transcripts were down-regulated 7- to 25-fold in responsive BT474 and SKBr3 cells. In contrast, lapatinib weakly down-regulated the AKT pathway in nonresponsive breast cancer cell lines (&lt;5-fold down-regulation of most genes in the pathway). Furthermore, the proapoptotic gene FOXO3A, which is negatively regulated by AKT, was up-regulated 7- and 25-fold in lapatinib-responsive SKBr3 and BT474 cells, respectively. Phosphorylated Akt and Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3A also decreased in responsive breast cancer cell lines exposed to lapatinib. Gene expression profiling also revealed that lapatinib stimulated the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and modulated the expression of genes involved in cell cycle control, glycolysis, and fatty acid metabolism. In BT474 and T47D cells, which expressed moderate basal levels of the estrogen and progesterone receptors, 1.0 micromol/L of lapatinib induced expression by 7- to 11-fold.

All genes regulated by FVIIa were similarly regulated by a PAR2 agonist peptide confirming FVIIa signaling via PAR2. An appreciable fraction of the PAR2-regulated genes was also regulated by a PAR1 agonist peptide suggesting extensive redundancy between FVIIa/PAR2 signaling and thrombin/PAR1 signaling. The FVIIa regulated genes encode cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, and the gene repertoire induced by FVIIa in MDA-MB-231 cells is consistent with a role for TF-FVIIa signaling in regulation of a wound healing type of response.

To study in detail the mechanisms by which aberrant N-glycosylation caused by altered N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V(GnT-V, GnT-Va, and Mgat5a) expression can regulate the invasiveness-related phenotypes found in some carcinomas, we utilized specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) to selectively knock down GnT-V expression in the highly metastatic and invasive human breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB231. Knockdown of GnT-V by siRNA expression had no effect on epidermal growth factor receptor expression levels but lowered expression of N-linked beta(1,6)-branching on epidermal growth factor receptor, as expected. Compared with control cells, knockdown of GnT-V caused significant inhibition of the morphological changes and cell detachment from matrix that is normally seen after stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF). Decreased expression of GnT-V caused a marked inhibition of EGF-induced dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), consistent with the lack of cell morphology changes in the cells expressing GnT-V siRNA. The attenuation of EGF-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 was dramatically observed in GnT-V knockdown cells, and these effects could be rescued by reintroduction of GnT-V into these cells, indicating that reduced EGF-mediated activation of SHP-2 was GnT-V related. Concomitantly, knockdown of GnT-V caused reduced EGF-mediated ERK signaling and tumor cell invasiveness-related phenotypes, including effects on actin rearrangement and cell motility. No changes in EGF binding were observed, however, after knockdown of GnT-V. Our results demonstrate that decreased GnT-V activity due to siRNA expression in human breast carcinoma cells resulted in an inhibition of EGF-stimulated SHP-2 activation and, consequently, caused attenuation of the dephosphorylation of FAK induced by EGF. These effects suppressed EGF-mediated downstream signaling and invasiveness-related phenotypes and suggest GnT-V as a potential therapeutic target."

Adenovirus-mediated delivery of melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24), a secreted cytokine having cancer-selective apoptosis-inducing properties, profoundly inhibits prostate cancer cell growth. However, forced overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) renders prostate cancer cells resistant to Ad.mda-7. We constructed a conditionally replication-competent adenovirus in which expression of the adenoviral E1A gene, necessary for replication, is driven by the cancer-specific promoter of progression elevated gene-3 (PEG-3) and which simultaneously expresses mda-7/IL-24 in the E3 region of the adenovirus (Ad.PEG-E1A-mda-7), a cancer terminator virus (CTV). This CTV generates large quantities of MDA-7/IL-24 as a function of adenovirus replication uniquely in cancer cells. Infection of Ad.PEG-E1A-mda-7 (CTV) in normal prostate epithelial cells and parental and Bcl-2- or Bcl-x(L)-overexpressing prostate cancer cells confirmed cancer cell-selective adenoviral replication, mda-7/IL-24 expression, growth inhibition, and apoptosis induction. Injecting Ad.PEG-E1A-mda-7 (CTV) into xenografts derived from DU-145-Bcl-x(L) cells in athymic nude mice completely eradicated not only primary tumors but also distant tumors (established in the opposite flank), thereby implementing a cure. These provocative findings advocate potential therapeutic applications of this novel virus for advanced prostate cancer patients with metastatic disease."

Curcumin acts through the inhibition of phosphorylation of the inhibitor of kappa B (IkappaB), which in turn reduces the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), an inflammation- and cell survival-related transcription factor. However, it is not clear whether the strong antimetastatic effect can exclusively be explained by inhibition of NFkappaB. Here, we addressed the effects of Curcumin (IC(50) = 17 muM) in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using microarray gene expression analyses. Among the 62 genes whose expression was significantly altered, we found the two inflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and -2 (Groalpha and -beta) that were downregulated. Further validation of the microarray results by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that Curcumin impairs transcription of CXCL1 and -2 &gt;24 h and reduces the corresponding proteins. Using small interfering RNA techniques, we elucidated the underlying molecular mechanism revealing that reduction of CXCL1 and -2 messenger RNA levels is NFkappaB dependent and requires intact IkappaBalpha expression. Moreover, CXCL1 and -2 silencing leads to downregulation of several metastasis-promoting genes among which we found the cytokine receptor CXCR4. We therefore suggest that the decrease of CXCL1 and -2 mediated by Curcumin is involved in the inhibition of metastasis."

The immunoreactivity of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab was determined by its ability to displace the binding of trastuzumab to SK-BR-3 human breast cancer (BC) cells. Cellular uptake and nuclear localization were evaluated in SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-361, and MDA-MB-231 BC cells, expressing high, intermediate, or very low levels of HER2/neu, respectively, by cell fractionation and confocal microscopy. Biodistribution and nuclear uptake were compared in athymic mice bearing MDA-MB-361 xenografts. The cytotoxicity of (111)In-trastuzumab and (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab was studied by clonogenic assays, and DNA damage was assessed by probing for phosphorylated histone H2AX (gammaH2AX) foci.RESULTS: The dissociation constant for binding of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab to SK-BR-3 cells was reduced &lt;3-fold compared with that of (111)In-trastuzumab, demonstrating relatively preserved receptor-binding affinity. The receptor-mediated internalization of (111)In-trastuzumab in SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-361, and MDA-MB-231 cells increased significantly from 7.2% +/- 0.9%, 1.3% +/- 0.1%, and 0.2% +/- 0.05% to 14.4% +/- 1.8%, 6.3% +/- 0.2%, and 0.9% +/- 0.2% for (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab harboring 6 NLS-peptides, respectively. NLS-trastuzumab localized in the nuclei of BC cells, whereas unmodified trastuzumab remained surface-bound. Conjugation of (111)In-trastuzumab to NLS-peptides did not affect its tissue biodistribution but promoted specific nuclear uptake in MDA-MB-361 xenografts (2.4-2.9 %ID/g [percentage injected dose per gram] for (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab and 1.1 %ID/g for (111)In-trastuzumab). (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab was 5- and 2-fold more potent at killing SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-361 cells than (111)In-trastuzumab, respectively, whereas toxicity toward MDA-MB-231 cells was minimal. (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab was 6-fold more effective at killing SK-BR-3 cells than unlabeled trastuzumab. Formation of gammaH2AX foci occurred in a greater proportion of BC cells after incubation with (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab compared with (111)In-trastuzumab or unlabeled trastuzumab.CONCLUSION: NLS-peptides routed (111)In-trastuzumab to the nucleus of HER2/neu-positive human BC cells, rendering the radiopharmaceutical lethal to the cells through the emission of nanometer-micrometer range Auger electrons. The greater cytotoxic potency of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab compared with unlabeled trastuzumab in vitro and its favorable tumor-targeting properties in vivo suggest that it could be an effective targeted radiotherapeutic agent for HER2/neu-amplified BC in humans."

In insects, the function of titin is divided between two shorter proteins, projectin and sallimus (Sls), which are the products of different genes. The Drosophila sallimus (sls) gene codes for a protein of 2 MDa. The N-terminal half of the protein is largely made up of immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and unique sequence; the C-terminal half has two stretches of sequence similar to the elastic PEVK region of titin, and at the end of the molecule there is a region of tandem Ig and fibronectin domains. We have investigated splicing pathways of the sls gene and identified isoforms expressed in different muscle types, and at different stages of Drosophila development. The 5' half of sls codes for zormin and kettin; both proteins contain Ig domains and can be expressed as separate isoforms, or as larger proteins linked to sequence downstream. There are multiple splicing pathways between the kettin region of sls and sequence coding for the two PEVK regions. All the resulting protein isoforms have sequence derived from the 3' end of the sls gene. Splicing of exons varies at different stages of development. Kettin RNA is predominant in the embryo, and longer transcripts are expressed in larva, pupa and adult. Sls isoforms in the indirect flight muscle (IFM) are zormin, kettin and Sls(700), in which sequence derived from the end of the gene is spliced to kettin RNA. Zormin is in both M-line and Z-disc. Kettin and Sls(700) extend from the Z-disc to the ends of the thick filaments, though, Sls(700) is only in the myofibril core. These shorter isoforms would contribute to the high stiffness of IFM. Other muscles in the thorax and legs have longer Sls isoforms with varying amounts of PEVK sequence; all span the I-band to the ends of the thick filaments. In muscles with longer I-bands, the proportion of PEVK sequence would determine the extensibility of the sarcomere. Alternative Sls isoforms could regulate the stiffness of the many fibre types in Drosophila muscles."

We examined whether SOD2, the gene encoding MnSOD, was epigenetically repressed in breast cancer cell lines by DNA methylation and histone acetylation. RT-PCR analysis of SOD2 mRNA showed the nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A to have two to three fold higher expression levels than either UACC-893 or MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells. Analysis of a region in the SOD2 promoter by sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing demonstrated significantly higher levels of CpG methylation in both human breast carcinoma cell lines assessed than in MCF-10A cells. CREB binding in vitro to a cognate site derived from this region was repressed by DNA methylation, and CREB binding to the 5' regulatory region of the SOD2 gene in vivo as determined by ChIP was significantly lower in breast carcinoma cells than in MCF-10A. Increased cytosine methylation was also accompanied by a significant decrease in the level of acetylated histones in the same region of the SOD2 promoter. Finally, a causal link between cytosine methylation and transcriptional repression was established by increasing MnSOD mRNA, protein and activity in breast carcinoma cells using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. These findings indicate that epigenetic silencing of SOD2 constitutes one mechanism leading to the decreased expression of MnSOD observed in many breast cancers."

The most frequent change of a domain architecture (DA) is insertion or deletion of a domain at the N or C terminus. Still, the mechanisms underlying the evolution of multidomain proteins are not very well studied. Here, we have studied the evolution of multidomain architectures (MDA), guided by evolutionary information in the form of a phylogenetic tree. Our results show that Pfam domain families and MDAs have been created with comparable rates (0.1-1 per million years (My)). The major changes in DA evolution have occurred in the process of multicellularization and within the metazoan lineage. In contrast, creation of domains seems to have been frequent already in the early evolution. Furthermore, most of the architectures have been created from older domains or architectures, whereas novel domains are mainly found in single-domain proteins. However, a particular group of exon-bordering domains may have contributed to the rapid evolution of novel multidomain proteins in metazoan organisms. Finally, MDAs have evolved predominantly through insertions of domains, whereas domain deletions are less common. In conclusion, the rate of creation of multidomain proteins has accelerated in the metazoan lineage, which may partly be explained by the frequent insertion of exon-bordering domains into new architectures. However, our results indicate that other factors have contributed as well."

An increasing number of studies have also provided evidence linking disruption of the Fanconi anemia/BRCA cascade to breast cancer. Our objectives were to examine the methylation status and expression profiles of ER, correlate the findings with BRCA1 and FANCF methylation and map the critical CpGs for ER expression. We found that the CpG islands in the 5' region of the ER gene are methylated in 59 of 120 (49.2%) primary breast cancers, including 45 of 59 ER-negative tumors (76.3%, P &lt; 0.00001). In addition, we observed a strong correlation between ER promoter and BRCA1 promoter methylation (odds ratio 3.12, 95% confidence interval 1.10-9.68, P = 0.02). In contrast, FANCF methylation was rare in breast tumors: one of 120 (0.8%). ER methylation was associated with high tumor grade (60.4% methylated vs. 39.6% unmethylated in grade 3 tumors, P = 0.04) and tumor subtype (P = 0.03). Though small in number, all tumors of the medullary subtype were ER methylated. In contrast, the lobular subtype had the least methylation (23.1% methylated vs. 76.9% unmethylated). After treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 5-aza-cytidine (5-aza-dC) and trichostatin, which resulted in re-expression of ER mRNA, we localized dramatic demethylation effects to CpG islands in positions +68, +165, +192, +195, +337, +341 and +405 from transcription start site of the ER promoter. These data suggest that unlike FANCF, both ER and BRCA1 are specifically targeted for methylation in sporadic breast cancers, a phenomenon that should be explored for development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."

Choline kinase (Chk), the enzyme that converts choline to phosphocholine (PC), is elevated in cancer cells and presents a novel target for increasing cell kill. Here, we have examined the effects of transiently down-regulating Chk by small interfering RNA against Chk (siRNA-chk) on PC and total choline-containing compound (tCho) levels and on the viability/proliferation of estrogen receptor-negative and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines and a nonmalignant mammary epithelial cell line. We investigated the effects of combination treatment with transient siRNA-chk transfection and the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in those cell lines. Microarray analysis of the invasive estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 cell line was done to characterize molecular changes associated with Chk down-regulation. Chk down-regulation decreased PC and tCho levels in the malignant cell lines, whereas the cell viability/proliferation assays detected a decrease in proliferation in these cells. In contrast, Chk down-regulation had an almost negligible effect on PC and tCho levels as well as cell viability/proliferation in the nonmalignant cell line. A combination of siRNA-chk with 5-FU treatment resulted in a larger reduction of cell viability/proliferation in the breast cancer cell lines; this reduction was evident to a much lesser degree in the nonmalignant cells. Microarray analysis showed that Chk down-regulation affected 33 proliferation-related genes and 9 DNA repair-related genes. Chk down-regulation with siRNA-chk may provide a novel alternative to enhance the effect of anticancer drugs in malignant cells."

Eighty-one genes in MCF-7 cells and 131 in MDA-MB-231 cells were identified, that had low basal expression and were significantly upregulated following treatment. Eighteen genes were studied for methylation and/or expression in breast cancer; PTCH, the receptor for the hedgehog (Hh) pathway and a known tumor suppressor gene, was selected for further analysis. Methylation of the PTCH promoter was found in MCF-7 cells and in breast cancer samples, and correlated with low PTCH expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of breast tissue arrays revealed high expression of PTCH in normal breast compared to ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinomas; furthermore, association was found between PTCH expression and favorable prognostic factors. PTCH is an inhibitor of the Hh pathway, and its silencing activates the pathway and promotes growth. Indeed, high activity of the Hh pathway was identified in MCF-7 cells and overexpression of PTCH inhibited the pathway. Moreover, treatment with cyclopamine, an inhibitor of the pathway, reduced cell growth and slowed the cell cycle in these cells. Thus, unmasking of epigenetic silencing in breast cancer enabled us to discover a large number of candidate tumor suppressor genes. Further analysis suggested a role of one of these genes, PTCH, in breast cancer tumorigenesis."

One protein implicated in inhibiting metastasis is the tumor metastasis suppressor nonmetastatic protein 23 homologue 1 (NM23-H1). NM23-H1 is a multifunctional protein, which, in addition to limiting metastasis, has DNase and histidine protein kinase activities. We have identified new functions for NM23-H1 in influencing estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha)-mediated gene expression. Using a battery of molecular and biochemical techniques, we show that NM23-H1 interacts with ER alpha and increases the ER alpha-estrogen response element (ERE) interaction. When NM23-H1 expression is increased in U2 osteosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, transcription of a transiently transfected, estrogen-responsive reporter plasmid is decreased. More importantly, when endogenous NM23-H1 expression is knocked down in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells using small interfering RNA, estrogen responsiveness of the progesterone receptor (PR), Bcl-2, cathepsin D, and cyclin D1 genes, but not the pS2 gene, is enhanced. Furthermore, NM23-H1 associates with the region of the PR gene containing the +90 activator protein 1 site, but not with the ERE-containing region of the pS2 gene, indicating that NM23-H1 mediates gene-specific effects by association with endogenous chromatin. Our studies suggest that the capacity of NM23-H1 to limit the expression of estrogen-responsive genes such as cathepsin D and Bcl-2, which are involved in cell migration, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, may help to explain the metastasis-suppressive effects of this protein. The complementary abilities of ER alpha and NM23-H1 together to influence gene expression, cell migration, and apoptosis could be key factors in helping to determine tumor cell fate."

ITIs consist of one light (bikunin) and two heavy chains (ITIHs). We have recently characterized ITIH5, a novel member of the ITIH gene family, and showed that its messenger RNA is lost in a high proportion of breast tumours. In the present study, an ITIH5-specific polyclonal antibody was generated, validated with western blot and used for immunohistochemical analysis on a tissue microarray; ITIH5 was strongly expressed in epithelial cells of normal breast (n=11/15), while it was lost or strongly reduced in 42% (92/217) of invasive breast cancers. ITIH5 expression in invasive carcinomas was associated with positive expression of oestrogen receptor (P=0.008) and histological grade (P=0.024). Correlation of ITIH5 expression with clinical outcome revealed that patients with primary tumours retaining abundant ITIH5 expression had longer recurrence-free survival (RFS; P=0.037) and overall survival (OS; P=0.044), compared to those with reduced expression (mean RFS: 102 vs 78 months; mean OS: 120 vs 105 months). Methylation-specific PCR analysis frequently showed strong methylation of the ITIH5 promoter in primary breast tumours (41%, n=109) and breast cancer cell lines (n=6). Methylation was significantly associated with mRNA loss (P&lt;0.001; n=39), and ITIH5 expression was induced after treatment of tumour cell lines with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Moreover, ITIH5 promoter methylation was significantly associated with reduced OS (P=0.008). The cellular function of ITIH5 was evaluated by forced expression of a full-length ITIH5 complementary DNA in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, which does not endogenously express ITIH5. ITIH5-expressing clones showed a 40% reduced proliferation rate compared to mock-transfected cells. Overall, these data show that promoter methylation-mediated loss of ITIH5 expression is associated with unfavourable outcome in breast cancer patients, and thus ITIH5 could be used as a prognostic marker, although this marker is not multivariate independent due to its close association with ER expression. Our data indicate that ITIH5 is a candidate class II tumour suppressor gene and could be involved in tumour progression, invasion and metastasis, as its absence is associated with increased proliferation rates and a prognostic value indicating poor clinical outcome."

We studied the effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on a panel of human breast cancer cells, which show similar vitamin D receptor (VDR) content but variable transcriptional and anti-proliferative responsiveness. In MDA-MB-453 cells, one of the responsive lines, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) increased cell and nuclear size and induced a change from a rounded to a flattened morphology. By phase contrast, laser confocal and electron microscopy, we found that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) changed the cytoarchitecture of actin filaments and microtubules and nuclear shape, induced filopodia and lamellipodia, and promoted cell-to-cell contacts via large cytoplasmic extensions. However, although claudin-7 and occludin content in the cells increased upon exposure to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), these proteins were not located at the plasma membrane probably due to the absence of E-cadherin expression. Additionally, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induced the accumulation of alpha(v)-integrin, beta(5)-integrin, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and paxillin in focal adhesion plaques, concomitant with the increased phosphorylation of the FAK. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) enhanced MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468 cell adhesion to plastic but decreased adhesion to laminin. The expression of the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and of the myoepithelial marker P-cadherin was down-regulated by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in several breast cancer cell lines.

Accordingly, mice lacking VDR (Vdr(-/-)) showed abnormally high levels of SMA and P-cadherin in their mammary gland.

The 11,637 Da-recombinant monomeric form of DisBa-01 displayed an RGD motif and interacted with purified alpha(v)beta(3) integrin in surface plasmon resonance studies, in a dose-dependent and cation sensitive manner. A three-dimensional molecular model of DisBa-01 in complex with alpha(v)beta(3) predicted a large surface of contacts with the beta(3) subunit. DisBa-01 inhibited the adhesion of alpha(v)beta(3)-expressing human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1) and murine melanoma cell line B16F10 to vitronectin (IC(50) = 555 nM and 225 nM, respectively), and transiently inhibited their proliferation without direct cell toxicity, but did not affect the binding nor the proliferation of a human breast cancer-derived cell line (MDA-MB-231) not expressing alpha(v)beta(3). In vivo, DisBa-01 dose-dependently decreased bFGF-induced angiogenesis in a matrigel plug assay in athymic nude mice (IC(50) = 83 nM). When injected intravenously to C57BL/6 mice together with B16F10 melanoma cells, DisBa-01 time- and dose-dependently inhibited lung metastasis monitored by bioluminescent imaging.

We have previously identified a novel peptide that binds to the SH2 domain of Grb7 and inhibits its association with several different receptor tyrosine kinases. We have synthesised the Grb7 peptide, G7-18NATE, with two different cell penetrating peptides, Penetratin and Tat. In this study, we have shown that both Penetratin- and Tat-conjugated G7-18NATE peptides are able to inhibit the proliferation of SK-BR-3, ZR-75-30, MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. There was no significant effects on breast cancer MCF-7cells, non-malignant MCF 10A or 3T3 cells. In addition, there was no significant inhibition of proliferation by Penetratin or Tat alone or by their conjugates with arbitrary peptide sequence in any of the cell lines tested. We determined the EC50 of G7-18NATE-P peptide for SK-BR-3 cell proliferation to be 7.663 x 10(-6) M. Co-treatment of G7-18NATE-P peptide plus Doxorubicin in SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells resulted in an additional inhibition of proliferation, resulting in 56 and 84% decreases in the Doxorubicin EC50 value in the presence of 5 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-5) M G7-18NATE-P peptide, respectively. Importantly, the co-treatment with Doxorubicin and the delivery peptide did not change the Doxorubicin EC50.

We also demonstrate that they express three intracellular sensors for viral RNA, the toll like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene, the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5), which induce type I IFN production in infected cells. Finally, we show for the first time that the IFN-induced antiviral state provides human islets with a powerful protection from the replication of Coxsackievirus. This may be critical for beta cell survival and protection from virus-induced T1D in humans."

Here, we show that the full antiestrogen ICI182,780 and, to a lesser extent, the selective ER modulator raloxifene (Ral), induce accumulation of exogenous ERalpha in a poorly soluble fraction in transiently transfected HepG2 or stably transfected MDA-MB231 cells and of endogenous receptor in MCF7 cells. ERalpha remained nuclear in HepG2 cells treated with either compound. Replacement of selected hydrophobic residues of ERalpha ligand-binding domain helix 12 (H12) enhanced receptor solubility in the presence of ICI182,780 or Ral. These mutations also increased transcriptional activity with Ral or ICI182,780 on reporter genes or on the endogenous estrogen target gene TFF1 in a manner requiring the integrity of the N-terminal AF-1 domain. The antiestrogen-specific effects of single mutations suggest that they affect receptor function by mechanisms other than a simple decrease in hydrophobicity of H12, possibly due to relief from local steric hindrance between these residues and the antiestrogen side chains. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments indicated an enhanced regional stabilization of mutant ligand-binding domains in the presence of antiestrogens. H12 mutations also prevent the increase in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between ERalpha monomers induced by Ral or ICI182,780 and increase intranuclear receptor mobility in correlation with transcriptional activity in the presence of these antiestrogens. Our data indicate that ICI182,780 and Ral locally alter the ERalpha ligand binding structure via specific hydrophobic residues of H12 and decrease its transcriptional activity through tighter association with an insoluble nuclear structure."

Here, we have investigated the mechanism of DNA methylation on the repression of TFPI-2 in breast cancer cell lines.RESULTS: We found that both protein and mRNA of TFPI-2 could not be detected in highly invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435. To further investigate the mechanism of TFPI-2 repression in breast cancer cells, 1.5 Kb TFPI-2 promoter was cloned, and several genetic variations were detected, but the promoter luciferase activities were not affected by the point mutation in the promoter region and the phenomena was further supported by deleted mutation. Scan mutation and informatics analysis identified a potential KLF6 binding site in TFPI-2 promoter. It was revealed, by bisulfite modified sequence, that the CpG island in TFPI-2 promoter region was hypermethylated in MDA-MB-435. Finally, using EMSA and ChIP assay, we demonstrated that the CpG methylation in the binding site of KLF-6 diminished the binding of KLF6 to TFPI-2 promoter.CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that the CpG islands in TFPI-2 promoter was hypermethylated in highly invasive breast cancer cell line, and DNA methylation in the entire promoter region caused TFPI-2 repression by inducing inactive chromatin structure and decreasing KLF6 binding to its DNA binding sequence."

PDCD4 functions as a transformation repressor by inhibiting the activity of the RNA helicase, eIF4A. We previously showed that retinoids, anti-estrogens and HER2/neu antagonist induce PDCD4 expression in human breast cancer cell lines. Very little is known about the expression of PDCD4 in human breast cancer tissues or the significance of the PDCD4 expression in breast cancer. To gain insight into the pattern of the PDCD4 expression in breast tissues, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of the PDCD4 expression in 80 archived, normal and ductal breast carcinoma tissues (invasive and carcinoma in situ) (DCIS) and correlated PDCD4 expression with expression of known prognostic markers in breast cancer (ER, PR and HER2/neu). To assess the role of methylation on PDCD4 expression in breast cancer cells, breast cancer cell lines were treated with the demethylating agent 5-deoxy-azacytidine and analyzed for PDCD4 expression. We observed primarily nuclear localization of PDCD4 in ductal carcinoma in situ compared to normal breast tissues where the PDCD4 expression was predominantly cytoplasmic. This was seen more frequently in DCIS cases that were ER positive and HER2/neu negative samples. PDCD4 expression was markedly decreased in the invasive ductal carcinoma. We did not observe any significant relationship between PDCD4 expression and the expression of RAR or PR. In T-47D, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells, treatment with 5-deoxy-azacytidine did not result in an increased expression of PDCD4. The present study demonstrated altered cellular localization of PDCD4 when comparing normal breast to neoplastic breast tissues. In addition, there was a decreased expression of PDCD4 in breast cancer when compared with normal breast tissue. A loss of the PDCD4 expression in breast cancer cell lines does not appear to result from hypermethylation of the PDCD4 promoter."

This association is abolished in whole cells and in vitro by a six-amino-acid peptide that mimics the sequence around the phosphotyrosine residue in position 537 of the human ERalpha. The phosphorylated peptide, at nanomolar concentrations, is taken up by MCF-7 and LNCaP cells derived from human mammary and prostate cancers, respectively. In addition, to block the ER/Src interaction, the phosphopeptide inhibits Src/Erk pathway, cyclin D1 expression, and DNA synthesis induced by estradiol or androgen or triggered by epidermal growth factor. In contrast, no inhibition of the Src-mediated epidermal growth factor action on DNA synthesis is detectable in human mammary cancer cells that do not express ER (MDA-MB231), indicating that the peptide specifically targets the ER-associated Src. Remarkably, the peptide, in contrast with classic steroid antagonists, does not interfere in ER- or androgen receptor-dependent transcriptional activity. Nevertheless, it markedly inhibits the growth of MCF-7 cell xenografts induced in immunodepressed and estradiol-treated mice. The present report suggests that inhibition of association of steroid receptors with Src or other signaling effectors may have therapeutic applications for patients with ER-positive tumors."

A putative estrogen response element (ERE) was located in the promoter region of the BCRP gene. The present study aimed to investigate whether human BCRP expression is regulated pretranscriptionally by 17beta-estradiol.METHODS: Two recombinant plasmids (pcDNA3-promoter-BCRP and pcDNA3-CMV-BCRP) were designed to express the full-length BCRP cDNA enforced driven by its endogenous promoter containing a functional ERE and a control constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, respectively, which were transfected into estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive MCF-7 and ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines.RESULTS: 17beta-estradiol significantly upregulated BCRP mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner, and the effect was abolished by the antiestrogen tamoxifen. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the putative ERE in the promoter region of the BCRP gene and ERalpha are essential for transcriptional activation of BCRP by 17beta-estradiol.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings indicate that BCRP expression is upregulated by 17beta-estradiol via a novel pretranscriptional mechanism which might be involved in 17beta-estradiol-ER complexes binding to the ERE of BCRP promoter via the classical pathway to activate transcription of the BCRP gene."

Recently, dramatic overexpression of ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface protein has been found in estrogen receptor-negative [ER (-)] breast cancer cell lines and in clinical samples. In this study, CD73 small interfering RNA (siRNA) plasmid was constructed and stably transfected into breast cancer cell MB-MDA-231 to determine the role of CD73 in breast cancer metastasis and the possible mechanism. Our study demonstrates that CD73 siRNA effectively inhibits CD73 gene expression at mRNA and protein level in MB-MDA-231 cells, leading to in vivo and in vitro growth suppression, prevention of adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM), and inhibition of invasion and migration. These properties correlate with inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity as well as reduction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. Demonstration of the role of CD73 in breast cancer may lead to new targeted therapies for breast cancer."

The human protooncogene Nup214 was first identified as a target for chromosomal translocation involved in leukemogenesis. Nup214 is located on the cytoplasmic face of the NPC and is implicated in anchoring the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC and recruiting the RNA helicase Ddx19. Here, we present the crystal structure of the human Nup214 N-terminal domain at 1.65-A resolution. The structure reveals a seven-bladed beta-propeller followed by a 30-residue C-terminal extended peptide segment, which folds back onto the beta-propeller and binds to its bottom face. The beta-propeller repeats lack any recognizable sequence motif and are distinguished by extensive insertions between the canonical beta-strands. We propose a mechanism by which the C-terminal peptide extension is involved in NPC assembly."

We herein revealed that SFK activation occurs in lipid rafts. Based on this finding, we have developed a lipid raft-targeted SFK inhibitory fusion protein (LRT-SIFP) that inhibits the SFK activity in lipid rafts. LRT-SIFP has a peptide inhibitor of SFK and a lipid raft-targeting sequence in which two cysteine residues are palmitoylated for clustering in lipid rafts. LRT-SIFP was found to inhibit cell adhesion and cell cycle progression of human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB231. On the other hand, the cell functions of MCF-7 cells were found to be not affected with a previously developed peptide inhibitor of SFK that lacks the lipid raft-targeting sequence. In addition, when we replaced the targeting sequence of LRT-SIFP with the consensus sequence for geranylgeranylation to make LRT-SIFP unable to cluster in lipid rafts, this mutated LRT-SIFP did not show any effect on the above cell functions of MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, in contrast to the breast cancer cell lines, LRT-SIFP did not show any inhibitory effect on cell adhesion and cell cycle progression of human normal cell line HEK293. The present lipid raft-specific knockdown of SFK activity would potentially be useful for selective cancer therapy to prevent tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer cells."

Recently, a 38.8-kDa protein from P. furiosus DSM 3638 was isolated and characterized. Electron microscopy revealed that this protein aggregated as spheres of approximately 30 nm in diameter, which we designated P. furiosus virus-like particles (PfVs). X-ray crystallographic analysis at 3.6-A resolution revealed that each PfV consisted of 180 copies of the 38.8-kDa protein and retained T=3 icosahedral symmetry, as is often the case in spherical viruses. The total molecular mass of each particle was approximately 7 MDa. An examination of capsid structures suggested strong evolutionary links among PfV, tailed double-stranded DNA bacteriophages, and herpes viruses. The similar three-dimensional structures of the various coat proteins indicate that these viral capsids might have originated and evolved from a common ancestor. The structure of PfV provides a previously undescribed example of viral relationships across the three domains of life (Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea)."

Previous results suggested that it might be involved in the regulation of breast cancer invasion and metastasis. In order to analyze the role of Fra-2 in breast cancer cells, it was silenced in the highly invasive MDA-MB231 cells using RNA interference. On the other hand, stable transfectants of the weakly invasive MCF7 cell line were established in order to analyze the effects of Fra-2 overexpression. In both approaches, cell proliferation was not or only weakly influenced by Fra-2. In contrast, the invasive potential of the cells was increased, and a weaker effect on motility was observed. By cDNA microarray analysis of the MCF7 transfectants followed by validation on a protein level, we identified several Fra-2 target genes which might be involved in cell invasion and migration, i.e., ALCAM and connexin 43. Additionally, mRNA expression levels of various genes which are associated with a more malignant behavior of the tumors in vivo were up- or downregulated, i.e., members of the MAGE family, S100P, TIMP2, IL24 etc. These results show that Fra-2 overexpression is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and is probably involved in breast cancer progression in vivo."

TGFbeta up-regulatesMaspin expression both at the RNA and protein levels. This up-regulation required Smad2/3 function and intact p53-binding elements in the Maspin promoter. DNA affinity immunoblot and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed the presence of both Smads and p53 at the Maspin promoter in TGFbeta-treated cells, suggesting that both transcription factors cooperate to induce Maspin transcription. TGFbeta did not activate Maspin-luciferase reporter in p53-mutant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which exhibit methylation of the endogenous Maspin promoter. Expression of ectopic p53, however, restored ligand-induced association of Smad2/3 with a transfected Maspin promoter. Stable transfection of Maspin inhibited basal and TGFbeta-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cell motility. Finally, knockdown of endogenous Maspin in p53 wild-type MCF10A/HER2 cells enhanced basal and TGFbeta-stimulated motility. Taken together, these data support cooperation between the p53 and TGFbeta tumor suppressor pathways in the induction of Maspin expression, thus leading to inhibition of cell migration."

We examined the expression of NNMT in several types of cancer cells by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. To examine the role of Stat3, Hep-G2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells were transfected with NNMT promoter-luciferase reporter construct together with conditionally active Stat3 (Stat3ER) or dominant-negative Stat3 expression vector and NNMT promoter activity was determined. The expression of NNMT and activated Stat3 in 88 colon cancer tissues and 17 normal colon tissues was examined with immunohistochemical analysis.RESULTS: In Hep-G2 cells and SW480 colon cancer cells, NNMT expression increased on stimulation of the cells with interleukin 6. NNMT promoter activity in Hep-G2 cells was dependent on the activation of Stat3. MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells and HT29 colon cancer cells expressed constitutively a high level of NNMT. Treatment of these cells with Stat3 siRNA or curcumin, which inhibited Stat3 phosphorylation, resulted in reduction of the NNMT level. We found a correlation between the expression of NNMT and activated Stat3 (P&lt;0.001) in the colon cancer tissues.CONCLUSION: NNMT is a novel Stat3-regulated gene. Its expression is enhanced with the activation of Stat3 in colon cancer tissues. NNMT may be a potential candidate for a tumor marker of various kinds of cancers."

Only a few Nurr1-regulated genes have so far been identified and it remains unclear how Nurr1 influences the development and function of dopaminergic neurons. To identify novel Nurr1 target genes we have used genome-wide expression profiling in rat midbrain primary cultures, enriched in dopaminergic neurons, following up-regulation of Nurr1 expression by depolarization. In this study we demonstrate that following depolarization the hyperexpression of Nurr1 and the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are phospholipase C- and protein kinase C-dependent. We show that Bdnf, which encodes a neurotrophin involved also in the phenotypic maturation of mDA neurons, is a novel Nurr1 target gene. By RNA interference experiments we show that a decreased Nurr1 expression is followed by tyrosine hydroxylase and BDNF mRNA and protein down-regulation. Reporter gene assay experiments performed on midbrain primary cultures using four Bdnf promoter constructs show that Bdnf is a direct target gene of Nurr1. Taken together, our findings suggest that Nurr1 might also influence the development and the function of midbrain dopaminergic neurons via direct regulation of Bdnf expression."

Its 48 subunits are arranged as eight hexamers (1x6mers) that form the native 8x6mer in a nested hierarchy of 2x6mers and 4x6mers. This quaternary structure is established by eight subunit types (termed I, IIA, II, IIIA, IIIB, IV, V, and VI), of which only type II has been sequenced. Crystal structures of the 1x6mer are available, but for the 8x6mer only a 40 A 3D reconstruction exists. Consequently, the structural parameters of the 8x6mer are not firmly established, and the molecular interfaces between the eight hexamers are still to be defined. This, however, is crucial for understanding how allosteric transitions are mediated between the different levels of hierarchy. Here, we show the 10 A structure (FSC(1/2-bit) criterion) of the oxygenated 8x6mer from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single-particle analysis. Moreover, we show its molecular model as obtained by DNA sequencing of subunits II, IIIA, IV and VI, and molecular modelling and rigid-body fitting of all subunit types. Remarkably, the latter enabled us to improve the resolution of the cryo-EM structure from 11 A to the final 10 A. The 10 A structure allows firm assessment of various structural parameters of the 8x6mer, the 4x6mer and the 2x6mer, and reveals a total of 46 inter-hexamer bridges. These group as 11 types of interface: four at the 2x6mer level (II-II, II-IV, V-VI, IV-VI), three form the 4x6mer (V-V, V-VI, VI-IIIB/IV/V), and four are required to assemble the 8x6mer (IIIA-IIIA, IIIA-IIIB, II-IV, IV-IV). The molecular model shows the amino acid residues involved, and reveals that several of the interfaces are intriguingly histidine-rich and likely to transfer allosteric signals between the different levels of the nested hierarchy."

We previously reported that the FASN blockade can induce a synergistic chemosensitization of breast cancer cells to microtubule interfering agents (MIAs) such as docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine. Upon pharmacological inhibition of FASN activity using the natural antibiotic cerulenin [(2S,3R)-2,3-epoxy-4-oxo-7E,10E-dodecadienamide], we evaluated the role of FASN-catalyzed endogenous fatty acid biogenesis on the sensitivity of SK-Br3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines to the anti-metabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Cells were exposed simultaneously to cerulenin and 5-FU, sequentially to 5-FU followed by cerulenin or cerulenin followed by 5-FU. Cell viability was determined by MTT assays and the increase in 5-FU-induced cell growth inhibition was measured by dividing 5-FU IC30 and IC50 values (i.e., 30% and 50% inhibitory concentrations, respectively) that were obtained in the absence of cerulenin by those in its presence. Co-exposure to cerulenin enhanced 5-FU efficacy up to 20-, 81-, and 58-times in SK-Br3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Pre-treatment with cerulenin followed by the addition of 5-FU increased 5-FU efficacy up to 31-, 87-, and 126-times in SK-Br3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Pre-treatment with 5-FU followed by the addition of cerulenin augmented 5-FU efficacy up to 107-, 20-, and 18-times in SK-Br3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. When isobologram transformations of multiple dose-response analyses were performed to detect in vitro synergy, we concluded that the nature of the interaction between cerulenin and 5-FU in individual breast cancer cells lines generally exhibited sequence-dependency. Thus, while synergism was mainly observed when breast cancer cells were exposed to 5-FU prior to cerulenin, moderate synergism or additive interactions was obtained either when the chemical FASN blocker preceded 5-FU or when both drugs were concurrently administered. Of note, no antagonist interactions occurred upon any schedule of combined treatment with cerulenin and 5-FU. Our current findings revealing a schedule-dependent synergistic interaction between 5-FU and cerulenin represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence that FASN-catalyzed de novo FA biogenesis plays a key role in regulating breast cancer cell response to antimetabolite-based therapies."

Phases were improved by density modification, including concentric 24- and 48-fold rotational symmetry averaging. From this, the continuous cryo-EM electron density separated into domain-like blocks. A draft atomic model of cpMVP was fit to this improved density from 15 domain models. Three domains were adapted from a nuclear magnetic resonance substructure. Nine domain models originated in ab initio tertiary structure prediction. Three C-terminal domains were built by fitting poly-alanine to the electron density.

DNA from MCF7(L) and MMU2 cells was also analysed by comparative genome hybridisation (CGH) to compare with SNP microarray data. Proteins previously determined to be involved in disease progression were quantified by Western blot and compared to array data. The SNP and CGH array both detected cytogenetic abnormalities commonly found in breast cancer: amplification of chromosomes 11q13-14.1, 17q and 20q containing cyclin D1, BCAS1 and 3 (Breast Cancer Amplified Sequence) and AIB1 (Amplified in Breast cancer) genes; losses at 6q, 9p and X chromosomes, which included ERalpha (Estrogen Receptor alpha) and p16 ( INK4A ) genes. However the SNP chip array data additionally identified regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) followed by duplication of the remaining allele-uniparental disomy (UPD). Good concordance between SNP arrays and CGH analyses was observed, however there was poor correlation between gene copy number and protein levels between the cell lines. There were reductions in ERalpha, cyclin D1 and p27 protein levels whilst p21 protein levels were elevated in antiestrogen resistant MCF7 cell lines. Although protein levels varied there was no difference in gene copy number. This study shows SNP and CGH array analysis are powerful tools for analysis of allelic imbalance in breast cancer. However, the antiestrogen resistant phenotype was likely to be due to changes in gene expression and protein degradation rather than in altered gene copy number."

Uptake of fluorescein-conjugated AMF was dynamin-dependent, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin- and genistein-sensitive, reduced upon overexpression of caveolin-1 in MDA-435 cells, and increased upon short hairpin RNA reduction of caveolin-1 in MDA-231 cells. Tissue microarray analysis of invasive primary human breast carcinomas showed that AMFR expression had no impact on survival but did correlate significantly with expression of phospho-Akt. Phospho-Akt expression was increased in AMF-internalizing MCF7 and MDA-435 breast carcinoma cells. AMF uptake in these cells was reduced by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition but not by regulators of macropinocytosis such as amiloride, phorbol ester, or actin cytoskeleton disruption by cytochalasin D. The raft-dependent endocytosis of AMF therefore follows a distinct phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway that is up-regulated in more aggressive tumor cells."

A serum sample for hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) RNA was obtained at baseline and 360 minutes after infusion. Non-transferrin-bound iron values were significantly higher 30 minutes after administration of sodium ferric gluconate and iron sucrose compared with iron dextran (mean +/- SEM 10.1 +/- 2.2, 3.8 +/- 0.8, and 0.23 +/-0.1 microM, respectively, p&lt;0.001 for sodium ferric gluconate vs iron dextran, p = 0.002 for iron sucrose vs iron dextran). A significant positive correlation was noted between transferrin saturation and the presence of non-transferrin-bound iron for sodium ferric gluconate and iron sucrose (r2 = 0.37 and 0.45, respectively, p&lt;0.001) but not for iron dextran (r2 = 0.09). After sodium ferric gluconate, significantly more samples showed increases in MDA levels from baseline compared with iron sucrose and iron dextran (p = 0.006); these increased levels were associated with the presence of non-transferrin-bound iron, baseline transferrin saturation above 30%, baseline transferrin levels below 180 mg/dl, and ferritin levels above 500 ng/ml (p&lt;0.05). However, only a transferrin level below 180 mg/dl was independently associated (odds ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval 1.2-15.3).CONCLUSION: Iron sucrose and sodium ferric gluconate were associated with greater non-transferrin-bound iron appearance compared with iron dextran. However, only sodium ferric gluconate showed significant increases in lipid peroxidation. The relationship between non-transferrin-bound iron from intravenous iron and oxidative stress warrants further exploration."

Unfortunately, prolonged treatment with TAM causes TAM-responsive tumors to become TAM resistant through an as-yet-unknown mechanism. To develop novel anti-breast cancer agents that are therapeutically superior to TAM, we must first fully understand the biological effects of TAM. In this study, we found that TAM treatment of MDA-MB-361 breast cancer cells activated p21Waf1/Cip1 gene transcription independently of p53. Furthermore, TAM-induced p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter activity was enhanced by transient expression of the gene encoding Early Growth Response-1 (Egr-1) protein, a transcription factor that plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation. The TAM-induced p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter activity was blocked by the expression of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to Egr-1 mRNA. In addition, induction of Egr-1 expression by TAM occurred at the transcriptional level via Ets-domain transcription factor Elk-1 through the JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways. Inhibition of the JNK and p38 MAP kinase signals inhibited Egr-1-mediated p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter activity. We conclude that TAM stimulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 gene transcription in MDA-MB-361 cells depends largely on Elk-1-mediated Egr-1 expression induced by activation of the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways."

Eight human homologs of Nm23 have been identified that share 26-88% identity with the prototype Nm23-H1. Here, we examine the potential of its homologs, -H2, DR-, -H4 and -H5, to inhibit in vitro correlates of metastasis in two highly metastatic human cell lines, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231. The metastatic cells were transfected with mammalian expression constructs containing the genes encoding for Nm23-H1, -H2, DR-, -H4 and -H5 and the resultant transfectants were analyzed by Boyden chamber motility and soft agar colonization assays. Nm23-H1 suppressed motility by 3.3- and 1.5-fold in MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively and inhibited anchorage independent growth in soft agar by 2.9- and 1.9-fold, respectively. None of the -H1 homologs were capable of suppressing motility in MDA-MB-435 cells, but in MDA-MB-231 cells, -H2 inhibited motility by 3-fold upon overexpression. When anchorage independent growth was assessed, -H2, -H4 and -H5 suppressed growth from 1.2- to 2.0-fold in both cell lines. Given their ability to suppress anchorage independent growth, Nm23-H1 homologs -H2, -H4 and -H5 may have some capacity to suppress metastasis. Motility suppression appears to be cell context dependent, but sequence disparities between -H1/H2 and the other family members may reveal regions critical for this inhibitory phenotype. Similarly, sequence differences between DR-Nm23 and its homologs may be important for anchorage independent growth suppression."

PPARgamma agonists regulate development, cellular growth and metabolism in various tissues and have been documented to decrease cellular proliferation and to induce apoptosis of various tumour phenotypes, including breast cancer. However, the full spectrum of anti-tumour effects occurs only at suprapharmacological doses. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of rosiglitazone-induced anti-tumour effects of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, and used that information to predict rosiglitazone-induced sensitization of breast cancer cells to the effects of other compounds. We first confirmed that 100 microM rosiglitazone, but not lower doses, decreases MDA-MB-231 cell viability in vitro. We then used microarray gene expression analysis to determine early rosiglitazone-induced gene expression changes after 4-h exposure, which included 1298 genes that we grouped into functional categories. We selectively confirmed rosiglitazone-mediated effects on expression of key regulators of breast cancer proliferation and apoptosis, including p53, p21 and Bax. Finally, we used this information to predict that rosiglitazone would sensitize MDA-MB-231 cells to the anti-tumour effects of CH11, which trimerizes Fas, as well as tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Moreover, we used the confirmed array data to predict cooperative activity of rosiglitazone and R-roscovitine (CYC202), an inhibitor of multiple cyclin-dependent kinases. We conclude that microarray analysis can determine early TZD-modulated changes in gene expression that help to predict effective in vitro drug combinations."

Transient transfection of different luciferase reporter vectors 3xEREs-Vit, 2xEREs-tk and ERE-C3 showed that the transactivation capacity of both ER subtypes was influenced by 1) the nature of the inducer (oestradiol (E2), phyto- and anti-oestrogen (AE)), 2) the structure of the promoter (nucleotidic sequence, number of ERE, length of the promoter sequence) and 3) the cell line (containing endogenous ER (MCF-7) or in which ER was stably expressed (MDA-MB-231-HE-5 (ERalpha+) or MDA-MB-231-HERB (ERbeta+)). ER subtype did not display the same efficacy on the different constructions in the presence of E2 and of AE according to the cell (e.g. in MCF-7 cells: tk&gt;Vit&gt;C3 approximately 0 while in MDA-MB-231 cells: Vit&gt;tk approximately C3). E2 response was higher in MCF-7 cells, probably due to higher ER expression level (maximal at 10(-10)M instead of 10(-8)M for E2 in HE-5 cells). Finally, the same ligand could exert opposite activities on the same promoter according to the ER isoform expressed: in the MDA-MB-231 cells, AE acted as inducers of the C3 promoter via ERbeta whereas ERalpha/AE complexes down-regulated this promoter. Approximately 70% of breast tumours express ER and most tumour cells coexpress both ER isotypes. Thus, different types of ER dimers can be formed in such tumours (ERbeta or ERalpha homodimers or ERalpha/ERbeta heterodimers). We therefore studied the influence of the coexistence of the two ERs on the ligand-induced transcriptional process following transient transfection of ERalpha in ERbeta+ cells, and inversely ERbeta in ERalpha+ cells. ERbeta-transfection inhibited the E2- and genistein-induced ERalpha-dependent transcription on all promoters in all cell lines except C3 in MCF-7; this inhibitory effect was lost following transfection of ERbeta deleted of its AF-1 (ERbeta-AF-2). These results suggest that the dominant negative properties of ERbeta are mainly due to its AF-1 function. Interestingly, transfection of an ERbeta-AF-2 construct into MCF-7 cells potentiated the transcription inhibitory capacity of 4-OH-tamoxifen (OHT) on the Vit and tk promoters. Thus, (1) OHT exerts an agonistic activity through the AF-1 function of ER and (2) expression of ERbeta in breast cancer cells seems to favour the AE treatment. Contrary to ERbeta, ERalpha-transfection had little effect on ERbeta transactivation capacity in HERB cells. Finally, the ratio ERalpha/ERbeta constitutes one decisive parameters to orientate the transcriptional mechanism of a target gene in the presence of agonist as well as of antagonist ligands."

Pleiotropic molecular effects of the pro-apoptotic dietary constituent flavone in human colon cancer cells identified by protein and mRNA expression profiling. Proteomics 2004;4:2455-64]. DLC-1 that encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein, functions as a tumor suppressor gene and is frequently inactivated or down-regulated in several common cancers. Restoration of DLC-1 expression suppresses in vitro tumor cells proliferation and tumorigenicity in vivo.METHODS: Here, the effect of flavone was examined in several DLC-1-deficient cell lines derived from different types human cancer using assays for cell proliferation, gene expression and transfer.RESULTS: We show that exposure to 150 microM flavone increased DLC1 expression in breast but not in liver or prostate carcinoma cells or a nonmalignant breast epithelial cell line. Flavone restored the expression of DLC1 in the breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-361, and BT20 as well as in the colon carcinoma cell line HT-29 all of which are DLC-1-negative due to promoter hypermethylation. We further show that flavone inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at G(2)-M, increased p21(Waf1) gene expression, and caused apoptosis. Microarray analysis of these aggressive and metastatic breast carcinoma cells revealed 29 flavone-responsive genes, among which the DNA damage-inducible GADD genes were up-regulated and the proto-oncogene STMN1 and IGFBP3 were down-regulated.CONCLUSIONS: Flavone-mediated alterations of genes that regulate tumor cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis contribute to chemopreventive and antitumoral effects of flavone. Alone or in combination with demethylating agents, flavone may be an effective adjunct to chemotherapy in preventing breast cancer metastasis."

Thirty-four genes deemed of interest based on potential involvement in anticancer activities of alpha-TEA fell into six categories: apoptosis related, signal transduction, cell cycle related, cell adhesion and motility, transcriptional regulators, and membrane traffic related. The gene (PMAIP1) for NOXA was studied further. NOXA mRNA and protein levels were elevated in a time and dose-dependent fashion following alpha-TEA treatment. Functional knockdowns using small interfering RNA (siRNA) showed NOXA to contribute to alpha-TEA-induced apoptosis. A correlation between alpha-TEA's ability to upregulate NOXA and induce apoptosis was seen among several human breast cancer cell lines. Efforts to identify upstream regulators of NOXA in alpha-TEA-induced apoptosis identified the necessity of both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and p73 expression. Additionally, protein levels of full length p73 were decreased by JNK siRNA treatment, suggesting that the signal transduction module of JNK-p73-NOXA is involved in alpha-TEA induced apoptosis of human breast cancer cells. Taken together, these findings suggest a role for JNK activation in mediating full length p73 expression and add to our understanding of the mechanisms of anticancer actions of alpha-TEA, a potential chemotherapeutic agent."

K20T cells were approximately 18-fold resistant to Taxol, displayed cross-resistance to Taxotere and the epothilones, but little cross-resistance to discodermolide. Sequence analysis of the class I beta-tubulin indicated that it harbored an A593G mutation resulting in a change from glutamate to glycine at amino acid 198, which is near the intradimer interface within the alpha/beta-tubulin heterodimer. An HA-tagged wild-type class I beta-tubulin expression vector was transfected into the K20T cells. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that this exogenous tubulin was incorporated into cellular microtubules and Western blot analysis indicated that the K20T transfectants predominantly expressed the exogenous wild-type class I beta-tubulin.

As experimental models, we used cells transfected with two CXCR4 promoter constructs and treated with HGF or cotransfected with c-Src wild-type (Srcwt) expression vector; phospho-c-Src formation was enhanced in both cell lines. In MCF-7 cells, consistent with activations of CXCR4Luc constructs after HGF treatment and Srcwt expression, Ets1 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factors were activated. In contrast, in MDA-MB231 cells, CXCR4Luc construct, Ets1 and NF-kappaB activities decreased. The divergence point seemed to be downstream of HGF/c-Src and consisted in the interaction between c-Src and the substrate histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). Only in MDA-MB231 cells, HDAC3 level was enhanced in membranes and nuclei 30 min after HGF and colocalized/coimmunoprecipitated with phospho-c-Src and phosphotyrosine. Thus, the CXCR4 induction by HGF in MCF-7 cells required NF-kappaB and Ets1 activations, downstream of phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt, whereas in HGF-treated MDA-MB231 cells, HDAC3 activation via c-Src probably caused a reduction of transcription factor activities, such as that of NF-kappaB. These results indicate possible roles of HGF in invasive growth of breast carcinomas. By enhancing CXCR4 in low invasive tumor cells, HGF probably favors their homing to secondary sites, whereas by suppressing CXCR4 in highly invasive cells, HGF might participate to retain them in the metastatic sites."

Sequence analysis showed that nine BRCA1 splice forms were isolated and characterized, compared with wild-type BRCA1 gene, five splice forms of which were novel. These splice isoforms were produced from the molecular mechanism of 5' and 3' alternative splicing. All these splice forms deleting exon 11b and the locations of alternative splicing were focused on two parts:one was exons 2 and 3, and the other was exons 9 and 10. These splice forms accorded with GT-AG rule. Most these BRCA1 splice variants still kept the original reading frame. Western blot analysis indicated that some BRCA1 splice variants were expressed in ZR-75-30 cell line at the protein level. In addition, we confirmed the presence of these new transcripts of BRCA1 gene in MDA-MB-435S, K562, Hela, HLA, HIC, H9, Jurkat and human fetus samples by RT-PCR analysis. These results suggested that breast cancer associated gene BRCA1 may have unexpectedly a large number of splice variants. We hypothesized that alternative splicing of BRCA1 possibly plays a major role in the tumorigenesis of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Thus, the identification of cancer-specific splice forms will provide a novel source for the discovery of diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and tumor antigens suitable as targets for therapeutic intervention."

Using a nested case control design we determined plasma levels of IgG recognizing native and MDA-modified p45 in baseline samples from 75 subjects with acute myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death and 148 matched controls.

We identified a zinc finger transcription factor, ZNF24, that may repress VEGF transcription. An inverse correlation between expression of VEGF and ZNF24 was observed in a series of independent studies. ZNF24 was up-regulated in angiogenic tumor nodules where VEGF expression is significantly decreased compared with preangiogenic nodules. In human breast carcinoma cells cultured under normoxic conditions, ZNF24 levels were significantly up-regulated whereas VEGF levels were low. In contrast, VEGF was significantly increased in hypoxic cells whereas ZNF24 was down-regulated. The same inverse correlation between ZNF24 and VEGF was also observed in 70% of matched cDNA pairs of normal and malignant tissues from human colon and breast biopsies. Overexpression of ZNF24 resulted in a significant down-regulation of VEGF, whereas silencing of ZNF24 with small interfering RNA led to increased VEGF expression. Cotransfection of ZNF24 and a VEGF promoter luciferase reporter construct in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a significant decrease in VEGF promoter activity. Taken together, these data suggest that ZNF24 is involved in negative regulation of VEGF and may represent a novel repressor of VEGF transcription."

Bias may occur between loci, or between alleles within a locus, and may differ between sample donors at the same loci. Previous research has suggested that omitting denaturation of the template prior to amplification can reduce the observed bias significantly. Comparison of the two methods (with and without denaturation) has found that nondenaturation of template reverses the direction of bias observed between allelic pairs following MDA.

Using the anti-estrogen ICI, ER negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells, and a prostate cancer cell line (22Rv1) deficient in both ERalpha and PPARgamma, we determined that Rosiglitazone-induced ERE reporter activation and proliferation is through an ERalpha dependent mechanism. Rosiglitazone-induced ERE activation is also dependent on activation of the Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase-Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (ERK-MAPK) pathway, since it is inhibited by co-treatment with U0126, a specific inhibitor of this pathway. We also demonstrate that when ERalpha and PPARgamma are both present, they compete for Rosi, inhibiting each others transactivation. To begin to unravel the pharmacological mechanism of Rosi-induced ER activation, sub-maximally effective concentrations of E(2) were used in combination with increasing concentrations of Rosi in luciferase reporter assays. From these assays it appears that E(2) and Rosi both activate ERalpha via similar pharmacological mechanisms. Furthermore sub-maximally effective concentrations of E(2) and Rosi additively increase both ERE reporter activity and MCF-7 cell proliferation. The results of this study may have clinical relevancy for Rosi's use both as an anti-diabetic in post-menopausal women and as an anti-cancer drug in women with ER positive breast cancer."

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of human PCI and its inactive derivatives on tumor growth and metastasis of human breast cancer (MDA-231) cells, and on angiogenesis in vivo. The invasiveness of MDA-231 cells was inhibited by recombinant intact PCI, but not by reactive site-modified PCI (R354APCI) or by the N-terminal fragment of protease-cleaved PCI (NTPCI). The in vitro invasiveness of MDA-231 cells expressing intact PCI (MDA-PCI) was significantly decreased as compared to MDA-231 cells expressing R354APCI (MDA-R354APCI) or NTPCI (MDA-NTPCI). Further, in vivo growth and metastatic potential of MDA-PCI, MDA-R354APCI and MDA-NTPCI cells in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were significantly decreased as compared to MDA-Mock cells. Angiogenesis was also significantly decreased in Matrigel implant containing MDA-PCI, MDA-R354APCI or MDA-NTPCI cells as compared to that containing MDA-Mock cells. In vivo angiogenesis in rat cornea and in vitro tube formation were also inhibited by recombinant intact PCI, R354APCI and NTPCI. Furthermore, the anti-angiogenic activity of PCI was strong as cleaved antithrombin (AT), and slightly stronger than that of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Overall, this study showed that, in addition to a reactive site-dependent mechanism, PCI may also regulate tumor growth and metastasis independently of its protease inhibitory activity by inhibiting angiogenesis."

Using macroarrays, the expression of genes involved in the G(1)/S transition was examined. Among these, Skp1 showed 2-3-fold increased expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Skp1 (S-phase kinase-associated protein) belongs to the Skp1/Cullin-1/F-box ubiquitin ligase complex responsible for the ubiquitination of cellular regulators leading to their proteolysis. Skp1 overexpression was also found after delta-lactoferrin transient transfection in other cell lines (HeLa, MDA-MB-231, HEK 293) at comparable levels. Analysis of the Skp1 promoter detected two sequences that were 90% identical to those previously known to interact with lactoferrin, the secretory isoform of delta-lactoferrin (GGCACTGTAC-S1(Skp1), located at - 1067 bp, and TAGAAGTCAA-S2(Skp1), at - 646 bp). Both gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that delta-lactoferrin interacts in vitro and in vivo specifically with these sequences. Reporter gene analysis confirmed that delta-lactoferrin recognizes both sequences within the Skp1 promoter, with a higher activity on S1(Skp1). Deletion of both sequences totally abolished delta-lactoferrin transcriptional activity, identifying them as delta-lactoferrin-responsive elements. Delta-lactoferrin enters the nucleus via a short bipartite RRSDTSLTWNSVKGKK(417-432) nuclear localization signal sequence, which was demonstrated to be functional using mutants. Our results show that delta-lactoferrin binds to the Skp1 promoter at two different sites, and that these interactions lead to its transcriptional activation. By increasing Skp1 gene expression, delta-lactoferrin may regulate cell cycle progression via control of the proteasomal degradation of S-phase actors."

These co-amplifications have been suggested to result from amplification of pre-existing junctions between two chromosomes, that is, translocation junctions. We investigated this hypothesis for two amplifications frequent in breast cancer, at 8p12 and 11q13, which had been reported to be associated in Southern blot studies. We confirmed that both genomic amplification and expression of genes was correlated between the frequently-amplified regions of 8p and 11q, in array CGH and microarray expression data, supporting the importance of co-amplification. We examined by FISH the physical structure of co-amplifications that we had identified by array CGH, in five breast cancer cell lines (HCC1500, MDA-MB-134, MDA-MB-175, SUM44, and ZR-75-1), four breast tumors, and a pancreatic cancer cell line (SUIT2). We found a variety of arrangements: amplification of translocation junctions; entirely independent amplification of the two regions on separate chromosomes; and separate amplification of 8p and 11q sequences in distinct sites on the same rearranged chromosome. In this last arrangement, interphase nuclei often showed intermingling of FISH signals from 8p12 and 11q13, giving a false impression that the sequences were interdigitated. We conclude that co-amplification of the main 8p and 11q amplicons in breast tumors is not usually the result of a preceding translocation event but most likely reflects selection of clones that have amplified both loci.

Here, we report the first purification, biophysical characterisation and 3-D structural analysis of one of the toxin components, XptA1, from Xenorhabdus nematophila PMFI296 to a resolution of 23 A. Membrane binding studies indicate that the three-component toxin system has a different mode of action from that of proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Biophysical characterisation of XptA1 suggests a mechanism of action of XptA1 whereby it first binds to the cell membrane forming a structure with a central cavity and forms a complex with its partners XptB1 and XptC1 producing the full insecticidal toxin. The structure of XptA1 is shown by a combination of electron microscopy, ultracentrifugation and circular dichroism spectroscopy to be a 1.15 MDa tetramer with a cage-like structure. Each of the four symmetry-related subunits has three well-defined domains and a longitudinal twist with one end narrower than the other. One third of the residues of XptA1 are alpha-helical and it is suggested the subunits associate partly via an alpha-helical coiled-coil interaction. XptA1 itself shows the same secondary structure at neutral pH and in an alkaline environment up to pH10.5. This pH tolerance indicates that the folded XptA1 can pass through the midgut of Lepidopteran insects susceptible to the insecticidal toxin complex. This implies therefore that its folded structure is important for its biological activity."

The purpose of this study was to further elucidate the molecular mechanism of 2ME2. MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells were treated with 2ME2 (2 micromol/L) or vehicle alone. RNA was extracted and genomic profiling was done using 22k Agilent microarrays. Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer was used to determine enrichment of Gene Ontology categories. Protein isolates were subjected to Western blot analysis. Protein synthesis was measured with a [35S]methionine pulse assay. An MDA-MB-435 cell line with two beta-tubulin mutations (2ME2R) was used to determine whether novel mechanisms were tubulin-dependent. Gene Ontology categories enriched include genes that regulate the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, apoptosis, and the cytosolic ribosome. The target of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint is the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). APC inhibition was confirmed by measuring protein levels of its targets securin and cyclin B1, which were increased in 2ME2-treated cells. Because gene expression in the cytosolic ribosome category was decreased, we evaluated whether 2ME2 decreases protein translation. This was confirmed with a pulse assay, which showed decreased isotope incorporation in 2ME2-treated cells, which was maintained in the tubulin-resistant 2ME2R cells. APC inhibition was not maintained in 2ME2R cells. 2ME2 induces tubulin-dependent cell cycle arrest through regulation of genes involved in the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, which results in inhibition of the APC and tubulin-independent inhibition of protein translation."

Besides its determinant role in carcinogenic progression, HPV E6 oncoprotein has also been instrumental in elucidating fundamental aspects of p53 function and its ubiquitin-proteasome degradation, with counterpart activities in various DNA tumor viruses. Establishing the conformational state and cellular distribution unequivocally for the endogenous protein in HPV-transformed cell lines derived from carcinomas is essential for understanding the underlying mechanism. Recombinant E6 from high-risk strains 16 and 18 folds into soluble oligomers of approximately 1.2 MDa, which are thermostable and display cooperative loss of tertiary and secondary structure upon chemical denaturation. Antibodies raised against these assemblies locate E6 evenly distributed in the cells. By depleting the polyclonal serum by immunoblocking with monomeric E6, the nuclei of Hela and CaSki cells become completely devoid of label, indicating that monomeric species are mainly localized in the nucleus and that both monomers and oligomers share epitopes. The monomeric species promote degradation of p53 by the proteasome, which correlates with the nuclear localization we describe. In contrast, the oligomeric E6 does not promote p53 degradation, in agreement with its cytoplasmic localization inferred from the immunoneutralization experiments. Our results indicate that the cytoplasmic species contain conformational epitopes that may arise from yet undefined homo or hetero-oligomers, but its localization otherwise agrees with that of the other group of major E6 targets, those involving PDZ binding domains, which requires further investigation."

To obtain a sufficient amount of DNA for molecular diagnoses, several whole genome amplification (WGA) methods have been proposed. In this study, using Francisella tularensis and Escherichia coli as models, we compared four WGA methods in terms of their efficiency of amplification of whole genomic DNA in order to identify the most suitable method for preparing DNA to be used for microarray analysis. It was possible to obtain more than 1.5 microg of products from 10 ng of F. tularensis and E. coli genomic DNA using four methods, but biases in the amplification of bacterial genes were least prominent in the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) or OmniPlex WGA. When the amplified DNAs were applied to microarray slides consisting of 32 different genes probes, DNAs amplified by Phi29 v2 of MDA and OmniPlex WGA showed high signal intensity as well as a high signal-to-noise ratio for all 32 genes. These results indicate that Phi29 v2 and OmniPlex WGA are useful methods for obtaining sufficient DNA from a limited amount of samples for the detection of microbes using microarrays."

RT-PCR, real-time PCR and Western blot showed that AF1Q gene was differentially expressed between highly metastatic MDA-MB-231HM cells and its parental MDA-MB-231 cells. However, its molecular mechanisms in breast cancer metastasis remain to be characterized. To investigate the effects of AF1Q on the progression of human breast cancer cells, in the present study, recombinant expression plasmid vectors of the human AF1Q gene was transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells. We demonstrated that AF1Q overexpression enhanced the in vitro proliferation and invasive potential of breast cancer cells. Focused microarray analyses showed that 22 genes were differentially expressed between AF1Q transfected cells and its parental counterparts. Integrin alpha3, accompanied by up-regulation of Ets-1 and MMP-2, significantly enhanced the in vitro invasive potential of human breast cancer cells mediated by AF1Q. Estrogen-responsive ring finger protein gene (EFP), also played a role in the enhancement of in vitro proliferation of human breast cancer cells mediated by AF1Q, accompanied by down-regulation of 14-3-3delta. The association was ERalpha independent. These results were further demonstrated by RNA interference (RNAi) experiment in vitro. In in vivo study, we also demonstrated that AF1Q transfected breast cancer cells grew much faster and had more pulmonary metastases than vector-transfected or its parental counterparts. On the contrary, AF1Q knockdown cells grew slower and had less pulmonary metastasis. Similar effects of AF1Q on integrin alpha3, Ets-1, MMP-2, EFP, and 14-3-3delta expression observed in vitro studies were also found in the in vivo study. Taken together, these results provide functional evidences that overexpression of AF1Q leads to a more progression in human breast cancer, at least in part, through regulating the integrin alpha3, Ets-1, MMP-2, EFP, and 14-3-3delta expression."

To provide for safety and tumor selectivity, the virus carried a large deletion including one of the two alpha4, gamma(1)34.5, alpha0 genes and the latency-associated transcript region. The gamma(1)34.5 gene, a major neurovirulence factor, was replaced by a gene cassette constitutively expressing the red fluorescent protein gene. Homologous recombination was used to transfer the fusogenic gBsyn3 mutation to the viral genome to produce the OncSyn virus. OncSyn causes extensive virus-induced cell fusion (syncytia) and replicates to higher titers than the parental Onc and HSV-1(F) strains in breast cancer cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that the OncSyn virus retains a stable genome and expresses all major viral glycoproteins. A xenograft mouse model system using MDA-MB-435S-luc (MM4L) human breast cancer cells constitutively expressing the luciferase gene implanted within the interscapular region of animals was used to test the ability of the virus to inactivate breast tumor cells in vivo. Seventy-two mice bearing MM4L breast cancer xenografts were randomly divided into three groups and given two rounds of three consecutive intratumoral injections of OncSyn, inactivated OncSyn, or phosphate-buffered saline 3 days apart. A single round of virus injections resulted in a drastic reduction of tumor sizes (p &lt;or= 0.0001) and diminution of chemiluminescence emitted by the cancer cells (p &lt;or= 0.0002). This effect was enhanced by a second round of virus injections into the tumors 3 days after the first round (p &lt;or= 0.0001).

Novel alleles in single cells were seen in 0.3% of amplifications, interpreted as either somatic microsatellite mutation events or 'slippage' of the MDA phi 29 polymerase. Three-allele results for a single marker in a single cell were found in 0.07% of amplifications, interpreted as 'slippage' of the MDA phi 29 polymerase. One apparent segmental duplication was found. Only one embryo with no normal cells was found, probably arising from the chaotic cleavage division following a triploid conception. Six embryos were mosaic, of which four had only one abnormal cell.CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in human embryos may be present in only a single cell, leading to potentially false abnormal results at pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. ADO associated with MDA reduces the efficacy of this approach for detection of aneuploidy. Statistical analysis showed that, for ADO of 28%, seven informative markers would be required to give 95% confidence of detecting trisomic embryos."

Binding of IL-24 to either of its two possible heterodimeric receptors IL-20R1/IL-20R2 and IL-22R/IL-20R2 activates STAT3 and/or STAT1 in target tissues such as lung, testis, ovary, keratinocytes and skin. To date, the physiological properties of IL-24 are still not well understood but available data suggest that IL-24 affects epidermal functions by increasing proliferation of dermal cells. In stark contrast to its &quot;normal&quot; and physiological behaviour, IL-24 has been reported to selectively and efficiently kill a vast variety of cancer cells, especially melanoma cells, independent of receptor expression and Jak-STAT signalling. These intriguing properties have led to the development of adenovirally-expressed IL-24, which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Using three different methods, we have analysed a large panel of melanoma cell lines with respect to IL-24 and IL-24 receptor expression and found that none of the investigated cell lines expressed sufficient amounts of functional receptor pairs and therefore did not react to IL-24 stimulation with Jak/STAT activation. Results for three cell lines contrasted with previous studies, which reported presence of IL-24 receptors and activation of STAT3 following IL-24 stimulation. Furthermore, evaluating four different sources and modes of IL-24 administration (commercial recombinant IL-24, bacterially expressed GST-IL-24 fusion protein, IL-24 produced from transfected Hek cells, transiently over-expressed IL-24) no induction or increase in cell death was detected when compared to appropriate control treatments. Thus, we conclude that the cytokine IL-24 itself has no cancer-specific apoptosis-inducing properties in melanoma cells."

A limitation to the anti-neoplastic efficacy of hPNPase(old-35) relates to its lack of cancer specificity. The promoter of Progression Elevated Gene-3 (PEG-Prom), discovered in our laboratory via subtraction hybridization in a transformation progression rodent tumor model functions selectively in a diverse array of human cancer cells, with limited activity in normal cells. An adenovirus constructed with the PEG-Prom driving expression of hPNPase(old-35) containing a C-terminal Hemaglutinin (HA)-tag (Ad.PEG.hPNPase(old-35)) was shown to induce robust transgene expression, growth suppression, apoptosis, and cell-cycle arrest in a broad panel of pancreatic cancer cells, with minimal effects in normal immortalized pancreatic cells. hPNPase(old-35) expression correlated with arrest in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle and up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) p21(CIP1/WAF-1/MDA-6) and p27(KIP1). In a nude mouse xenograft model, Ad.PEG.hPNPase(old-35) injections effectively inhibited growth of human pancreatic cancer cells in vivo.

Human breast carcinoma cell lines BT-20, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and T47D and one nonmalignant human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, were tested in this study. We found that UP exerted a potent cytotoxicity against all breast carcinoma cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, UP showed limited toxicity to MCF-10A cells, indicating UP's cytotoxic effect is selective for malignant cells. UP's cytotoxic effect was due to apoptosis, as confirmed by positive TUNEL signals, annexin V-binding, caspase 9 activation and PARP cleavage. Notably, UP-induced apoptosis was blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk, further indicating the involvement of caspase activity. Moreover, UP caused a marked decrease of the levels of antiapoptotic BCL-X(L), Survivin and XIAP while enhancing the levels of proapoptotic BIK, BIM, MCL-1S and NOXA, consequently favoring induction of apoptosis. Additionally, we found that cells with functional p53 (MCF-7, T47D) or mutant p53 (BT-20, MDA-MB-231) were both susceptible to UP's cytotoxicity. Importantly, UP was able to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells with p53 knockdown by RNA interference, confirming the dispensability of p53 in UP-induced apoptosis. Overall, our results establish that UP induces p53-independent apoptosis in breast carcinoma cells with no marked toxicity to nonmalignant cells, raising the possibility of its use as a new chemotherapeutic drug for breast cancer irrespective of p53 status."

Studies on coactivation of wild-type and variant ERalpha/Sp1 by DRIP150 indicates that the DNA-binding domain and helix 12 in the ligand binding domain of ERalpha are required and the coactivation response is squelched by overexpressing an NR-box peptide that contains two LXXLL motifs from GRIP2. In contrast, coactivation of ERalpha/Sp1 by wild-type and mutant DRIP150 expression plasmids show that coactivation of ERalpha/Sp1 by DRIP150 is independent of the NR-boxes. Deletion analysis of DRIP150 demonstrates that coactivation requires an alpha-helical NIFSEVRVYN (amino acids 795-804) motif within 23 amino acid sequence (789-811) in the central region of DRIP150 and similar results were obtained for coactivation of ERalpha by DRIP150. Thus, although different domains of ERalpha are required for hormone-dependent activation of ERalpha and ERalpha/Sp1, coactivation of these transcription factors by DRIP150 requires the alpha-helical amino acids 795-804.

Biochemical and biophysical analyses showed the mucins were stiffened random coils in solution that were polydisperse in size (M(r) = 6-20 MDa, average M(r) = 14 MDa) and comprised of disulfide-linked subunits (average M(r) = 7 MDa). Agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the pooled mucus sample contained at least two populations of oligomeric mucins. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic digests of the unfractionated mucin preparation showed that the oligomeric mucins Muc5b and Muc5ac were present. In summary, we have shown that equine airways mucus is a mixture of Muc5b and Muc5ac mucins that have a similar macromolecular organization to their human counterparts. This study will form the basis for future studies to analyze the contribution of these two mucins to equine airways pathology associated with mucus accumulation."

Lately, a method of cargo delivery, coincubation with CPP, has been applied. We have studied uptake and toxicity of the CPP, YTA2, in the Bowes human melanoma cell line and human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line and compared the results with known cell-penetrating peptides. The results show that fluoresceinyl YTA2 is taken up by the Bowes cells with 3.23 nmol/mg protein and shows low membrane toxicity to the cells with an EC50 of 60 microM. Furthermore, we show that YTA2 is capable of delivering cargo proteins, such as beta-galactosidase and tetramethyl rhodamine iso-thiocyanate (TRITC) labeled streptavidin into cells by coincubation. The delivery of TRITC-labeled streptavidin was quantified to 42.4 pmol streptavidin/mg protein. The delivery of proteins into the cells by mere coincubation is an advantage, since the chemical coupling between the CPP and the cargo molecule, which adds time-consuming synthesis and purification steps, can be omitted. In addition, the flexibility in CPP cargo delivery is increased."

Given this, the ability to amplify total DNA obtained from evidence, in an unbiased manner, would be highly advantageous. Methods for whole genome amplification (WGA) have the potential to fulfill this role, resulting in a virtually unlimited supply of DNA. In the research presented, two WGA methods, improved primer extension preamplification and multiple displacement amplification (MDA), were tested using commercial kits. Control DNA, artificially degraded DNA, and DNA from fresh blood, aged blood, hair shafts, and aged bones underwent WGA, followed by short tandem repeat and mitochondrial DNA analysis. The methods did amplify DNA, but performed poorly on forensically relevant samples; the maximum amplicon size was reduced, and MDA often resulted in extraneous bands following polymerase chain reaction. Taken together, WGA appears to be of limited forensic utility unless the samples are of a very high quality."

High expression of BSP in breast and prostate primary carcinomas is associated with progression and bone metastases development. In this study, we examined the transcriptional regulation of BSP gene expression in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells compared with Saos-2 human osteoblast-like cells. BSP human promoter deletion analyses delineated a -56/-84 region, which comprises a cAMP response element (CRE) that was sufficient for maximal promoter activity in breast cancer cell lines. We found that the basic fibroblast growth factor response element (FRE) also located in the proximal promoter was a crucial regulator of human BSP promoter activity in Saos-2 but not in breast cancer cells. Promoter activity experiments in combination with DNA mobility shift assays demonstrated that BSP promoter activity is under the control of the CRE element, through CREB-1, JunD and Fra-2 binding, in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and in Saos-2 cells. Forskolin, a protein kinase A pathway activator, failed to enhance BSP transcriptional activity suggesting that CRE site behaves as a constitutive rather than an inducible element in these cell lines. Over-expression of JunD and Fra-2 increased BSP promoter activity and upregulated endogenous BSP protein expression in MCF-7 and Saos-2 cells while siRNA-mediated inhibition of both factors expression significantly reduced BSP protein level in MDA-MB-231. Collectively, these data provide with new transcriptional mechanisms, implicating CREB and AP-1 factors, that control BSP gene expression in breast cancer cells."

We have found that a 22-amino-acid-long peptide derived from the N-terminal part of p14ARF, denoted ARF(1-22), which has previously been shown to mimic the function of p14ARF, has cell-penetrating properties. This peptide is internalized to the same extent as the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) TP10 and dose-dependently decreases proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA MB 231 cells. Uptake of the ARF(1-22) peptide is associated with low membrane disturbance, measured by deoxyglucose and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, as compared to its scrambled peptide. Also, flow cytometric analysis of annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) binding and Hoechst staining of nuclei suggest that ARF(1-22) induces apoptosis, whereas scrambled or inverted peptide sequences have no effect. The ARF(1-22) peptide mainly translocates cells through endocytosis, and is found intact inside cells for at least 3 hours. To our knowledge, this is the first time a CPP having pro-apoptopic activity has been designed from a protein."

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in many tumor cells, while sparing most normal cells. Several chemotherapeutic drugs synergize with TRAIL in reducing tumor growth and inducing apoptosis. Because some tumour cells respond poorly to these treatments, biomarkers that predict clinical responsiveness are needed. This study used surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) to identify novel apoptotic markers in TRAIL and etoposide (T+E)-treated MDA-MB-231 and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells and MCF-10A non-transformed breast cells. T+E induced apoptosis, increasing caspase-3 activity at 4-8h, in all cell lines. Protein profiles revealed two prominent peaks, m/z 10090 and 8560, which decreased significantly during apoptosis. Mass spectrometry sequencing of tryptic peptides identified these proteins as S100A6 (confirmed immunologically) and ubiquitin (confirmed against a purified standard), respectively. Caspase inhibition prevented the decrease in both proteins during T+E-induced apoptosis whereas proteasome inhibition combined with T+E further decreased ubiquitin, possibly by preventing its recycling. Using SELDI-TOF MS we have identified S100A6 and ubiquitin as potential protein markers of apoptosis. Further validation using patient samples is required to confirm their potential utility in monitoring the effectiveness of anti-cancer drugs in inducing tumour cell apoptosis."

The objectives of this study were to further analyze COX-2 mRNA expression in patients with GERD compared to Barrett's esophagus (BE) and Barrett's cancer (BC).METHODS: Tissue samples from 110 patients with GERD (n = 43), BE (n = 20), and BC (n = 47) were obtained in routine upper GI endoscopy. Expression levels of COX-2 were measured by quantitative real-time reverse trancriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Also, 24-h pH monitoring was performed in all patients of the GERD study group and the DeMeester composite score was used to match COX-2 mRNA expression with the severity of acid exposure in the lower esophagus.RESULTS: COX-2 mRNA is progressively upregulated within the metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma (MDA) sequence (p = 0.001). COX-2 levels of the squamous epithelium in the distal esophagus from patients with GERD and a pathologic mean DeMeester score (&gt;14.72) were significantly higher than in patients with normal DeMeester scores (p = 0.01).CONCLUSION: In summary our findings suggest that alterations in COX-2 mRNA expression occur independently of endoscopic or histologic signs of GERD in the acid-exposed squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus. However, this early COX-2 increase in GERD is further upregulated within the MDA sequence for yet unknown reasons."

A major cause for unfavorable fragmentation is insufficient proton 'mobility' due to charge localization at strongly basic sites, in particular, the guanidine group of arginine. We have recently demonstrated that the conversion of the guanidine group of the arginine side chain by malondialdehyde (MDA) is a convenient tool to reduce the basicity of arginine residues and can have beneficial effects for peptide fragmentation. In the present work, we have focused on peptides that typically yield incomplete sequence information in CID-MS/MS experiments. Energy-resolved tandem MS experiments were carried out on angiotensins and arginine-containing phosphopeptides to study in detail the influence of the modification step on the fragmentation process. MDA modification dramatically improved the fragmentation behavior of peptides that exhibited only one or two dominant cleavages in their unmodified form. Neutral loss of phosphoric acid from phosphopeptides carrying phosphoserine and threonine residues was significantly reduced in favor of a higher abundance of fragment ions. Complementary experiments were carried out on three different instrumental platforms (triple-quadrupole, 3D ion trap, quadrupole-linear ion trap hybrid) to ascertain that the observation is a general effect."

Semi-quantitative data were obtained that were comparable in quality, but not in quantity, to data from DNA microarray hybridization analysis. In the chromosomal region where losses are frequent in breast, prostate, and other cancers, we detected a homozygous deletion of the SMAD4 gene in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line. We also observed partial or entire loss of expression in genes such as CCBE1, CCDC11, CD226, NP_115536.1, NP_689683.2, RNF152, SERPINB8, and TCF4 in certain breast and/or prostate cancer cell lines. An increase in gene expression was rare, but found with the transcription factor ONECUT2 gene in all of the cancer cell lines examined. Real-time qRT-PCR experiments confirmed these SM RT-PCR results. Further analysis of clinical specimens of breast cancer by real-time qRT-PCR demonstrated that the gene expression of CCBE1, TCF4, NP_115536.1, and NP_689683.2 was downregulated in the majority of clinical cases of breast cancer."

Most organisms that were genetically modified to lack the MsrA gene have shown shortening of their life span. Methionine sulfoxide reductases B (MsrB) proteins codified by three separate genes, named MsrB1, MsrB2, and MsrB3, are included in the Msrs system. To date, the mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional regulation of MsrB genes have not been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of MsrB1 selenoprotein levels through transcriptional regulation of the MsrB1 gene in MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines.RESULTS: A MsrB1 gene promoter is located 169 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site. It contains three Sp1 binding sites which are sufficient for maximal promoter activity in transient transfection experiments. High levels of MsrB1 transcript, protein and promoter activity were detected in low metastatic MCF7 human breast cancer cells. On the contrary, very low levels of both MsrB1 transcript and promoter activity were detected in the highly metastatic counterpart MDA-MB231 cells.A pivotal role for Sp1 in the constitutive expression of the MsrB1 gene was demonstrated through transient expression of mutant MsrB1 promoter-reporter gene constructs and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Since Sp1 is ubiquitously expressed, these sites, while necessary, are not sufficient to explain the patterns of gene expression of MsrB1 in various human breast cancer cells. MDA-MB231 cells can be induced to express MsrB1 by treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a demethylating agent. Therefore, the MsrB1 promoter is controlled by epigenetic modifications.CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide the first insights into the transcriptional regulation of the human MsrB1 gene, including the discovery that the Sp1 transcription factor may play a central role in its expression. We also demonstrated that the MsrB1 promoter activity appears to be controlled by epigenetic modifications such as methylation."

We have also reported that these antitumor effects are associated with activation of multiple signaling pathways, including STAT-3, STAT-1, Jun-N-Terminal kinase (JNK), and Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), the latter being found to mediate its antiinvasive action in MDA-MB-435 cells. The present experiments were designed to test the effect of DFMO on the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and determine its biological significance. We found that DFMO administration (1 mM) to MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells significantly increased cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation as well as the transactivation of pCRE-luc, a CREB-dependent promoter activated by PKA. To determine the significance of this biochemical effect of DFMO, we used the PKA inhibitor H89 which, as expected, suppressed in a dose-dependent manner (1 and 10 microM) basal and DFMO-induced CREB phosphorylation in our system. Administration of H89 alone was able to suppress proliferation of MDA-MB-435 cells when used at a concentration (10 microM) shown to completely block basal CREB phosphorylation. At concentrations of 0.5 and 1 muM, H89 treatment, while having no antiproliferative effect of its own, potentiated in a dose-dependent fashion the growth inhibitory action of a suboptimal concentration of DFMO (0.01 mM). Ten micromoles of H89 reduced invasiveness of MDA-MB-435 cells in matrigel by approximately 40% (an effect similar to that of 1 mM DFMO). The combination treatment further reduced invasiveness by approximately 80% (P &lt; 0.01 versus the individual treatments). H89 treatment (10 microM) partially reduced DFMO-induced phosphorylation of STAT-3 but not that of STAT-1, Extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), and JNK. In conclusion, our results indicate that PKA signaling exerts proproliferative and proinvasive effects in our experimental system. Therefore, its activation by DFMO represents a compensatory mechanism which should be blocked in order to maximize the antitumor action of the drug. Our data are also consistent with the notion that STAT-3 activation by DFMO is at least in part mediated through the PKA pathway."

We examined the effects of lycopene on breast cancer cell lines using pangenomic arrays. Lycopene is derived predominantly from tomatoes and tomato products and there is some epidemiologic evidence for a preventive role in breast cancer. Previously, we investigated lycopene in breast cancer using a dedicated breast cancer microarray. To confirm these results and explore pathways other than those implicated in breast cancer, for this study we used pangenomic arrays containing 25,000 oligonucleotides. This in vitro study assayed two human mammary cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), and a fibrocystic breast cell line (MCF-10a) treated or not with 10 microM lycopene for 48 h. A competitive hybridization was performed between Cy3-labeled lycopene treated RNA and Cy5-labeled untreated RNA to define differentially expressed genes. Using t-test analysis, a subset of 391 genes was found to be differentially modulated by lycopene between estrogen-positive cells (MCF-7) and estrogen-negative cells (MDA-MB-231, MCF-10a). Hierarchical clustering revealed 726 discriminatory genes between breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) and the fibrocystic breast cell line (MCF-10a).

We evaluated cell viability in four breast cancer cell lines (i.e., MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and SKBR3) that were treated with PTX and GEM combined either simultaneously (PTX + GEM) or sequentially (PTX --&gt; GEM; GEM --&gt; PTX). PTX-GEM interactions at the cellular level were assessed mathematically employing both the isobologram analysis (Berenbaum) and the combination index (Chou-Talalay) method. PTX-GEM molecular interactions on the apoptotic markers PARP, Bcl-2 and Bax were analyzed by immunoblotting procedures. Apoptosis was detected using a DNA ladder assay. We observed significant synergistic growth inhibitory interactions when PTX was administered before GEM. Additive interactions were observed when both the simultaneous regimen and the GEM followed by PTX regimen were used. DNA ladder and Western blotting results in the PTX followed by GEM sequence revealed a significant increase in the apoptotic cell death of breast cancer cells related to the Bax/Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway. In summary, the occurrence of clinically relevant synergism between PTX and GEM suggests a sequence-dependent nature in human breast cancer cells. This synergistic interaction on the PTXright curved arrow GEM schedule appears to be related to an increase in the Bcl-2-related mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The synergism that we have observed may explain the favorable clinical responses that have been achieved in clinical studies, in which patients are administered PTX first, and then GEM."

The sequence specificity of this compound was assessed by a Taq polymerase stop assay, identifying the sites of covalent modification on plasmid DNA. The adenine-N3 adducts were confirmed at AT-rich sequences using a thermally induced strand cleavage assay. These studies reveal that this compound retains the inherent sequence selectivity of the related natural compounds. The AS-I-145 sensitivity of yeast mutants deficient in excision and post-replication repair (PRR) pathways was assessed. The sensitivity profile suggests that the sequence-specific adenine-N3 adducts are substrates for nucleotide excision repair (NER) but not base excision repair (BER). Single-strand ligation PCR was employed to follow the induction and repair of the lesions at nucleotide resolution in yeast cells. Sequence specificity was preserved in intact cells, and adduct elimination occurred in a transcription-coupled manner and was dependent on a functional NER pathway and Rad18. The involvement of NER as the predominant excision pathway was confirmed in mammalian DNA repair mutant cells. AS-I-145 showed good in vivo antitumor activity in the National Cancer Institute standard hollow fiber assay and was active against the human breast MDA-MD-435 xenograft when administered i.v. or p.o.

As naturally occurring bacteria, biotypes of Pasteuria penetrans are attractive candidates for the biocontrol of various Meloidogyne spp. (root-knot nematodes). Failure to culture these bacteria outside their hosts has prevented isolation of genomic DNA in quantities sufficient for identification of genes associated with host recognition and virulence. We have applied multiple-strand displacement amplification (MDA) to generate DNA for comparative genomics of biotypes exhibiting different host preferences. Using the genome of Bacillus subtilis as a paradigm, MDA allowed quantitative detection and sequencing of 12 marker genes from 2000 cells. Meloidogyne spp. infected with P. penetrans P20 or B4 contained single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the spoIIAB gene that did not change the amino acid sequence, or that substituted amino acids with similar chemical properties. Individual nematodes infected with P. penetrans P20 or B4 contained SNPs in the spoIIAB gene sequenced in MDA-generated products.

Statistically significant transcripts of genes with very high differential expression were further validated by QPCR in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines expressing exogenous and endogenous S100A7. S100A7 expression correlated with increases in genes associated with MHC class II receptor activity, antigen processing and antigen presentation, and immune cell activation.

The Hu/Mu ProtIn microarray contains 516 and 456 probe sets that survey human and mouse genes of interest (proteases, protease inhibitors, or interactors), respectively. To investigate the performance of the array, gene expression profiles were analyzed in pure mouse and human samples (reference RNA; normal and tumor cell lines/tissues) and orthotopically implanted xenografts of human A549 lung and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinomas. Relative gene expression and &quot;present-call&quot; P values were determined for each probe set using dChip and MAS5 software, respectively.

Bcl-2 protein expression prevented the p53Delta291-mediated increase in Bcl-2 promoter activity although immunoprecipitation demonstrated that only a small proportion of the wild-type p53 but not p53Delta91 protein interacts with Bcl-2. Unless levels of ectopically expressed mutant p53 were extremely high, stable expression of mutant p53 in MCF-7 cells moderately increased Bcl-2 protein levels. Expression of mutant p53 did not alter E2 regulation of Bcl-2, however, mutation of the uORF prevented regulation by both mutant p53 and E2. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of WT p53 strongly reduced Bcl-2 expression in ER(-)/mut p53 MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together these data support the position that mutant p53 behaves in a dominant &quot;positive&quot; manner relieving repression by WT p53 or another Bcl-2 transcriptional inhibitor in a manner independent of nuclear translocation."

However, the mechanism for this is largely unknown. Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is an important divalent cation transporter. The aim of the present study is to construct recombinant adenovirus encoding human DMT1 with iron responsive element (DMT1+IRE) and infect MES23.5 dopaminergic cells in order to investigate the relationship between increased DMT1+IRE expression and iron accumulation. The human DMT1 gene was obtained by RT-PCR from tissues of human duodenum. AdDMT1+IRE was successfully constructed and identified by PCR, restriction endonuclease analyses and DNA sequencing, respectively. It was able to efficiently infect MES23.5 cells, which was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blots. When incubated with 100 microM ferrous iron for 6h, the intracellular iron levels dramatically increased in AdDMT1+IRE infected MES23.5 cells compared to the solely adenovirus infected cells. Meanwhile, the levels of hydroxyl free radicals and malondialdehyde (MDA) in these cells increased. This led to the activation of caspase-3. The apoptosis in AdDMT1+IRE infected cells was shown with hypercondensed nuclei using Hoechst staining. Analysis of DNA extracted from these cells showed the typical &quot;ladder pattern&quot;, indicating the formation of mono- and oligonucleosomes. These results suggested that increased DMT1+IRE expression in MES23.5 cells caused the increased intracellular iron accumulation. This resulted in the increased oxidative stress leading to ultimate cell apoptosis."

We evaluated a promising method for whole-genome amplification, called multiple displacement amplification (MDA), with respect to even and accurate representation of retrovirally transduced genomic DNA. We proved that MDA is a suitable method to subsequently quantify engraftment efficiencies by quantitative real-time PCR by analyzing retrovirally transduced DNA in a background of untransduced DNA and retroviral integrations found in primary material from a retroviral transplantation model. The portion of these retroviral integrations in the amplified samples was 1.02-fold (range 0.2, to 2.1-fold) the portion determined in the original genomic DNA. Integration site analysis by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) is essential for the detection of retroviral integrations. The combination of MDA and LM-PCR showed an increase in the sensitivity of integration site analysis, as a specific integration site could be detected in a background of untransduced DNA, while the transduced DNA made up only 0.001%. These results show for the first time that MDA enables large-scale sensitive detection and reliable quantification of retrovirally transduced human genomic DNA and therefore facilitates follow-up analysis in gene therapy studies even from the smallest amounts of starting material."

It was demonstrated that vacuolar H+-ATPase (EC 3.6.3.14) and PM H+-ATPase (EC 3.6.3.6) differed in sensitivity to heavy metals. Exposure of cucumber seedlings to Cd, Cu and Ni had no significant effect on the activity of the vacuolar proton pump and, in the case of Ni, also on the activity of the PM proton pump. In contrast, Cd and Cu ions diminished both ATP hydrolysis and proton transport in plasma membranes. Transcript levels of genes encoding PM enzyme as well as the subunit A of tonoplast enzyme in roots stressed with heavy metals were similar to the control. Cd, Cu and Ni were accumulated in cucumber roots with similar efficiency, but their relative distribution between the symplast and apoplast differed. To explain the mechanism of heavy metal action on the plasma membranes of cucumber roots, the MDA content, as a lipid peroxidation product, and fatty acid composition were analyzed. It was shown that exposure of plants to Cd, Cu and Ni did not enhance the lipid peroxidation in the PM fraction. However, all metals caused an increase in the saturation of PM fatty acids and a decrease in the length of the fatty acid chain."

It also exerts immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic effects, as well as potent antitumor bystander effects, making it an ideal candidate for a new anticancer gene therapy. Here, we examined the feasibility of adeno-associated virus type 1 (AAV1) vector-mediated systemic gene therapy using mda-7/IL24. In vitro studies showed that medium conditioned by AAV1-mda7-transducedC2C12 cells induces tumor cell-specific apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis in a human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assay. To assess the in vivo effects of AAV1-mediated systemic delivery of MDA-7/IL24, we generated a subcutaneous tumor model by injecting Ehrlich ascites tumor cells into the dorsum of DDY mice. A single intravenous injection of AAV1-mda7 (2.0 x 10(11) viral genomes) significantly inhibited tumor growth. In addition, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), and immunohistochemical analyses showed significant induction of tumor-cell-specific apoptosis and reduction of microvessel formation within the tumors, and there was a significant increase in survival among the AAV1-mda7-treated mice. These results clearly demonstrate that continuous systemic delivery of MDA-7/IL24 can serve as an effective treatment for cancer. Thus, AAV1 vector-mediated systemic delivery of MDA-7/IL24 represents a potentially important new approach to anticancer therapy."

Here we show that the major capsid protein of GTA, expressed in E. coli, can be assembled into prohead-like structures in the presence of calcium ions in vitro. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of uranyl acetate staining material and thin sections of glutaraldehyde-fixed material demonstrates that these associates have spherical structures with diameters in the range of 27-35 nm. The analysis of scanning TEM images revealed particles of mass approximately 4.3 MDa, representing 101+/-11 copies of the monomeric subunit. The establishment of this simple and rapid method to form prohead-like particles permits the GTA system to be used for genome manipulation within the photosynthetic bacterium, for specific targeted drug delivery, and for the construction of biologically based distributed autonomous sensors for environmental monitoring."

Activation of retinoid pathways is also in development for cancer treatment. Retinoic acid receptor-beta-the tumor suppressor and main retinoid mediator--is silenced in many tumors. The ErbB-1 inhibitor PD153035 cooperates with retinoic acid during growth inhibition and induces retinoic acid receptor-beta suggesting that ErbB-1 controls retinoic acid receptor-beta. However, here we demonstrate that ErbB pathways are not involved in PD153035-mediated retinoic acid receptor-beta-upregulation. PD153035 inhibits ErbB-1-phosphorylation, whereas its derivative EBE-A22 is inactive. Yet both inhibit cell growth and upregulate retinoic acid receptor-beta in ErbB-1-overexpressing (MDA-MB-468), moderately expressing (OVCAR-3), ErbB-1-negative (MDA-MB-453) or ErbB-negative cells (CEM, Jurkat). Both bind DNA, whereas the closely related ErbB-1 inhibitors AG1478 and ZD1839, which are inactive on retinoic acid receptor-beta, do not significantly bind DNA. None of the other ErbB-1/ErbB-2 inhibitors tested (RG-14620, LFM-A12, AG879, AG825) affect retinoic acid receptor-beta. PD153035 decreases methylation of the retinoic acid receptor-beta2 promoter. In OVCAR-3, it stimulates dislodgement of histone deacetylase 1 from the promoter and acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Consequently, PD153035 facilitates recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter and stimulates transcriptional activity. Moreover, PD153035 increases the retinoic acid receptor-beta mRNA half-life. No other retinoid receptor, nor estrogen receptor-alpha, nor RASSF1A is upregulated by PD153035. Thus PD153035 induces retinoic acid receptor-beta by ErbB-independent transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. This report highlights a triple action for an ErbB-1 inhibitor (ErbB-1 inhibition, DNA intercalation, retinoic acid receptor-beta-induction). Such multitargeting drugs bear great potential for cancer treatment."

However, the accuracy of existing methods is limited. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based prediction method that assigns a measure called the local match rate to each position of an amino acid sequence to estimate the confidence of our method. Empirically, the accuracy of the method correlates positively with the local match rate; therefore, we employ it to predict the local structures of positions with a high local match rate. For positions with a low local match rate, we propose a neural network prediction method. To better utilize the knowledge-based and neural network methods, we design a hybrid prediction method, HYPLOSP (HYbrid method to Protein LOcal Structure Prediction) that combines both methods. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we first perform cross-validation experiments by applying our knowledge-based method, a neural network method, and HYPLOSP to a large dataset of 3,925 protein chains. We test our methods extensively on three different structural alphabets and evaluate their performance by two widely used criteria, Maximum Deviation of backbone torsion Angle (MDA) and Q(N), which is similar to Q(3) in secondary structure prediction. We then compare HYPLOSP with three previous studies using a dataset of 56 new protein chains. HYPLOSP shows promising results in terms of MDA and Q(N) accuracy and demonstrates its alphabet-independent capability."

Single strand antisense transcription system targeting specific p53 mutation site (mt-p53) was constructed, and corresponding antisense RNA was prepared. The hybridization of antisense RNA with its corresponding mt-p53 gene was confirmed by in-situ hybridization. Human breast cancer cells were transfected with antisense RNA by cationic liposome-mediated method. Time course of effects of antisense RNA was investigated by immunocytochemical staining and cell growth inhibiting assay. Expression of mt-p53 protein was examined by Western blot. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay and cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay.RESULTS: Mutation of p53 exon 8 was found in MDA-MB-231 cells and antisense transcription system (pGEM3zf (+/-) p53exon8) was then constructed successfully. In transfected MDA-MB-231 cells, hybridization signals were observed in cytoplasm.

Nine representative strains were isolated from a range of surfaces and were grown in YEB medium and harvested during the late exponential growth phase. Bacterial biomass and spent culture medium were extracted with ethanol and ethyl acetate, respectively. Extracts were assayed for their antifouling activity using two tests: (1) antimicrobial well diffusion test against a common fouling bacterium, Halomonas marina, and (2) anti-crustacean activity test using Artemia salina. Our results showed that none of the ethanolic extracts (bacterial biomass) were active in either test. In contrast, most of the organic extracts had antimicrobial activity (88%) and were toxic towards A. salina (67%). Sequencing of full 16 S ribosomal DNA analysis showed that the isolates were related to Bacillus mojavensis and Bacillus firmus.

Nevertheless, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of TP expression in such cancers. Promoter methylation of dinucleotide cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites is a known mechanism of reversible gene expression silencing.METHODS: TP promoter methylation was investigated in five cancer cell lines (SKBR-3, 786-O, HT-29, MDA-231, DLD-1). TP mRNA levels were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. The degree of methylation was identified by bisulfite sequencing. Minimal TP promoter activity was determined by Luciferase reporter assays. DNA-protein interactions were evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.RESULTS: SKBR-3 cells exhibited the highest TP expression, 786-O, HT-29, and MDA-231 cells exhibited intermediate TP expression, while DLD-1 cells did not express TP as demonstrated by TP mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity levels. SKBR-3 lacked methylation in the TP promoter, intron 1 and exon 1 regions, while DLD-1 showed extensive methylation. Treatment of DLD-1 and SKBR-3 with the methylation-inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-2dC), resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in TP mRNA and protein levels in DLD-1 but not SKBR-3 cells. Trichostatin-A treatment, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, improved the 5-aza-2dC-induced TP re-activation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that methylation significantly inhibits transcription factor binding. Supershift analyses suggest that the Sp1 and Sp3 (to a lesser degree) transcription factors have a role in the regulation of TP expression.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that TP promoter methylation is a mechanism for down-regulation of TP expression in cancer cells and may have implications in modulating prognosis of cancer patients."

These novel matrices could improve ssDNA sequencing performances due to interactions between GNPs and polymer chains and the formation of physical cross-linking points as demonstrated by intrinsic viscosities and glass transition temperatures. The effects of the parameters in relation to quasi-IPN/GNPs matrices, such as GNP contents, GNP particle sizes, LPA molecular masses, and solution concentrations, on ssDNA sequencing performances were studied. In the presence of GNPs, the separation had the advantages of high resolution, speediness, excellent reproducibility, long shelf life and easy automation. Therefore, less viscous matrix solutions (with moderate size GNPs) due to lower solution concentration and lower-molecular-mass LPA could be used to replace more viscous solutions (without GNPs) due to higher solution concentration or higher-molecular-mass LPA to separate DNA, while the sieving performances were approximate even higher, which helped to achieve full automation especial for capillary array electrophoresis (CAE) and microchip electrophoresis (MCE)."

The existence of homology sequences to sequences belonging to other human pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae like Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella and Salmonella was also observed. The presence of these sequences in this plasmid could indicate that there is horizontal genetic transfer between bacterial strains isolated from different host species. In conclusion, the present study suggests that APEC strains harbor high-molecular weight plasmids that present pathogenicity-related sequences and that these are probably responsible for the pathogenicity exhibited by these strains. The presence of human pathogenicity-associated sequences in APEC conjugative plasmids suggests that these strains could represent a zoonotic risk."

The expression of ER and progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA as well as the production of ER protein were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot method, respectively. MTI assay was used to examine the function of re-expressed ER protein.RESULTS: The ER gene promoter was highly methylated, while ER mRNA and ER protein were not expressed in the ER-negative breast cell line MDA-MB-231. The ER-negative breast cells treated with demethylating agent 5 -aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-2'-deoxyC) restored the expression of ER mRNA and ER protein. Expression of the endogenous ER-responsive PR gene was activated and the methylation of ER gene was simultaneously decreased. After MDA-MB-231 was treated with 5-AZA-2'-deoxyC, the protein of ER was re-expressed and the growth of cells treated with tamoxifen were inhibited significantly (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: inactivation of ER gene has a close relationship with the abnormal methylation of ER gene promoter. 5-AZA-2'-deoxyC may effectively cause demethylation and restore functional expression of ER silenced by aberrant hypermethylation.

Here, we examined whether PTHrP(38-94) amide was able to modulate gene expression of MDA-MB231 cells, employing a combination of conventional, differential display and semi-quantitative multiplex PCR techniques.

Moreover, recent evidence suggests that senescent tumor cells release DNA into the circulation, which is subsequently carried by the blood and thus enriched in the serum and plasma. We tested 10 head and neck cancer patients (5 with malignant melanomas (MM) and 5 with adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC)) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based microsatellite analysis of DNA from white blood cells and paired plasma samples. Our goal was to amplify two microsatellite markers, D1S243 and D19S246, which sometimes show microsatellite alterations in head and neck cancer patients. However amplification of fragments from three loci in the plasma samples proved impossible, probably due to the small amounts of DNA isolated. We used multiple displacement amplification (MDA) to amplify genomic DNA from the plasma samples. Two microsatellite fragments were amplified from whole genome amplified DNA. Among 5 heterozygote samples, 3 showed the same pattern in DNA samples from both blood cells and plasma but 2 showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Although further study is necessary to confirm whether the LOH found in this study reflects alteration in circulating tumor cell DNA, application of whole genome amplification may allow DNA analysis from limited amounts of such DNA and provide a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure and useful aid in therapy."

Whereas steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) but not peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) was also reported to repress estrogen receptor (ER) transactivation of the synthetic 4ERE in Hep G2, the effects of these xenobiotic nuclear receptors (XNRs) on the endogenous estrogen responsive promotor remain to be determined. Effects of CAR, SXR, and PPAR-gamma on ER transactivation were also examined in three different kinds of breast cancer cell lines. However, except in MCF-7, studies were limited either in single dose response (MDA-MB-231) or with CAR only (MCF-7-K3). And there is presently no report on the effects of CAR, SXR, and PPAR-gamma on ER-mediated transactivation in ovarian-derived CHO-S cells. Accordingly, this article further examined the effects of the endogenous vitellogenin B1 estrogen responsive promotor on the SXR- and PPAR-gamma-modulated ER transactivation in Hep G2, and either dose-dependent or single dose effects of SXR, PPAR-gamma, and CAR in two different breast cancer cell lines and the ovarian-derived cell line respectively, on the ER-mediated transactivation of the synthetic (4ERE)-tk-luciferase reporter. Consistent with the previous report, CAR significantly repressed ER-mediated transactivation of the endogenous vitellogenin B1 promotor in Hep G2 cells. However, contrary to the effects on the synthetic promotor, PPAR-gamma potentiated whereas SXR did not have any effects on the ER transactivation of the vitellogenin promotor in Hep G2. In the breast cancer cell line of MDA-MB-231 in which endogenous ER is known not to be expressed, CAR modestly stimulated ER transactivation of the synthetic 4ERE in a low dose whereas both SXR and PPAR-gamma did not have any effects in all doses examined (20-500 ng). And in both CHO-S and estrogen-independent breast cancer cell line, MCF-7-K3, none of the three xenobiotic receptors significantly influenced the ER-mediated 4ERE transactivation in all doses examined.

Epirubicin, a stereoisomer of doxorubicin, is one of the commonly used anthracyclines. Anthracyclines while effective therapy for breast cancer, have their own unique toxicities, such as cardiomyopathy. l-Carnitine, a quarternary ammonium compound synthesized from methionine and lysine, is required for oxidative metabolism in mitochondria. Cardiac function is closely linked with oxidative metabolism whereby l-carnitine is an essential cofactor. A hypothesis is being investigated to determine if supplementation with carnitine in breast cancer patients treated with epirubicin will reduce the development of cardiac toxicity. We determined whether addition of l-carnitine altered the tumor cytotoxic effects of epirubicin using a number of in vitro cell viability assays in different breast cancer cell lines including BT549, MDA-MB-435, NCI-ADR-RES, MCF7 and T47D. Additionally we investigated the ability of cells to respond to l-carnitine following analysis of the expression of carnitine metabolic enzymes by RT-PCR. We determined that supplementation with l-carnitine had no effect on the ability of epirubicin to kill a variety of breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, no differences in the induction of apoptosis by epirubicin were observed. Furthermore, all cell lines examined expressed proteins required for carnitine uptake and use. Our data suggest that supplementation with l-carnitine does not impair the ability of epirubicin to kill breast cancer cells. These results suggest that supplementation with l-carnitine in patients undergoing epirubicin treatment could be safely used to reduce associated cardiotoxicities without fear that the efficacy of chemotherapy is jeopardized."

Two of the reported compounds (8a and 8b) stimulated specifically the proliferation of MCF-7 cells, but not that of estrogen receptor negative (ER-) human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, suggesting that their mitogenic activity is mediated by ER. Accordingly, the stimulating effect of 8a and 8b was suppressed by the pure antiestrogen fulvestrant. Besides, 8a and 8b induced ER down-regulation similar to that produced by classical ER agonists or pure antagonists. The effects of the compounds under study on ER-mediated transcription were assessed on (ER+) MVLN cells, that is, MCF-7 cells stably transfected with a pVit-tk-Luc reporter plasmid. Derivatives 8a and 8b, and surprisingly compound 8c, enhanced ER-mediated gene transactivation in that model. Finally, no coumarin was able to compete with tritiated 17beta-estradiol ([(3)H]E(2)) for ER binding, suggesting unconventional interactions with the receptor, such as interactions with the second binding pocket or with the coactivator-binding region. To conclude, observations performed in this study on compound 8c reveal that estrogenic activity can be dissociated from enhancement of cell proliferation. Furthermore, ERE-driven transactivation of transcription seems to be a condition necessary, but not sufficient, for estrogen-induced stimulation of cell growth."

ER antagonist ICI182780 blocked the E2 effect on BLM expression in MCF-7 cells. From these results we conclude that ER participates in up-regulation of BLM expression in MCF-7 cells by means of E2. Similar results were obtained when MCF-7 cells were treated with bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine-disrupting chemical having a weak estrogenic activity. The ER binding ability of BPA is estimated at 1/1000 of E2 ability, and in this study about 1000-times more BPA was needed for the same levels of estrogenic effect of E2. The expression of cell-cycle associated genes, cdc6, MCM5, MCM2, Myt1, PCNA and AuroraA were up-regulated by E2 and BPA treatment in MCF-7 cells accompanied by up-regulation of BLM. In this BLM promoter study, Sp1 elements in the upper region of BLM modulated transcription, but were not indispensable for E2 response. Our results suggested that up-regulation of BLM expression by E2 and BPA is ER-dependent and may be responsible for repair of DNA damage caused by the genotoxicity of these estrogenic agents."

Their nature as obligate biotrophic parasites and consequent inability to grow on culture media has significantly hampered research. A common bottleneck to the molecular genetic analysis of powdery mildew fungi is the availability of genomic DNA of suitable quality and in sufficient quantity. The so-called whole genome amplification technology has the potential to overcome this limitation. Here we present the application of phi29 DNA polymerase-mediated multiple displacement amplification (MDA) to amplify the whole genome of Podosphaera fusca, the main causal agent of powdery mildew in cucurbits, to address this problem. The genome coverage and fidelity of the MDA process was evaluated by PCR amplification and sequencing of two genetics markers: the nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (CYTB). Our results show that MDA is a valuable tool for molecular genetic analysis of powdery mildew fungi that can be used for a number of downstream applications in different fields, such as epidemiology and population genetics or systematics."

Whole-genome amplification (WGA) provides an opportunity to amplify the genome from a single blastomere to a level at which multiple tests can be performed on the same cell. Early WGA methods (primer extension preamplification and degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR) have not proved sufficiently accurate and reliable for routine clinical use. However, WGA using multiple displacement amplification (MDA) offers approx 5 million-fold amplification with fidelity, apparently sidestepping the limitation of a single cell, and is sufficient for use in most off-the-shelf molecular tests.

A 28-kDa polypeptide, related to an alkaline phosphatase (AP), was shown to be tightly linked to this 18-kDa polypeptide. The excreted 28-kDa polypeptide also displayed a consensus sequence similar to the group of DING proteins, but with a smaller molecular weight.

The recombinant luciferase reporter vectors pGL3-FAS, pGL3-cerbB2 and pGL3-midkine were constructed and their relative transcriptional activities in SKBR3, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and NIH3T3 cell lines were analyzed.RESULTS: FAS protein was expressed in all the three breast cancer cell lines with different levels (SKBR3&gt;MCF-7&gt;MDA-MB-231), but its expression in NIH3T3 was not detected. FAS protein was localized primarily in cytosol. FAS promoter showed relatively high transcriptional activities in breast cancer cell lines which were obviously higher than SV40 promoter and midkine promoter, but it showed little/no in transcriptional activities NIH3T3 cells. The transcriptional activity of FAS promoter was comparable to that of cerbB2 promoter in SKBR3 cells, but it was significantly higher than that in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines.CONCLUSION: FAS promoter can drive therapeutic gene in a wider range of human breast cancers than cerbB2 promoter and it exhibits a stronger activity than midkine promoter.

Here, using S. cerevisiae to produce recombinant dynein with a chemically controlled dimerization switch, we show by structural and single-molecule analysis that processivity requires two dynein motor domains but not dynein's tail domain or any associated subunits. Dynein advances most frequently in 8 nm steps, although longer as well as side and backward steps are observed. Individual motor domains show a different stepping pattern, which is best explained by the two motor domains shuffling in an alternating manner between rear and forward positions. Our results suggest that cytoplasmic dynein moves processively through the coordination of its two motor domains, but its variable step size and direction suggest a considerable diffusional component to its step, which differs from Kinesin-1 and is more akin to myosin VI."

A3G is expressed either as an enzymatically active low-molecular-mass (LMM) form or as an enzymatically inactive high-molecular-mass (HMM) ribonucleoprotein complex. Resting CD4 T cells exclusively express LMM A3G, where it functions as a powerful postentry restriction factor for HIV-1. Activation of CD4 T cells promotes the recruitment of LMM A3G into 5- to 15-MDa HMM complexes whose function is unknown. Using tandem affinity purification techniques coupled with MS, we identified Staufen-containing RNA-transporting granules and Ro ribonucleoprotein complexes as specific components of HMM A3G complexes. Analysis of RNAs in these complexes revealed Alu and small Y RNAs, two of the most prominent nonautonomous mobile genetic elements in human cells. These retroelement RNAs are recruited into Staufen-containing RNA-transporting granules in the presence of A3G. Retrotransposition of Alu and hY RNAs depends on the reverse transcriptase machinery provided by long interspersed nucleotide elements 1 (L1). We now show that A3G greatly inhibits L1-dependent retrotransposition of marked Alu retroelements not by inhibiting L1 function but by sequestering Alu RNAs in cytoplasmic HMM A3G complexes away from the nuclear L1 enzymatic machinery. These findings identify nonautonomous Alu and hY retroelements as natural cellular targets of A3G and highlight how different forms of A3G uniquely protect cells from the threats posed by exogenous retroviruses (LMM A3G) and endogenous retroelements (HMM A3G)."

To gain a better understanding of the role of constitutive Stat3 signaling in breast cancer progression, we evaluated the expression profile of potential Stat3-regulated genes that may confer resistance to apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Stat3 signaling was blocked with antisense oligonucleotides in human MDA-MB-435s breast cancer cells and Affymetrix GeneChip microarray analysis was done. The candidate Stat3 target gene Survivin was further evaluated in molecular assays using cultured breast cancer cells and immunohistochemistry of breast tumor specimens.RESULTS: Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, was identified as a potential Stat3-regulated gene by microarray analysis. This was confirmed in Survivin gene promoter studies and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showing that Stat3 directly binds to and regulates the Survivin promoter. Furthermore, direct inhibition of Stat3 signaling blocked the expression of Survivin protein and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Direct inhibition of Survivin expression also induced apoptosis. Increased Survivin protein expression correlates significantly (P = 0.001) with elevated Stat3 activity in primary breast tumor specimens from high-risk patients who were resistant to chemotherapy treatment.CONCLUSIONS: We identify Survivin as a direct downstream target gene of Stat3 in human breast cancer cells that is critical for their survival in culture. Our findings suggest that activated Stat3 signaling contributes to breast cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy by, at least in part, inducing expression of the antiapoptotic protein, Survivin."

Trimethylation of H3-K9 by the recently identified euchromatic histone methyltransferase SETDB1/ESET may be responsible for transcriptional repression of certain promoters. Here, we show that SETDB1 associates with endogenous DNA methyltransferase activity. SETDB1 interacts with the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B but not with the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1. The interaction of SETDB1 with DNMT3A was further characterized and confirmed by in vivo and in vitro interaction studies. A direct interaction of the two proteins occurs through the N terminus of SETDB1 and the plant homeodomain of DNMT3A. Co-expression of SETDB1 and DNMT3A was essential for repression of reporter gene expression in a Gal4-based tethering assay and resulted in their recruitment to the artificial promoter. We further demonstrate that the CpG-methylated promoters of the endogenous p53BP2 gene in HeLa cells and the RASSF1A gene in MDA-MB-231 cells are simultaneously occupied by both SETDB1 and DNMT3A proteins, which provides evidence for SETDB1 being at least partly responsible for H3-K9 trimethylation at the promoter of RASSF1A, a gene frequently silenced in human cancers. In summary, our data demonstrate the direct physical interaction and functional connection between the H3-K9 trimethylase SETDB1 and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and thus contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of the self-reinforcing heterochromatin machinery operating at silenced promoters."

However, approximately 30% of invasive breast cancers are hormone independent because they lack ER expression due to hypermethylation of ER promoter. Treatment of ER-negative breast cancer cells with demethylating agents [5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC)] and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (trichostatin A) leads to expression of ER mRNA and functional protein. Here, we examined whether epigenetically reactivated ER is a target for tamoxifen therapy. Following treatment with trichostatin A and 5-aza-dC, the formerly unresponsive ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells became responsive to tamoxifen. Tamoxifen-mediated inhibition of cell growth in these cells is mediated at least in part by the tamoxifen-bound ER. Tamoxifen-bound reactivated ER induces transcriptional repression at estrogen-responsive genes by ordered recruitment of multiple distinct chromatin-modifying complexes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show recruitment of two different corepressor complexes to ER-responsive promoters in a mutually exclusive and sequential manner: the nuclear receptor corepressor-HDAC3 complex followed by nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation complex. The mechanistic insight provided by this study might help in designing therapeutic strategies directed toward epigenetic mechanisms in the prevention or treatment of breast cancer."

The BRCA1 protein is involved in the regulation of DNA repair. How specific tumor-associated mutations affect the molecular function of BRCA1, however, awaits further elucidation. Cell lines that harbor BRCA1 gene mutations are invaluable tools for such functional studies. Up to now, the HCC1937 cell line was the only human breast cancer cell line with an identified BRCA1 mutation. In this study, we identified three other BRCA1 mutants from among 41 human breast cancer cell lines by sequencing of the complete coding sequence of BRCA1.

All three mutations were accompanied by loss of the other BRCA1 allele. The 185delAG and 5396 + 1G&gt;A mutations are both classified as pathogenic mutations. In contrast with wild-type cell lines, none of the BRCA1 mutants expressed nuclear BRCA1 proteins as detected with Ab-1 and Ab-2 anti-BRCA1 monoclonal antibodies.

Little is known about the role of the key prostaglandin catabolic enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) in breast cancer pathogenesis. Using a pharmacologically based screen for epigenetically silenced genes, we found low levels of 15-PGDH in MDA-MB-231 cells [estrogen receptor (ER) negative] but high levels in MCF-7 cells (ER positive) and observed its up-regulation following demethylation treatment. Further analysis revealed methylation of the 15-PGDH promoter in one breast cancer cell line and 30% of primary tumors. Analysis of 15-PGDH expression revealed low levels in 40% of primary breast tumors and identified a correlation between 15-PGDH and ER expression. Transfection assays showed that transient up-regulation of 15-PGDH levels in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a decreased clonal growth, and stable up-regulation significantly decreased the ability of these cells to form tumors in athymic mice. In contrast, transient silencing of 15-PGDH in MCF-7 cells resulted in their enhanced proliferation, and a stable silencing in these cells enhanced cell cycle entry in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Forced expression of 15-PGDH inhibited the ER pathway and silencing of 15-PGDH up-regulated expression of aromatase. In addition, 15-PGDH levels were down-regulated by estrogen but up-regulated by the tumor suppressor gene CAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha. Our results indicate for the first time that 15-PGDH may be a novel tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer, and suggest that this enzyme can modulate the ER pathway."

In previous studies, we have shown that the Arabidopsis thaliana ALDH3I1 gene is transcriptionally activated by abiotic stress, and over-expression of the ALDH3I1 gene confers stress tolerance in transgenic plants. The A. thaliana genome contains 14 ALDH genes expressed in different sub-cellular compartments and are presumably involved in different reactions. The purpose of this study was to compare the potential of a cytoplasmic and a chloroplastic stress-inducible ALDH in conferring stress tolerance under different conditions. We demonstrated that constitutive or stress-inducible expression of both the chloroplastic ALDH3I1 and the cytoplasmic ALDH7B4 confers tolerance to osmotic and oxidative stress. Stress tolerance in transgenic plants is accompanied by a reduction of H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) derived from cellular lipid peroxidation. Involvement of ALDHs in stress tolerance was corroborated by the analysis of ALDH3I1 and ALDH7B4 T-DNA knockout (KO) mutants. Both mutant lines exhibited higher sensitivity to dehydration and salt than wild-type (WT) plants. The results indicate that ALDH3I1 and ALDH7B4 not only function as aldehyde-detoxifying enzymes, but also as efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers and lipid peroxidation-inhibiting enzymes. The potential of ALDHs to interfere with H2O2 was also shown for recombinant bacterial proteins."

We show here that TLR9 protein is expressed in human breast cancer cells and clinical breast cancer samples. Stimulation of TLR9-expressing breast cancer cells with the TLR9 agonistic CpG oligonucleotides (1-10 mumol/L) dramatically increased their in vitro invasion in both Matrigel assays and three-dimensional collagen cultures. Similar effects on invasion were seen in TLR9-expressing astrocytoma and glioblastoma cells and in the immortalized human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A. This effect was not, however, dependent on the CpG content of the TLR9 ligands because the non-CpG oligonucleotides induced invasion of TLR9-expressing cells. CpG or non-CpG oligonucleotide-induced invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells was blunted by chloroquine and they did not induce invasion of TLR9(-) breast cancer cells. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with CpG or non-CpG oligonucleotides induced the formation of approximately 50-kDa gelatinolytic band in zymograms. This band and the increased invasion were abolished by a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001 but not by a serine proteinase inhibitor aprotinin. Furthermore, CpG oligonucleotide treatment decreased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 expression and increased levels of active MMP-13 in TLR9-expressing but not TLR9(-) breast cancer cells without affecting MMP-8. Neutralizing anti-MMP-13 antibodies inhibited the CpG oligonucleotide-induced invasion. These findings suggest that infections may promote cancer progression through a novel TLR9-mediated mechanism. They also propose a new molecular target for cancer therapy, because TLR9 has not been associated with cancer invasiveness previously."

Here, we use the clinically relevant HDAC inhibitor, LBH589 (LBH) to explore the roles of HDAC in ER gene silencing. In the ER-negative human breast cancer lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, treatment with LBH for 24 hours restored ER mRNA and protein expression without a concomitant demethylation of the CpG island at the ER promoter. The expression of ER mRNA was sustained at least 96 hours after withdrawal of LBH treatment. Restoration of ER expression by LBH enhanced 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen sensitivity in MDA-MB-231 cells. The molecular mechanisms by which LBH reactivated silenced ER gene in MDA-MB-231 cells were examined with emphasis on chromatin structure reorganization. By chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, LBH treatment released DNMT1, HDAC1, and the H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) methyltransferase SUV39H 1 from the ER promoter. Such changes were associated with an active chromatin formation manifested as accumulation of acetylated histones H3 and H4, a decrease in methylated H3-K9, and an impaired binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1 alpha) at the promoter. Our findings suggest that HDAC inhibitors could restore expression of the silenced ER gene by reorganizing the heterochromatin-associated proteins without alteration in promoter DNA hypermethylation."

At the genetic level, CLCs show recurrent physical loss of chromosome16q coupled with the lack of E-cadherin (CDH1 gene) expression. However, little is known about the putative therapeutic targets for these tumors. The aim of this study was to characterize CLCs at the molecular genetic level and identify putative therapeutic targets.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We subjected 13 cases of CLC to a comprehensive molecular analysis including immunohistochemistry for E-cadherin, estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2/neu and p53; high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH); microarray-based CGH (aCGH); and fluorescent and chromogenic in situ hybridization for CCND1 and FGFR1.RESULTS: All cases lacked the expression of E-cadherin, p53, and HER2, and all but one case was positive for estrogen receptors. HR-CGH revealed recurrent gains on 1q and losses on 16q (both, 85%). aCGH showed a good agreement with but higher resolution and sensitivity than HR-CGH. Recurrent, high level gains at 11q13 (CCND1) and 8p12-p11.2 were identified in seven and six cases, respectively, and were validated with in situ hybridization. Examination of aCGH and the gene expression profile data of the cell lines, MDA-MB-134 and ZR-75-1, which harbor distinct gains of 8p12-p11.2, identified FGFR1 as a putative amplicon driver of 8p12-p11.2 amplification in MDA-MB-134. Inhibition of FGFR1 expression using small interfering RNA or a small-molecule chemical inhibitor showed that FGFR1 signaling contributes to the survival of MDA-MB-134 cells.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that receptor FGFR1 inhibitors may be useful as therapeutics in a subset of CLCs."

Using real-time, quantitative PCR, laser capture microdissection, and immunohistochemistry, distinctive patterns of expression of the hedgehog pathway members patched 1 (PTCH1), smoothened, GLI1, GLI2 and the 3 hedgehog ligands were identified for epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts in benign breast and breast cancer. Hedgehog ligands were expressed at higher levels in some cancer epithelial cell lines compared to noncancerous epithelial cells. Correspondingly, expression of GLI1, a transcription factor and transcriptional product of hedgehog signaling, was increased 8-fold in cancer epithelial cell lines; however, PTCH1, also a transcriptional target of hedgehog signaling in many cell types, was not increased. GLI1 protein and mRNA, and PTCH1 and sonic hedgehog (SHH) proteins were elevated in 3 of 10 breast cancers; however, PTCH1 transcripts were not consistently increased. Hedgehog-mediated transcription, as indicated by a reporter of GLI-dependent promoter activity and by expression of GLI1 transcripts, was reduced by the hedgehog pathway inhibitor cyclopamine in both MDA-MB-435 cancer epithelial cells and MCF10AT epithelial cells, a cell line derived from benign breast. However, cyclopamine reduced viability of cancer epithelial cell lines, including MDA-MB-435, but did not specifically affect fibroblasts or epithelial cells from benign breast, including MCF10AT. Treatment with sonic hedgehog ligand diminished the cyclopamine-induced reduction in GLI-dependent promoter activity in MCF10AT and MDA-MB-435 and viability of MDA-MB-435. These results demonstrate modulation of GLI-mediated transcription in both cancer and benign-derived epithelial cells by cyclopamine and sonic hedgehog, and further suggest that hedgehog signaling contributes to the survival of only the cancer epithelial cells. Determination as to whether the increase in GLI1 and SHH expression in breast cancer indicates a significant increase in hedgehog signaling will require further evaluation."

Recent studies suggest that resveratrol possesses anticancer effects, although its mechanism of action is not well understood. We now show that resveratrol inhibits Src tyrosine kinase activity and thereby blocks constitutive signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) protein activation in malignant cells. Analyses of resveratrol-treated malignant cells harboring constitutively-active Stat3 reveal irreversible cell cycle arrest of v-Src-transformed mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3/v-Src), human breast (MDA-MB-231), pancreatic (Panc-1), and prostate carcinoma (DU145) cell lines at the G0-G1 phase or at the S phase of human breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) and pancreatic cancer (Colo-357) cells, and loss of viability due to apoptosis. By contrast, cells treated with resveratrol, but lacking aberrant Stat3 activity, show reversible growth arrest and minimal loss of viability. Moreover, in malignant cells harboring constitutively-active Stat3, including human prostate cancer DU145 cells and v-Src-transformed mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3/v-Src), resveratrol treatment represses Stat3-regulated cyclin D1 as well as Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 genes, suggesting that the antitumor cell activity of resveratrol is in part due to the blockade of Stat3-mediated dysregulation of growth and survival pathways. Our study is among the first to identify Src-Stat3 signaling as a target of resveratrol, further defining the mechanism of antitumor cell activity of resveratrol and raising its potential application in tumors with an activated Stat3 profile."

PAR1 is activated by thrombin whereas the upstream coagulant protease VIIa bound to tissue factor and Xa can activate both PAR1 and PAR2. PAR1 has been implicated in tumor cell growth, migration, and invasion whereas the function of PAR2 in these processes is largely unknown. Towards defining the functional importance of PAR2 in cancer cells, we used small interfering RNAs to deplete highly invasive breast cancer cells of endogenous PAR proteins. Our findings strongly suggest that PAR2 is critical for MDA-MB-231 and BT549 breast cancer cell migration and invasion towards NIH 3T3 fibroblast conditioned medium. To define the relative importance of PAR1 versus PAR2 in mediating factor VIIa and Xa responses, we assessed signaling in cancer cells lacking either endogenous PAR1 or PAR2 proteins. Strikingly, in MDA-MB-231 cells depleted of PAR2, we observed a marked inhibition of VIIa and Xa signaling to phosphoinositide hydrolysis and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation whereas signaling by VIIa and Xa remained intact in PAR1-deficient cells. Factor VIIa and Xa-induced cellular migration was also impaired in MDA-MB-231 cells deficient in PAR2 but not in cells lacking PAR1. Together, these studies reveal the novel findings that PAR2, a second protease-activated G protein-coupled receptor, has a critical role in breast cancer cell migration and invasion and functions as the endogenous receptor for coagulant proteases VIIa and Xa in these cells."

By first amplifying the genomic DNA (gDNA), biodiversity analysis and gDNA library construction of microbes found in contaminated soils were made possible. The MDA method was validated by analyzing amplified genome coverage from approximately five Escherichia coli cells, resulting in 99.2% genome coverage. The method was further validated by confirming overall representative species coverage and also an amplification bias when amplifying from a mix of eight known bacterial strains. We extracted DNA from samples with extremely low cell densities from a U.S. Department of Energy contaminated site. After amplification, small-subunit rRNA analysis revealed relatively even distribution of species across several major phyla. Clone libraries were constructed from the amplified gDNA, and a small subset of clones was used for shotgun sequencing. BLAST analysis of the library clone sequences showed that 64.9% of the sequences had significant similarities to known proteins, and &quot;clusters of orthologous groups&quot; (COG) analysis revealed that more than half of the sequences from each library contained sequence similarity to known proteins.

However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate PTHrP production by breast cancer cells are not entirely clear. We hypothesized that Gli2, a downstream transcriptional effector of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, regulates PTHrP expression in metastatic breast cancer because the Hh pathway regulates physiologic PTHrP expression in the developing growth plate. Here, we show that Gli2 is expressed in several human cancer cell lines that cause osteolytic lesions in vivo and produce PTHrP (MDA-MB-231, RWGT2, and PC-3) but is not expressed in nonosteolytic cancer cell lines that do not secrete PTHrP (MCF-7, ZR-75, and T47D). Transient expression of Gli2 in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells increased PTHrP promoter-luciferase activity dose dependently. Stable expression of Gli2 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in an increase in PTHrP protein in the conditioned medium. Alternatively, MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with Gli2-EnR, a repressor of Gli2 activity, exhibited a 72% to 93% decrease in PTHrP mRNA by quantitative real-time PCR when compared with control cells. To examine the effects of Gli2 on breast cancer-mediated osteolysis in vivo, athymic nude mice were inoculated with MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing Gli2 or the empty vector. Following tumor cell inoculation via the left cardiac ventricle, Gli2-expressing tumors caused significantly more osteolysis.

Here, we examined alterations in the expression of three members, RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3, and their interacting partner, CBF-beta, in breast cancer. Among them, RUNX3 was consistently underexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Fifty percent of the breast cancer cell lines (n = 19) showed hypermethylation at the promoter region and displayed significantly lower levels of RUNX3 mRNA expression (P &lt; 0.0001) and protein (P &lt; 0.001). In primary Singaporean breast cancers, 9 of 44 specimens showed undetectable levels of RUNX3 by immunohistochemistry. In 35 of 44 tumors, however, low levels of RUNX3 protein were present. Remarkably, in each case, protein was mislocalized to the cytoplasm. In primary tumors, hypermethylation of RUNX3 was observed in 23 of 44 cases (52%) and was undetectable in matched adjacent normal breast epithelium. Mislocalization of the protein, with or without methylation, seems to account for RUNX3 inactivation in the vast majority of the tumors. In in vitro and in vivo assays, RUNX3 behaved as a growth suppressor in breast cancer cells. Stable expression of RUNX3 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells led to a more cuboidal phenotype, significantly reduced invasiveness in Matrigel invasion assays, and suppressed tumor formation in immunodeficient mice. This study provides biological and mechanistic insights into RUNX3 as the key member of the family that plays a role in breast cancer. Frequent protein mislocalization and methylation could render RUNX3 a valuable marker for early detection and risk assessment."

This review addresses new trends in the technical performance of MDA and its applications to genetic analyses. The main challenge of WGA methods is to obtain balanced and faithful replication of all chromosomal regions without the loss of or preferential amplification of any genomic loci or allele.

We also evaluated its effects on the breast cancer MDA-MB231 and melanoma DM413 cell lines. The anti-GRP78 antibody binds only to cells expressing GRP78 on the surface, to a site also recognized by its physiologic agonist, activated alpha(2)-macroglobulin (alpha(2)M*). This antibody is completely specific for a peptide, including the primary amino acid sequence CNVKSDKSC, which contains a tertiary structural motif mimicking an epitope in GRP78. Tertiary structural analysis suggested the linear GRP78 primary amino acid sequence LIGRTWNDPSVQQDIKFL (Leu(98)-Leu(115)) as the putative binding site, containing the tertiary structual arrangement described above, which was confirmed experimentally. The anti-GRP78 antibodies from prostate cancer patients recognize almost exclusively this epitope. We produced animal antibodies against both these peptides, and they are able to mimic the effects of the human antibody. Our experiments also suggest this epitope as highly immunogenic, thereby explaining the specificity of the immune response against this epitope in GRP78, observed in humans. Using 1-LN cells as a model, we show that anti-GRP78 IgG purified from the sera of these patients mimics the proproliferative effects induced by alpha(2)M* via the common receptor, GRP78. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of human anti-GRP78 IgG show a dose-dependent protective effect on apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha."

In functional experiments, tet-regulated induction of CD44s potentiated the migration and invasion of MCF7F cells through HA-supplemented Matrigel. EMS1/cortactin was identified by expression profiling as a novel transcriptional target of HA/CD44 signaling, an association validated by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting experiments in a range of breast cancer cell lines. The mechanistic basis underpinning CD44-promoted transcription of EMS1/cortactin was shown to be dependent upon a NFkappaB mechanism, since pharmacological inhibition of IkappaKinase-2 or suppression of p65 Rel A expression attenuated CD44-induced increases in cortactin mRNA transcript levels. Overexpression of a c-myc tagged murine cortactin construct in the weakly invasive, CD44-deficient MCF7F and T47D cells potentiated their invasion. Furthermore, the functional importance of cortactin to CD44s-promoted metastasis was demonstrated by selective suppression of cortactin in CD44-expressing MCF7F-B5 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using RNAi, which was shown to result in attenuated CD44-promoted invasion and CD44-promoted adhesion to bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs)."

Here, we show that integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which is either activated or overexpressed in many types of cancers, is a critical regulator of breast cancer cell survival through the protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt pathway but is largely dispensable for the survival of normal breast epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells. We show that inhibition of ILK activity with a pharmacologic ILK inhibitor, QLT-0267, results in the inhibition of PKB/Akt Ser473 phosphorylation, stimulation of apoptosis, and a decrease in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) expression in human breast cancer cells. In contrast, QLT-0267 treatment has no effect on PKB/Akt Ser473 phosphorylation or apoptosis in normal human breast epithelial, mouse fibroblast, or vascular smooth muscle cells. The inhibition of PKB/Akt Ser473 phosphorylation by QLT-0267 in breast cancer cells was rescued by a kinase-active ILK mutant but not by a kinase-dead ILK mutant. Furthermore, a dominant-negative ILK mutant increased apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line but not in normal human breast epithelial cells. The inhibitor was active against ILK isolated from all cell types but did not have any effect on cell attachment and spreading.

Mutation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in breast cancer is associated with metastasis and aggressive clinical phenotype. In this report, we demonstrate that wild type but not the dominant-negative mutant (V143A) or cancer-specific mutants (R175H or R280K) of p53 repress CXCR4 expression. Recently described cancer-specific p53 isoform, Delta133p53, also failed to repress CXCR4 promoter activity. Short-interfering RNA-mediated depletion of p53 increased endogenous CXCR4 expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that contain wild-type p53. Basal CXCR4 promoter activity in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells deleted of p53 [HCT116(p53KO)] was 10-fold higher compared to that in parental HCT116 cells with functional wild-type p53. Deletion analysis of CXCR4 promoter identified a seven-base pair p53-repressor element homologous to cyclic AMP/AP-1 response (CRE/AP-1) element. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed binding of ATF-1 and cJun to the CRE/AP-1 element. The p53 rescue drug PRIMA-1 reduced CXCR4 mRNA and cell surface expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, which express R280K mutant p53. CP-31398, another p53 rescue drug, similarly reduced cell surface levels of CXCR4. PRIMA-1-mediated decrease in CXCR4 expression correlated with reduced invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells through matrigel. These results suggest a mechanism for elevated CXCR4 expression and metastasis of breast cancers with p53 mutations or isoform expression.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Cited2 and Smad3 were recruited to MMP9 promoter upon TGF-beta stimulation. This is the first demonstration that Cited2 functions as a Smad3/p300-interacting transcriptional co-activator in modulating the expression of MMP9, which could affect tumor cell invasion mediated by TGF-beta."

Present study utilized several human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T-47D, Hs578T and MDA-MB-231, varying in COX-2 expression) as well as 10 human breast cancer specimens to examine the roles of COX-2 and prostaglandin E (EP) receptors in VEGF-C expression or secretion, and the relationship of COX-2 or VEGF-C expression to lymphangiogenesis. We found a strong correlation between COX-2 mRNA expression and VEGF-C expression or secretion levels in breast cancer cell lines and VEGF-C expression in breast cancer tissues. Expression of LYVE-1, a selective marker for lymphatic endothelium, was also positively correlated with COX-2 or VEGF-C expression in breast cancer tissues. Inhibition of VEGF-C expression and secretion in the presence of COX-1/2 or COX-2 inhibitors or following downregulation of COX-2 with COX-2 siRNA established a stimulatory role COX-2 in VEGF-C synthesis by breast cancer cells. EP1 as well as EP4 receptor antagonists inhibited VEGF-C production indicating the roles of EP1 and EP4 in VEGF-C upregulation by endogenous PGE2. Finally, VEGF-C secretion by MDA-MB-231 cells was inhibited in the presence of kinase inhibitors for Her-2/neu, Src and p38 MAPK, indicating a requirement of these kinases for VEGF-C synthesis. These results, for the first time, demonstrate a regulatory role of COX-2 in VEGF-C synthesis (and thereby lymphangiogenesis) in human breast cancer, which is mediated at least in part by EP1/EP4 receptors."

The diversity of Archaea in a soil sample was mapped by generating a clone library using group-specific primers in combination with a terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism profile. Intact cells were extracted from the environmental sample, and fluorescent in situ hybridization probing with Cy3-labeled probes designed from the clone library was subsequently used to detect the organisms of interest. Single cells with a bright fluorescent signal were isolated using a micromanipulator and the genome of the single isolated cells served as a template for multiple displacement amplification (MDA) using the Phi29 DNA polymerase. The generated MDA product was afterwards used for 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and shotgun-cloned for additional genomic analysis. Sequence analysis showed &gt;99% 16S rRNA gene homology to soil crenarchaeotal clone SCA1170 and shotgun fragments had the closest match to a crenarchaeotal BAC clone previously retrieved from a soil sample.

We hypothesized that one such factor may be the integrin-binding protein osteopontin (OPN), and we investigated this clinically and experimentally. In breast cancer patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy, OPN levels were significantly higher in lymph node metastases than in the primary tumor (P &lt; 0.001). To test the functional contribution of OPN to lymphatic metastasis and to determine whether the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) integrin-binding sequence of OPN is important for this process, we transfected wild-type OPN or mutant OPN (lacking the RGD sequence) into MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells. In vitro, cells overexpressing OPN demonstrated increased anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (P = 0.001) and increased RGD-dependent adhesion (P = 0.045). Following mammary fat pad injection of nude mice, cells overexpressing OPN showed increased lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastases, and lung micrometastases at earlier time points (P = 0.024). Loss of the RGD region partially abrogated this effect in the lymphatics (P = 0.038). These novel findings indicate that OPN is a key molecular player involved in lymphatic metastasis of breast cancer, potentially by affecting RGD-mediated adhesive interactions and by enhancing the establishment/persistence of tumor cells in the lymphatics."

Mutations in A-type lamins cause muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy and other diseases, including progeroid syndromes. To identify new binding partners for lamin A, we carried out a two-hybrid screen with a human skeletal-muscle cDNA library, using the Ig-fold domain of lamin A as bait. The C-terminal region of titin was recovered twice. Previous investigators showed that nuclear isoforms of titin are essential for chromosome condensation during mitosis. Our titin fragment, which includes two regions unique to titin (M-is6 and M-is7), bound directly to both A- and B-type lamins in vitro. Titin binding to disease-causing lamin A mutants R527P and R482Q was reduced 50%. Studies in living cells suggested lamin-titin interactions were physiologically relevant. In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, two independent C. elegans (Ce)-titin antibodies colocalized with Ce-lamin at the nuclear envelope. In lamin-downregulated [lmn-1(RNAi)] embryos, Ce-titin was undetectable at the nuclear envelope suggesting its localization or stability requires Ce-lamin. In human cells (HeLa), antibodies against the titin-specific domain M-is6 gave both diffuse and punctate intranuclear staining by indirect immunofluorescence, and recognized at least three bands larger than 1 MDa in immunoblots of isolated HeLa nuclei. In HeLa cells that transiently overexpressed a lamin-binding fragment of titin, nuclei became grossly misshapen and herniated at sites lacking lamin B. We conclude that the C-terminus of nuclear titin binds lamins in vivo and might contribute to nuclear organization during interphase."

It seems to be very important to study the expression of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and receptor 2 (AdipoR2) in the human breast epithelial cells and breast cancer cells in order to clarify whether or not adiponectin exerts its effects directly on these cells. Expression of adiponectin, AdipoR1, and AdipoR2 mRNA was determined by RT-PCR assay using the RNA samples obtained from human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, SKBR3, and MDA-MB231), HMEC (primary culture of normal human mammary epithelial cells), adipose tissues (axilla) as well as breast cancer cells and normal breast epithelial cells selectively collected from breast cancer tissues by laser microdissection (LMD). Adiponectin mRNA expression was observed only in the adipose tissues. On the other hand, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA expression was observed in all four breast cancer cell lines, HMEC, adipose tissues as well as breast cancer cells and normal breast epithelial cells selectively collected by LMD. In addition, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression in both normal breast epithelial cells and breast cancer cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. These results suggest a possibility that adiponectin might modulate the growth of normal breast epithelial cells and breast cancer cells directly through AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 receptors, and that the association of low serum adiponectin levels with a high breast cancer risk might be explained, at least in part, by the direct effect of adiponectin on the breast epithelial cells."

In this study, we demonstrate that a soluble ectodomain of LRIG1, containing only the LRRs, inhibits ligand-independent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and causes growth inhibition of A431, HeLa and MDA-468 carcinoma cells. In contrast, cells that do not express detectable levels of EGFR fail to respond to soluble LRIG1. However, when a functional EGFR gene is introduced in these cells, they become growth-inhibited by soluble LRIG1 protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of high-affinity (K(d)=10 nM) binding sites on the A431 cells that can be competitively displaced (up to 75%) by molar excess of EGF. Even more powerful effects are obtained with a chimeric proteoglycan harboring the N-terminus of decorin, substituted with a single glycosaminoglycan chain, fused to the LRIG1 ectodomain. Both proteins also inhibit ligand-dependent activation of the EGFR and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 signaling in a rapid and dose-dependent manner. These results suggest a novel mechanism of action evoked by a soluble ectodomain of LRIG1 protein that could modulate EGFR signaling and its growth-promoting activity. Attenuation of EGFR activity without physical downregulation of the receptor could represent a novel therapeutic approach toward malignancies in which EGFR plays a primary role in tumor growth and survival."

We have applied bioinformatics to classify the relationship of human, rat, and mouse REX1 proteins in the C2H2 family of zinc finger proteins and demonstrate that REX1 is a member of the YY1 sub-family of transcription factors, which includes the Drosophila pleiohomeotic (Pho) protein. We have generated a molecular model of the human REX1 zinc finger domains based on the crystal structure of the YY1 transcription factor. To date, expression of hRex-1 and its extensively studied mouse homolog mRex-1, has been reported only in embryonic and adult stem cells and in differentiated spermatocytes. In this study, reverse transcription-PCR and Western analysis were employed to assay for hRex-1 expression in cultured normal human epithelial cells and human carcinoma cell lines. Expression of hRex-1 mRNA was detected in normal human epidermal keratinocytes, normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), bronchial, and small airway lung epithelial cells. Other stem cell markers, such as Oct 4, DAB2, and cMyc were also detected in normal human epidermal keratinocyte cultures. Expression of hRex-1 was also detected in some human tumor cell lines including MDA-MB-468 mammary carcinoma, SCC-15 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and N-TERA2 human teratocarcinoma cells. Western analyses confirmed expression of the human REX1 (ZFP42) protein in MDA-MB-468 cells and normal human keratinocytes. This research has identified model human cell culture systems, in addition to embryonic stem (ES) cells, in which Rex-1 is expressed, and this should enable the characterization of REX1 functions in normal adult epithelial cells and tumorigenic stem cells."

We present evidence that the tumor cell-derived platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is the key regulator of vascular SMCs motility induced by breast cancer cells. PDGF significantly upregulates neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) mRNA expression and protein production in aortic smooth muscle cells (AOSMCs) and depletion of NRP-1 production by AOSMCs with specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) prevents the PDGF-dependent migration of vascular SMCs.

Other than ectopic delivery of tumor suppressor-encoded cDNA, there are no therapeutic tools able to specifically re-activate tumor suppressor genes that are silenced in tumor cells. Herein, we describe a novel approach to specifically regulate dormant tumor suppressors in aggressive cancer cells. We have targeted the Mammary Serine Protease Inhibitor (maspin) (SERPINB5) tumor suppressor, which is silenced by transcriptional and aberrant promoter methylation in aggressive epithelial tumors. Maspin is a multifaceted protein, regulating tumor cell homeostasis through inhibition of cell growth, motility and invasion. We have constructed artificial transcription factors (ATFs) made of six zinc-finger (ZF) domains targeted against 18-base pair (bp) unique sequences in the maspin promoter. The ZFs were linked to the activator domain VP64 and delivered in breast tumor cells. We found that the designed ATFs specifically interact with their cognate targets in vitro with high affinity and selectivity. One ATF was able to re-activate maspin in cell lines that comprise a maspin promoter silenced by epigenetic mechanisms. Consistently, we found that this ATF was a powerful inducer of apoptosis and was able to knock down tumor cell invasion in vitro. Moreover, this ATF was able to suppress MDA-MB-231 growth in a xenograft breast cancer model in nude mice. Our work suggests that ATFs could be used in cancer therapeutics as novel molecular switches to re-activate dormant tumor suppressors."

Although progesterone controls transcriptional activation through binding to its nuclear receptors, it also initiates rapid nongenomic signaling events. Recently, three putative membrane progestin receptors (mPRalpha, beta, and gamma) with structural similarity to G protein-coupled receptors have been identified. These mPR isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and belong to the larger, highly conserved family of progestin and adiponectin receptors found in plants, eubacteria, and eukaryotes. The fish mPRalpha has been reported to mediate progesterone-dependent MAPK activation and inhibition of cAMP production through coupling to an inhibitory G protein. To functionally characterize the human homologs, we established human embryonic kidney 293 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines that stably express human mPRalpha, beta, or gamma. For comparison, we also established cell lines expressing the mPRalpha cloned from the spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) and Japanese pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes). Surprisingly, we found no evidence that human or fish mPRs regulate cAMP production or MAPK (ERK1/2 or p38) activation upon progesterone stimulation. Furthermore, the mPRs did not couple to a highly promiscuous G protein subunit, Galpha(q5i), in transfection studies or provoke Ca(2+) mobilization in response to progesterone. Finally, we demonstrate that transfected mPRs, as well as endogenous human mPRalpha, localize to the endoplasmic reticulum, and that their expression does not lead to increased progestin binding either in membrane preparations or in intact cells. Our results therefore do not support the concept that mPRs are plasma membrane receptors involved in transducing nongenomic progesterone actions."

Unfortunately, the outcome of current therapies for ErbB2-positive breast cancers remains unsatisfying due to resistance and side effects. New therapies for ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers continue to be in great need. Peptide therapy using cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) as peptide carriers is promising because the internalization is highly efficient, and the cargoes delivered can be bioactive. However, the major obstacle in using these powerful CPPs for therapy is their lack of specificity. Here, we sought to develop a peptide carrier that could introduce therapeutics specifically to ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. By modifying the HIV TAT-derived CPP and conjugating anti-HER-2/neu peptide mimetic (AHNP), we developed the peptide carrier (P3-AHNP) that specifically targeted ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. A signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)-inhibiting peptide conjugated to this peptide carrier (P3-AHNP-STAT3BP) was delivered more efficiently into ErbB2-overexpressing than ErbB2 low-expressing cancer cells in vitro and successfully decreased STAT3 binding to STAT3-interacting DNA sequence. P3-AHNP-STAT3BP inhibited cell growth in vitro, with ErbB2-overexpressing 435.eB breast cancer cells being more sensitive to the treatment than the ErbB2 low-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells. Compared with ErbB2 low-expressing MDA-MB-435 xenografts, i.p. injected P3-AHNP-STAT3BP preferentially accumulated in 435.eB xenografts, which led to more reduction of proliferation and increased apoptosis and targeted inhibition of tumor growth. This novel peptide delivery system provided a sound basis for the future development of safe and effective new-generation therapeutics to cancer-specific molecular targets."

An 8-h MDA reaction yielded a sufficient quantity of DNA from an initial amount of 0.4 ng, which is equivalent to approximately 10(5) cells. Uniform amplification of genes randomly selected from the cyanobacterial genome was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The metagenome from bacteria associated with scleractinian corals was used for whole-genome amplification using phi29 polymerase to analyse the microbial diversity.

In spite of its cytotoxic effect, clinical efficacy is impaired by the development of resistance. We performed gene expression analysis to shed light into the molecular mechanism of action of this drug in two breast cancer cell lines. Activation of genes related with cell cycle, cell growth and apoptosis (BNIP3L, CCNG2, DDIT4, TGFB2, TP53BP1, TP53INP1, and VEGF) was the main finding in the p53-wild type cell line MCF7, while the p53-non-functional cell line MDA-MB-231 was characterized by the regulation of NF-kappaB target genes (BIRC3, CXCL1/GRO1, IRAK2, TNF, TNFAIP and TRAF1). Genes consistently induced (ATF3, CCNG2, CDKN1A, EGR1, INSIG1, and MAF) or repressed (CCND1 and VGF) in both cell lines, were also found after gemcitabine treatment. In addition, MDA-MB-231 cells showed a higher basal and induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity after treatment with gemcitabine. In comparison with gemcitabine, gene expression after 5-fluorouracil treatment showed essentially different profiles in both cell lines. This, in spite of using equitoxic concentrations producing similar effects on cell cycle. NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in MDA-MB-231 cells was dependent on IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation, as shown by functional experiments using the specific inhibitor BAY11-7082. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis of clinical samples of breast carcinoma further validated the induction of NF-kappaB expression and IkappaB down-regulation upon neoadjuvant gemcitabine treatment. Thus, gene expression patterns, in vitro functional studies and analysis of tissue samples are in agreement with a role for NF-kappaB pathway in gemcitabine response. Together with the reported role for NF-kappaB in the induction of resistance to chemotherapy, our data gives support to clinical strategies combining gemcitabine with NF-kappaB inhibitors in breast cancer."

In November 2004, two Escherichia coli isolates with resistance to a wide range of beta-lactams (including amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefotaxime) were isolated from scouring calves. Testing by PCR and sequence analysis confirmed the isolates as being both bla(CTX-M14/17) and bla(TEM-35) ((IRT-4)) positive. They had indistinguishable plasmid and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. Transferability studies demonstrated that bla(CTX-M) was located on a conjugative 65-MDa IncK plasmid. Following a farm visit in December 2004, 31/48 calves and 2/60 cows were positive for E. coli with bla(CTX-M). Also, 5/48 calf and 28/60 cow samples yielded bla(CTX)- and bla(TEM)-negative E. coli isolates that were resistant to cefotaxime, and sequence analysis confirmed that these presented mutations in the promoter region of the chromosomal ampC gene. Fingerprinting showed 11 different PFGE types (seven in bla(CTX-M)-positive isolates). Six different PFGE clones conjugated the same bla(CTX-M)-positive IncK plasmid. One clone carried a different-sized, bla(CTX-M)-positive, transformable plasmid. This is the first report of bla(CTX-M) from livestock in the United Kingdom, and this report demonstrates the complexity of ESBL epidemiology. Results indicate that horizontal plasmid transfer between strains as well as horizontal gene transfer between plasmids have contributed to the spread of resistance. We have also shown that some clones can persist for months, suggesting that clonal spread also contributes to the perpetuation of resistance."

Negligible conformational changes occur in E3BD upon its high-affinity binding to E3. Modifications of E3BD residues at the center of the E3BD/E3 interface impede E3 binding far more severely than those of residues on the periphery, validating the &quot;hot spot&quot; paradigm for protein interactions.

PRL-3 mRNA levels were determined in several normal human endothelial cells exposed or unexposed to the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and in 27 human tumor cell lines. In endothelial cells, PRL-3 mRNA expression was increased in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) exposed to PMA. An oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed that PRL-3 was among the 10 genes with the largest increase in expression on PMA stimulation. Phenotypically, PMA-treated HMVEC showed increased invasion, tube formation, and growth factor-stimulated proliferation. A flow cytometric analysis of cell surface markers showed that PMA-treated HMVEC retained endothelial characteristics. Infection of HMVEC with an adenovirus expressing PRL-3 resulted in increased tube formation. In tumor cells, PRL-3 mRNA levels varied markedly with high expression in SKNAS neuroblastoma, MCF-7 and BT474 breast carcinoma, Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma, and HCT116 colon carcinoma. Western blotting analysis of a subset of cell line lysates showed a positive correlation between PRL-3 mRNA and protein levels. PRL-3 was stably transfected into DLD-1 colon cancer cells. PRL-3-overexpressing DLD-1 subclones were assessed for doubling time and invasion. Although doubling time was similar among parental, empty vector, and PRL-3 subclones, invasion was increased in PRL-3-expressing subclones. In models of endogenous expression, we observed that the MCF-7 cell line, which expresses high levels of PRL-3, was more invasive than the SKBR3 cell line, which expresses low levels of PRL-3. However, the MDA-MB-231 cell line was highly invasive with low levels of PRL-3, suggesting that in some models invasion is PRL-3 independent. Transfection of a PRL-3 small interfering RNA into MCF-7 cells inhibited PRL-3 expression and cell invasion.

Of 60 differentially expressed genes, ALL1-fused gene from chromosome 1q (AF1Q), a putative oncogene not described previously in breast cancer, was identified and found to be over-expressed in MDA-MB-435HM cells compared with MDA-MB-435LM cells. The results indicate that AF1Q may play an important role in breast cancer metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we generated an AF1Q high-expression cell line by stable transfection of AF1Q cDNA into MDA-MB-435LM cells. Results showed that over-expression of AF1Q led to a marked increase in the invasive and metastatic potential of MDA-MB-435LM cells in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, transcription factor Ets-1, and RhoC expression in both mRNA and protein levels. Consistent with this observation, reduced AF1Q expression in MDA-MB-435HM cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in a significant decrease in the invasive potential of MDA-MB-435HM cells in vitro and in the protein expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, Ets-1, and RhoC, compared with either parental or non-silencing control cells.

SIM2 was initially identified by positional cloning on chromosome 21 and is thought to contribute to the etiology of trisomy-21 [Down syndrome (DS)]. In addition to the physical and mental deficiencies associated with this genetic disease, it has become apparent that women with DS are 10-25 times less likely to die from breast cancer in comparison with age-matched normal populations. This is thought to be a result of gene dosage effect of tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 21. Here, we report that a splice variant of SIM2, SIM2 short (SIM2s), is differentially expressed in normal breast and breast cancer-derived cell lines and is downregulated in human breast cancer samples. Re-establishment of SIM2s in MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells significantly reduced proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and invasive potential. Consistent with its role as a transcriptional repressor, SIM2s directly decreased expression of matrix metalloprotease-3, a known mediator of breast cancer metastasis. These results suggest that SIM2s has breast tumor suppressive activity."

Herceptin, in combination with standard chemotherapy, such as taxol or etoposide, gives a synergistically apoptotic response in breast tumors.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The mechanism underlying this synergy between chemotherapy and herceptin treatment is not well understood. Herein, we have determined that addition of herceptin, sensitized breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 to etoposide- or taxol-induced apoptosis.RESULTS: This treatment resulted in reduced expression of ErbB2 and the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Using antisense oligonucleotides against Mcl-1, MDA-MB-231 cells were rendered sensitive to etoposide-induced apoptosis similar to herceptin, but combined treatment of antisense against Mcl-1 and herceptin failed to give a significant increase in apoptosis. In 29 human breast tumors immunostained for ErbB2 and Mcl-1, we found that when ErbB2 was overexpressed, there was a corresponding increase in Mcl-1 expression.DISCUSSION: Using murine fibroblasts that express human ErbB2, but no other ErbB family member (NE2), these cells showed resistance to both taxol- and etoposide-induced apoptosis compared with parental cells. In addition, NE2 cells preferentially express the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 compared with parental cells, and treatment with herceptin reduces Mcl-1 expression. Taken together, these results suggest that herceptin sensitizes ErbB2-overexpressing cells to apoptosis by reducing antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein levels."

These molecular switches play pivotal roles in cardiac action potentials, neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, calcium-dependent gene transcription and synaptic transmission. CaVs possess self-regulatory mechanisms that permit them to change their behaviour in response to activity, including voltage-dependent inactivation, calcium-dependent inactivation and calcium-dependent facilitation. These processes arise from the concerted action of different channel domains with CaV beta-subunits and the soluble calcium sensor calmodulin. Until recently, nothing was known about the CaV structure at high resolution. Recent crystallographic work has revealed the first glimpses at the CaV molecular framework and set a new direction towards a detailed mechanistic understanding of CaV function."

Another isoform, the duodenal Cyt b561 (Dcytb), was reported to have ferric reductase activity, possibly facilitating intestinal iron uptake. Herein, a new Cyt b561 homologue, LCytb (for lysosomal Cytb561) was found expressed in the late endosomal-lysosomal membrane. LCytb shared high sequence similarity with CGCytb (45% identity) and Dcytb (42% identity). Moreover, four heme-coordinating His residues, and putative ASC and MDA binding sites were highly conserved. Recombinant LCytb exhibited an ASC-reducible b-type Cyt absorbance spectrum with alpha-band maximum at 561 nm in the spectrum of the reduced protein. Northern blots and Western blots revealed that LCytb was predominantly expressed in lung, spleen, thymus, testis and placenta. In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence studies further demonstrated that the protein was expressed in the alveolar macrophages of the lung, in the white pulp of the spleen, widespread in the thymus, and in the Sertoli cells of the testis. Sequence analysis indicated the presence of a (DE)XXXL(LI)-type signal in the C-terminal of the protein, predicting a late endosomal-lysosomal subcellular localization. This localization was confirmed by double labeling experiments in RAW264.7 and 293 cells, stably transfected with LCytb."

One such compound, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), leads to covalent DNA modifications and the deregulation of gene expression. To date, these mechanisms of BaP-induced carcinogenesis are poorly understood, particularly in the case of breast cancer. We tested the effects of BaP exposure on cellular growth dynamics and DNA methylation in four breast cancer cell lines since disruptions in DNA methylation lead to deregulated gene expression and the loss of genomic integrity. We observed robust time- and concentration-dependent loss of proliferation, S phase and G2M accumulation and apoptosis in p53 positive MCF-7 and T47-D cells. We observed minimal responses in p53 negative HCC-1086 and MDA MB 231 cells. Furthermore, BaP increased p53 levels in both p53 positive cell lines, as well as p21 levels in MCF-7 cells, an effect that was prevented by the p53-specific inhibitor pifithrin-alpha. No changes in global levels of DNA methylation levels induced by BaP were detected by the methyl acceptor assay (MAA) in any cell line, however, methylation profiling by AIMS (amplification of intermethylated sites) analysis showed dynamic, sequence-specific hypo- and hypermethylation events in all cell lines. We also identified BaP-induced hypomethylation events at a number of genomic repeats. Our data confirm the p53-specific disruption of the cell cycle as well as the disruption of DNA methylation as a consequence of BaP treatment, thus reinforcing the link between environmental exposures, DNA methylation and breast cancer."

In vitro delivery to a human pancreatic cell line (PANC-1) was shown to exhibit sequence-specific inhibition of 48-h cell growth with an IC50 value of 37 nM. The inhibitory potency of this siHybrid was increased (IC50 value of 7.8 nM) using a homologous chemically modified siHybrid (mH) in which the 19-mer sense strand had the following pattern of 2 '-deoxyinosine (dI) and 2 '-O-methylribonucleotide (2 '-OMe) residues: 5'-d(TITIT)-2'OMe(GCGGUGGUU)-d(GICIT). These modifications were intended to favor antisense strand-mediated RNAi while mitigating possible sense strand-mediated off-target effects and RNase H-mediated cleavage of the antisense RNA strand. The presently reported immunoliposomal delivery system was successfully used in vivo to inhibit HER-2 expression, and thus induce apoptosis in human breast carcinoma tumors (MDA-MB-435) in mice upon repeated i.v. treatment at a dose of 3 mg/kg of H or mH.

MEKK1 is a MAPKKK that regulates both the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and the c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. MEKK1 signaling regulates migration through control of cell adhesion and is required for inducible expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). MEKK1-deficient mice with mammary gland-targeted expression of the polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) transgene develop primary mammary tumors at a rate and frequency similar to wild-type littermates, indicating that MEKK1 deficiency does not affect PyMT-mediated transformation. However, MEKK1-/- mice display significantly delayed tumor cell dissemination and lung metastasis. Delayed MEKK1-dependent tumor dissemination is associated with markedly reduced tumor uPA expression, gelatinase activity, and prolonged tumor basement membrane integrity. siRNA-mediated MEKK1 knockdown inhibits uPA activity, cell migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Thus MEKK1 controls tumor progression by regulating both the migration and proteolysis aspects of tumor cell invasiveness. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a MAPKKK that regulates metastasis through control of tumor invasiveness."

In this study, we assessed the influence of these compounds on mammary tumor growth. Both compounds stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 and T47D cells [estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha-positive)], but do not stimulate the proliferation of an ERalpha-negative cell line (MDA-MB-435 cells). Genistein appeared more efficient in this regard due to its higher binding affinity for ERalpha, a property explained by a structural analysis of the binding of these compounds to the ERalpha's ligand binding domain. As previously described for estradiol (E(2)), genistein and apigenin down regulated ERalpha and enhanced estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent gene expression. The additional finding that genistein antagonizes the anti-proliferative effect of hydroxytamoxifen suggests phytoestrogens may be detrimental in women with breast cancer who are being treated with tamoxifen. In addition, because of their ability to stimulate breast cell growth, the widespread use of phytoestrogens in postmenopausal women could be detrimental."

However, which splicing changes that might contribute directly to tumorigenesis or cancer progression remain to be elucidated. We used splicing-sensitive microarrays to detect differences in alternative splicing between two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 (estrogen receptor positive) and MDA-MB-231 (estrogen receptor negative), as well as cultured human mammary epithelial cells. Several splicing alterations in genes, including CD44, FAS, RBM9, hnRNPA/B, APLP2, and MYL6, were detected by the microarray and verified by reverse transcription-PCR. We also compared splicing in these breast cancer cells cultured in either two-dimensional flat dishes or in three-dimensional Matrigel conditions. Only a subset of the splicing differences that distinguish MCF7 cells from MDA-MB-231 cells under two-dimensional culture condition is retained under three-dimensional conditions, suggesting that alternative splicing events are influenced by the geometry of the culture conditions of these cells. Further characterization of splicing patterns of several genes in MCF7 cells grown in Matrigel and in xenograft in nude mice shows that splicing is similar under both conditions. Thus, our oligonucleotide microarray can effectively detect changes in alternative splicing in different cells or in the same cells grown in different environments. Our findings also illustrate the potential for understanding gene expression with resolution of alternative splicing in the study of breast cancer."

Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) strongly down-regulated ERalpha protein and transcript levels, without altering the level of ERbeta protein, in both cell lines. In cells transfected with the ERalpha promoter linked to a luciferase gene reporter, I3C ablated ERalpha promoter activity. Propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) is a highly selective ERalpha agonist, whereas, 17beta-estradiol activates both ERalpha and ERbeta. I3C treatment inhibited the PPT- and 17beta-estradiol-induced proliferation of breast cancer cells, disrupted the PPT and 17beta-estradiol stimulation of estrogen response element (ERE)-driven reporter plasmid activity as well as of endogenous progesterone receptor transcripts. Using an in vitro ERE binding assay, I3C was shown to inhibit the level of functional ERalpha and stimulated the level of ERE binding ERbeta even though the protein levels of this receptor remained constant. In ERalpha-/ERbeta+ MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, I3C treatment stimulated a 6-fold increase in binding of ERbeta to the ERE. I3C also induced ERE- and activator protein 1-driven reporter plasmid activities in the absence of an ER agonist, suggesting that ERbeta is activated in indole-treated cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the expression and function of ERalpha and ERbeta can be uncoupled by I3C with a key cellular consequence being a significantly higher ERbeta:ERalpha ratio that is generally highly associated with antiproliferative status of human breast cancer cells."

The F domain of the ERalpha modulates its functions in a ligand-, promoter-, and cell-specific manner. To identify the region(s) responsible for these functions, we characterized the effects of serial truncations within the F domain. We found that truncating the last 16 residues of the F domain altered the activity of the human ERalpha (hERalpha) on an estrogen response element-driven promoter in response to estradiol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), its sensitivity to overexpression of the coactivator steroid receptor coactivator-1 in mammalian cells, and its interaction with a receptor-interacting domain of the coactivator steroid receptor coactivator-1 or engineered proteins (&quot;monobodies&quot;) that specifically bind to ERalpha/ligand complexes in a yeast two-hybrid system. Most importantly, the ability of the ER to induce pS2 was reduced in MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing this truncated ER vs. the wild-type ER. The region includes a distinctive segment (residues 579-584; LQKYYIT) having a high content of bulky and/or hydrophobic amino acids that was previously predicted to adopt a beta-strand-like structure. As previously reported, removal of the entire F domain was necessary to eliminate the agonist activity of 4-OHT. In addition, mutation of the vicinal glycine residues between the ligand-binding domain and F domains specifically reduced the 4-OHT-dependent interactions of the hERalpha ligand-binding domain and F domains with monobodies. These results show that regions within the F domain of the hERalpha selectively modulate its activity and its interactions with other proteins."

The clinical significance of Dab2 protein in breast cancer remains yet unknown. Immunohistochemical analysis of Dab2 protein showed no detectable expression in 67/91 (74%) breast tumors, while all 10 normal tissues showed presence of Dab2 protein. We hypothesized that epigenetic silencing of Dab2 may account for loss of protein in breast cancer. Methylation of Dab2 exon 1, a putative promoter, was analyzed in six breast cancer cell lines and in 54 primary breast tumors by methylation specific PCR. Methylation was observed in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells and in 6 of 54 (11%) primary breast tumors that also showed loss of Dab2 protein. Expression of Dab2 transcripts was detected in all cell lines except MDA-MB-157. However, none of these six cell lines showed detectable levels of Dab2 protein by western blotting, while non-malignant mammary epithelial cell line MCF 10A showed Dab2 protein expression. To our knowledge this is the first report showing low frequency of Dab2 (putative) promoter methylation (11%) in primary breast tumors. Frequent loss of Dab2 protein (74%) suggest that hypermethylation of Dab2 promoter may only be one of the mechanisms accounting for its loss in breast cancer. Further, in silico analysis of Dab2 3'-UTR revealed existence of miRNA complimentary to this region of the gene, suggesting microRNA mediated targeting of Dab2 mRNA might account for loss of the protein in breast cancer."

While these cell lines and their variants share many phenotypic characteristics with human breast tumors, the extent to which they reflect the underlying molecular biology of breast cancer remains controversial. We explored this issue using a probabilistic rather than heuristic approach. Data from gene expression microarrays were used to compare the global structures of the transcriptomes of three estrogen receptor alpha positive (ER+) human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, ZR-75-1) and 13 human breast tumors (11 ER+; 2 ER-). Linear representations of the respective data structures were obtained by deriving those top principal components (PCs) required to capture &gt; or =80% of the cumulative variance for each data set (M PCs). We then identified those genes most highly correlated with the M PCs (Pearson's correlation coefficient r &gt; or =0.800) and identified a group of 36 genes commonly correlated with both the cell line (M = 5 PCs) and tumor (M = 6 PCs) data structures. All 36 common genes were correlated with PC1 from the breast tumor data: 21/36 genes were correlated with PC1, 14/36 genes correlated with PC2, and 1/36 genes correlated with PC3 from the cell line data. Genes important in defining the data structures include NFkappaB p65, IGFBP-6, ornithine decarboxylase-1, and paxillin. When data from MDA-MB-435 xenografts (ER-) were included in the analysis, we were unable to find any common genes between these xenografts and the breast tumors. These data clearly imply that MCF-7, T47D, and ZR-75-1 cells and ER+ breast tumors share substantial global similarities in the structures of their respective transcriptomes, and that these cell lines are good models in which to identify molecular events that are likely to be important in some ER+ human breast cancers."

Analysis of B02 cells transcriptional profile revealed that 11 and 9 out of the 50 most up- and down-regulated mRNAs, respectively, corresponded to genes which expression has been previously associated with osteoblastic differentiation process. Thus, osteoblast specific cadherin 11 which mediates the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblastic cells is up-regulated in B02. While S100A4, recently described as a key negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation, is the most down-regulated gene in B02 cells. RT-PCR and western blotting experiments allowed the validation of the modulation of several genes of interest. Using immunohistochemistry, performed on human breast primary tumors and their matched liver and bone metastases, we were able to confirm that the osteoblast-like pattern of gene expression observed in our model holds true in vivo.

We used a titin exon array to search for which part(s) of the human titin transcriptional unit encompassing 363 exons is(are) expressed in non-striated muscle tissues. Expression profiling of adult smooth muscle tissues (aorta, bladder, carotid, stomach) identified alternatively spliced titin isoforms, encompassing 80 to about 100 exons. These exons code for parts of the titin Z-disk, I-band and A-band regions, allowing the truncated smooth muscle titin isoform to link Z-disks/dense bodies together with thick filaments. Consistent with the array data, Western blot studies detected the expression of approximately 1 MDa smooth muscle titin in adult smooth muscles, reacting with selected Z-disc, I-band, and A-band titin antibodies. Immunofluorescence with these antibodies located smooth muscle titin in the cytoplasm of cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells and in the tunica media of intact adult bovine aorta. Real time PCR studies suggested that smooth muscle titins are expressed from a promoter located 35 kb or more upstream of the transcription initiation site used for striated muscle titin, driving expression of a bi-cistronic mRNA, coding 5' for the anonymous gene FL39502, followed 3' by titin, respectively. Our work showed that smooth muscle and striated muscle titins share in their conserved amino-terminal regions binding sites for alpha-actinin and filamins: Yeast two-hybrid screens using Z2-Zis1 titin baits identified prey clones coding for alpha-actinin-1 and filamin-A from smooth muscle, and alpha-actinin-2/3, filamin-C, and nebulin from skeletal muscle cDNA libraries, respectively.

The interaction between tumour cells and their surrounding stromal environment is a crucial factor regulating tumour invasion and metastasis. Stromal fibroblasts are the main source of HGF in the body, and release HGF as an inactive precursor (pro-HGF). HGF activator (HGFA), matriptase, urokinase-type plasminogen activator and hepsin are the main factors responsible for converting pro-HGF into active HGF. HAI-1 and HAI-2 are 2 novel Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors that regulate HGF activity through inhibition of HGFA, matriptase and hepsin action. Recent studies demonstrate that HAI-1 and HAI-2 may also potently inhibit a number of other pro-metastatic serine proteases and therefore have direct bearing on the spread of tumours. Our study examined the potential of these HAI's to suppress the influence of HGF and regulate cancer metastasis. We generated a retroviral expression system that induced HAI expression in a human fibroblast cell line. Forced expression of either HAI-1 or HAI-2 in these fibroblasts resulted in a dramatic decrease in the production of bioactive hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). This reduction in HGF activity subsequently suppressed HGF's metastatic influence on breast cancer cells. To further assess the anti-cancer properties of HAI-1 and HAI-2 we generated recombinant HAI proteins. These recombinant HAI proteins possessed the ability to potently quench HGF activity. We also demonstrate that these recombinant HAI's suppressed fibroblast-mediated breast cancer invasion. An additional ribozyme transgenes study revealed that elimination of HAI-1 and HAI-2 expression, in an MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, significantly enhanced the migratory, proliferative and invasive nature of these breast cancer cells. Overall, our data demonstrates the important roles of HAI-1 and HAI-2 in cancer metastasis, and reveals that these serine protease inhibitors display strong therapeutic potential."

In vitro, YFP-MSS-CFP can be used to detect MMP activity and 1,10-phenathroline inhibition of MMP activity.

Whereas normal breast cells express low levels of Rad6B, increases in Rad6B expression occur in hyperplasia with overexpression in breast carcinomas. Here, we show that the human Rad6B gene is a transcriptional target of T-cell factor (TCF)-4/beta-catenin/p300. Rad6B promoter activity is subject to negative regulation in normal human MCF10A breast cells whereas it is constitutively active in metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Derepression and activation of Rad6B promoter in MCF10A cells require coexpression of beta-catenin and p300. Using electrophoresis mobility shift assay, Western blot analysis of electrophoresis mobility shift assay, UV cross-linking, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we show that Rad6B transcriptional repression in MCF10A cells is due to paucity of transcriptionally active beta-catenin assembled on the TCF binding sequence in the Rad6B promoter rather than to a deficit/decreased affinity of TCF-4 for the TCF binding element in Rad6B promoter. Three-dimensional epithelial acini generated in vitro from MCF10A cells cotransfected with beta-catenin and p300 showed beta-catenin expression on the membrane, cytoplasm, and/or nuclei with concomitant Rad6 overexpression, whereas control acini showed beta-catenin on the membranes and negligible Rad6 expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of 12 breast carcinomas showed an approximately 80% correlation between Rad6 and beta-catenin expression, and combined nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of beta-catenin and Rad6 was detected in 25% of the breast carcinomas. In vivo implantation of MCF10A-Rad6B cells produced hyperplastic lesions. These data reveal a potentially important role for transcriptionally active beta-catenin in the regulation of Rad6B gene expression, and link aberrant beta-catenin signaling with transcriptional deregulation of Rad6B and breast cancer development."

HIF-alpha protein is found at high levels in many cancers, and the redox protein thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) increases both aerobic and hypoxia-induced HIF-alpha. Therefore, Trx-1 and HIF-alpha are attractive molecular targets for novel cancer therapeutics.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated whether two novel anticancer drugs AJM290 and AW464 (quinols), which inhibit Trx-1 function, can inhibit the HIF pathway.RESULTS: Treatment of several cancer cell lines with AJM290 or AW464 prevented the hypoxia-induced increase of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at subtoxic concentrations. AJM290 and AW464 also decreased VEGF in pVHL mutant renal cell carcinoma cells that constitutively overexpress HIF-alpha protein. They surprisingly up-regulated HIF-alpha expression in breast cancer cell lines in normoxia and hypoxia as well as in pVHL mutant cells. In the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line, the compounds inhibited RNA and protein expression of the HIF-alpha target genes, carbonic anhydrase IX, VEGF, and BNIP3, concordantly with HIF-alpha up-regulation. Both compounds specifically inhibited HIF-alpha-dependent induction of hypoxia regulatory element-luciferase and HIF-1alpha hypoxia regulatory element-DNA binding. To analyze the HIF-1alpha domain inhibited by AJM290, we transfected cells with plasmids expressing a fusion protein of Gal linked to HIF-1alpha or HIF-1alpha COOH-terminal transactivation domain (CAD) with a Gal4-responsive luciferase reporter gene. AJM290 inhibited both the full-length HIF-1alpha and HIF-1alpha CAD transcriptional activity.CONCLUSIONS: AJM290 and AW464 are inhibitors of HIF-1alpha CAD transcription activity and DNA binding, but they also inhibit degradation of HIF, in contrast to other Trx inhibitors."

Therefore, Hif-alpha is an attractive target for development of novel cancer therapeutics. We have generated Chinese hamster ovary cells, which stably express luciferase reporter construct under the control of a hypoxia response element to screen 15,000 compounds. We identified 40 compounds that inhibited hypoxic up-regulation of luciferase, and the top 30 compounds were further screened in a secondary assay using MDA-468 breast cancer cell line. Eight compounds were shown to inhibit VEGF expression in hypoxic cells at subtoxic concentrations. Three top putative Hif inhibitors, DJ12, DJ15, and DJ30, were chosen for further analysis. Transient transfection of cells with hypoxia-regulated luciferase reporter plasmids further validated that these compounds inhibit hypoxia up-regulated genes. All three compounds failed to inhibit Hif-1alpha protein levels but they did inhibit induction of downstream targets of Hif-alpha under hypoxia. Two of the three compounds were cell type specific, whereas compound DJ12 inhibited VEGF at subtoxic levels in breast cancer cell lines MDA-468 and ZR-75, melanoma cell line MDA-435, and pVHL mutant renal cancer cell lines RCC4 and 786-0. Compound DJ12 down-regulated mRNA of downstream targets of Hif-alpha, and significantly inhibited Hif-1alpha transactivation activity by blocking Hif-1alpha hypoxia response element-DNA binding.

The best-characterized mechanism of retinoid action is stimulation of transcription from promoters containing RA response elements (RARE). Retinoids induce senescence-like growth arrest in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells; this effect is associated with the induction of several growth-inhibitory genes. We have now found that these genes are induced by RAR-specific but not by RXR-specific ligands. Genome-scale microarray analysis of gene expression was used to compare the effects of two pan-RAR ligands, one of which is a strong agonist of RARE-dependent transcription, whereas the other induces such transcription only weakly and antagonizes the inducing effect of RAR agonists. Both RAR ligands, however, produced very similar effects on gene expression in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that RARE-dependent transcription is only a minor component of retinoid-induced changes in gene expression. The effects of RAR ligands on gene expression parallel changes associated with damage-induced senescence, and both ligands induced G(1) arrest and the senescent phenotype in MCF-7 cells. The RAR ligands up-regulated many tumor-suppressive genes and down-regulated multiple genes with oncogenic activities. Genes that are strongly induced by RAR ligands encode secreted bioactive proteins, including several tumor-suppressing factors. In agreement with these observations, retinoid-treated MCF-7 cells inhibited the growth of retinoid-insensitive MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells in coculture. These results indicate that RARE-independent transcriptional effects of RAR ligands lead to senescence-like growth arrest and paracrine growth-inhibitory activity in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells."

The WT1 protein belongs to the early growth response family of zinc-finger transcription factors. Uniquely to WT1, an evolutionarily conserved alternative splice event inserts the tripeptide KTS, between zinc fingers 3 and 4. Whereas -KTS isoforms bind DNA and activate or repress transcription, +KTS isoforms bind DNA less efficiently and interact with splice factors and RNA in vitro and in vivo. Although candidate DNA targets have been found, physiological mRNA targets are yet to be defined. We examined the distribution of WT1 in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes in nuclear extract prepared from M15 cells, a mouse mesonephric fetal kidney cell line. WT1 cofractionated with the splice factor PSF in large RNP particles &gt;or=2 MDa. We also found that PSF co-immunoprecipitated with WT1, suggesting a functional interaction between these 2 multifunctional proteins. Using yeast three-hybrid library constructed from the co-immunoprecipitated RNA we found that WT1 (+KTS) binds close to or at the start codon of alpha-actinin 1 (ACTN1) mRNA. A band shift assay confirmed the ability of the WT1 zinc-finger domain (+KTS) to bind this sequence in vitro. ACTN1 is the first likely physiological mRNA target of WT1."

Here we describe a novel interaction between DDR1, a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by collagen, and the phosphoprotein DARPP-32 in mammary epithelial cells. DARPP-32 expression was readily detected in non-transformed mammary cell lines, but was strongly reduced or even absent in breast tumor cell lines, such as MCF7. Transfection of MCF7 cells with DARPP-32 resulted in severely impaired cell migration, while DARPP-32 transfection into the DDR1-deficient breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 did not alter migration. Co-expression of both DDR1 and DARPP-32 in MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited migration, thereby supporting a critical role of the DDR1/DARPP-32 complex in motility. Mutational substitution of the phosphorylation sites Thr-34 or Thr-75 on DARPP-32 revealed that phosphorylation of Thr-34 is necessary for the ability of DARPP-32 to impair breast tumor cell migration. Thus, DARPP-32 signaling downstream of DDR1 is a potential new target for effective anti-metastatic breast cancer therapy."

We present here the complete cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence of two hemoglobin polypeptides from the planorbid Biomphalaria glabrata (intermediate host snail for the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni). Both isoforms contain 13 different, cysteine-free globin domains, plus a small N-terminal nonglobin &quot;plug&quot; domain with three cysteines for subunit dimerization (total M(r) approximately 238 kDa). We also identified the native hemoglobin molecule and present here a preliminary 3D reconstruction from electron microscopical images (3 nm resolution); it suggests a 3 x 2-mer quaternary structure (M(r) approximately 1.43 MDa). Moreover, we identified a previously undescribed rosette-like hemolymph protein that has been mistaken for hemoglobin. We also detected expression of an incomplete hemocyanin as trace component. The combined data show that B. glabrata hemoglobin evolved from pulmonate myoglobin, possibly to replace a less-efficient hemocyanin, and reveals a surprisingly simple evolutionary mechanism to create a high molecular mass respiratory protein from 78 similar globin domains."

Here we demonstrate that oligoamines specifically suppress the mRNA and protein expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and ERalpha target genes in ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines, whereas neither ERbeta nor other steroid hormonal receptors are affected by oligoamines. The constitutive expression of a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven exogenous ERalpha in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells was not altered by oligoamines, suggesting that oligoamines specifically suppress ERalpha transcription rather than affect mRNA or protein stability. Further analysis demonstrated that oligoamines disrupted the DNA binding activity of Sp1 transcription factor family members to an ERalpha minimal promoter element containing GC/CA-rich boxes. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 or expression of the c-Jun dominant negative inhibitor TAM67 blocked the oligoamine-activated JNK/c-Jun pathway and enhanced oligoamine-inhibited ERalpha expression, suggesting that AP-1 is a positive regulator of ERalpha expression and that oligoamine-activated JNK/AP-1 activity may antagonize the down-regulation of ERalpha induced by oligoamines. Taken together, these results suggest a novel antiestrogenic mechanism for specific polyamine analogues in human breast cancer cells."

The CB1 and CB2 receptors recognize endogenous and exogenous cannabinoid compounds, which fall into five structurally diverse classes. Mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies have identified several key amino acid residues involved in the selective recognition of these ligands. Numerous residues involved in receptor activation have been elucidated. Regions of the CB1 receptor mediating desensitization and internalization have also been discovered. The known genetic structures of the CB1 and CB2 receptors indicate polymorphisms and multiple exons that maybe involved in tissue and species-specific regulation of these genes. The cannabinoid receptors are regulated during chronic agonist exposure, and gene expression is altered in disease states. There is a complex molecular architecture of the cannabinoid receptors that allows a single receptor to recognize multiple classes of compounds and produce an array of distinct downstream effects."

ST7 suppressed growth of PC-3 prostate cancer cells inoculated subcutaneously into severe combined immunodeficient mice, and increased the latency of tumor detection from 13 days in control tumors to 23 days. Re-expression of ST7 was also associated with suppression of colony formation under anchorage-independent conditions in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and ST7 mRNA expression was downregulated in 44% of primary breast cancers. Expression profiling of PC-3 cells revealed that ST7 predominantly induces changes in genes involved in re-modeling the extracellular matrix such as SPARC, IGFBP5 and several matrix metalloproteinases. These data indicate that ST7 may mediate tumor suppression through modification of the tumor microenvironment."

To identify the structure of the epitope in the protein recognized by mAb1F83, in the present study, we exposed chain B from bovine insulin (insulin B chain) to MDA and characterized the MDA adducts by mass spectrometry. The MDA-modified insulin B chain was digested with V8 protease, and the resulting peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography--electrospray ionization--mass spectrometry (LC--ESI--MS/MS). The MS/MS analyses confirmed the formation of N-propenal- (+54 Da) and dihydropyridine-type (DHP, +134 Da) adducts in both Lys29 and the N-terminus of insulin B chain. The ELISA analysis of HPLC fractions of peptides, including the DHP adducts using mAb1F83, showed that the immunoreactivity of the DHP--lysine adduct was more significant than the DHP--N-terminus adduct.

Tumor-produced parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), a known stimulator of osteoclastic bone resorption, is a major mediator of the osteolytic process in breast cancer. We have previously shown that PTHrP increases breast cancer cell proliferation, survival, migration, and pro-invasive integrin alpha6beta4 expression. To determine the role of integrin alpha6beta4 in these PTHrP-mediated effects, we utilized two strategies to modulate expression of the alpha6 and beta4 subunits in parental and PTHrP-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells: overexpression of alpha6beta4 by transfection with constructs encoding the alpha6 and beta4 subunits, and suppression of endogenous alpha6beta4 expression by transfection with siRNAs targeting these subunits. We now show that the effects of PTHrP are mediated via upregulation of integrin alpha6beta4 expression. We also show that integrin alpha6beta4 expression is modulated at the mRNA level, indicating a transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional mechanism of action for PTHrP. PTHrP expression also increased the levels of phosphorylated Akt, with a consequent increase in the levels of phosphorylated (inactive) glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). The role of PTHrP in breast cancer growth and metastasis may thus be mediated via upregulation of integrin alpha6beta4 expression and Akt activation, with consequent inactivation of GSK-3."

We hypothesized that AP2 factors regulate a set of genes characteristic of the hormone responsive breast cancer phenotype. To better understand the role of AP2 factors in hormone responsive breast cancer, we sought to identify AP2-target genes in breast epithelial cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Overexpression of AP2 factors was achieved in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) using adenoviral vectors. AP2 target genes were identified by comparative hybridization to cDNA microarrays containing 30,000 human genes. Expression patterns were confirmed by Northern and Western blot and by elimination of AP2 using siRNA. Potential regulatory elements in promoters of target genes were identified by DNase I hypersensitive site mapping.RESULTS: Comparative cDNA microarray hybridization identified a set of genes induced by overexpression of AP2alpha and AP2gamma in HMECs. The up-regulation of cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2 (CRABPII), EST-1, and ECM1 was induced by overexpression of AP2alpha, AP2gamma, or a chimeric AP2 factor in which the activation domain of AP2alpha was replaced by the activation domain of herpesvirus VP16. Interestingly, hormone unresponsive MDA-MB-231 cells were resistant to CRABPII induction by any of the AP2 factors. Elimination of AP2gamma in MCF7 cells resulted in a significant reduction in CRABPII expression. AP2alpha induced DNase I hypersensitive sites in the promoter of the CRABPII gene at -5000 bp, which corresponds to the site of action of RAR/RXR factors.CONCLUSIONS: AP2 factors regulate CRABPII expression in HMECs and breast cancer cells and accounts for the associated expression of ERalpha and CRABPII in hormone responsive breast cancer. Because CRABPII mediates growth suppressive effects of RA in breast cancer, the data suggest that AP2 factors have the ability to mediate RA responsiveness through the regulation of CRABP II expression."

Treatment of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with BMS-387032 led to a stabilization of the E2F1 protein that was accompanied by significant increases in the p57 mRNA and protein. This increase did not occur in an E2F1-deficient cell line. An E2F1-estrogen receptor fusion protein activated the endogenous p57 promoter in response to hydroxytamoxifen treatment in the presence of cycloheximide. Luciferase constructs driven by the p57 promoter verified that upregulation of p57 mRNA by BMS-387032 is transcriptional and dependent on E2F-binding sites in the promoter. Expression of exogenous p57 significantly decreased the fraction of cells in S phase. Furthermore, p57-deficient MDA-MB-231 cell lines were significantly more sensitive to BMS-387032-induced apoptosis than controls. The results presented in this manuscript demonstrate that small molecule cdk inhibitors transcriptionally activate p57 dependent upon E2F1 and that this activation in turn serves to limit E2F1's death-inducing activity."

In the present study, we examined the specific roles of PKCbeta1 and beta2 in growth control in human breast cancer cell lines. The PKCbeta-specific inhibitor LY379196 significantly inhibited growth of the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and BT474, but not the normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10F. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with LY379196 caused an increase in the fraction of cells in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. To explore the roles of PKCbeta1 and beta2, we used cDNA expression vectors that encode wild-type and constitutively activated or dominant negative mutants of these two proteins. When compared with vector controls, derivatives of MCF-7 cells that stably overexpress wild-type PKCbeta1 or PKCbeta2 displayed a slight increase in growth rate; derivatives that stably express the constitutively active mutants of PKCbeta1 or PKCbeta2 displayed a marked increase in growth rate; and derivatives that stably express a dominant negative mutant of PKCbeta1 or beta2 displayed inhibition of growth. The derivatives of MCF-7 cells that stably express the constitutively activated mutants of PKCbeta1 or beta2 were more resistant to growth inhibition by LY379196 than the vector control MCF-7 cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated that MCF-7 cells that stably overexpress wild-type or constitutively activated mutants of PKCbeta1 or beta2 had higher cellular levels of cyclin D1 than vector control cells, whereas cells that express a dominant negative mutant had decreased levels of cyclin D1. The derivatives that stably express the constitutively activated mutants of PKCbeta1 or beta2 also displayed increased cyclin D1 promoter activity in transient transfection luciferase reporter assays, and this induction of activity requires activator protein 1. Constitutively activated PKCbeta1 and beta2 also enhanced the transcription of c-fos in transient transfection luciferase reporter assays. Thus, PKCbeta1 and beta2 may play important positive roles in the growth of at least a subset of human breast cancers. Therefore, inhibitors of these isoforms may be useful in breast cancer chemoprevention or therapy."

Mutations of p53 occur in over 40% of breast cancers and are indicative of tumor resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Recently, there has been a high degree of interest in pharmacological approaches for restoring the normal function to mutant p53. The low molecular weight compound p53 reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis (PRIMA-1) was shown to induce cytotoxic effects and apoptosis in human tumor cells with mutant p53. Here, we studied the molecular mechanisms of PRIMA-1-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells with p53 mutations such as MDA-231 and GI-101A as compared to MCF-7 cells. We show that PRIMA-1 selectively induces apoptosis in human breast cancer cells MDA-231 and GI-101A compared to the MCF-7. This effect was paralleled by an increase in total p53 level in the nucleus and the induction of its phosphorylation at Ser-15 site. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we show that PRIMA-1 restored p53 DNA binding activity to the promoters of the proapoptotic genes such as Bax and PUMA, but inhibited the binding activity to the promoters of the MAP4K4 gene. Knockdown of p53 protein in breast cancer cells using siRNA followed by PRIMA-1 treatment resulted in decline of Bax and PUMA proteins expression. Cell incubation with either PRIMA-1 or SP600125 (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase inhibitor) resulted in the abrogation of adriamycin-induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, whereas Bax activation was not inhibited. We conclude that both Bax and PUMA but not JNK signaling are involved in PRIMA-1-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells with p53 mutation."

In the current study we provide evidence to suggest that the induction of acetylcholinesterase expression during apoptosis is regulated by the mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+). During apoptosis, treatment of HeLa and MDA-MB-435s cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 resulted in a significant increase in acetylcholinesterase mRNA and protein levels. Chelation of intracellular Ca(2+) by BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester), an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator, inhibited acetylcholinesterase expression. A23187 also enhanced the stability of acetylcholinesterase mRNA and increased the activity of acetylcholinesterase promoter, effects that were blocked by BAPTA-AM. Perturbations of cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis by thapsigargin resulted in the increase of acetylcholinesterase expression as well as acetylcholinesterase promoter activity during thapsigargin induced apoptosis in HeLa and MDA-MB-435s cells, effects that were also inhibited by BAPTA-AM. We further demonstrated that the transactivation of the human acetylcholinesterase promoter by A23187 and thapsigargin was partially mediated by a CCAAT motif within the -1270 to -1248 fragment of the human acetylcholinesterase promoter. This motif was able to bind to CCAAT binding factor (CBF/NF-Y). These results strongly suggest that cytosolic Ca(2+) plays a key role in acetylcholinesterase regulation during apoptosis induced by A23187 and thapsigargin."

We investigated the plasmid contents of 18 Neisseria lactamica isolates and 20 nasopharyngeal Neisseria meningitidis isolates. Of 18 N. lactamica strains, 9 harbored one or more plasmids, whereas only one N. meningitidis isolate contained a plasmid. Twelve plasmids were completely sequenced, while five plasmid sequences from the public databases were also included in the analyses.

Three plasmids from N. lactamica appeared to be highly similar on the nucleotide level to the meningococcal plasmids pJS-A (&gt;99%) and pJS-B (&gt;75%). The genetic organizations of two plasmids show a striking resemblance with that of the recently identified meningococcal disease-associated (MDA) phage, while four putative proteins encoded by these plasmids show 25% to 39% protein identity to those encoded by the MDA phage. The putative promoter of the gene encoding the replicase on these plasmids contains a polycytidine tract, suggesting that replication is subjected to phase variation. In conclusion, extensive plasmid diversity is encountered among commensal neisseriae. Members of three plasmid groups are found in both pathogenic and commensal neisseriae, indicating plasmid exchange between these species. Resemblance between plasmids and MDA phage may be indicative of dissemination of phage-related sequences among pathogenic and commensal neisseriae."

The molecular mechanism(s) underlying the deregulated expression of KLK6 during cancer progression are currently unknown. Here, we provide evidence that aberrant expression of KLK6 is regulated at the level of transcription by multiple cooperating mechanisms. KLK6 can be reactivated in non-expressing breast cancer cells by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a compound causing DNA demethylation. Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, resulted in moderate induction of KLK6 only in MDA-MB-231 cells. However, combined 5-aza-dC/TSA treatment resulted in synergistic activation of KLK6. We show that KLK6 inactivation is associated with hypermethylation of specific CpG dinucleotides located in the KLK6 proximal promoter and overexpression with complete demethylation. These results indicate a causal role of DNA methylation and chromatin structure in cancer-associated loss of KLK6 expression. In some breast cancer cell lines, KLK6 expression could be restored by the vitamin D3 analog EB1089. Our data indicate that transcriptional deregulation of KLK6 in cancer cells during breast cancer progression is complex and certainly not uniform in different tumors, involving epigenetic mechanisms as well as pathways regulated by nuclear receptors. This allows for the pharmacological modulation of KLK6 with potential therapeutic implications."

We investigated the ability of MDA to amplify samples containing very small amounts of target DNA (5 pg to 1 ng) in the presence of a second, larger DNA sample for downstream short tandem repeat (STR) multiplex genotyping. We observed that STR amplification success of the minor fraction was increased in these mixed samples when compared with standard PCR only or MDA containing only the single trace DNA sample. Increased numbers of alleles were detected, with less amplification bias between loci than in single source samples undergoing the same protocol. To improve the STR genotyping accuracy, animal DNA was substituted for the additional human DNA, maintaining the increase in the number and quality of human-specific STR loci amplified. Polyethylene glycol 400, a commonly used crowding agent, was used as a replacement for the added genomic DNA in the MDA reaction and produced very similar results. Therefore, we suggest that additional DNA is acting as a molecular crowding agent during MDA. Performing MDA on trace amounts of DNA under crowded conditions results in greater numbers of alleles being amplified and more balanced amplification occurring between alleles."

Peaks are referenced against the lookup table to obtain a complete profile of amino acid combinations, and combinations are assembled into series of increasing length. Concatenating the differences between successive entries in compositional series yields peptide sequences that can be scored and ranked according to signal intensity.

Using both oligonucleotide single-nucleotide polymorphism and mRNA expression arrays, we integrated genomic and transcriptional information to identify and prioritize candidate cancer genes in regions of increased and decreased chromosomal copy number in a cohort of primary breast cancers. Confirming the validity of this approach, several regions of previously-known copy number (CN) alterations in breast cancer could be successfully reidentified. Focusing on regions of decreased CN, we defined a prioritized list of eighteen candidate genes, which included ARPIN, FBN1, and LZTS1, previously shown to be associated with cancers in breast or other tissue types, and novel genes such as P29, MORF4L1, and TBC1D5. One such gene, the RUNX3 transcription factor, was selected for further study. We show that RUNX3 is present at reduced CNs in proportion to the rest of the tumor genome and that RUNX3 CN reductions can also be observed in a breast cancer series from a different center. Using tissue microarrays, we demonstrate in an independent cohort of over 120 breast tissues that RUNX3 protein is expressed in normal breast epithelium but not fat and stromal tissue, and widely down-regulated in the majority of breast cancers (&gt;85%). In vitro, RUNX3 overexpression suppressed the invasive potential of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in a matrigel assay.

In contrast, the antiestrogens ICI 182,780 and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) were inactive in this assay. We have investigated the effects of these compounds and several structurally-diverse estrogenic compounds on transactivation in cells transfected with pERE(3) and wild-type ERalpha, mutant ERalpha (1-553), and ERalpha (1-537) containing deletions of amino acids 595-554 and 595-538, respectively. These constructs were used to develop an in vitro assay to distinguish between different structural classes of estrogenic compounds. The results obtained using these constructs were highly cell context- and structure-dependent. Neither E2- nor diethylstilbestrol-induced transactivation in MCF-7 (or MDA-MB-231) cells transfected with pERE(3)/ERalpha (1-537) due to partial deletion of helix 12; however, octylphenol and nonlylphenol, resveratrol (a phytoestrogen), kepone and 2',3',4',5'-tetrachloro-4-biphenylol were &quot;estrogenic&quot; in MCF-7 cells transfected with pERE(3)/ERalpha (1-537). Moreover, the structure-dependent estrogenic activities of several synthetic estrogens (xenoestrogens) in MDA-MB-231 cells were different than those observed in MCF-7 cells. These results demonstrate that the estrogenic activity of many synthetic compounds do not require activation function 2 (AF-2) of ERalpha and are mechanistically different from E2.

In order to circumvent the problem of tumor specificity, the suicide gene, HSV-1 thymidine kinase (HSV-Tk), was modified with a complex 5' upstream-untranslated region (5'-UTR) that limits efficient translation to cells expressing high levels of the translation initiation factor, eIF4E. Since previous studies have shown that most tumor cells express elevated levels of eIF4E, tumor-specific gene delivery was optimized by incorporation of the 5'-UTR-modified suicide gene (HSV-UTk) into an adenovirus vector (Ad-CMV-UTk). The efficacy of this novel approach of targeting suicide gene expression and limiting cytotoxicity by means of translational restriction was tested in vitro with the use of the human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB435, and ZR-75-1). As controls, normal MCF10A, HMEC, and HMSC cell lines that express relatively low levels of eIF4E were used. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to quantify HSV-Tk mRNA for cells infected with Ad-CMV-UTk as well as with Ad-CMV-Tk (a control adenovirus in which HSV-Tk is not regulated at the level of translation). Translation of HSV-Tk in the Ad-infected cells was measured by Western blot analysis. In addition, cytotoxicity was determined following treatment with the pro-drug ganciclovir (GCV) using an MTT viability assay. Finally, microPET imaging was used to assess cancer cell-specific expression of HSV-Tk and expression in normal tissues in vivo after intraperitoneal injection of Ad-CMV-Tk or Ad-CMV-UTk. These data collectively showed enhanced cancer cell-specific gene expression and reduced normal tissue gene expression for the Ad-HSV-UTk compared to the Ad-CMV-Tk, leading to increased cancer cell-enhanced GCV cytotoxicity. These results indicate that translational targeting of suicide gene expression in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo is effective and may provide a platform for enhanced cancer gene therapy specificity."

In the present study, a fungus strain G1 isolated from wild C. sinensis was identified and initially characterized. A phylogenetic tree was generated based on the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of related fungi. The analysis of ITS sequence showed that fungus G1 was clustered together with C. sinensis, Tolypocladium cylindrosporum and Tolypocladium inflatum in the phylogenetic tree. Both the morphological character and the ITS sequence analysis establish that fungus G1 is one of the anamorph strains of C. sinensis and belongs to Tolypocladium genus. Furthermore, the polysaccharide (PS) extracted from fungus G1 and its antioxidant activity on H22-bearing mice was investigated. H22 cells were hypodermically injected into the right oxter of each mouse after the ICR mice were treated with PS by means of gavage for 7 days. Then the same administration process continued for 9 days. At the end of the experiments, the tumor weight of each mouse was measured. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in mouse liver, brain and serum, as well as glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in mouse liver and brain were assayed.

The mechanisms underlying such resistance are poorly understood. Herein we show that all CLL B-cells tested (30/30) display high mRNA and protein expression of the tumor suppressor Mda-7/IL-24, an IL-10 family member, in comparison to normal B cells. A downstream Mda-7 signaling target, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was highly phosphorylated in all CLL cells but not in normal B-cells. Mda-7 expression and p38 MAPK phosphorylation diminished in culture and the latter could be reinduced by recombinant (r)-IL-24 or LPS and Mda-7 transfection. Mda-7/IL-24 siRNA specifically inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation in CLL without affecting p38 MAPK, bcl2, or Lyn expression, further demonstrating the direct role of Mda-7/IL-24 in p38 MAPK activation. Both pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK and Mda-7 silencing augmented spontaneous apoptosis by three-fold in CLL cells cultured in autologous serum, which was reversed by LPS and r-IL-24. We established the role of p38 MAPK in CLL cell survival and demonstrated a paradoxical effect, whereby Mda-7 and IL-24, inducers of apoptosis in diverse cancer cells, promote the survival of CLL B-cells through p38 MAPK activation."

We used the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) method to generate a subtracted cDNA library enriched with gene transcripts differentially expressed after 1 day post-infection. Some of the ESTs from the infected tissues fell in gene categories related to stress and immune responses. For the reverse library (ESTs expressed in controls compared with infected tissues) the most abundant transcripts were of ribosomal and mitochondrial nature. Several ESTs potentially induced by virus exposure were selected for in vivo expression studies. We observed a clear difference in expression between infected and control samples for two candidate genes, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 7 interacting protein, which seems to play an important role in apoptosis and the interferon induced protein with helicase C domain 1 (mda-5) that contributes to apoptosis and regulates the type I IFN production, a key molecule of the antiviral innate response in most organisms."

Although ER is a predictive marker for tamoxifen response, ER status fails to predict tamoxifen response in a significant number of patients highlighting the need to identify new pathways for tamoxifen sensitivity/resistance. To identify novel proteins induced by tamoxifen in breast cancer cells sensitive to tamoxifen growth inhibition, two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis was used to profile proteins in T47D breast cancer cells. Six proteins were identified that were differentially regulated by 17beta-estradiol, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and the pure antagonist acolbifene (EM-652); calreticulin, synapse associated protein 1 (SYAP1), CD2 antigen binding protein 2 (CD2BP2), nucleosome assembly protein 1 like 1 (NAP1L1), d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3-PHGDH) and pyridoxine 5' phosphate oxidase (PNPO). At the mRNA level, these ligands differentially regulated expression of mRNAs encoding the identified proteins in T47D and MCF7 cells but had no effect on mRNA in ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

Cited2 interacts with cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP)/p300, TFAP2, Lhx2, and nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and estrogen receptor to function as a transcriptional modulator. Overexpression of Cited2 in Rat1 cells leads to tumor formation in nude mice, suggesting that Cited2 is a transforming gene. Through microarray analysis, Cited2 was found to be down-regulated by transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta) in various cell lines. In this study, we confirmed that both mRNA and protein levels of Cited2 are down-regulated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Overexpression of Smad7 or knockdown of Smad4 in MDA-MB-231 cells showed that the Smad pathway is involved in the down-regulation of Cited2. Based on nuclear run-on analysis and Cited2 promoter/reporter assay, Cited2 transcription was not affected by TGF-beta, supporting that down-regulation of Cited2 by TGF-beta is most likely through post-transcriptional regulation. By using transcriptional inhibitors, we demonstrated that the turnover of Cited2 transcripts appears to be accelerated during TGF-beta stimulation. Pharmacologic inhibition of translation with cycloheximide attenuated Cited2 down-regulation by TGF-beta. We examined the expression of recombinant Cited2 gene introduced into MDA-MB-231 cells by stable transfection, and we found that mRNA containing the Cited2 protein-coding region controlled by a heterologous promoter indeed responds to TGF-beta-mediated down-regulation. Study from Cited2 deletion mutants showed that the C-terminal conserved region of Cited2 coding sequence is essential for the down-regulation. This is the first demonstration that TGF-beta-mediated down-regulation of Cited2 is post-transcriptional, through the Smad pathway, and requires the presence of its coding sequence."

We used Affymetrix HG-U133 GeneChip technology to compare genome-wide expression profiles of ventral and dorsal tegmentum from 8 weeks GA human embryos, in order to identify genes involved in specification, differentiation, and survival of mesencephalic DA (mDA) neurons. Known mDA marker genes including ALDH1A1, DAT1, VMAT2, TH, CALB1, NURR1, FOXA1, GIRK2, PITX3, RET, and DRD2 topped the list of 96 genes from HG-U133A with higher expression in VT, validating the experimental set-up.

Calcium modulates protein structure and function and may act as a molecular signal or switch in cells. The relationship between MMPs and calcium has barely been studied and is absent for MMP-26. We have investigated the calcium-binding sites and the role of calcium in MMP-26. MMP-26 has one high-affinity and one low-affinity calcium binding site. High-affinity calcium binding was restored at physiologically low calcium conditions with a calcium-dissociation constant of 63 nM without inducing secondary and tertiary structural changes. High-affinity calcium binding protects MMP-26 against thermal denaturation. Mutants of this site (D165A or E191A) lose enzymatic activity. Low-affinity calcium binding was restored at relatively high calcium concentrations and showed a K(d2) (low-affinity calcium-dissociation constant) value of 120 microM, which was accompanied with the recovery of enzymatic activity reversibly and tertiary structural changes, but without secondary structural rearrangements. Mutations at the low-affinity calcium-binding site (C3 site), K189E or D114A, induced enhanced affinity for the Ca2+ ion or an irreversible loss of enzymatic activity triggered by low-affinity calcium binding respectively. Mutation at non-calcium-binding site (V184D at C2 site) showed that C2 is not a true calcium-binding site. Observations from homology-modelled mutant structures correlated with these experimental results.

The cytotoxic action of these drugs has been linked to their ability to inhibit microtubule depolymerization, causing growth arrest and subsequent cell death. Studies by a number of laboratories have also linked suppression of MEK1/2 signaling to enhanced Taxol toxicity in vitro and in vivo. The present study examined the interactions of the semi-synthetic taxane Taxotere with MEK1/2 inhibitors in epithelial tumor cells. In vitro colony formation studies demonstrated that Taxotere and the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD184352 interacted in a sequence dependent fashion to synergistically kill human mammary carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231, MCF7) as well as in other tumor cell types; e.g. prostate and renal cell carcinoma. Athymic mice were implanted in the rear flank with either MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells and tumors permitted to form to a volume of approximately 100 mm3 prior to a two day exposure of either Vehicle, PD184352 (25 mg/kg), Taxotere (15 mg/kg) or the drug combination. Tumor volume was measured every other day and tumor growth determined over the following approximately 30 days. Transient exposure of MDA-MB-231 tumors or MCF7 tumors to PD184352 did not significantly alter tumor growth rate or the mean tumor volume in vivo approximately 15-30 days after drug administration. Transient Taxotere exposure of MDA-MB-231 or to a lesser extent MCF7, tumors modestly reduced the mean tumor volume in vivo approximately 15-30 days after drug administration. In contrast, combined treatment with PD184352 and Taxotere significantly reduced MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 tumor growth. The tumor control values for MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF7 cells were 0.43 and 0.71, respectively. Fractionated irradiation of MDA-MB-231 tumors during drug exposure or single dose irradiation prior to drug administration did not significantly further suppress tumor growth beyond that of cells exposed to Taxotere and MEK1/2 inhibitor. Single dose irradiation of tumors after drug exposure, however, caused a significant further suppression of tumor growth below that caused by drug exposure. These findings were also reflected in ex vivo colony formation analyses of isolated tumor cells. Collectively, these findings argue that Taxotere and MEK1/2 inhibitors have the potential to suppress mammary tumor growth in vivo which is enhanced by sequence-dependent exposure to ionizing radiation. Based on the cell lines used in these studies, our findings argue that the interaction of Taxotere and PD184352 is independent of p53 status, estrogen dependency, caspase 3 levels or oncogenic K-RAS expression."

Negative-stain electron microscopy enabled the identification of double-ringed particles and single hexameric rings (&quot;pinwheels&quot;) resulting from partial staining. A 2D average of these pinwheels showed marked similarity to the corresponding structures found in preparations of GSI, except that the arms of the subunits were 40% longer. Reconstructions from particles embedded in vitreous ice showed that GlnN has a double-ringed, dodecameric structure with a 6-fold dihedral space group (D6) symmetry and dimensions of 17.0 nm parallel with the 6-fold axis and 18.3 nm parallel with the 2-fold axes. The structures, combined with a sequence alignment based on structural principles, showed how many aspects of the structure of GSI, and most notably the alpha/beta barrel fold active site were preserved. There was evidence for the presence of this structure in the reconstructed volume, thus, identifying the indentations between the pinwheel spokes as putative active sites and suggesting conservation of the overall molecular geometry found in GSI despite their low level of global homology. Furthermore, docking of GSI into the reconstruction left sufficient plausibly located unoccupied density to account for the additional residues in GSIII, thus validating the structure."

It was found that the malondialdehyde (MDA) increased with superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreasing in the inner ear of the rat treated with d-galactose than of the control. However, there was no significant difference in elevation of ABR threshold between the rat with mtDNA4834 deletion induced by d-galactose and control. After aminoglycoside antibiotic injected, the hearing threshold of the rats carrying mtDNA4834 deletion increased significantly compared with the rats without mtDNA4834 deletion. The results show that resembled accelerated aging in the inner ear of the rat could be induced by injecting d-galactose. Moreover, those suggest that mtDNA4834 deletion can not directly induce the hearing loss, but acting as a predisposing factor which can greatly enhance the sensitivity of the inner ear to the aminoglycoside antibiotic."

Journal international du cancer";4;2006;"Nuclear targeting of a midregion PTHrP fragment is necessary for stimulating growth in breast cancer cells.";"Parathyroid-hormone related protein (PTHrP) is the primary factor in humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy and is highly secreted by breast cancers. The pro-hormone undergoes post-translational processing and cleavage to give rise to mature secretory peptides, one of which is midregion PTHrP (38-94/95/101) containing a nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) in amino acids (87-106). The current study investigates whether the NLS in midregion PTHrP is important in breast cancer growth. PTHrP-(67-101), a midregion PTHrP fragment containing NLS-(87-101) significantly increased growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells (126.3 and 121.3% of control respectively in serum conditions), independent of PTHR1 whereas PTHrP-(67-86), which lacks the NLS did not. Fluorescent-labelled PTHrP-(67-101) translocated to the nucleus, whereas PTHrP-(67-86) remained cytosolic and a scrambled(+NLS) peptide was not internalised. In comparison, no growth influence or uptake was seen in non-tumour breast cells (Hs578Bst). Increases in intracellular calcium mobilisation were observed in breast cancer cells stimulated with both PTHrP-(67-101) and PTHrP-(67-86) (EC(50) of 3.2 pM and 2.2 pM respectively for MCF-7 cells), whereas inositide turnover was not detected. Both nuclear uptake and calcium signalling were attenuated in the presence of EGTA, but not with U73122 or N-terminal PTHrP peptides. Our studies indicate that the NLS-containing midregion PTHrP peptide is dependent on both internalisation and nuclear translocation to induce growth in breast cancer cells. These findings highlight the importance of midregion PTHrP and its receptor in breast cancer growth and may provide potential targets for future therapeutic intervention."

The synthesis of this lipopeptide, C16-A7R, formed by the sequence of 7 amino acids ATWLPPR, linked to a palmitoyl fatty chain by an amide bond was described. After the characterisation of cationic liposomes formulated with the lipopeptide, the results obtained using various techniques showed that the lipopeptide-based liposomes were well accumulated in cells of the human breast cancer line MDA-MB-231 overexpressing NRP-1. Delivery of reporter genes expressing either beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) was selectively enhanced in these cells when compared with NRP-1-negative cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, an increase by 250% in beta-gal activity was observed when delivered by lipopeptide-based liposomes compared to cationic liposomes alone."

Our aim was to investigate if the isolated genomic DNA from archival plasma/serum, combined with multiple strand displacement amplification (MDA) can be used for genotyping.METHODS: Nine archival plasma/serum samples and freshly frozen gastric biopsies from the same nine H. pylori-infected subjects were used for DNA isolation. Subsequently, MDA-DNA derived from the plasma/serum samples and DNA isolated from the antrum biopsies were analyzed by PCR amplification and pyrosequencing for the presence of interleukin-1beta gene (IL-1B) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). In addition, Southern blot and pyrosequencing analysis of H. pylori-specific PCR amplicons were performed.RESULTS: IL-1B SNP profiles obtained from the plasma/serum MDA-DNA and antrum biopsy DNA were identical. A C/C genotype was observed in 7 of 9 samples, and 2 of 9 revealed a C/T genotype for IL-1B -511. Similarly, 7 of 9 had a T/T, and 2 of 9 had a C/T genotype for IL-1B -31; 4 of 9 had a C/C, 4 of 9 had a C/T, and 1 of 9 had a T/T genotype, respectively, for IL-1B +3954. Moreover, pyrosequencing analysis revealed the presence of H. pylori 26695 and J99-like 16S rDNA variable V3 region sequence motifs in the antrum biopsies but not in the plasma/serum samples.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that MDA combined with pyrosequencing enables a rapid and accurate molecular typing of cytokine single nucleotide polymorphisms from archival plasma/serum samples."

In tumor cell lines, constitutive HRPAP20 expression enhanced proliferation and suppressed apoptosis, characteristics frequently associated with malignant progression. Here, we report that highly invasive breast cancer cell lines and human breast tumor specimens express elevated HRPAP20, which in transfection experiments in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, increased invasion. Results from mechanistic studies revealed that HRPAP20 bound to calmodulin (CaM) via a conserved CaM-binding motif. Transfection of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with HRPAP20 harboring a mutated CaM-binding motif (HRPAP20K73A) inhibited its interaction with CaM and failed to increase invasion. Other experiments revealed that transfection with HRPAP20, but not HRPAP20K73A, increased secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Moreover, knockdown of HRPAP20 with small interfering RNA in MCF-7/HRPAP20 transfectants and wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells reduced invasion and inhibited secretion of MMP-9. Together these observations suggest that HRPAP20 may be an important regulator of breast tumor cell invasion by a CaM-mediated mechanism that leads to increased MMP-9 secretion. We conclude that dysregulation of HRPAP20 expression in tumor cells may contribute to the observed phenotypic changes associated with breast cancer progression."

We previously showed that PA can inhibit the growth of estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer cells and that this activity is, at least in part, mediated by the ability of the compound to inhibit transcriptional activation driven by estrogen response elements (EREs). We now shed additional light on the antiestrogenic action of PA by determining its effects on early events in the estrogen-signaling pathway.METHODS: MCF-7 breast cancer cells were used in this study. ER-ERE binding activity, and subsequent effects on ER and progesterone receptors (PR), c-myc, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21ASF1/CP1/MDA-6 (p21) were evaluated using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, real-time RT-PCR, and western blotting methodologies. Effects of PA on p21 promoter activity were assessed in transient transfection experiments utilizing p21 promoter-reporter gene constructs.RESULTS: We demonstrate that PA treatment can block ER-ERE binding activity and that this effect is accompanied by downregulation of PR and c-myc, two genes which are transcriptionally regulated by estrogen through novel-ER-binding sites. Suppression of c-myc by PA is followed by increased mRNA levels of p21, an effect that is mediated by PA activation of the p21 promoter. Forced overexpression of c-myc through co-transfection of MCF-7 cells with a c-myc expression plasmid prevented PA upregulation of p21 promoter activity.CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the potent antiestrogenic properties of PA, indicate that its effects are mediated by inhibiting ER-ERE interactions, and suggest that downregulation of c-myc is an early event leading to increased p21 expression and cell growth inhibition."

In this study, we examined the effect of tea polyphenols on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury, and explored its mechanisms.METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats received tea polyphenols (100 mg.kg-1.d-1) or vehicle (water) intragastrically by gavage for 14 days, followed by LPS (5 mg/kg) or saline injection intraperitoneally. Liver injury was assessed by biochemical assay and pathological analysis. Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were determined. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein and TNF-alpha, iNOS and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA expressions in the liver were detected by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively.RESULTS: Administration of LPS resulted in liver injury in rats, evidenced by elevated activities of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hepatocellular necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration in the liver. These responses were associated with increased serum TNF-alpha levels, induced iNOS protein, expressions of TNF-alpha, iNOS mRNA in the liver and elevated lipid peroxidation at 90 minutes or 6 hours after LPS injection. Pretreatment with tea polyphenols attenuated LPS-induced liver injury, and blunted the rises of serum TNF-alpha levels and lipid peroxidation and the induction of expressions of TNF-alpha, iNOS in the liver.CONCLUSION: Tea polyphenols prevent LPS-induced liver injury, and the mechanisms may involve the reduction of serum TNF-alpha levels and lipid peroxidation and the suppression of TNF-alpha, iNOS expressions in the liver."

All model rats were given 200 mL/L CCl(4) (2 mL/Kg, po) twice a week for 8 wk. Four weeks after CCl(4) treatment, thirty model rats were further divided randomly into 3 subgroups: CCl(4) and two FMAC subgroups. Rats in CCl(4) and 2 FMAC subgroups were treated with FMAC 0, 0.5 and 1.0 g/kg, daily via gastrogavage beginning at the fifth week and the end of the eighth week. Spleen weight, blood synthetic markers (albumin and prothrombin time) and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydroxyproline (HP) concentrations were determined. Expression of collagen I, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) mRNA were detected by RT-PCR. Histochemical staining of Masson's trichrome was performed.RESULTS: CCl(4) caused liver fibrosis, featuring increased prothrombin time, hepatic MDA and HP contents, and spleen weight and decreased plasma albumin level. Compared with CCl(4) subgroup, FMAC subgroup (1 g/kg) significantly decreased the prothrombin time (36.7+/-7.2 and 25.1+/-10.2 in CCl(4) and FMAC groups, respectively, P&lt;0.05) and increased plasma albumin concentration (22.7+/-1.0 and 30.7+/-2.5 in CCl(4) and FMAC groups, respectively, P&lt;0.05).

The amounts of hepatic MDA and HP in CCl(4)+FAMC (1 g/kg) subgroup were also lower than those in CCl(4) subgroup (MDA: 3.9+/-0.1 and 2.4+/-0.6 in CCl(4) and CCl(4)+FMAC groups, respectively, P&lt;0.01; HP: 1730.7+/-258.0 and 1311.5+/-238.8 in CCl(4) and CCl(4)+FMAC groups, respectively, P&lt;0.01). Histologic examinations showed that CCl(4)+FMAC subgroups had thinner or less fibrotic septa than CCl(4) group. RT-PCR analysis indicated that FMAC (1 g/kg) reduced mRNA levels of collagen I, TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 (collagen I: 5.63+/-2.08 and 1.78+/-0.48 in CCl(4) and CCl(4)+FMAC groups, respectively, P&lt;0.01; TIMP-1: 1.70+/-0.82 and 0.34+/-0.02 in CCl(4) and CCl(4)+FMAC groups, respectively, P&lt;0.01; TGF-beta1:38.03+/-11.9 and 4.26+/-2.17 in CCl(4) and CCl(4)+FMAC groups, respectively, P&lt;0.01) in the CCl(4)-treated liver.CONCLUSION: It demonstrates that FMAC can retard the progression of liver fibrosis induced by CCl(4) in rats."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the sequence variation of poly Q encoding region in breast cancer cell lines at single molecule level, and to determine if the sequence variation is related to AIB1 gene amplification.METHODS: The polymorphic poly Q encoding region of AIB1 gene was investigated at the single molecule level by PCR cloning/sequencing. The amplification of AIB1 gene in various breast cancer cell lines were studied by real-time quantitative PCR.RESULTS: Significant amplifications (5-23 folds) of AIB1 gene were found in 2 out of 9 (22%) ER positive cell lines (in BT-474 and MCF-7 but not in BT-20, ZR-75-1, T47D, BT483, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-330). The AIB1 gene was not amplified in any of the ER negative cell lines. Different passages of MCF-7 cell lines and their derivatives maintained the feature of AIB1 amplification. When the cells were selected for hormone independence (LCC1) and resistance to 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OH TAM) (LCC2 and R27), ICI 182,780 (LCC9) or 4-OH TAM, KEO and LY 117018 (LY-2), AIB1 copy number decreased but still remained highly amplified. Sequencing analysis of poly Q encoding region of AIB1 gene did not reveal specific patterns that could be correlated with AIB1 gene amplification. However, about 72% of the breast cancer cell lines had at least one under represented (&lt;20%) extra poly Q encoding sequence patterns that were derived from the original allele, presumably due to somatic instability. Although all MCF-7 cells and their variants had the same predominant poly Q encoding sequence pattern of (CAG)3CAA(CAG)9(CAACAG)3(CAACAGCAG)2CAA of the original cell line, a number of altered poly Q encoding sequences were found in the derivatives of MCF-7 cell lines.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that poly Q encoding region of AIB1 gene is somatic unstable in breast cancer cell lines. The instability and the sequence characteristics, however, do not appear to be associated with the level of the gene amplification."

HeLa cells stably transfected with restin results in G1 cell cycle arrest. How this gene is regulated by atRA in the cell differentiation process is still unclear. In this study, we observed that up-regulation of restin was present during the atRA-induced HL60 cell differentiation process, suggesting the functional relevance between RESTIN and atRA-induced cellular effects. In order to further define the transcriptional regulation of restin by atRA, we analyzed the promoter region of restin. About 2.1kb 5' flanking sequence of this gene was cloned into vector pGL3 and its core promoter region was identified through systemic deletions. Interestingly, restin promoter containing several potential consensus-binding sites of STAT-1alpha was activated by atRA in ER(+) MCF-7 cells but not in ER(-) MDA-MB-231 cells, over-expression of STAT-1alpha in latter rescued the activation effect of restin promoter in response to atRA and IFNgamma. Our evidence supported that STAT-1alpha plays an important role in the atRA-induced transcriptional up-regulation of restin, which was associated with the atRA-induced HL60 cell differentiation and potentially mediated the downstream effects of atRA signal pathway via STAT-1alpha in some cancer cells."

An impressive number of synthetic Grb2-SH2 domain inhibitors have been identified; however, clinical agents operating by this mechanism are lacking, due in part to the unique requirement of anionic phosphate-mimicking functionality for high SH2 domain-binding affinity or the extended peptide nature of most inhibitors. In the current study, a new binding motif was successfully developed by the incorporation of 3'-substituted tyrosine derivatives into a simplified nonphosphorylated cyclic pentapeptide scaffold (4), which resulted in high affinity Grb2-SH2 inhibitors without any phosphotyrosine or phosphotyrosine mimetics. The new L-amino acid analogues bearing an additional nitro, amino, hydroxy, methoxy or carboxy group at the 3'-position of the phenol ring of tyrosine were prepared in an orthogonally protected form suitable for solid-phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc protocols. The incorporation of these residues into cyclic peptides composed of a five-amino acid sequence motif, Xx(1)-Leu-(3'-substituted-Tyr)-Ac6c-Asn, provided a brand new class of nonphosphorylated Grb2 SH2 domain inhibitors with reduced size, charge and peptidic character. The highest binding affinity was exhibited by the 3'-aminotyrosine (3'-NH2-Tyr)-containing (R)-sulfoxide-cyclized pentapeptide (10b) with an IC50 = 58 nM, the first example with low-nanomolar affinity for a five-amino acid long sequence binding to Grb2-SH2 domain free of any phosphotyrosine or phosphotyrosine mimics. However, the incorporation of 3'-NO2-Tyr, 3'-OH-Tyr or 3'-OCH3-Tyr surrogates in the pentapeptide scaffold is detrimental to Grb2-SH2 binding. These observations were rationalized using molecular modeling. More significantly, the best Grb2-SH2 inhibitor 10b showed excellent activity in inhibiting the growth of erbB2-dependent MDA-MB-453 tumor cell lines with an IC50 value of 19 nM. This study is the first attempt to identify novel nonphosphorylated high affinity Grb2 SH2 inhibitors by the utilization of 3'-substituted tyrosine derivatives, providing a promising new strategy and template for the development of non-pTyr-containing Grb2-SH2 domain antagonists with potent cellular activity, which potentially may find value in chemical therapeutics for erbB2-related cancers."

In eukaryotic HASs, the position of the Glu is very similar and the Lys is replaced by a conserved polar Gln. To assess whether Lys48 and Glu327 interact or influence seHAS activity, we investigated the effects of changing Lys48 to Arg or Glu and Glu327 to Lys, Asp, or Gln. Mutants, including a double switch variant with Lys48 and Glu327 exchanged, were expressed and assayed in Escherichia coli membranes. SeHASE327Q and seHASE327K were expressed at low levels, whereas seHASE327D and the Lys48 mutants were expressed well. The specific enzyme activities (relative to wild type) were 17 and 7% for the K48R and K48E mutants and 26 and 38% for the E327Q and E327D mutants, respectively. In contrast, seHAS(E327K) showed only 0.16% of wild-type activity but was rescued over 46-fold by changing Lys48 to Glu. Expression of the seHASE327K,K48E protein was also rescued to near wild-type levels. Based on size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle laser light scattering analysis, all the variants synthesized hyaluronan (HA) of smaller weight-average molar mass than wild-type enzyme (3.6 MDa); the smallest HA (approximately 0.6 MDa) was made by seHASE327K,K48E and seHASK48E. The results indicate that Glu327 within MD4 is a critical residue for the stability of seHAS, that it may interact with Lys48 within MD2, and that these residues are involved in the ability of HAS to synthesize very large HA."

In vitro biological activity assay demonstrated that this novel compound has wide-range, strong antitumor activity. This study is aimed to determine the effects of boehmeriasin A on breast cancer cell (MDA-MB-231 cell line). Proliferation assay and fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) showed that cell growth inhibition and G1 phase arrest of cell cycle were caused by boehmeriasin A. The concentrations resulting in total and 50% growth inhibition are 0.007 and 0.0035 microg/mL, respectively. Exposed in 0.007 microg/mL boehmeriasin A for 12 h, the G1 phase cell percent increased from 44.8% pre-drug treatment to 66.3%. Consistent with G1 arrest and cell growth inhibition, cyclin E2 and cyclin D1 messenger RNA expression in the cell was down-regulated with drug treatment.

Blank PLA-PEG nanoparticles have been successfully prepared and MTT assay suggested that the nanoparticles with HepG2 cell co-culture model did not cause significant changes in membrane integrity in controlled concentration range (0.001-0.1 mg/ml). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that large dose of PLA-PEG nanoparticles injection (42.04 mg/kg, i.v.) did not induce hepatic cell apoptosis. From biochemical assay experiments, although the levels of SOD decreased and those of MDA, NOS increased after treatment with large dose of PLA-PEG nanoparticles injection (42.04 mg/kg, i.v.), they were all not significant (p&gt;0.05). Then Kunming mice were treated with large dose of PLA-PEG nanoparticles (42.04 mg/kg, i.v.) and after 4 days total RNA was isolated to elucidate patterns of gene expression using a mouse cDNA-microarray (SuperArray). Treatment with nanoparticles resulted in over-expression of a lot of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, especially two ABC transporters (ABCA8 and ABCC5/MRP5), and down-regulation of GSTP1, in comparison with the control. ABCA8 could extrude low molecular weight polymers after PLA-PEG nanoparticles hydrolysis outside the cells. We also discovered that ABCC5 expressed multidrug resistance protein 5 (MRP5) to pump out conjugate (GS-X) of PLA-PEG nanoparticles with GSH. The results were confirmed by RT-PCR. Results of in vitro accumulation and efflux experiments indicated that about 51-52% (51.5% and 52.0%) intracellular PLA-PEG nanoparticles was expulsed after mouse primary hepatocytes reached a saturation uptake of nanoparticles during the concentration range of 750-1000 microg/ml.

We report the initial characterization of BRCC3, a novel gene discovered previously by mRNA expression profiling in MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells treated with Raf antisense oligonucleotide. BRCC3 is localized at human chromosome 5q12.1. BRCC3 open reading frame consists of 529 amino acids, coding for an approximate 60-kDa predominantly membrane-associated protein. Expression levels of BRCC3 mRNA and protein are high during G2/M phase of the cell cycle in breast cancer cells. Treatment of MDA-MB 231 cells with Raf-1 siRNA resulted in decreased expression of Raf-1, BRCC3 and p-ERK, but not B-Raf. Transient or stable expression of the epitope-tagged BRCC3 cDNA was associated with increased p-ERK in three different cell lines. Consistently, BRCC3 siRNA treatment of MDA-MB 231 cells caused decreased expression of BRCC3 and p-ERK. Furthermore, exogenous BRCC3 expression was associated with a delay in etoposide-induced cell death and an increase in cell proliferation. These findings demonstrate that BRCC3 is a novel effector of Raf-1, and implicate a role of BRCC3 in modulation of p-ERK, cell survival and proliferation."

Expression of p21 was increased in MDA-MB-468 cells treated with EGF or CPT but not by gamma-irradiation. MCF-7 cells exhibited p21 upregulation following exposure to CPT and gamma-radiation but not EGF. EGF caused cell cycle arrest in G(1) phase for MDA-MB-468 cells. CPT caused G(1)-phase arrest in MDA-MB-468 cells and prolonged S phase in MCF-7 cells. gamma-Radiation caused an increase in cells in G(2)/M phase for MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7. MDA-MB-468 cells were growth-inhibited by EGF, CPT, and gamma-radiation. MCF-7 cells were growth-stimulated by EGF and inhibited by CPT and gamma-radiation. Combining EGF with tat-anti-p21 immunoconjugates (ICs) amplified the growth-inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-468 cells 1.2-fold to 2.3-fold, but had no effect on the growth stimulation of MCF-7 cells by EGF. Tat-anti-p21 ICs sensitized MCF-7 cells 1.4-fold to gamma-radiation but had no effect on the growth of gamma-irradiated MDA-MB-468 cells. Tat-anti-p21 ICs sensitized both MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells 1.7-fold to CPT. We conclude that tat-anti-p21 ICs are promising sensitizers for cytotoxic cancer therapies and that their sensitization is dependent on treatment-related p21 expression. This general approach could potentially be extended to other growth-regulatory molecules that are associated with tumor growth and progression."

Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is a whole genome amplification technique based on the properties of the phi29 DNA polymerase, which leads to a uniform representation of the genome with very low error rates. In this study we performed MDA on 28 macaque DNA samples extracted from blood or non-invasively collected semen from which we obtained mitochondrial control region sequences both before and after MDA. The length of the readable sequences was longer for the original samples than for the MDA products, but the number of unresolved positions was comparable both before and after MDA. We conclude that the MDA technique is useful for increasing the amount of DNA for sequencing mitochondrial regions in the case of non-invasively collected semen samples."

These effects were associated with decreased expression of cyclin D1. The present study focuses on the effects of sulindac sulfide and exisulind on hormone signaling components in breast cancer cells. We found that estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive T47D breast cancer cells were somewhat more sensitive to growth inhibition by sulindac sulfide or exisulind than ER-negative PR-negative MB-MDA-468 breast cancer cells. Further studies indicated that sulindac sulfide and exisulind caused marked down-regulation of expression of the ER and PR-A and PR-B in T47D cells. However, neither compound caused a major change in expression of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), RARbeta, or RARalpha in T47D cells. Sulindac sulfide and exisulind also caused a decrease in expression of the ER in estrogen-responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Both compounds also markedly inhibited estrogen-stimulated activation of an estrogen-responsive promoter in transient transfection reporter assays. Treatment of T47D cells with specific protein kinase G (PKG) activators did not cause a decrease in ER or PR expression. Therefore, although sulindac sulfide and exisulind can cause activation of PKG, the inhibitory effects of these two compounds on ER and PR expression does not seem to be mediated by PKG. Our findings suggest that the growth inhibition by sulindac sulfide and exisulind in ER-positive and PR-positive human breast cancer cells may be mediated, in part, by inhibition of ER and PR signaling. Thus, these and related compounds may provide a novel approach to the prevention and treatment of human breast cancers, especially those that are ER positive."

These drugs initiated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner as measured by phenotypic morphological changes, by binding of a fluorescent phophatidyl serine-specific dye (PSS-380) onto the outer leaflet of the cell membranes, and by activation of caspases, -3, -8, and -9. It was observed that in two hours very little apoptotic process had started but predominant biochemical changes occurred after 6 h. DNA degradation started after 24 hours of drug treatment. However, very little is known about the stability of the ';Replication Complexes'' during the apoptotic process. DNA helicases are motor proteins that catalyze the melting of genomic DNA during its replication, repair, and recombination processes. Previously, DNA helicase-III was characterized as a component of the replication complexes isolated from embryonic chicken brains as well as breast and colon carcinoma cells. Helicase activities were measured by a novel method (ROME assay), and DNA polymerase-alpha activities were determined by regular chain extension of the nicked ACT-DNA, by determining values obtained from +/- aphidicolin-treated incubation mixtures. In all three breast carcinoma cell lines, a common trend was observed: a decrease of activities of DNA polymerase-alpha and Helicase III. A sharp decrease of activities of the glycolipid sialyltransferases: SAT-2 (CMP-NeuAc; GD3 alpha2-8 sialyltransferase) and SAT-4 (CMP-NeuAc: GM1a alpha2-3 sialyltransferase) was observed in the apoptotic carcinoma cells treated with L-PPMP compared with cis-platin."

This study found that a water extract of Zanthoxyli Fructus possessed anti-tumor activity against a wide variety of cancer cells including those from prostate (LNCaP, DU145, PC-3), breast (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB231), lung (NCI-H460, -H520), as well as leukemia (HL-60, NB4, Jurkat) in vitro, as measured by the trypan blue exclusion test. Importantly, Zanthoxyli Fructus slowed the proliferation of LNCaP, DU145, and MDA-MB231 cells present as xenografts in BALB/c nude mice without adverse effects. Further studies explored the molecular mechanism by which Zanthoxyli Fructus inhibited the proliferation of androgen-dependent human prostate cancer LNCaP cells because Zanthoxyli Fructus possessed the strongest anti-tumor activity against these cells. Zanthoxyli Fructus blocked androgen receptor (AR) signaling in conjunction with down-regulation of nuclear levels of AR and induced apoptosis of these cells, as measured by the reporter assay, Western blot analysis, and TUNEL assay, respectively. As expected, Zanthoxyli Fructus also decreased the level of the AR-target molecule, prostate-specific antigen in these cells. Furthermore, Zanthoxyli Fructus inhibited AKT kinase and down-regulated levels of cyclin D1 protein, as measured by the AKT kinase assay with GSK-3alpha/beta as a substrate and Western blot analysis, respectively. Taken together, Zanthoxyli Fructus might be useful as an adjunctive therapeutic agent for the treatment of individuals with a variety of cancer types."

IL-10 is a potent immunomodulatory cytokine with implications for pathogenesis in various autoimmune diseases. Polymorphism of the IL-10 promoter region correlates with disease outcome. To understand the gene regulation of IL-19, we analyzed the IL-19 promoter region. A regulatory region (PE), 148bp upstream of exon 1 of IL-19 and linked to a luciferase reporter gene, supported luciferase activity 13 times greater than that supported by a negative promoterless control. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed specific binding sites for the transcription factors of the oligonucleotides PE1 (-148 to -98) derived from PE. We identified the sequence TGTGGT (-142 to -138) on PE1 as the binding site for the transcription factor AML1, and crucial for the promoter activity of IL-19 because substituting 1bp in the PE region (-139G--&gt;T) abolished IL-19 promoter activity."

Recently, a candidate peptide sequence towards the C-terminal of the AChE molecule has been identified, as the salient site remote from normal catalysis in neurons, and possibly other cells. The main aim of this study was to explore the possibility that 'AChE-peptide' might also affect human breast cancer cells. Uptake of the non-cytotoxic tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used as an index of endocytosis, a key component of the metastatic cascade, representing exocytosis/secretory membrane activity and/or plasma membrane protein turnover. AChE-peptide had no affect on the weakly metastatic MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. By contrast, application of AChE-peptide to the strongly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of HRP uptake; treatment with a scrambled variant of the peptide of comparable amino acid length was ineffective. The action of AChE-peptide was suppressed by lowering the extracellular Ca2+ concentration and co-applying a selective antagonist of alpha7, but not alpha4/beta2, nicotinic receptor. The results suggest that AChE-peptide has a novel, selective bioactivity on breast cancer cells and can potentiate metastatic cell behaviour."

Mutations of the oncosuppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are associated with a hereditary risk of breast cancer, and dysregulation of their expression has been observed in sporadic cases. Soya isoflavones have been shown to inhibit breast cancer in studies in vitro, but associations between the consumption of isoflavone-containing foods and breast cancer risk have varied in epidemiological studies. Soya is a unique source of the phytoestrogens daidzein (4',7-dihydroxyisoflavone) and genistein (4',5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), two molecules that are able to inhibit the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of genistein (5 microg/ml) and daidzein (20 microg/ml) on transcription in three human breast cell lines (one dystrophic, MCF10a, and two malignant, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) after 72 h treatment.

Previously, we and others have demonstrated that antisense raf oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of Raf-1 expression leads to tumor growth arrest, radiosensitization and chemosensitization in vivo. Raf-1 inhibition is also associated with apoptotic cell death. In this study, we inhibited Raf-1 using an antisense raf oligonucleotide (AS-raf-ODN) to identify downstream targets of Raf-1 using microarray gene expression analysis. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with 250 nM AS-raf-ODN led to significant inhibition of Raf-1 protein (75.2 +/- 9.6%) and c-raf-1 mRNA levels (86.2 +/- 3.3%) as compared to untreated control cells. The lipofectin control or mismatch oligonucleotide had no effect on Raf-1 expression. To determine the changes in gene expression profiles that were due to inhibition of Raf-1, we simultaneously compared the gene expression patterns in AS-raf-ODN treated cells with untreated control cells and cells treated with lipofectin alone or MM-ODN. A total of 17 genes (4 upregulated and 13 down-regulated) including c-raf-1 were identified that were altered after AS-raf-ODN treatment. Functional clustering analysis revealed genes involved in apoptosis (Bcl-XL), cell adhesion (paxillin, plectin, Rho GDIalpha, CCL5), metabolism (GM2A, SLC16A3, PYGB), signal transduction (protein kinase C nu), and transcriptional regulation (HMGA1), and membrane-associated genes (GNAS, SLC16A3).

In this research, a multicopy expression plasmid pA-O815/3xIGFBP-6 containing 3 copies of human IGFBP-6 expression cassette was constructed and transformed into P. pastoris GS115. The encoding sequence of alpha-factor leading peptide fused in-frame at the 5' end of human IGFBP-6 open reading frame and led expressed IGFBP-6 into the secretory pathway. After transformed cells were induced with methanol, medium supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The two major protein bands of approximately 30 and approximately 18kDa were detected. The protein of approximately 30kDa was confirmed to be the glycosylated recombinant human IGFBP-6 (rhIGFBP-6), which was partially proteolyzed by protease Kex2 to produce a approximately 18kDa fragment. Approximately 95% homogeneity of the soluble form of 30kDa rhIGFBP-6 were achieved by two-step purification procedure using ion-exchange chromatography and then hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. The rhIGFBP-6 could be distributed to all of the cell body when cultured MDA-MB-231 cell with rhIGFBP-6 and the activities of rhIGFBP-6 were assayed by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, which revealed that rhIGFBP-6 inhibited IGF-II-stimulated cell proliferation.

Multiple displacement amplification (MDA), a phi29 DNA polymerase based whole genome amplification technique, has the potential to help resolve this problem by yielding large amounts of high molecular weight DNA from tiny starting quantities.METHODS: Firstly, a comparison was made of restriction endonuclease fragment patterns of DNA from seven different HPV types and corresponding MDA products. Secondly, E6/E7 and LCR sequencing data from HPV16 recombinant plasmid and MDA copy DNA were correlated. Thirdly, DNA and MDA products from cervical cell lines (CaSki, HeLa, and SiHa that contain integrated HPV) and an invasive cervical carcinoma were analysed by Southern blot hybridisation. Fourthly, MDA product from CaSki cell DNA mixed with HPV18-plasmid DNA was tested for the demonstration of both episomal and integrated HPV. Finally, MDA products from HPV16 positive abnormal cervical cytological samples were assayed for integration by Southern blot hybridisation.RESULTS: DNA templates and MDA products yielded analogous data. Episomal and integrated HPV DNA were successfully detected by Southern blot assay of the cell line/HPV-plasmid model, and in MDA products of clinical samples.CONCLUSIONS: These data show that MDA has considerable potential to assist in the investigation of HPV physical status; abundant (&gt;40 microg) DNA can be generated with high fidelity from minuscule (50 ng) starting quantities, and both episomal and integrated HPV DNA are distinguishable in MDA products from solid tumours and cytological materials."

Oestrogen receptors interact via a specific DNA-binding domain, the oestrogen responsive element (ERE), in the promoter region of sensitive genes. This binding leads to an initiation of gene expression and hormonal effects.OBJECTIVE: To determine the transcriptional activity of the oestrogen receptor, we developed a molecular imaging system using sodium iodide symporter (NIS) as a reporter gene.METHODS: The NIS reporter gene was placed under the control of an artificial ERE derived from pERE-TA-SEAP and named as pERE-NIS. pERE-NIS was transferred to MCF-7, human breast cancer cells, which highly expressed oestrogen receptor-alpha with lipofectamine. Stably expressing cells were generated by selection with G418 for 14 days. After treatment of 17beta-oestradiol and tamoxifen with serial doses, the (125)I uptake was measured for the determination of NIS expression. The inhibition of NIS activity was performed with 50 micromol x l(-1) potassium perchlorate.RESULTS: The MCF7/pERE-NIS treated with 17beta-oestradiol accumulated (125)I up to 70-80% higher than did non-treated cells. NIS expression was increased according to increasing doses of 17beta-oestradiol. MCF7/pERE-NIS treated with tamoxifen also accumulated (125)I up to 50% higher than did non-treated cells. Potassium perchlorate completely inhibited (125)I uptake. When MDA-MB231 cells, the oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells, were transfected with pERE-NIS, (125)I uptake of MDA-MB-231/pERE-NIS did not increase.CONCLUSION: This pERE-NIS reporter system is sufficiently sensitive for monitoring transcriptional activity of the oestrogen receptor. Therefore, cis-enhancer reporter systems with ERE will be applicable to the development of a novel selective oestrogen receptor modulator with low toxicity and high efficacy."

An increase in the molecular weight of the separation medium favors the separation of larger DNA fragments. In order to obtain ultrahigh-molecular-weight (UHMW) LPA, a &quot;frozen&quot; method was developed to synthesize the LPA homopolymer. This approach has three major advantages when compared with other existing routes of LPA synthesis: (i) long LPA chains could be obtained easily, with their average molecular weight (MW) being in the high 10 MDa range; (ii) the desired MW could be adjusted over a broad range by controlling the temperature and the concentration of initiators during synthesis; (iii) the product solution contains only a tiny amount of impurity besides the solvent and LPA. Both static and dynamic laser light scattering measurements were carried out to characterize the synthesized LPA in the buffer solution. The DNA sequencing matrix prepared from LPA using this method was studied and the results were compared with the newly developed commercial product POP7 from Applied Biosystems. It should be noted that this approach can be applied to synthesize other water-soluble polymers, resulting in UHMW products because the chain transfer constant is smaller at lower temperatures."

We have demonstrated that rainbow trout (rt) Ea4-peptide exerted biological activities in several established tumor cell lines [Chen et al., 2002; Kuo and Chen, 2002]. Here we report the activity of rtEa4-peptide in promoting attachment of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). While rtEa2-, rtEa3-, and rtEa4-peptides enhanced the attachment of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose dependent manner, rtEa4-peptide possessed the highest activity. Antibodies specific to alpha2 and beta1 integrins significantly inhibited the attachment of cells to rtEa4-peptide coated-plates by 40%. In addition, rtEa4-peptide induced the expression of fibronectin 1 and laminin receptor genes in MDA-MB-231 cells. Blocking new protein synthesis by cycloheximide significantly reduced the attachment of MDA-MB-231 cells to rtEa4-peptide coated wells by 50%. These results suggest that rtEa4-peptide may promote cell attachment by interacting with alpha2/beta1 integrin receptors at the cell surface and by inducing the expression of fibronectin 1 and laminin receptor genes. Expression of fibronectin 1 gene induced by rtEa4-peptide in MDA-MB-231 cells was abolished by inhibitors of PI3K, PKC, Mek1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK signaling transduction molecules.

In this study, we cloned several monoclonal IgG autoantibody Fab fragments specific for oxLDL from peripheral blood lymphocytes of atherosclerosis patients, using phage display technology. The sequences of their variable regions were determined at the cDNA level. The closest germline counterparts for the heavy chains belonged to the V(H)3 or V(H)1 family. The sequences and lengths of complementarity-determining regions (CDR)3-V(H) were diverse, and frequent mutations of positively charged amino acids (particularly arginine) over entire V(H) and V(L) sequences were observed. It is proposed that anti-oxLDL autoantibody formation is driven by antigens. Among the Fabs, P2-8 and P3-175 bound to both MDA-LDL and Cu-oxLDL, and inhibited the uptake of oxLDL by macrophages, suggesting the epitope(s) recognized by the Fabs is a part of ligands on oxLDL that is involved in uptake by macrophage scavenger receptor.

Many point mutations in the human ERalpha gene have been reported to be associated with breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and psychiatric diseases. However, functional analyses for most mutants with amino acid changes are still lacking. In the present study, to investigate the effects of point mutations on the function, gel-shift assays and luciferase assays were performed for eight kinds of mutated ERalpha proteins, including a single nucleotide change of C207G (N69K), G478T (G160C), T887C (L296P), A908G (K303R), C926T (S309F), A1058T (E353V), A1186G (M396V), and G1231deletion (411fsX7). The mutated ERalpha expression plasmids were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. With gel-shift assays using in vitro translated ERalpha proteins, binding to the consensus estrogen response element (ERE) was observed for the mutated ERalpha proteins except ERalpha (G160C) and ERalpha (411fsX7), the binding of which was comparable with that of the wild type. Western blot analyses showed that ERalpha (G160C) could not be efficiently translated with the in vitro transcription/translation system and that ERalpha (411fsX7) produced a truncated protein. To investigate the transactivation potency, wild-type or mutated ERalpha expression plasmids were co-transfected with pGL3-3EREc38 reporter plasmid into human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-435 cells. The concentration-response curves (10pM-100nM E2) of the mutant ERalpha proteins except ERalpha (E353V) and ERalpha (411fsX7) were similar to that of wild-type ERalpha. However, at a low level of E2 (100pM), the mutants ERalpha (N69K), ERalpha (L296P), ERalpha (S309F), and ERalpha (M396V) showed a significant decrease of transactivation compared with that of the wild-type ERalpha.

In conclusion, we found that some of the naturally occurring human ERalpha mutants with amino acid changes may have an altered responsiveness to estrogen and antiestrogens."

These regions are difficult to not only amplify by PCR for template preparations, but also determine the DNA sequences using standard Cycle sequencing (CS) method. Transcriptional sequencing (TS) is a unique DNA sequencing method using RNA polymerase, and is based on the principles of the chain-termination method, which is a powerful method to analyze GC-rich sequences. In this study, we examined the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) to overcome low efficiency of PCR amplification in GC-rich regions and subjected to TS reaction. Combination of MDA and TS (MDA-TS) was extremely successful with GC content ranging from 65% to 85%, which are difficult to analyze with PCR and CS. We also report plasmid vector, pTS1, which has the stronger T7 and T3 promoters than those of conventional vectors, and the sequence that decreases transcriptional efficiency was removed from its multiple cloning sites. pTS 1 resulted in the improved sequencing accuracy and reduced reaction time up to 5 min. These results showed that MDA-TS is a rapid and accurate method for the analysis of GC-rich templates."

Using array-based CGH, highly altered genomic copy number changes were found more often in MCF-7 (159 genes) than in MDA-MB-231 (109 genes) and MDA-MB-435 (49 genes), suggesting more genomic changes in MCF-7 cells. On comparing MCF-7 with MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines, we identified 8 genes with different copy numbers, including dystroglycan, which is located in the p12-21.2 area of chromosome 3.

CMT 300 has shown promise in phase I clinical trials in patients with Kaposi's Sarcoma, which is characterized by over-production of the pro-angiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this study, we report a novel activity of CMT 308, a 9-amino derivative of CMT 300, on reducing levels of VEGF secreted by breast cancer cell lines. CMT 308, at sub-cytotoxic concentrations, reduced basal levels of secreted VEGF in the poorly invasive MCF-7 cell line as well as the more aggressively invasive MDA-MB-435s cell line in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, CMT 308 also reduced transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-induced VEGF secretion in both cell lines. While VEGF could be detected in the conditioned media of untreated MCF-7 cells within 4h, levels of secreted VEGF in CMT 308-treated cells remained undetectable up to 8h. CMT 308 diminished secretion of VEGF from MCF-7 cells up to 8h regardless of previous time in culture. CMT 308 did not reduce the levels of basal VEGF mRNA in either cell line, but did reduce pools of total intracellular VEGF protein. Although TGFbeta stimulated an increase in VEGF levels in the conditioned media as well as in the cytoplasm, TGFbeta treatment did not increase VEGF mRNA levels. Thus, augmented expression of VEGF protein by breast cancer cell lines in the presence of TGFbeta appears to involve upregulation at a step beyond transcription. Moreover, the data strongly indicate that in these breast cancer cell lines, CMT 308 reduces VEGF secretion by targeting some post-transcriptional event. The capacity of CMT 308 to diminish levels of a major pro-angiogenic signal makes the nonantimicrobial tetracycline derivative an attractive candidate for anti-angiogenic therapy in management of breast cancer."

Accumulating evidence shows important roles of V-ATPase in tumor metastasis and antigen presentation of dendritic cells (DC). A novel V-ATPase associated protein, designated as DVA9.2 (dendritic cell-derived V-ATPase associated protein of 9.2 kDa), has been identified from a human DC cDNA library by large-scale random sequencing. Full length cDNA of DVA9.2 encodes an 81-residue protein that shares 70-80% homology with human V-ATPase subunit M9.2. Distant relationship is also found with Vma21p, a yeast protein required for V-ATPase assembly. DVA9.2 contains a conserved domain, ATP synthase subunit H (pafm05493), and two membrane-spanning helices. DVA9.2 mRNA is detectable in several human tumor cell lines as well as some human normal cells and tissues. Moreover, the inducible expression of DVA9.2 mRNA in DC during maturation is observed. DVA9.2 displays integration with membrane and main localization in lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi-associated organelles, only less at the plasma membrane. In addition, DVA9.2 is co-localized with V(0)-sector subunit a. Silencing of DVA9.2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) does not affect the V-ATPase activity in cell membrane fractions or attenuate the migration and invasion in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells.

The relationship between certain protein expressions (MLH1, ERCC1, PARP, RAD51, XRCC4) and CQ increased radiosensitivity in radioresistant MDA-MB 231 cells was examined by Western blot method. The genes which are associated with CQ increased radiosensitivity were studied by microarray analysis.RESULTS: CQ increased deaths of parental MDA-MB 231 cells, radiosensitive MDA-MB 231 cells and radioresistant MDA-MB 231 cells were compared with those of the CQ-untreated control cells after irradiation, and the Radiation Potentiation Factor were 1.21-1.23. The expression of ERCC1 in the presence and absence of CQ in the radioresistant cells was significantly higher than that of sham-irradiated control cells by Western blot method. After irradiation, RAD51 level was increased up to 3-hour radiation and then gradually reduced. The expression of MLH1 was lower in 24 hours than that of other time points after irradiation. There were no differences on the expressions of MLH1, ERCC1, RAD51 in cells with and without CQ, which suggested that these genes weren't correlated with CQ increased radiosensitivity. XRCC4 and PARP levels were not changed by irradiation. Microarray analysis showed that TNP3, FRIH, CA21, ADTA genes might be related to CQ increased radiosensitivity in radioresistant cells.CONCLUSION: CQ can increase radiosensitivity in radioresistant MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells.

Recombinant retrovirus ReCED1-4 and ReEmpty were produced by 293 package cells and transfected into MDA-MB435 human breast cancer cells. The expression of CED1-4 in transfectants and their supernatant was analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. MDA-MB435 cell proliferation assays were performed in vitro and in vivo. CED-14-induced apoptosis was demonstrated using Annexin V binding, TUNEL and caspase 3 assays. The expression of integrin beta1 and c-fos mRNA was detected by RT-PCR.RESULTS: The constructed soluble CED1-4 encoded 484 amino acids and a secreting signal peptide (27 amino acids). CED1-4 was expressed by MDA-MB435/CED1-4 cells, and detected in the supernatant of CED1-4 tranfectants. CED1-4 transfection significantly inhibited the growth of MDA-MB435 cells in vitro and in vivo.

Siegesbeckia glabrescens (SG) has been used in traditional oriental medicine to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina pectoris. This study examined whether or not SG could induce apoptosis in human breast carcinoma cells. The treatment of estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive (MCF-7) and ER-negative (MDA-MB-231) cells with a variety of SG concentrations (0-1.0 mg/ml) resulted in a dose-dependent sequence of events that were marked by apoptosis. Furthermore, this apoptosis was accompanied by the cleavage of procaspase-9 and -3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in the MCF-7 cells, and procaspase-8 and -3 and PARP in the MDA-MB-231 cells. Although, the SG-induced apoptosis was associated with a decrease in the level of Bcl-2 mRNA expression and an increase in the level of Bax mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells, there was no detectable change in the MDA-MB-231 cells. This suggests that SG might exert anti-proliferative action in human breast carcinoma cells via two different apoptotic pathways, namely an intrinsic signal in MCF-7 cells and an extrinsic signal in MDA-MB-231 cells. Therefore, regardless of the ER status, SG might be a promising pro-apoptotic agent for treating breast cancer."

Treatment of A549 lung cancer cells with BAY 43-9006 diminished Mcl-1 levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner without affecting other Bcl-2 family members. Similar BAY 43-9006-induced Mcl-1 downregulation was observed in ACHN (renal cell), HT-29 (colon), MDA-MB-231 (breast), KMCH (cholangiocarcinoma), Jurkat (acute T-cell leukemia), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) and MEC-2 (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) cells. Mcl-1 mRNA levels did not change in BAY 43-9006-treated cells. Instead, BAY 43-9006 enhanced proteasome-mediated Mcl-1 degradation. This Mcl-1 downregulation was followed by mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation as well as enhanced sensitivity to other proapoptotic agents. The caspase inhibitor Boc-D-fmk inhibited BAY 43-9006-induced caspase activation but not cytochrome c release. In contrast, Mcl-1 overexpression inhibited cytochrome c release and other features of BAY 43-9006-induced apoptosis.

The genes for both proteins are characteristic markers of breast and prostate cancer cells that metastasize to bone. Here we experimentally addressed the compelling question of whether Runx2 and MMP are functionally linked. By cDNA expression array analysis, we identified MMP9 as a novel downstream target of Runx2. Like that of MMP13, MMP9 expression is nearly depleted in Runx2 mutant mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the recruitment of Runx2 to the MMP9 promoter. We show by mutational analysis that the Runx2 site mediates transactivation of the MMP9 promoter in osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) and nonosseous (HeLa) cells. The overexpression of Runx2 by adenovirus delivery in nonmetastatic (MCF-7) and metastatic breast (MDA-MB-231) and prostate (PC3) cancer cell lines significantly increases the endogenous levels of MMP9. The knockdown of Runx2 by RNA interference decreases MMP9 expression, as well as that of other Runx2 target genes, including the genes for MMP13 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Importantly, we have demonstrated using a cell invasion assay that Runx2-regulated MMP9 levels are functionally related to the invasion properties of cancer cells. These results are consistent with Runx2 control of multiple genes that contribute to the metastatic properties of cancer cells and their activity in the bone microenvironment."

To facilitate this, we have previously characterized an experimental system in which the role of candidate metastasis-related genes can be screened and tested. Monoclonal cell lines M4A4 and NM2C5 are spontaneously occurring sublines of the MDA-MB-435 cell breast tumor cell line that exhibit phenotypic differences in growth, invasion, and metastatic efficiency in athymic mice. In this study, transcriptional profiles of these cell lines were created using oligonucleotide microarrays representing over 12,000 genes. Intensity modeling and hierarchical clustering analysis identified a 171-gene expression signature that correlated with metastatic phenotype and highlighted several GTPase signaling components. Restoration of one of these GTPases, deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC-1), in metastatic M4A4 cells to levels observed in the nonmetastatic NM2C5 cell line resulted in the inhibition of migration and invasion in vitro and a significant reduction in the ability of these cells to form pulmonary metastases in athymic mice. These studies show the utility of expression profiling, in an appropriate experimental system, to identify genetic determinants of metastatic sufficiency. The finding that DLC-1 can act as a metastasis-suppressor gene supports an influential role for GTPase signaling in tumor progression."

We have previously shown that aberrant expression of the Runx2 DNA binding domain in metastatic breast cancer cells can prevent production of osteolytic lesions in bone. Here, we show that proper Runx2 subnuclear targeting is required for osteolysis. We have identified point mutations of the Runx2 nuclear matrix-targeting signal sequence that impair its targeting to nuclear matrix sites. These mutations block the invasive and osteolytic properties of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vivo. Cell lines expressing this Runx2 mutant protein inhibit the osteogenic properties of bone marrow stromal cells in coculture assays. The mutant breast cancer cells also exhibit reduced invasiveness in vitro and do not express genes involved in invasion and angiogenesis (VEGF and MMP13). Our findings suggest that fidelity of Runx2 intranuclear organization is necessary for expression of target genes that mediate the osteolytic activity of metastatic breast cancer cells."

Whereas many growth factors stimulate SphK1, much less is known of the regulation of SphK2. Here we report that epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated SphK2 in HEK 293 cells. This is the first example of an agonist-dependent regulation of SphK2. Chemotaxis of HEK 293 cells toward EGF was inhibited by N,N-dimethylsphingosine, a competitive inhibitor of both SphKs, implicating S1P generation in this process. Down-regulating expression of SphK1 in HEK 293 cells with a specific siRNA abrogated migration toward EGF, whereas decreasing SphK2 expression had no effect. EGF contributes to the invasiveness of human breast cancer cells, and EGF receptor expression is associated with poor prognosis. EGF also stimulated SphK2 in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells. Surprisingly, however, down-regulation of SphK2 in these cells completely eliminated migration toward EGF without affecting fibronectin-induced haptotaxis.

Inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) synergistically activate the methylated ER gene promoter in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to examine the chromatin status and repressor complex associated with silenced ER and changes in the key regulatory factors during reactivation by inhibitors of DNMT (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) and HDAC (trichostatin A). The silencing of ER due to CpG hypermethylation correlates with binding of specific methyl-binding proteins, DNMTs, and HDAC proteins. Inhibition of HDAC activity by trichostatin A results in the accumulation of hyperacetylated core histones. The activation of ER gene expression by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine also involves the release of the repressor complex involving various methyl-binding proteins, DNMTs, and HDAC1. HDAC and DNMT inhibitors modulate histone methylation at H3-K9 and H3-K4 to form a more open chromatin structure necessary for reactivation of silenced ER transcription. Together these results impart a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of chromatin remodeling during ER reactivation by DNMT and HDAC inhibitors.

The transcript profiles were first analysed by a modified protocol for representational difference analysis (RDA) of cDNAs between MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The majority of genes identified by RDA showed nearly complete concordance with microarray results, and also led to the identification of some differentially expressed genes such as lysyl oxidase, copper transporter ATP7A, EphB6, RUNX2 and a variant of RUNX2. The altered transcripts identified by microarray analysis were involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interaction, Rho signaling, calcium homeostasis and copper-binding/sensitive activities.

The proteomic profiles indicated altered abundance of fewer proteins as compared to transcript profiles. Antisense knockdown of selected transcripts led to inhibition of cell proliferation that was accompanied by altered proteomic profiles. The proteomic profiles of antisense transfectants suggest the involvement of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, Raf kinase inhibitor and 80 kDa protein kinase C substrate in mediating the inhibition of cell proliferation."

Cancer cell selective tropism was ensured by engineering the expression of the adenoviral E1A protein, necessary for viral replication, under the control of a minimal promoter region of progression elevated gene-3 (PEG-3), which functions selectively in diverse cancer cells with minimal activity in normal cells. In the E3 region of this CRCA, we introduced the mda-7/IL-24 gene, thereby mediating robust production of this cytokine as a function of adenovirus replication. Infection of this CRCA (designated Ad.PEG-E1A-mda-7) in normal mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells confirmed cancer cell selective adenoviral replication, mda-7/IL-24 expression, growth inhibition, and apoptosis induction. Injecting Ad.PEG-E1A-mda-7 into human breast cancer xenografts in athymic nude mice completely eradicated not only the primary tumor but also distant tumors (established on the opposite flank of the animal) thereby implementing a cure. This dual cancer-specific targeting strategy provides an effective approach for treating breast and other human neoplasms with the potential for eradicating both primary tumors and metastatic disease.

Conversely, silencing of RhoGDI expression by DNA vector-mediated RNA interference (small interfering RNA) sensitized MDA-MB-231 cells to drug-induced apoptosis. Resistance to apoptosis was restored by reintroduction of RhoGDI protein expression. The mechanism for the anti-apoptotic activity of RhoGDI may derive from its ability to inhibit caspase-mediated cleavage of Rac1 GTPase, which is required for maximal apoptosis to occur in response to cytotoxic drugs. Taken together, the data show that RhoGDI is an anti-apoptotic molecule that mediates cellular resistance to these chemotherapy agents."

Furthermore, exposure of mice to Delta9-THC led to significantly elevated 4T1 tumor growth and metastasis due to inhibition of the specific antitumor immune response in vivo. The suppression of the antitumor immune response was mediated primarily through CB2 as opposed to CB1. Furthermore, exposure to Delta9-THC led to increased production of IL-4 and IL-10, suggesting that Delta9-THC exposure may specifically suppress the cell-mediated Th1 response by enhancing Th2-associated cytokines. This possibility was further supported by microarray data demonstrating the up-regulation of a number of Th2-related genes and the down-regulation of a number of Th1-related genes following exposure to Delta9-THC. Finally, injection of anti-IL-4 and anti-IL-10 mAbs led to a partial reversal of the Delta9-THC-induced suppression of the immune response to 4T1. Such findings suggest that marijuana exposure either recreationally or medicinally may increase the susceptibility to and/or incidence of breast cancer as well as other cancers that do not express cannabinoid receptors and are resistant to Delta9-THC-induced apoptosis."

LIMK1 is reported to play an important role in cell motility, but the mechanism of induction of cell motility and the role of LIMK1 in tumor growth, angiogenesis and invasion are poorly understood. Here we show that expression of LIMK1 in MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells enhanced cell proliferation and cell invasiveness and promoted in vitro angiogenesis. Since tumor metastasis requires degradation of the extracellular matrix by the serine protease urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), we examined the role of LIMK1 in the regulation of uPA/uPAR system. LIMK1 overexpression in breast cancer cells upregulated the uPA system, increased uPA promoter activity, induced uPA and uPAR mRNA and protein expression and induced uPA secretion. In contrast, cells transfected with the catalytically inactive LIMK mutant D460N-LIMK1 did not exhibit these phenotypic changes. Blocking antibodies against uPA and uPAR suppressed LIMK1-induced cell invasiveness. In addition, LIMK1 overexpression increased tumor growth in female athymic nude mice, promoted tumor angiogenesis and induced metastasis to livers and lungs, possibly by increasing uPA expression in the tumors. Finally, LIMK1 and uPAR were coordinately overexpressed in human breast tumors. These results suggested an important role for LIMK1 signaling in breast cancer tumor growth, angiogenesis and invasion and a regulatory connection between LIMK1 and the uPA system."

A synthetic library was screened to identify inhibitors of tumor cell migration. From this, we discovered that CAC-1098 (aurintricarboxylic acid) and CBI-0997 (5-(2,4-dimethoxy-5-ethylphenyl)-4-(4-bromophenyl) isoxazole) inhibited migration of MDA-MB-231 cells with IC50 = 5 and 50 nM, respectively. We synthesized KRIBB3 (5-(5-ethyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl) isoxazole) by replacing the bromide group of CBI-0997 with a methoxyl group. Like CBI-0997, KRIBB3 has anti-migratory and anti-invasive activities in MDA-MB-231 cells. Because KRIBB3 has a better drug-like structure, we focused our effort on further understanding its anti-migratory mechanism. Biotinyl-KRIBB3 was synthesized as an affinity probe for identification of KRIBB3-binding proteins. Using affinity chromatography, we identified Hsp27 as a target protein of KRIBB3 in vitro. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of Hsp27 and tumor cell migration. In contrast, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with KRIBB3 blocked phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced phosphorylation of Hsp27 and tumor cell migration. Furthermore, overexpression of Hsp27 antagonized the inhibitory effect of KRIBB3 on tumor cell invasion, and knockdown of Hsp27 using small interfering RNA inhibited tumor cell migration. Overall, our results demonstrate that KRIBB3 inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion by blocking protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of Hsp27 through its direct binding to Hsp27."

In our current study, we show that expression of the alpha6beta4 integrin in MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells leads to increased expression of the autocrine motility factor autotaxin, as determined by Affymetrix gene chip, real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses. We further demonstrate that increased autotaxin secretion from integrin alpha6beta4 expressing cells acts to enhance chemotaxis through its ability to convert lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and accounts for 80% of the motogenic activity of the conditioned medium. We determine that integrin alpha6beta4-dependent overexpression of autotaxin in MDA-MB-435 cells is mediated by NFAT1, but not NFAT5, through the use of siRNAs that specifically target autotaxin, integrin beta4, NFAT1 and NFAT5. Finally, we show by electrophoretic mobility shift assays that two consensus NFAT binding sites found in the autotaxin promoter strongly and specifically bind NFAT1 from integrin alpha6beta4 expressing cells. In summary, we find that the alpha6beta4 integrin potentiates autotaxin expression through the upregulation and activation of NFAT1. These observations highlight for the first time a mechanism by which NFAT transcription factors can facilitate an invasive and motile phenotype downstream of integrin alpha6beta4 signaling."

However, there have been no unbiased studies to identify novel molecular targets of this compound. We therefore undertook a gene expression profiling study to identify novel targets of curcumin. A cDNA array comprised of 12,625 probes was used to compare total RNA extracted from curcumin-treated and untreated MDA-1986 cells for differential gene expression. We identified 202 up-regulated mRNAs and 505 transcripts decreased &gt; or =2-fold. The proapoptotic activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) was induced &gt;4-fold. Two negative regulators of growth control [antagonizer of myc transcriptional activity (Mad) and p27kip1] were induced 68- and 3-fold, respectively. Additionally, two dual-activity phosphatases (CL 100 and MKP-5), which inactivate the c-jun-NH2-kinases, showed augmented expression, coinciding with reduced expression of the upstream activators of c-jun-NH2-kinase (MEKK and MKK4). Of the repressed genes, the expression of Frizzled-1 (Wnt receptor) was most strongly attenuated (8-fold). Additionally, two genes implicated in growth control (K-sam, encoding the keratinocyte growth factor receptor, and HER3) as well as the E2F-5 transcription factor, which regulates genes controlling cell proliferation, also showed down-regulated expression. Considering its role in apoptosis, we determined the contribution of ATF3 to the antitumor effect of curcumin. Curcumin-treated MDA-1986 cells showed a rapid, dose-dependent increase in ATF3/mRNA protein. Moreover, expression of an exogenous ATF3 cDNA synergized with curcumin in inducing apoptosis. Thus, we have identified several putative, novel molecular targets of curcumin and showed that one, (ATF3) contributes to the proapoptotic effects of this compound."

BRCA2 is not expressed in the non-dividing cells, and expression is cell cycle stage-dependent and is elevated in the sporadic cancer cells. Mutational analysis of the upstream sequence of the human BRCA2 gene revealed an E2-box-containing silencer at the -701 to -921 position. The E2-box is essential for the cell-cycle stage-dependent activity of the silencer. We affinity-purified a 29-kDa silencer-binding protein (SBP) from the nuclear extracts of human breast cells BT-549 and MDA-MB-231. We explored whether the E2-box-binding repressor protein SLUG, which is of similar molecular size, is involved in the silencing process. Supershift assay with the purified SBP and anti-SLUG antibody revealed the identity of the SBP as SLUG. We found that silencer is inactive in the human breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 that do not express SLUG, further suggesting the involvement of SLUG in the BRCA2 gene silencing. Inducible expression of human SLUG in the dividing MDA-MB-468 cells reduced BRCA2 RNA levels with the activation of the silencer. Furthermore, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of SLUG mRNA in the BT-549 cells caused inhibition of the silencer function. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggested that SLUG mediates its action by recruiting C-terminal-binding protein-1 (CtBP-1) and histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1) at the silencer E2-box. The general HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A, inhibited the SLUG-mediated regulation of the silencer function. It thus appears that SLUG is a negative regulator for BRCA2 gene expression."

Based on sequence analysis of Wnt-5a, we identified 14 peptide fragments and investigated their ability to mimic the effects of Wnt-5a on mammary cell adhesion and migration. Two of these peptides significantly increased adhesion and impaired migration in the non-tumorigenic HB2 breast epithelial cell line and in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line, both of which show little endogenous expression of the Wnt-5a protein. We removed two amino acids at a time from the N terminus of the shorter of these two peptides to identify the shortest peptide that still inhibited migration. The influence on tumor cell adhesion was gradually lost and was no longer detectable when only six amino acids remained. However, formylation of the N-terminal methionine of this hexapeptide restored its effect on adhesion and reduced tumor cell motility via a Frizzled-5 receptor-dependent mechanism, even at a low pH such as encountered in breast tumor tissue. This formylated hexapeptide ligand induced a rapid cytosolic calcium signal, whereas it did not affect the cellular levels of unphosphorylated beta-catenin or active JNK. The novel formyl-Met-Asp-Gly-Cys-Glu-Leu peptide ligand is not only a valuable experimental tool but has also a potential role in antimetastatic treatment of the 50% of human breast cancer patients that have reduced endogenous Wnt-5a protein expression."

The re-expression of ERalpha in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells has been used as a model system, in which hormone-dependent responses can be restored. Paradoxically, in contrast to the mitogenic activity of 17beta-estradiol (E2) in ER-positive breast cancer cells, E2 suppresses proliferation in ER-negative breast cancer cells in which ERalpha has been re-expressed. We have used global gene expression profiling to investigate the mechanism by which E2 suppresses proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells that express ERalpha through adenoviral infection. We show that a number of genes known to promote cell proliferation and survival are repressed by E2 in these cells. These include genes encoding the anti-apoptosis factor SURVIVIN, positive cell cycle regulators (CDC2, CYCLIN B1, CYCLIN B2, CYCLIN G1, CHK1, BUB3, STK6, SKB1, CSE1 L) and chromosome replication proteins (MCM2, MCM3, FEN1, RRM2, TOP2A, RFC1). In parallel, E2-induced the expression of the negative cell cycle regulators KIP2 and QUIESCIN Q6, and the tumour-suppressor genes E-CADHERIN and NBL1. Strikingly, the expression of several of these genes is regulated in the opposite direction by E2 compared with their regulation in ER-positive MCF-7 cells. Together, these data suggest a mechanism for the E2-dependent suppression of proliferation in ER-negative breast cancer cells into which ERalpha has been reintroduced."

Transfer of NIS into other tumors would expand the utility of this treatment to tumors of nonthyroid origin. MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in many tumor types, including breast, pancreatic, and ovarian. The aim of this study was to create a construct containing NIS under the control of the MUC1 promoter to target expression specifically to MUC1-positive breast cancer cells.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A replication-deficient adenoviral construct was created containing the MUC1 promoter followed by the human NIS gene. Iodide uptake assays, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry were used to confirm NIS expression and function. Breast cancer xenografts in mice were infected with Ad5/MUC1/NIS and then imaged and treated using radioiodide.RESULTS: A 58-fold increase in iodide uptake was observed in infected MUC1-positive T47D cells with no significant increase observed in MUC1-negative MDA-MB-231 cells or in cells infected with the control virus. The in vivo study yielded clear images of Ad/MUC1/NIS-infected tumor xenografts using (123)I. Administration of a therapeutic dose of (131)I resulted in an 83% reduction in tumor volume, whereas control tumors continued to increase in size (P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the MUC1 promoter is capable of directing efficient and selective expression of the NIS gene in MUC1-positive breast tumor cells. This could potentially have applications for both imaging and therapy in a range of MUC1-positive tumor types."

These properties pose considerable challenges for modern-day structural biology. Despite these obstacles, high-resolution x-ray structures of the 30S and 50S subunits have revealed the RNA architecture and its interactions with proteins for ribosomes from Thermus thermophilus, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Haloarcula marismortui. Some regions, however, remain inaccessible to these high-resolution approaches because of their high conformational dynamics and potential heterogeneity, specifically the so-called L7/L12 stalk complex. This region plays a vital role in protein synthesis by interacting with GTPase factors in translation. Here, we apply tandem MS, an approach widely applied to peptide sequencing for proteomic applications but not previously applied to MDa complexes. Isolation and activation of ions assigned to intact 30S and 50S subunits releases proteins S6 and L12, respectively. Importantly, this process reveals, exclusively while attached to ribosomes, a phosphorylation of L12, the protein located in multiple copies at the tip of the stalk complex. Moreover, through tandem MS we discovered a stoichiometry for the stalk protuberance on Thermus thermophilus and other thermophiles and contrast this assembly with the analogous one on ribosomes from mesophiles. Together with evidence for a potential interaction with the degradosome, these results show that important findings on ribosome structure, interactions, and modifications can be discovered by tandem MS, even on well studied ribosomes from Thermus thermophilus."

Transfection with HER2/neu-specific siRNA resulted in a sequence-specific decrease in HER2/neu mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, transfection with HER2/neu siRNA caused cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 in the breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3 and BT-474, consistent with a powerful RNA silencing effect. siRNA treatment resulted in an antiproliferative and apoptotic response in cells overexpressing HER2/neu, but had no influence in cells with almost no expression of HER2/neu proteins like MDA-MB-468 cells. These data indicate that HER2/neu function is essential for the proliferation of HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells.

However, mechanisms responsible for antitumor activity of mda-7 in human ovarian cancer cells have not been identified. We investigated the therapeutic activity and underlying mechanisms of adenovirus-mediated mda-7 gene (Ad-mda7) transfer in human ovarian cancer cells. Ad-mda7 treatment resulted in overexpression of MDA-7/IL-24 protein in both ovarian cancer and normal ovarian epithelial cells. However, Ad-mda7 significantly (P = 0.001) inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis only in tumor cells and not in normal cells. Studies addressing the mechanism of action of Ad-mda7-induced tumor cell apoptosis revealed early activation of the transcription factors c-Jun and activating transcription factor 2, which in turn stimulated the transcription of an immediate downstream target, the death-inducer Fas ligand (FasL), and its cognate receptor Fas. Associated with the activation of Fas-FasL was the activation of nuclear factor kappaB and induction of Fas-associated factor 1, Fas-associated death domain, and caspase-8. Promoter-based reporter gene analyses showed that Ad-mda7 specifically activated the Fas promoter. Inhibition of Fas using small interfering RNA resulted in a significant decrease in Ad-mda7-mediated tumor cell death. Additionally, blocking of FasL with NOK-1 antibody abrogated Ad-mda7-mediated apoptosis. Collectively, these results show that Ad-mda7-mediated killing of human ovarian cancer cells involves activation of the Fas-FasL signaling pathway, a heretofore unrecognized mediator of MDA-7 apoptosis induction."

Although p53-deficient cancer cells are often less responsive to chemotherapy, they are not completely drug resistant, suggesting that other apoptotic pathways are at work. Here, we compared for the first time to our knowledge p73 and p63 activation in various breast cancer (BC) cell lines after Adriamycin (ADR) treatment, an agent considered as mandatory in breast cancer chemotherapy. Our study was carried out using 1 p53-proficient BC cell line (MCF7 cells) and 3 BC cell lines deficient in p53 response (MCF7/ADR(IGR), MDA-MB157 and T47D) after ADR-induced genotoxic stress. We report that in cells with no p53 response after ADR treatment, TAp73, but not TAp63 or DeltaN-p73/p63, may replace p53 in triggering not only apoptosis but also cell cycle arrest or DNA repair effectors such as p21, GADD45, 14-3-3sigma and p53R2. We also demonstrate that TAp73 siRNA inhibits the accumulation of TAp73 in response to ADR treatment in MDA-MB157 cells and confers protection against ADR. ADR-induced downregulation of the DeltaNp73 isoform in the T47D cell line with nonfunctional mutant p53 further supports anti-apoptotic function of the isoform antagonistic to both p53 and TA-p73/p63.

Whereas these hormones are most commonly known to regulate gene transcription through direct interaction with estrogen receptors (ERs) and with specific DNA sequences of target genes, recent studies show that ER also activates a number of rapid signaling events that are initiated at the cell membrane. To study the membrane-initiated effects of estrogen and separate them from the activities initiated by the nuclear localized ER in human breast cancer cells, we generated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines that have stably integrated either the wild-type nuclear form of ER (WT-ER) or a modified, membrane-targeted ER (MT-ER) that lacks a nuclear localization sequence and is dually acylated with a myristoylation sequence at the N terminus and a palmitoylation sequence at the C terminus. We demonstrate that MT-ER is membrane localized in the absence of estradiol (E2), showing punctate membrane and cytoplasmic speckles after E2 exposure. In contrast to WT-ER, MT-ER was not down-regulated by E2 or by antiestrogen ICI 182,780 exposure, and MT-ER failed to regulate endogenous E2-responsive genes highly up-regulated by WT-ER. Cells expressing MT-ER showed a greater serum response element-mediated transcriptional response that was partially inhibited by antiestrogen ICI 182,780. The MT-ER and WT-ER differentially altered ERK1/2 and Akt activities and the proliferation of breast cancer cells in response to E2. Hence, this study reveals distinct actions of the MT-ER vs. the WT-ER in effecting estrogen actions in breast cancer cells."

We evaluated the performance of multiple displacement amplification (MDA) WGA using gDNA extracted from lymphoblastoid cell lines (N = 27) with a range of starting gDNA input of 1-200 ng into the WGA reaction. Yield and composition analysis of whole genome amplified DNA (wgaDNA) was performed using three DNA quantification methods (OD, PicoGreen and RT-PCR). Two panels of N = 15 STR (using the AmpFlSTR Identifiler panel) and N = 49 SNP (TaqMan) genotyping assays were performed on each gDNA and wgaDNA sample in duplicate. gDNA and wgaDNA masses of 1, 4 and 20 ng were used in the SNP assays to evaluate the effects of DNA mass on SNP genotyping assay performance. A total of N = 6,880 STR and N = 56,448 SNP genotype attempts provided adequate power to detect differences in STR and SNP genotyping performance between gDNA and wgaDNA, and among wgaDNA produced from a range of gDNA templates inputs.RESULTS: The proportion of double-stranded wgaDNA and human-specific PCR amplifiable wgaDNA increased with increased gDNA input into the WGA reaction. Increased amounts of gDNA input into the WGA reaction improved wgaDNA genotyping performance. Genotype completion or genotype concordance rates of wgaDNA produced from all gDNA input levels were observed to be reduced compared to gDNA, although the reduction was not always statistically significant. Reduced wgaDNA genotyping performance was primarily due to the increased variance of allelic amplification, resulting in loss of heterozygosity or increased undetermined genotypes. MDA WGA produces wgaDNA from no template control samples; such samples exhibited substantial false-positive genotyping rates.CONCLUSION: The amount of gDNA input into the MDA WGA reaction is a critical determinant of genotyping performance of wgaDNA. At least 10 ng of lymphoblastoid gDNA input into MDA WGA is required to obtain wgaDNA TaqMan SNP assay genotyping performance equivalent to that of gDNA. Over 100 ng of lymphoblastoid gDNA input into MDA WGA is required to obtain optimal STR genotyping performance using the AmpFlSTR Identifiler panel from wgaDNA equivalent to that of gDNA."

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of the herb is poorly understood. Specifically, whether huanglian extract affects the expression of cancer-related genes has not been defined. This study used DNA microarray technology to examine the effect of the herbal extract on expression of the common genes involved in carcinogenesis in two human breast cancer cell lines, the ER-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Treatment of the cancer cells with huanglian extract markedly inhibited their proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The growth inhibitory effect was much more profound in MCF-7 cell line than that in MDA-MB-231 cells. DNA microarray assay revealed that treatment with huanglian dramatically increased the mRNA expression of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in MCF-7 cells. Quantitative analysis by real-time PCR or western blotting confirmed the upregulation of the two genes (especially IFN-beta) in MCF-7 cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. Addition of neutralizing antibody against IFN-beta to culture medium markedly inhibited the huanglian-induced antiproliferative effect, confirming the involvement of IFN-beta in the huanglian's effect and also suggesting an autocrine pathway for the action of IFN-beta in this setting. Given that IFN-beta is among the most important anticancer cytokines, the upregulation of this gene by huanglian is, at least in part, responsible for its antiproliferative effect. The results of this study implicate huanglian as a promising herb for chemoprevention and chemotherapy of certain cancers."

In this study, we used microarray technology to identify target genes of 1,25(OH)2D3 in androgen-responsive prostate cancer LNCaP cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 up-regulated CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (C/EBPdelta) by approximately 5-fold in these cells. Knockdown of C/EBPdelta expression by RNA interference showed that C/EBPdelta is essential for the significant growth inhibition of LNCaP cells in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. Moreover, we found that 1,25(OH)2D3 induced C/EBPdelta in other cancer cells, including the estrogen receptor (ER)-expressing MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells that are sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of 1,25(OH)2D3.

Furthermore, forced expression of C/EBPdelta in prostate cancer LNCaP as well as breast cancer MCF-7 and T47D cells dramatically reduced their clonal growth. Taken together, forced expression of C/EBPdelta in cancer cells may be a promising therapeutic strategy."

In this study, we set out to determine whether MDA-MB-435-DTP cells shown to express melanoma-specific genes were identical to various other MDA-MB-435 cell stocks worldwide. CGH-microarray, genetic polymorphism genotyping, microsatellite fingerprint analysis and/or chromosomal number confirmed that the MDA-MB-435 cells maintained at the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (MDA-MB-435-LCC) are almost identical to the MDA-MB-435-DTP cells, and showed a very similar profile to those obtained from the same original source (MD Anderson Cancer Center) but maintained independently (MDA-MB-435-PMCC). Gene expression profile analysis confirmed common expression of genes among different MDA-MB-435-LCC cell stocks, and identified some unique gene products in MDA-MB-435-PMCC cells. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of the melanoma marker tyrosinase across multiple MDA-MB-435 cell stocks. Collectively, our results show that the MDA-MB-435 cells used widely have identical origins to those that exhibit a melanoma-like gene expression signature, but exhibit a small degree of genotypic and phenotypic drift."

We examined the relationship between the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells, with the aim of developing specific targeted therapy.METHODS: Four human breast cancer cell lines were examined, and the effects of antisense (AS) Bcl-2 and AS Bcl-xL phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) on chemosensitivity were tested in vitro and in vivo. Chemosensitivity was evaluated by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the antitumor effect was assessed in vivo by the success of xenograft transplantation into athymic mice.RESULTS: Treatment with AS Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL ODNs resulted in a sequence-specific decrease in protein expression, compared with controls. Treatment of BT-474, ZR-75-1, and MDA-MB-231 cells with AS Bcl-2 increased chemosensitivity to doxorubicin (DOX), mitomycin C (MMC), paclitaxel (TXL), and docetaxel (TXT). Transfection of the Bcl-2 gene into MDA-MB-453 cells decreased sensitivity to DOX and MMC. Treatment of MDA-MB-231, BT-474, and ZR-75-1 cells with AS Bcl-xL increased chemosensitivity to DOX, MMC and taxanes to a smaller extent than AS Bcl-2. This occurred in the setting of increased Bax and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, as well as decreased Bcl-2 and pAkt. AS Bcl-2 ODNs induced splenomegaly in association with increased serum IL-12, which was attenuated by methylation of the CpG motifs of AS Bcl-2; however, methylated CpG failed to negate the increased antitumor effect of AS Bcl-2. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, to a smaller extent, are major determinants of chemosensitivity in breast cancer cells.CONCLUSION: Targeted therapy against Bcl-2 protein with the use of AS ODNs might enhance the effects of chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer."

Exposure of copper (10 and 25 microM) and zinc (10 and 25 microM) caused activation of p53 in ER+/p53+ human epithelial breast cancer MCF7 cells and resulted in up-regulation of p21. Transactivation of p53 in MCF7 cells also led to increase in expression of Bax, proapototic Bcl-2 family member, triggering mitochondrial pore opening, and PIG3 (p53-induced gene 3 product), and also generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The treatment of MCF7 cells with either copper or zinc for 4 h also caused decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi(m)), accompanied by an elevation in the ROS production and redistribution of p53 into mitochondria. The loss of Delta psi(m) was correlated with accumulation of Annexin V positive apoptotic cells. However, the release of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) and its translocation into nucleus was observed only in MCF7 cells treated with copper. In MDA-MB-231 (ER-/p53-) and MCF7-E6 (ER+/p53-) cells, both p53 and p21 protein levels were not altered in the presence of metals. These cells were resistant to metals, and there was no alteration in Delta psi(m). Copper treatment did not result in accumulation of ROS in these cell lines with an inactive p53 even after exposure to 50 microM of copper for 6 h, indicating a key role for p53 in the ROS generation. Pretreatment of MCF7 cells with p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha, resulted in decrease of copper and zinc induced ROS production to the control level, suppression of both Bax expression and AIF release. Therefore, the activation of p53 seems to play a crucial role in copper and zinc induced generation of ROS in epithelial breast cancer cells, and expression of downstream targets of p53, such as PIG3 and Bax, responsible for increased generation of the intracellular ROS, as well as disruption of mitochondrial integrity. Our data suggest that copper induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells with no caspases through the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane with release of AIF and its translocation into the nucleus. The results demonstrate that a functional p53 is required for the execution of apoptosis in epithelial cells."

The objectives of this study were to evaluate clusterin expression levels in human breast cancer and to determine whether antisense oligonucleotides or double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting the clusterin gene enhance apoptosis induced by paclitaxel. Clusterin immunostaining was evaluated in a tissue microarray of 379 spotted breast cancers. The effect of hormone withdrawal, paclitaxel treatment, clusterin antisense oligonucleotide (OGX-011), and siRNA treatments on clusterin expression was examined in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Northern, quantitative real-time PCR, and Western analyses were used to measure change in clusterin mRNA and protein levels. The effect of OGX-011 or siRNA clusterin treatment on chemosensitivity to paclitaxel was done in both cell lines in vitro, whereas the ability of OGX-011 to chemosensitize in vivo was evaluated in athymic mice bearing MCF-7 tumors. Clusterin was expressed in 62.5% of tumors within the tissue microarray. Clusterin expression increased after estrogen withdrawal and paclitaxel treatment in vitro in MCF-7 cells. OGX-011 or siRNA clusterin decreased clusterin levels by &gt;90% in a dose-dependent, sequence-specific manner and significantly enhanced chemosensitivity to paclitaxel in vitro. When combined, OGX-011 or siRNA clusterin reduced the IC50 by 2-log compared with paclitaxel alone. In vivo administration of OGX-011 enhanced the effects of paclitaxel to significantly delay MCF-7 tumor growth. These data identify clusterin as a valid therapeutic target and provides preclinical proof-of-principle to test OGX-011 in multimodality therapies for breast cancer."

There are two strategies for the amplification of single meiotic recombinants: repulsion-phase allele-specific PCR and whole genome amplification (WGA). The former can selectively amplify single recombinant molecules from a batch of sperm but is not scalable for high-throughput operation. Currently, primer extension pre-amplification is the only method used in WGA of single sperm, whereas it has limited capacity to produce high-coverage products enough for the analysis of local recombination rate in multiple large regions. Here, we applied for the first time a recently developed WGA method, multiple displacement amplification (MDA), to amplify single sperm DNA, and demonstrated its great potential for producing high-yield and high-coverage products. In a 50 mul reaction, 76 or 93% of loci can be amplified at least 2500- or 250-fold, respectively, from single sperm DNA, and second-round MDA can further offer &gt;200-fold amplification. The MDA products are usable for a variety of genetic applications, including sequencing and microsatellite marker and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis.

In this report, we show that BI-1 is expressed at various levels in six different human breast cancer cell lines. In order to investigate the function of BI-1 in oestrogen-dependent MCF-7, T-47D and oestrogen-independent MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, the RNA interference technique was used to knock down BI-1 expression specifically. Suppression of BI-1 expression caused a significant increase in spontaneous apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas MCF-7 and T-47D cells remained almost unaffected. Furthermore, BI-1 expression analysis using a cancer profiling array showed up-regulation of BI-1 expression in cancer samples of breast, uterus and ovary, whereas down-regulated BI-1 expression was identified in stomach, colon, kidney, lung and rectal cancer. In addition, immunohistochemical studies using a BI-1-specific antibody on human breast cancer specimens also revealed that BI-1 is expressed in the majority of cases. Moreover, to analyse whether BI-1 expression is oestrogen receptor-dependent, tumour cells were treated with oestradiol, ICI and tamoxifen: this showed no significant changes in BI-1 expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that BI-1 expression is differentially deregulated in different cancers and that BI-1 plays an important role in preventing certain breast cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis. Thus, the development of novel therapeutic strategies based on targeting BI-1 gene expression in breast cancer could be restricted to selected individual cancer types."

To date, few peptide carriers have been developed that have proved effective for siRNA delivery. Our previous branched carriers composed of histidine and lysine were useful for transfection of plasmids. In this study, we determined if these and more highly branched HK polymers were effective carriers of siRNA.METHODS: Several branched polymers were synthesized on a Ranin Voyager synthesizer. These polymers were then screened for their ability to transfer siRNA into SVR-bag4 cells, MDA-MB-435 cells, and C6 cells. After one polymer, H3K8b, was identified as an effective carrier of siRNA, additional polymers were synthesized to determine the essential domains for siRNA transport. The size/zeta-potential of HK : siRNA complexes were measured with the N4 submicron particle size analyzer and the Delsa 440 SX zeta-potential analyzer, respectively. Toxicity of the highly branched polymers in complex with siRNA was investigated by flow cytometry.RESULTS: In an endothelial cell line (SVR-bag4) that stably expressed beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), an siRNA in complex with the H3K8b polymer inhibited beta-gal expression by more than 80%. In contrast, the polymer H2K4b, which was an effective carrier of plasmids, was not an efficient carrier of siRNA. The size and surface charge did not distinguish effective from ineffective HK carriers of siRNA. By modifying H3K8b, we then determined what properties of H3K8b augmented siRNA delivery. The histidine-rich domain and the length of the terminal arms of H3K8 were important for siRNA delivery. The modestly more effective analog of H3K8b containing an integrin ligand, H3K8b(+RGD), was able to inhibit markedly intracellular beta-gal expression. Furthermore, we determined that H3K8b(+RGD) in complex with a luciferase-targeting siRNA inhibited luciferase expression in MDA-MB-435 cells. At its optimal concentration for inhibiting its target, H3K8b(+RGD) : siRNA complex had minimal toxicity. In contrast, carriers of siRNA such as Oligofectamine and Lipofectamine 2000 were significantly more toxic.CONCLUSIONS: Both the degree of complexity and the sequence specificity are important factors to be considered for developing the HK carrier of siRNA. In particular, we found that certain branched HK polymers (H3K8b, H3K8b(+RGD), and similar structural analogs) with eight terminal branches and a histidine-rich domain were effective carriers of siRNA."

A key contribution in this regard was the introduction of tumor-selective viral replication for amplification of the initial inoculum. Specifically, following cellular infection, the virus replicates selectively in the infected tumor cells and kills the cells by cytolysis. Next, the progeny virions infect surrounding target cells, replicate and eradicate the infected tumor cells, leaving normal cells unaffected. However, to date there have been two limitations to clinical application of these CRAd agents; i.e., both infectivity and tumor specificity are poor. Survivin protein is a novel member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family, which plays an important role in the survival of cancer cells and progression of malignancies. Previous data have shown the survivin promoter has high activities in multiple cancer cells with a low activity in mouse liver. In this study, we propose an improved CRAd agent to circumvent the obstacles. We constructed a novel CRAd agent, CRAd-Survivin-RGD, which contains both the survivin promoter (either the short version, S-S, or the long version, S-L) to selectively drive E1 gene expression in tumor cells and a capsid modification and RGD4C to specifically enhance the tumor infectivity of CRAd agents. Both CRAd agents (S-S and S-L) showed high replication rates in the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-361, and low promoter activity in both normal mouse and human liver, thus signifying the CRAd agents have the phenotype of 'tumor on/liver off'. In cytocidal experiments, the CRAd agents demonstrated a high cytocidal effect on multiple cancer cell lines, including the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231; the glioma cell line, D65, the melanoma cell line, MEL-28; and mesothelioma, Meso2374. The results also showed the tumor growth was dramatically inhibited by intertumoral administration of the CRAd agents in a breast cancer (MDA-MB-361) xenograft animal model. These data clearly demonstrate that CRAd-Survivin-RGD is a potential novel therapeutic agent for treatment in many, but not all, human cancers."

The aims of this study were to investigate the expression of the ghrelin axis in breast cancer tissues and cell lines and to examine the effect of ghrelin on breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Ghrelin and its functional receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) type 1a, were expressed in normal breast tissue and breast cancer specimens and cell lines. In contrast, the truncated GHSR type 1b isoform was exclusively expressed in breast carcinoma, suggesting that it has potential as a diagnostic marker. Ghrelin treatment significantly increases the proliferation of the MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines in vitro. In addition, we have described the expression of a human preproghrelin isoform, exon 3-deleted preproghrelin, which encodes mature ghrelin plus a novel C-terminal peptide. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to demonstrate that this mRNA isoform is highly expressed in the MDA-MB-435 metastatic breast cancer cell line relative to the benign MCF-10A breast epithelial cell line. The unique C-terminal peptide of exon 3-deleted preproghrelin is expressed in the glandular epithelium of breast cancer tissues, with high-grade carcinoma exhibiting the strongest immunoreactivity. The data presented here suggest that components of the ghrelin axis may represent novel markers for breast cancer and potential therapeutic targets."

ERalpha can also act via a nonclassical pathway by altering the activities of other transcription factors (e.g., Sp1, AP-1, or NF-kappaB) at their cognate sites on DNA. We previously generated a mutant form of ERalpha (E207A/G208A) that does not bind to EREs, and therefore lacks signaling via the classical pathway but retains signaling via the nonclassical pathway. In the current study, we introduce this mutant ERalpha into MDA-MB231 ERalpha-negative breast carcinoma cells to identify nonclassical pathway genes that respond to 17beta-estradiol (E2), selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) tamoxifen (TAM) or raloxifene (RAL), or the estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780 (ICI). Consistent with a role for nonclassical signaling in SERM action, microarray analyses identify 268 responsive nonclassical ERalpha pathway target genes. ICI elicits the largest number of nonclassical genes, followed by RAL, TAM, and E2. Custom microarrays containing identified nonclassical ERalpha responsive genes are used to compare gene expression in human breast tumor (n = 34) and normal mammary epithelial cell (n = 9) samples. A subset of nonclassical genes (n = 32) are differentially expressed in breast tumors. In summary, we show that nonclassical ERalpha pathway target genes exhibit a range of transcriptional responses to SERMs and identify targets of this pathway as potentially relevant to breast cancer. The identification of nonclassical ERalpha target genes offers new insight into estrogen receptor signaling and cross talk with pathways that mediate breast tumor response to SERM therapy."

Breast carcinoma cells express different complements and variable proportions of ErbB receptor Tyr kinases, which activate unique and redundant signaling cascades that are essential for cell survival. Previously it was shown that a COOH-terminal truncation mutant of the EGFR (EGFR-CD533) blocks EGFR dependent signals and radiosensitizes breast carcinoma cells. In this study the effects of EGFR-CD533 and an analogous truncation mutant of ErbB2 (ErbB2-CD572) on ErbB receptor family dimerization and signaling are further investigated. Using adenoviral vectors in breast carcinoma cell lines with variable ErbB expression profiles, we demonstrate different effects for each deletion mutant. EGFR-CD533 blocks ligand stimulation of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4, but is associated with a compensatory Tyr kinase activity resulting in phosphorylation of ErbB3. In contrast, ErbB2-CD572 produces a weaker, non-specific pattern of ErbB receptor family inhibition, based upon the ErbB expression pattern of the cell type. Investigation of the compensatory Tyr kinase activity associated with EGFR-CD533 expression identified an ErbB3/c-Src signaling pathway that regulates expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl family proteins. This signaling is active in the T47D cell line, which inherently over-express ErbB3, absent in MDA-MB231 cells, which have low ErbB3 expression levels, and is restored in a MDA-MB231 cell line engineered to over-express ErbB3. Furthermore we demonstrate that ErbB3/c-Src signaling is radio-protective, and that its elimination through pharmacologic inhibition of c-Src enhances radiation-induced apoptosis. In summary, these studies identify a novel ErbB3/c-Src survival signal and point to ErbB3 expression levels as an important variable in therapeutic targeting of ErbB receptors in breast carcinoma cells."

WGA DNA (wgaDNA) yield and genotyping performance were evaluated using genotypes determined from gDNA and wgaDNA using the AmpFlSTR Identifiler assay and N = 49 TaqMan SNP assays. Short tandem repeat (STR) and SNP genotyping completion and concordance rates were significantly reduced with wgaDNA from all WGA methods compared with gDNA. OmniPlex wgaDNA exhibited a greater reduction in genotyping performance than MDA wgaDNA. Reduced wgaDNA genotyping performance was due to allelic (all protocols) and locus (OmniPlex) amplification bias leading to heterozygote and locus dropout, respectively, and %GC sequence content (%GC) was significantly correlated with TaqMan assay performance. Lymphoblast wgaDNA exhibited higher yield (OmniPlex), buffy coat wgaDNA exhibited higher STR genotyping completion (MDA), whereas mouthwash wgaDNA exhibited higher SNP genotyping discordance (MDA).

The isolates are, therefore, members of the &quot;Gammaproteobacteria&quot; and Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides, the taxonomic groups that have been shown to dominate polar sea ice and seawater microbial communities. Exopolysaccharides produced by Antarctic isolates were characterized. Chemical composition and molecular weight data revealed that these EPS were very diverse, even among six closely related Pseudoalteromonas isolates. Most of the EPS contained charged uronic acid residues; several also contained sulfate groups. Some strain produced unusually large polymers (molecular weight up to 5.7 MDa) including one strain in which EPS synthesis is stimulated by low temperature.

In the nucleus, beta-catenin binds to the TCF/LEF-1 (T-cell factor/ lymphoid enhancer factor) transcription factor family resulting in the activation of several genes, some of them having important implications in tumour progression. In our study, we investigated the potential regulation of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) expression by the beta-catenin/TCF pathway. This CC-chemokine has been implicated in tumour progression events such as angiogenesis or tumour associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration. We thus demonstrated that MCP-1 expression correlates with the reorganization of the E-cadherin/beta-catenin complexes. Indeed, MCP-1 was expressed by invasive breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, BT549 and Hs578T), which do not express E-cadherin but was not produced by noninvasive breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) expressing high level of E-cadherin. In addition, the MCP-1 promoter was activated in BT549 breast cancer cells transfected with beta-catenin and TCF-4 cDNAs. The MCP-1 mRNA level was similarly upregulated. Moreover, we showed that MCP-1 mRNA was downregulated after transfection with a siRNA against beta-catenin in both BT549 and Hs578T cells. Our results therefore identify MCP-1 as a target of the beta-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway in breast tumour cells, a regulation which could play a key role in breast tumour progression."

TGF-beta induction of stress fibers in epithelial cells requires high molecular weight tropomyosins encoded by TPM1 and TPM2 genes. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying the failure of TGF-beta to induce stress fibers and inhibit cell migration in metastatic cells. RT-PCR analysis in carcinoma cell lines revealed a significant reduction in TPM1 transcripts in metastatic MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and SW620 cell lines. Treatment of these cells with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) increased mRNA levels of TPM1 with no effect on TPM2. Importantly, 5-aza-dC treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells restored TGF-beta induction of TPM1 and formation of stress fibers. Forced expression of TPM1 by using Tet-Off system increased stress fibers in MDA-MB-231 cells and reduced cell migration. A potential CpG island spanning the TPM1 proximal promoter, exon 1, and the beginning of intron 1 was identified. Bisulfite sequencing showed significant cytosine methylation in metastatic cell lines that correlated with a reduced expression of TPM1. Together these results suggest that epigenetic suppression of TPM1 may alter TGF-beta tumor suppressor function and contribute to metastatic properties of tumor cells."

We examined the ability of C75, a synthetic slow-binding inhibitor of FAS activity, to modulate the cytotoxic activity of the microtubule-interfering agent Taxol (paclitaxel) in SK-Br3, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and multidrug-resistant MDR-1 (P-Glycoprotein)-overexpressing MCF-7/AdrR breast cancer cells. When the combination of C75 with Taxol in either concurrent (C75 + Taxol 24 hr) or sequential (C75 24 hr --&gt; Taxol 24 hr) schedules were tested for synergism, addition or antagonism using the isobologram and the median-effect plot analyses, co-exposure of C75 and Taxol mostly demonstrated synergistic effects, whereas sequential exposure to C75 followed by Taxol mainly showed additive or antagonistic interactions. Because the nature of the cytotoxic interactions was definitely schedule-dependent in MCF-7 cells, we next evaluated the effects of C75 on Taxol-induced apoptosis as well as Taxol-activated cell death and cell survival-signaling pathways in this breast cancer cell model. An ELISA for histone-associated DNA fragments demonstrated that C75 and Taxol co-exposure caused a synergistic enhancement of apoptotic cell death, whereas C75 pre-treatment did not enhance the apoptosis-inducing activity of Taxol. Co-exposure to C75 and Taxol induced a remarkable nuclear accumulation of activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), which was accompanied by a synergistic nuclear accumulation of the p53 tumor-suppressor protein that was phosphorylated at Ser46, a p38 MAPK-regulated pro-apoptotic modification of p53. As single agents, FAS blocker C75 and Taxol induced a significant stimulation of the proliferation and cell survival mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/ERK2 MAPK) activity, whereas, in combination, they interfered with ERK1/ERK2 activation. Moreover, the combined treatment of C75 and Taxol inactivated the anti-apoptotic AKT (protein kinase B) kinase more than either agent alone, as evidenced by a synergistic down-regulation of AKT phosphorylation at its activating site Ser(473) without affecting AKT protein levels. To rule out a role for non-FAS C75-mediated effects, we finally used the potent and highly sequence-specific mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi) to block FAS-dependent signaling. Importantly, SK-Br3 and multi-drug resistant MCF-7/AdrR cells transiently transfected with sequence-specific double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides targeting FAS gene demonstrated hypersensitivity to Taxol-induced apoptotic cell death. Our findings establish for the first time that FAS blockade augments the cytotoxicity of anti-mitotic drug Taxol against breast cancer cells and that this chemosensitizing effect is schedule-dependent. We suggest that the alternate activation of both the pro-apoptotic p38 MAPK-p53 signaling and the cytoprotective MEK1/2 --&gt; ERK1/2 cascade, as well as the inactivation of the anti-apoptotic AKT activity may explain, at least in part, the sequence-dependent enhancement of Taxol-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis that follows inhibition of FAS activity in breast cancer cells. If chemically stable FAS inhibitors demonstrate systemic anticancer effects of FAS inhibition in vivo, these findings may render FAS as a valuable molecular target to enhance the efficacy of taxanes-based chemotherapy in human breast cancer."

One factor determining the sensitivity or resistance to the retinoid anticancer signal is the transcriptional response of retinoid-regulated target genes in cancer cells. We used cDNA microarray to identify 31 retinoid-regulated target genes shared by two retinoid-sensitive neuroblastoma cell lines, and then sought to determine the relevance of the target gene responses to the retinoid anticancer signal. The pattern of retinoid responsiveness for six of 13 target genes (RARbeta2, CYP26A1, CRBP1, RGS16, DUSP6, EGR1) correlated with phenotypic retinoid sensitivity, across a panel of retinoid-sensitive or -resistant lung and breast cancer cell lines. Retinoid treatment of MYCN transgenic mice bearing neuroblastoma altered the expression of five of nine target genes examined (RARbeta2, CYP26A1, CRBP1, DUSP6, PLAT) in neuroblastoma tumour tissue in vivo. In retinoid-sensitive neuroblastoma, lung and breast cancer cell lines, direct inhibition of retinoid-induced RARbeta2 expression blocked induction of only one of eight retinoid target genes (CYP26A1). DNA demethylation, histone acetylation, and exogenous overexpression of RARbeta2 partially restored retinoid-responsive CYP26A1 expression in RA-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast, but not SK-MES-1 lung, cancer cells. Combined, rather than individual, inhibition of DUSP6 and RGS16 was required to block retinoid-induced growth inhibition in neuroblastoma cells, through phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase. In conclusion, sensitivity to the retinoid anticancer signal is determined in part by the transcriptional response of key retinoid-regulated target genes, such as RARbeta2, DUSP6, and RGS16."

These results suggest that promoters I.3 and II are the major promoters directing aromatase expression in breast tumors. The characterization of transcription factors that interact with the two elements near promoters I.3 and II, i.e., S1 and CREaro, helps us better understand the mechanism of the switch of promoter usage between normal breast tissue and cancer tissue. The positions of the two regulatory regions were mapped by DNase I footprinting and DNA deletion analyses. We applied the yeast one-hybrid approach to screen a human breast tissue hybrid cDNA expression library for genes encoding the proteins binding to these regions. Our results suggest that in normal breast tissue, the function of promoters I.3 and II is suppressed through the binding of EAR-2, COUP-TFI, and RARgamma to S1, and through the binding of Snail/Slug proteins to their binding site that quenches the CREaro activity. In cancer tissue, the expression levels of EAR-2, COUP-TF1, EARgamma, Snail, and Slug decrease, and aromatase expression is then up-regulated through the binding of ERRalpha to S1 and the binding of CREB1 or related factors to CREaro. In a separate study, we found that estrogen could up-regulate aromatase expression in breast cancer cells by a non-genomic action of ERalpha via cross-talk with growth factor-mediated pathways. Our preliminary results suggest that protein kinase C delta participates in this ERalpha-growth factor mediated regulation. To further understand the regulatory mechanism, we have recently initiated an in vivo footprinting analysis of the -260/+76 bp region of promoter I.3. The experiments were conducted with both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Our results revealed several footprinted sites. Five regions (sites 1-5) were then selected for functional analysis through DNA site-directed mutagenesis experiments. This analysis has also confirmed the promoter I.3 TATA site and Snail/Slug binding site. These mutants showed higher luciferase activity when compared to the wild-type, indicating that the proteins binding to these sites were acting as repressors. By reviewing findings from our laboratory and other laboratories, a detailed mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of aromatase expression in breast cancer tissue is summarized and discussed."

Germ-line mutation of either TSC gene leads to the development of the heritable disorder TSC. This disorder is characterized by the development of hamartomas in many organs and is associated with the proliferative lung disease, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, the brain tumour giant cell astrocytoma and occasionally with renal cell carcinoma. However, the TSC genes have not been studied in breast cancer. The current study investigated the expression of the TSC gene products and the potential mechanisms of their aberrancy in human breast cancer cells and tissues.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS: Using immunohistochemical analysis, both hamartin and tuberin were found to be strongly stained in normal mammary epithelial cells and weakly in stromal cells. In invasive tumour tissues, however, the staining of both proteins were to be markedly reduced (P &lt; 0.01). At message level, although normal and tumour tissues expressed both TSC products, the transcript levels of tuberin was significantly lower in tumour tissues compared with normal tissues (P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistical difference between node negative and node positive tumours with both hamartin and tuberin. Tumours from patients who developed recurrence and died from breast cancer had significantly low levels of tuberin compared with those who remained disease free (P = 0.03 and 0.05, respectively). Likewise, hamartin levels were significantly lower in patients with metastasis, recurrence and mortality, when compared with those remained disease free (P = 0.001, 0.041 and 0.003, respectively). Using methylation specific PCR, the TSC1 promoter was found to be heavily methylated in ZR751, MDA MB 435, and BT549, but not in MCF-7 which expressed highly level of hamartin. TSC1 promoter methylation was also seen in most breast tumours, but only in a limited number of normal tissues. The methylation of TSC2 promoter appears to be less frequent. MDA MB 468, MDA MB 483, MDA MB 435S and weakly MDA MB 435 were found to have methylated TSC2 promoter. In breast tissues, however, a very small number of samples were found to have methylation of the TSC2 promoter.CONCLUSION: TSC1 genes are aberrantly expressed in human breast cancer cell lines and breast tumour tissues and their promoters are seen to be methylated in breast tumour tissues. The expression of TSC1 is associated with an unfavourable clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer."

Previous studies demonstrated that reactivation of PR expression in hormone-independent MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells enabled progesterone to suppress cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. We determined the whole genomic effect of progesterone in PR-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells. We identified 151 progesterone-regulated genes with expression changes &gt; 3-fold after 24 hr treatment. Most are novel progesterone target genes. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of 55 genes showed a 100% confirmation rate. Twenty-six genes were regulated at both 3 and 24 hr. Studies using translation inhibitor suggest that most of the 26 genes are primary progesterone target genes. Progesterone consistently suppressed the expression of genes required for cell proliferation and metastasis and increased the expression of many tumor-suppressor genes. Progesterone also consistently decreased the expression of DNA repair and chromosome maintenance genes, which may be part of the mechanism leading to cell cycle arrest. These data suggest potential usefulness of progestin in combating ER-negative but PR-positive breast cancer and indicate that progesterone can exert a strong anticancer effect in hormone-independent breast cancer following PR reactivation. The identification of many novel progesterone target genes open up new avenues for in-depth elucidation of progesterone-mediated molecular networks."

Because very limited treatment options are available for recurrent hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), it is imperative to assess whether the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter-based TSTA gene therapy will be functional in HRPC.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We tested the TSTA-driven adenovirus vector on three androgen-dependent and six HRPC models. Real-time gene expression was monitored by both optical imaging and the combined modality of positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography.RESULTS: The TSTA-driven firefly luciferase expressing adenoviral vector was active in all androgen receptor (AR)-expressing HRPC models, but inactive in AR- and PSA-negative lines. Interestingly, the TSTA-mediated gene expression was induced by hydrocortisone in MDA PCa 2b, a cell line with mutated AR that possesses altered ligand specificity. In animal models, the TSTA-mediated optical signal was more robust in the HRPC than androgen-dependent tumors. In a parallel trend, a TSTA vector that expresses the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase PET reporter gene also displayed more robust PET signal in the HRPC tumor.CONCLUSIONS: The activity of TSTA system is AR dependent and it recapitulates the functional status of endogenous AR. These data support the conclusion that AR function is activated in HRPC despite castrated levels of androgen. Together with the fact that majority of recurrent prostate cancers express AR and PSA, we foresee that the TSTA approach can be a promising gene therapy strategy for the advanced stages of prostate cancer."

To study the relationship among ERalpha, RARalpha and CRABPII expression, the protein levels of each member were compared in five breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MCF-7, ZR-75-1, Hs587 T and MDA-MB-231 cells) and two immortalized nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell lines (MTSV1.7 and MCF-10A). ERalpha, RARalpha and CRABPII proteins were detected in T47D, MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells but not in other tested cell lines. RARalpha and CRABPII proteins were either reduced or undetectable in T47D/C4:2W and MCF-7/ADR cells with lost expression of ERalpha. Estradiol increased and anti-estrogens (tamoxifen and ICI 164,384) downregulated the expression of both RARalpha and CRABPII proteins in T47D and MCF-7 cells. RARalpha antagonist Ro-41-5253 inhibited CRABPII expression, but not RARalpha expression in estradiol-treated T47D and MCF-7 cells. Suppression of ERalpha by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced RARalpha and CRABPII gene expression and siRNA suppression of RARalpha reduced CRABPII expression while having no effect on ERalpha in T47D cells. Transient transfection of either RARalpha or ERalpha expression vectors increased CRABPII expression in MDA-MB-231 cells but only RARalpha, not ERalpha, activated hCRABPII promoter reporter. These results indicate that there is a gene activation pathway in which ERalpha drives RARalpha transcription and RARalpha drives CRABPII transcription in ERalpha-positive human breast cancer cells."

Soluble TRAIL has been shown to induce apoptosis in a wide variety of cancer cells in vitro and to suppress tumor growth specifically without damaging normal cells and tissues in vivo. In our previous report, we have demonstrated that an artificial gene encoding the polypeptide composed of the three functional elements (a secretion signal, a trimerization domain and an apoptosis-inducing moiety of TRAIL gene sequence) expresses and secretes highly apoptotic trimeric TRAIL into the culture supernatant. Here, as an approach to TRAIL-based cancer gene therapy, we developed an adenoviral vector delivering the gene that encodes our secretable trimeric TRAIL (stTRAIL). This adenovirus (Ad-stTRAIL) potently induced apoptosis in vitro in cancer cell lines such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, A549, HCT116 and U-87MG. In an animal xenograft tumor model bearing a human glioma cell line U-87MG, intratumoral delivery of Ad-stTRAIL dramatically suppressed tumor growth without showing detectable adverse side effects. Histological analysis revealed that Ad-stTRAIL suppresses tumor growth by inducing apoptotic cell death. Contrary to the known rapid clearance of systemically delivered TRAIL protein from the blood circulation, stTRAIL expressed by Ad-stTRAIL in tumor tissues persisted for more than 4 days. In a comparison of tumor suppressor activity between Ad-stTRAIL and Ad-flTRAIL (delivering the full-length TRAIL gene) after mixing infected cells with uninfected cells and implanting these mixed cells in nude mice, Ad-stTRAIL showed higher tumor suppressor activity than that of Ad-flTRAIL. Our data reveal that a gene therapy using Ad-stTRAIL has a promising potential to treat human cancers including gliomas."

Whereas sequence-specific DNA-binding factors dictate the expression patterns of genes through transcriptional regulation, those transcriptional factors influencing constitutive cell survival with perillyl alcohol treatment are not well studied. Here, we investigated whether the monoterpenes can regulate the activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), a calcium-dependent transcription factor necessary for survival in the WEHI-231 B-lymphoma cells. Unique among the monoterpenes, perillyl alcohol short-term treatment induced a persistent decrease of calcium levels, whereas other various monoterpenes caused transient reductions in calcium levels. Perillyl alcohol treatment also rapidly elicited reductions of NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity and target gene induction, which was associated with an increase in apoptosis in these B-lymphoma cells. This apoptosis was directly due to NF-kappaB because its prior activation abolished the cell killing effects of perillyl alcohol treatment. Our findings suggest that perillyl alcohol can inhibit NF-kappaB function to modulate gene expression patterns and cell survival of certain B-lymphoma cells. The effects of perillyl alcohol were not limited to these B-lymphoma cells but were also observed in MDA-MB 468 cells, an estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell line. These results identify a calcium-dependent NF-kappaB pathway as a molecular target of perillyl alcohol activity in different cancer cell types."

The deregulation is the consequence of an increased transcription level and gene amplification. Several laboratories, including our own, have identified, in the proximal promoter, enhancers implicated in the gene overexpression. However, our previous studies of a 6-kb ERBB2 promoter fragment revealed the presence of repressing fragments, which were able to overcome the effect of the proximal enhancers. These repressing elements were functional in all cell lines, regardless of their endogenous ERBB2 expression level. Here, we show that a distal ERBB2 promoter region restores high transcription rates specifically in ERBB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. This distal promoter region thus contains enhancers essential for the overexpression of the gene. By EMSA, performed with nuclear extract of cells overexpressing (BT-474) or not (MDA-MB-231) the ERBB2 gene, we show that at least two sequences of the distal promoter region are bound exclusively by BT-474 extract. Further experiments reveal that AP-2 transcription factors contribute to this differential binding activity, by binding recognition sequences located 4500 bp and 4000 bp upstream of the transcription start site. These sites are occupied by AP2 in vivo, as demonstrated by ChIP assay. Inactivation of AP-2 proteins in ERBB2 overexpressing cells reduces the distal promoter activity up to 70%, indicating the AP-2 factors are implicated in the strong distal enhancing effect. Moreover, we identified a 54-bp fragment that is bound specifically by BT-474 nuclear extract. Further experiments did not lead to the identification of the protein responsible for this binding. Our results thus highlight the importance of ERBB2 distal promoter region and further implicate AP-2 in ERBB2 overexpression in breast cancer cells."

The cellular target of docetaxel is the microtubule, specifically the beta-tubulin subunit, that comprises a series of isotypes and that can modulate function. This study has examined the role of alteration in beta-tubulin isotypes in vitro and has sequenced the beta-tubulin gene to determine if there were mutations, both of which may represent important mechanisms of acquired resistance to docetaxel. Breast cancer cells, MCF-7 (oestrogen-receptor positive) and MDA-MB-231, (oestrogen-receptor negative) were made resistant to docetaxel in vitro. Expression of beta-tubulin isotypes (class I, II, III, IVa, IVb, and VI) was determined at the RNA and protein level using RT-PCR and western analysis, respectively. DNA sequencing evaluated the beta-tubulin gene. At the mRNA level, class I, II, III, and IVa beta-tubulin mRNA isotypes were over-expressed in docetaxel-resistant MCF-7 cells when compared with the docetaxel-sensitive parental cells. However, class VI beta-tubulin mRNA isotype expression was decreased in resistant cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, there was a decrease in expression of the class I and class IVa beta-tubulin mRNA. However, there were increased expressions in class II, IVb, and VI beta-tubulin mRNA isotypes in resistant cells. Western analysis has confirmed corresponding increases in beta-tubulin protein levels in MCF-7 cells. However, in MDA-MB-231 cells, there were decreased protein levels for class II and class III beta-tubulin. This study demonstrates that altered expression of mRNA beta-tubulin isotypes and modulation of beta-tubulin protein levels are associated with acquired docetaxel resistance in breast cancer cells. This allows further understanding and elucidation of mechanisms involved in resistance to docetaxel."

Subsequently, a H. pylori-specific 16S rDNA variable V3 region PCR assay was applied directly on MDA-DNA and, combined with pyrosequencing analysis; the presence of H. pylori in some biopsies from colon in patients with microscopic colitis was confirmed. Furthermore, temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) of 16S rDNA amplicons using primers flanking variable regions V3, V4, and V9, was used to establish bacterial profiles from individual biopsies. A variation of the bacterial profiles in the colonic mucosa in microscopic colitis and in normal rectal mucosa was observed.

The mechanisms by which COX-2 exerts its mitogenic effects have not been entirely elucidated, but stimulation of prostaglandin E2 production and alterations in the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF-1/CIP1/MDA-6)(p2i) have been suggested. Here, we demonstrate that two COX-2 inhibitors (NS398 and Nimesulide) inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in NSCLC cells, and these effects were associated with induction of p21 mRNA and protein expression. However, the anti-growth effect of the COX-2 inhibitors and their ability to induce p21 were not affected by COX-2 siRNA suggesting that their actions were COX-2 independent. Instead, activation of the MEK-1/Erk pathway was necessary since COX-2 inhibitors stimulated the phosphorylation of ERKs, and their effects were blocked by PD98095, an inhibitor of this pathway. Furthermore, we show that both NS398 and Nimesulide induced p21 gene promoter activity and this was prevented by PD98095. COX-2 inhibitors increased nuclear protein binding to the Spl site in the promoter region of the p21 gene. Consistent with a role for p21, we found that p21 antisense oligonucleotides prevented the effects of COX-2 inhibitors on cell growth. In summary, our results suggest that COX-2 inhibitors suppress NSCLC cell growth by inducing the expression of the p21 gene through MEK-1/ERK signaling and DNA-protein interactions involving Spl.

Recently, it has been shown that CpG island hypermethylation of the KLK10 gene is responsible for the tumor-specific loss of KLK10 gene expression in certain breast cancer cell lines.METHOD: We examined the role of CpG island hypermethylation in the tumor-specific loss of KLK10 expression in breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. We treated cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (dC) and monitored changes in KLK10 mRNA by RT-PCR and secreted hK10 protein expression by ELISA. The following cell lines were used: MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, ZR-75-1, T-47D and BT-474 (breast); BG-1, MDAH-2774, HTB-75, HTB-161, PA-1 and ES-2 (ovary), and LNCaP and PC-3 (prostate).RESULTS: Upregulation of KLK10 mRNA levels, which was accompanied by an increase in secreted hK10 protein concentration, was observed for a subset of breast, ovarian, and prostate tumor cell lines after 5-aza-2'-dC. Genomic sequencing of sodium-bisulfite-treated DNA demonstrated that CpG sites within the KLK10 gene exon 3 were highly methylated. Hypermethylation of exon 3 CpG regions was also detected in primary ovarian cancers.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CpG island hypermethylation plays an important role in the downregulation of kallikrein 10 mRNA and protein expression, but it cannot explain the pattern of expression of this gene in all cell lines or tissue tested."

Osteonectin was isolated from conditioned media of several cell lines including breast cancer (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-468), osteoblasts (hFOB1.19), non-neoplastic breast epithelial (hTERT-HME1), and vascular endothelial cells isolated from a bone biopsy (HBME-1). Chemical/physical properties of osteonectin from these five sources was analyzed to determine if unique configurations of osteonectin exist and therefore identify a chemotactic isoform. Osteonectin from all sources had a molecular weight of approximately 46 kDa, N-linked glycosylation, and undetectable phosphorylated serines, sialic acids and O-linked oligosaccharides. The cDNA for osteonectin from the breast cancer, osteoblast, and breast epithelial cell lines was identical, while the vascular endothelial cell cDNA contained point mutations that resulted in eight amino acid substitutions. Bone-derived osteonectin was then analyzed to assess its influence on breast cancer cell motility and migration. Although osteonectin increased undirected MDA-MB-231 cell motility, it did not chemoattract the same breast cancer cell line. However, the breast cancer cells did migrate toward the known chemoattractant vitronectin and to bone extracts derived from wild-type and osteonectin-null mice. Migration to vitronectin was enhanced when osteonectin was also present. We concluded that osteonectin was not a chemotactic factor. However, through its anti-adhesive properties, osteonectin induced undirected breast cancer cell motility, and may have enhanced chemoattraction to vitronectin."

AP-2 transcription factors bind to the HER-2/neu gene promoter and activate its expression. In a striking concurrence, anomalous abundance of AP-2alpha protein or its homolog AP-2gamma is also detected with HER-2/neu protein in mammary tumor-derived cell lines. This suggests that the deregulation of AP-2 is the preceding pathogenic event and probably the pivotal one in this type of mammary carcinogenesis. We examined the process of AP-2alpha gene expression in mammary carcinoma cell lines to identify where the aberration had occurred. We found no amplification of the AP-2alpha gene. Its promoter was marginally upregulated; however, it did not significantly increase the mRNA levels. When the AP-2alpha protein was examined, a remarkable stability was seen in breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-453 and SK-BR-3, with a half-life of over 30 hr. This is sharply higher than the approximate 1 hr observed in mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A and murine cell line NIH 3T3. Treatment of MCF-10A and NIH 3T3 cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 showed that AP-2alpha was ubiquitinated and its level significantly increased. Moreover, this increase was accompanied by elevated levels HER-2/neu protein. In contrast, weaker ubiquitination of AP-2alpha was seen in MDA-MB-453 and SK-BR-3 cancer cells, and MG-132 treatment did not raise the AP-2alpha level any further. These results uncover that unusual stability is the main mechanism that raises the levels of AP-2 proteins, and in addition, provide the first clue that defective ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal-degradation pathway is possibly the prime cause that affects the HER-2/neu gene and culminates in breast cancer."

Therefore, we emphasized on the evaluation of I-PEP and MDA protocols, which shows that the two methods have their relative strengths and weaknesses. In general, the product yield of MDA is higher than that of I-PEP. However, the specificity of the I-PEP products appears to be higher, particularly in the analysis of STR loci. In the analysis of SNP markers, some loci amplify better using products obtained from I-PEP whereas some worked better with MDA. Our analyses also demonstrate that blood spots on FTA cards are a more efficient source of DNA for I-PEP as compared to MDA, especially for STR analysis."

Extracellular matrices can affect cellular proliferation, but their effects on p21 have not been entirely elucidated. Herein, we explore the effects of the matrix glycoprotein fibronectin on p21 expression in human lung carcinoma cells. Our studies show that fibronectin stimulates cell proliferation, and that this effect is associated with suppression of p21 and stimulation of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels in human lung non-small lung cell carcinoma cells (H1838). In contrast, the matrix protein collagen type 1 had no effect. The suppression of p21 by fibronectin was blocked by inhibitors of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (PD98095), and the Rho-kinase pathway (Y-27632). Fibronectin stimulated the phosphorylation of Erk and increased Rho protein expression. To determine the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the inhibitory effects of fibronectin on p21 expression, transient transfection assays were performed with cells expressing a wild-type human p21 promoter construct. In these cells, fibronectin reduced p21 gene promoter activity. Finally, electrophoresis mobility shift experiments revealed that fibronectin decreased nuclear Sp1 binding activity in the promoter region of the p21 gene promoter, and a Sp1 competing oligonucleotide inhibited the fibronectin response. Taken together, our results suggest that fibronectin stimulates lung cancer carcinoma cell growth by reducing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and by inducing cyclin D1 gene expression. The reduction of p21 by fibronectin appears to be mediated through Erk and Rho-kinase signaling and DNA-protein interactions at the Sp1 site in the p21 gene promoter. These observations unveil a novel mechanism for p21 gene regulation by fibronectin in lung carcinoma cell growth that represents a potential target for therapy."

By means of nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and Southern blot analysis of the PCR amplicons, we have shown that Helicobacter spp. DNA is present in human gallstones. In this study we have investigated the possibility of using multiple displacement amplification (MDA) of isolated gallstone DNA and pyrosequencing analysis for the molecular identification of Helicobacter spp.MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA isolated from the nucleus of 33 human gallstones and one control strain were used in a MDA assay. Subsequently, pyrosequencing analysis was performed either directly on MDA-DNA using primers flanking the Helicobacter spp. 16S rDNA variable V3 region or on PCR amplicons derived from broad-range primers flanking the 16S rDNA variable V3, V4, and V9 regions.RESULTS: Pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rDNA derived from MDA-DNA revealed that Helicobacter spp.-like DNA was present in 25 of 33 (approximately 76%) gallstones. Using an H. pylori-specific Southern blot analysis, Helicobacter spp.-like DNA was present in 20 of 33 [approximately 61%] of the gallstones. Using MDA-DNA directly in pyrosequencing analysis, Helicobacter spp.-like DNA was present in 13 of 33 [approximately 39%] gallstones.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that multiple displacement amplification combined with pyrosequencing enables a rapid and accurate molecular typing of Helicobacter spp. from small and precious biopsy specimens."

The APC/C is a 1.5-MDa complex composed of at least 12 different core subunits. At different stages of mitosis and G1, the APC/C associates with a variety of regulatory proteins, such as the activator proteins Cdc20 and Cdh1 and the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which regulate APC/C activity in a substrate-specific manner. Although APC/C and its regulators have been under intense investigation, it is still poorly understood how substrates are recognized and ubiquitinated by the APC/C, why so many subunits are required for these processes, and how regulators of the APC/C control its ubiquitin ligase activity in a substrate-specific manner. This chapter describes a simple and rapid procedure that allows the isolation of APC/C from vertebrate cells and tissues with reasonable purity and at high concentrations, yielding up to 0.5 mg of APC/C. This procedure should facilitate biochemical, biophysical, and structural analyses of the APC/C that will be needed for a better mechanistic understanding of its function and regulation."

Estrogen receptors alpha and beta regulate production of VEGF in both breast and endometrial cancer cells. Alternative splicing of ER-alpha mRNA generates a mixture of transcripts with various exon deletions in normal breast and breast cancer cells and some of these variants are overexpressed in breast cancer. We analyzed the role of exon-deleted variants of ER-alpha in regulation of VEGF production by simultaneous transient transfection of CHO and MDA-MB-231 cells with a VEGF promoter luciferase construct. Estrogen (10 nM) treatment resulted in a 6-fold increase in luciferase activity in cells transfected with the exon 3 deleted variant (ERDelta3) compared to a 2-fold activity induction in cells transfected with wild type ER-alpha. Exon 5 and exon 7 deleted variants were unable to induce activation of the VEGF promoter. Using specific deletion constructs of the VEGF promoter linked to luciferase, we showed that the majority of activation by ERDelta3 was restricted to the -70 to -88 bp fragment that contains two Sp1 sites. Site-directed mutagenesis of both Sp1 sites indicated that ERDelta3 activates the VEGF promoter through interaction with Sp1 proteins. ERDelta3, a variant frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, may significantly contribute to the production of VEGF thus resulting in enhanced tumor growth in vivo."

As an experimental system, we used human medullary breast carcinoma because of its heavy B lymphocytic infiltration paralleled to a relatively better prognosis. Ig-rearranged V region V(H)-J(H), Vkappa-Jkappa, and Vlambda-Jlambda genes, amplified by RT-PCR of the infiltrating B cells, were cloned, sequenced, and subjected to a comparative DNA analysis. A combinatorial single-chain variable fragment Ab minilibrary was constructed out of randomly selected V(H) and Vkappa clones and tested for binding activity. Our data analysis revealed that some of the V(H)-J(H), Vkappa-Jkappa, and Vlambda-Jlambda region sequences were being assigned to clusters with oligoclonal predominance, while other characteristics of the Ab repertoire were defined also. A tumor-restricted binder clone could be selected out of the single-chain variable fragment kappa minilibrary tested against membrane fractions of primary breast tumor cells and tumor cell lines, the V(H) of which proved to be the overexpressed V(H)3-1 cluster. The specific binding was confirmed by FACS analysis with primary breast carcinoma cells and MDA-MB 231 cell line. ELISA and thin layer chromatography dot-blot experiments showed this target Ag to be a ganglioside D3 (GD3).

ESC is phosphorylated in vivo, but the region of ESC that is phosphorylated and its consequences are not known. Here, we show that the amino-terminal region of ESC (residues 1-60) mediates its phosphorylation and dimerization. Phosphorylation of ESC1-60 in vitro by CK1 and CK2 strongly enhances its dimerization. Both phosphorylation and dimerization are conserved in the mammalian ESC homolog EED, suggesting that they play important roles in vivo. One role is suggested by the effect of phosphatase treatment on native ESC complexes, which does not affect the integrity of the 600 kDa ESC/E(Z) complex, but eliminates the 1 MDa ESC/E(Z) complex, which is distinguished from the former by the presence of the additional subunits PCL and RPD3. Thus, stability and perhaps assembly of larger ESC complexes may depend on ESC phosphorylation."

MDA is reported to yield large quantities of high-quality DNA. The applicability of MDA to single cells was recently demonstrated as a potential technique for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This paper shows the first clinical application of MDA in PGD. Two cycles of PGD were performed in two diseases, resulting in two pregnancies. All the diagnoses given on blastomeres were confirmed on the non-transferred whole embryos. The blastomere diagnosis was coupled with short tandem repeat (STR) analysis (16 loci) in all cycles. Allelic drop-out (ADO) assessment and amplification efficiency were evaluated on 40 single lymphocytes derived from parents of each disease. ADO and amplification failure were 10.3 and 2.2% for beta-thalassaemia and 17.9 and 2.2% for cystic fibrosis respectively. HLA matching for A, B and DR was performed successfully on single cell for the beta-thalassaemia family using similar methods to genomic DNA. The PGD protocol used in all diseases consists of MDA amplification, followed by a standard polymerase chain reaction protocol. Although HLA matching was not applied to embryos, its feasibility was shown on single cell DNA amplified by MDA. Altogether, these data show the simplicity and reliability of performing PGD in combination with HLA matching and STR analysis using MDA."

Herein we characterize a novel gene at chromosome 22q13.31 designated PRR5.

In vitro transcription/translation demonstrated that the five variants generate three protein isoforms differing in their N-terminal length. Mutational analysis of PRR5 in human breast and colorectal tumors did not reveal somatic mutations. However, mRNA expression analyses revealed PRR5 overexpression in a majority of colorectal tumors but substantial downregulation of PRR5 expression in a subset of breast tumors and reduced expression in two breast cancer cell lines. Treatment with trichostatin A increased PRR5 mRNA levels in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced expression in MDA-MB-231 cells only. Thus, PRR5 may represent a potential candidate tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer."

Administration of the humanized anti-PTHrP mAb significantly suppressed osteolytic bone metastasis of MDA-5a and caused osteogenesis at the sites of metastasis.CONCLUSION: The humanized anti-PTHrP mAb was effective against bone metastasis by inducing osteogenesis and, therefore, will provide a new treatment option for bone metastasis in breast cancer."

The genetic basis of DM1 consists of a mutational expansion of a repetitive trinucleotide sequence (CTG). The number of triplets expansion divides patients in four categories related to the molecular changes (E1, E2, E3, E4). The pathogenic mechanisms of multi-systemic involvement of DM1 are still unclear. DM1 has been suspected to be due to premature aging, that is known to be sustained by increased free radicals levels and/or decreased antioxidants activities in neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, the gain-of-function at RNA level hypothesis has gained great attention, but oxidative stress might act in the disease progression. We have investigated 36 DM1 patients belonging to 22 unrelated families, 10 patients with other myotonic disorders (OMD) and 22 age-matched healthy controls from the clinical, biochemical and molecular point of view. Biochemical analysis detected blood levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonilaldehyde (MDA), vitamin E (Vit E), hydroxyl radicals (OH) and total antioxidant system (TAS). Results revealed that DM1 patients showed significantly higher levels of SOD (+40%; MAL (+57%; RAD 2 (+106%; and TAS (+20%; than normal controls. Our data support the hypothesis of a pathogenic role of oxidative stress in DM1 and therefore confirm the detrimental role played by free radicals in this pathology and suggest the opportunity to undertake clinical trials with antioxidants in this disorder."

We previously reported that natural and synthetic progestins (P) increased VEGF mRNA and protein levels in progesterone receptor (PR) containing T47-D human breast cancer cells in a PR dependent manner, but not in PR positive ZR-75 and MCF-7, or in PR negative MDA-MB-231 cells. This indicated that factors beside PR are involved in progesterone-dependent VEGF regulation. We, therefore, tested additional tumor cell lines reported to contain PR for progestin-dependent VEGF induction. Out of nine PR-positive breast tumor cell lines, progestins induced VEGF in three cell lines that lack wild-type p53 (T47-D, BT-474, and HCC-1428) but not in cell lines that contained the wild-type p53 protein. The T47-D and BT-474 cells express mutant p53, while the p53 protein is absent HCC-1428 cells. The anti-progestin RU-486 blocked progestin-dependent induction of VEGF in T47-D and BT-474 cells but not in HCC-1428 cells. However, RU-486 partially blocked medroxyprogesterone acetate-dependent induction of VEGF in HCC-1428 cells. Estrogen receptor (ER) and PR agonists and antagonists also induce VEGF in HCC-1428 cells and this effect was partially blocked by anti-estrogen ICI-182, 780. Progestin-dependent VEGF induction was completely inhibited by PRIMA-1-activated p53 in all cell-types, but progestin-dependent transcription of a progesterone-regulated minimal promoter was only partially inhibited. PRIMA-1 induced activation of p53 in tumor cell lines was confirmed with a p53-responsive p21 reporter plasmid and by detecting increased levels of p21 proteins in cell lysates. PRIMA-1 induced p53 protein in the HCC-1428 cells while levels of mutant p53 protein in T47-D and BT-474 remained unaltered. Progestin-dependent induction of VEGF was also inhibited by stable transfection of wild-type p53 in T47-D cells. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that wild-type p53 blocks progestin-dependent induction of VEGF in breast cancer cells and this may be a novel anti-angiogenic mechanism for controlling the growth of progestin-dependent tumors."

However, pharmacologic concentrations of 2MEO bind to estrogen receptors (ER). We have therefore examined the ER activity of 2MEO.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Estrogenic actions of 2MEO were evaluated by changes in gene expression of the ER-positive (MCF7) breast tumor cell line and, in vivo, estrogenicity was assessed in breast tumor xenograft models and by measuring endocrine responses in uterus and liver.RESULTS: In the ER-positive breast tumor cell line (MCF7), microarray experiments revealed that 269 of 279 changes in gene expression common to 2MEO and estradiol were prevented by the ER antagonist, ICI 182,780. Changes in the expression of selected genes and their sensitivity to inhibition by ICI 182,780 were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR measurement. Activation of ER in MCF7 cells by 2MEO was further confirmed by stimulation of an estrogen response element-dependent reporter gene that was blocked by ICI 182,780 (1 micromol/L). Doses of 2MEO (15-150 mg/kg) that had no antitumor efficacy in either nu/nu BALB/c or severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing ER-negative MDA-MB-435 tumors had uterotropic and hepatic estrogen-like actions. In female nu/nu BALB/c mice inoculated with the estrogen-dependent MCF7 tumor cells, 2MEO (50 mg/kg/d) supported tumor growth.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor growth enhancement by 2MEO at doses generating serum levels (100-500 nmol/L) that have estrogenic activity suggests that a conservative approach to the further clinical evaluation of this agent should be adopted and that its evaluation in breast cancer is inappropriate."

The major histocompatibility complex class II was found down-regulated in highly metastatic cells and correlated with MHC transactivator (CIITA) expression. Constitutive CIITA expression observed in poorly metastatic is driven by promoters III and IV of CIITA gene. Conversely, both promoters were ineffective in highly metastatic cells. The MHC class II and CIITA expression was restored in these cells upon stimulation with IFNgamma or by the treatment with a hypomethylating agent. Both treatments induced USF-1 and IRF binding complexes to promoter IV but only IFNgamma induced the binding of 435-Lung2 nuclear proteins to an ARE-1 site at the promoter III. Neither Southern blot nor bisulfite sequencing of promoter IV demonstrated strong hypermethylation of this promoter at the IFNgamma-responsive elements such as GAS, E-box or IRF-1. We suggest that partial or hemimethylation of promoter IV is sufficient to silence the CIITA expression in highly metastatic cells and that this epigenetic mechanism is responsible for the lack of MHC-II expression. Forced CIITA expression restored the MHC-II antigen expression in 435-Lung2 cells and abrogates spontaneous lung metastasis in both SCID and nude mice but also affected the tumorigenicity in nude mice. The increase in NK cell infiltration in nude mice bearing CIITA-tumors correlated with sign of tumor cell apoptosis and the increase in the number of NK cells in the spleens, suggesting that NK cells might be responsible for the observed antitumor activity."

Several liprin mutants have weaker binding to LAR as assessed by yeast interaction trap assays, and the extents of in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation of these mutants were reduced relative to that of wild-type liprin-alpha1. Treatment of liprin-alpha1 with calf intestinal phosphatase weakened its interaction with the recombinant GST-LAR protein. A liprin LH region mutant that inhibited liprin phosphorylation did not bind to LAR as assessed by coprecipitation studies. Endogenous LAR was shown to bind phosphorylated liprin-alpha1 from MDA-486 cells labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate. In further characterizing the phosphorylation of liprin, we found immunoprecipitates of liprin-alpha1 expressed in COS-7 cells to incorporate phosphate after washes of up to 4 M NaCl. Additionally, purified liprin-alpha1 derived from Sf-9 insect cells retained the ability to incorporate phosphate in in vitro phosphorylation assays, and a liprin-alpha1 truncation mutant incorporated phosphate after denaturation and/or renaturation in SDS gels. Finally, binding assays showed that liprin binds to ATP-agarose and that the interaction is challenged by free ATP, but not by free GTP. Moreover, liprin LH region mutations that inhibit liprin phosphorylation stabilized the association of liprin with ATP-agarose. Taken together, our results suggest that liprin autophosphorylation regulates its association with LAR."

To identify a molecular basis for acquired 2-methoxyestradiol resistance, we generated a stable 2-methoxyestradiol-resistant (2ME2R) MDA-MB-435 human cancer cell line by stepwise exposure to increasing 2-methoxyestradiol concentrations. 2ME2R cells maintained in the presence of the drug and W435 cells maintained in the absence of the drug showed 32.34- to 40.07-fold resistance to 2-methoxyestradiol. Cross-resistance was observed to Vinca alkaloids, including vincristine, vinorelbine, and vinblastine (4.29- to 6.40-fold), but minimal resistance was seen to colchicine-binding agents including colchicine, colcemid, and AVE8062A (1.72- to 2.86-fold). No resistance was observed to paclitaxel and epothilone B, polymerizing agents (0.89- to 1.14-fold). Genomic sequencing identified two different heterozygous point mutations in the class I (M40) isotype of beta-tubulin at amino acids 197 (Dbeta197N) and 350 (Kbeta350N) in 2ME2R cells. Tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of both wild-type and the mutant beta-tubulin in 2ME2R cells at the protein level. Consistently, treatment of parental P435 cells with 2-methoxyestradiol resulted in a dose-dependent depolymerization of microtubules, whereas 2ME2R cells remained unaffected. In contrast, paclitaxel affected both cell lines. In the absence of 2-methoxyestradiol, 2ME2R cells were characterized by an elevated level of detyrosination. Upon 2-methoxyestradiol treatment, levels of acetylated and detyrosinated tubulins decreased in P435 cells, while remaining constant in 2ME2R cells. These results, together with our structure-based modeling, show a tight correlation between the antitubulin and antiproliferative effects of 2-methoxyestradiol, consistent with acquired tubulin mutations contributing to 2-methoxyestradiol resistance."

Inactivation of proapoptotic genes, or activation of survival signaling, leads to chemoresistance. Activator protein 2alpha (AP-2alpha), a developmentally regulated sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor, has been shown to function like a tumor suppressor. Here, we show that controlled expression of AP-2alpha, using tetracycline-inducible system, increased the chemosensitivity of cancer cells by severalfold by sensitizing cells to undergo apoptosis upon chemotherapy. Under these conditions, neither AP-2alpha expression nor drug treatment resulted in apoptosis induction, whereas in combination the cancer cells underwent massive apoptosis. We found that endogenous AP-2alpha protein is induced posttranscriptionally by various chemotherapeutic drugs. Blocking the endogenous AP-2alpha by small interfering RNA in human cancer cells lead to decreased apoptosis, increased colony formation, and chemoresistance irrespective of their p53 status upon chemotherapy. We further show that 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced reexpression of AP-2alpha in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (wherein AP-2alpha expression is silenced by hypermethylation), resulted in massive apoptosis induction, increased chemosensitivity, decreased colony formation, and loss of tumorigenesis upon chemotherapy. However, in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with AP-2alpha small interfering RNA, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment failed to increase apoptosis and chemosensitivity. The treatment also resulted in increased colony formation and efficient tumor formation upon chemotherapy. These results establish an important role for AP-2alpha in cancer cell chemosensitivity and provide new insights for modifying the chemosensitivity of cancer cells by activating apoptotic pathways."

The oxytocin promoter does not contain an oestrogen response element (ERE), but instead a high-affinity binding site for nuclear orphan receptors. In the present study, the oestrogen-dependent up-regulation of the bovine oxytocin promoter is investigated in MDA-MB 231 cells. Control by oestrogen is shown to be dependent on the integrity of the nuclear orphan receptor binding site and the presence of ligand-activated oestrogen receptor, but independent of oestrogen receptor binding to DNA. Partial agonists tamoxifen and raloxifen and the pure antagonist ICI 182 780 all show agonistic activities on transcription, while exhibiting normal binding affinities to oestrogen receptor (ER)alpha. Nuclear orphan receptors oestrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) and germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF) are expressed to significant levels in MDA-MB 231 cells. Binding of ERRalpha to the oxytocin promoter binding site can be demonstrated, suggesting the involvement of this nuclear orphan receptor in oestrogen-dependent up-regulation. The oestrogenic stimulation of the oxytocin promoter apparently is dependent on the stimulation of the transcriptional activity of this nuclear orphan receptor by ERK-1/ERK-2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases). This novel nonclassical mechanism of oestrogen action most probably is not restricted to the regulation of neuropeptide hormone expression, but may further contribute to the multitude of tissue-specific effects of oestrogenic substances."

In transient transfection experiments, a Her-2/neu promoter bearing a PEA3 site-mutated sequence was not subject to negative regulation by GLA in Her-2/neu-overexpressing cell lines. Concurrent treatments of Her-2/neu-overexpressing cancer cells with GLA and the anti-Her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab led to synergistic increases in apoptosis and reduced growth and colony formation."

We have previously shown the involvement of Sp1 in the up-regulation of urokinase receptor (uPAR) expression, a key molecule in tumor invasion and metastasis. Here, we investigated whether a marked down-regulation of Sp1 activity may inhibit uPAR expression and migration ability of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. To this end, we tested the decoy ability of a novel peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-DNA chimera which carries a central DNA strand, containing Sp1-binding sequence, covalently linked to two PNA fragments at both ends (PNA-DNA-PNA, PDP). The chimera was synthesized, annealed with complementary DNA (PDP-DNA), and then tested for its ability to bind Sp1 both in vitro and in living MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in the presence of urokinase (uPA). This PDP-DNA decoy molecule efficiently competes for the binding to endogenous Sp1 in nuclear extracts, and upon transfection with liposomal vectors, causes a marked decrease of available Sp1 in both untreated and uPA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Accordingly, both uPA-dependent enhancement of uPAR expression and cell migration were strongly reduced in transfected cells. Interestingly, a detectable inhibitory effect is also observed in breast cancer cells exposed to PDP-DNA in the absence of transfection reagents. Finally, the inhibitory effect of PDP-DNA appeared to be stronger than that observed with oligonucleotides carrying Sp1 consensus sequence. Our findings show that this novel PNA-DNA chimera, containing Sp1 consensus sequence, effectively inhibits Sp1 activity, uPAR expression, and motility of breast cancer cells indicating its potential therapeutic use to prevent tumor dissemination."

To this aim, we evaluated the potential of the selected plant extracts to affect proliferation and differentiation of ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which become ERalpha positive after treatment with a decoy molecule against a regulatory region of the human ERalpha gene. All the plant extracts inhibited cell proliferation and showed no effect on ERalpha gene expression, but when they were added in combination with the decoy molecule, a modulatory effect was observed, depending on the extract employed. The extracts exhibiting the greatest effects were those obtained from Aegle marmelos. Gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (GC/ MS) analysis enabled us to identify lupeol, a known triterpenoid, as the major bioactive component of A. marmelos plant extracts. Similar to the Aegle marmelos extracts, lupeol was found to stimulate the decoy effect of RA4 DNA sequence, increasing at a high level ERa gene expression in MDA-MB-231 ERalpha-negative breast cancer cells, and also inhibited cell proliferation."

In the present study, we examined the effects of costunolide on telomerase activity and on the components of telomerase in MCF-7 (wild-type p53) and MDA-MB-231 (mutant p53) cells. We found that costunolide inhibited the growth and telomerase activity of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The expression of hTERT mRNA was also inhibited but hTR mRNA was not. In addition, the bindings of transcription factors in hTERT promoters were significantly decreased in both cells by the treatment of costunolide. These results suggest that costunolide inhibited the growth of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and this effect was mediated at least in part by a significant reduction in telomerase activity."

To date, genome-wide high marker density assessments of MDA-DNA have focussed mainly upon suitability for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping applications. Suitability for short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping has not been investigated in great detail, despite their inherent instability during DNA replication, and the obvious challenge that this presents to WGA techniques. Here, we aimed to assess the applicability of MDA in STR genotyping by conducting a genome-wide scan of 768 STR markers for MDAs of 15 high quality genomic DNAs. We found that MDA genotyping call and accuracy rates were only marginally lower than for genomic DNA. Pooling of three replicate MDAs resulted in a small increase in both call rate and genotyping accuracy. We identified 34 STRs (4.4% of total markers) of which five essentially failed with MDA samples, and 29 of which showed elevated genotyping failures/discrepancies in the MDAs. We emphasise the importance of DNA and MDA quality checks, and the use of appropriate controls to identify problematic STR markers."

The 5.8s DNA of G. tenuifolia was isolated, and the species of this plant was confirmed by NCBI's DNA database. G. tenuifolia was then extracted with ethanol and separated into several fractions using the partition procedure with water, n-butanol, and ethyl acetate (EA). Among these, the EA fraction most significantly affected the activity of DPPH(*) and superoxide anion scavenging. Additionally, only the EA fraction exhibited cytotoxicity on breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and liver cancer cells (Hep G2 and Hep 3B). Next, the EA fraction was further separated by column chromatography, and 15 fractions were obtained. Three effective components were isolated and identified separately from the active fractions: oleanolic acid (OA) from fraction 6, luteolin from fractions 8-10, and luteolin-7-glucoside from fraction 12. The test of these three compounds on scavenging activity of DPPH(*) and superoxide anion indicates that luteolin had the highest antioxidant activity, whereas the effect of OA was negligible. Additionally, a synergistic effect between luteolin and luteolin-7-glucoside was observed. Kick-out experiments showed that the activities were vanished or decreased. Especially on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, the cytotoxicity completely disappeared when luteolin was eliminated from fractions 8-10. These findings demonstrate that luteolin plays a crucial role in the inhibition of the growth of hepatoma cancer cell lines. Fraction 3, which did not contain luteolin, luteolin-7-glucoside, and oleanolic acid, had cytotoxicity on MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, Hep G2, Hep 3B, and A549, which implies that this fraction contained some other effective ingredients and requires further study.

However, the transcriptional regulation of mammaglobin has not been well-characterized. In this report, we used luciferase reporter assays to identify the 200 bp directly 5' of the transcriptional start site as the minimal promoter region of mammaglobin. Sequence scanning indicated that two PEA3 transcription sites were possibly involved in mammaglobin transcription. By transfecting a PEA3 expression vector into breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-415 and MCF-7, we determined that exogenous PEA3 was able to drive transcription. Mutational analysis indicated that each PEA3 site was functional. Our reporter system and electrophorectic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) also identified the involvement of a unique repetitive element in mammaglobin transcription. Finally, AP-1 was determined via luciferase assays to be involved in regulating non-PEA3 dependent transcription.

We have cloned and sequenced the cDNA encoding the complete polypeptide of Aplysia californica hemocyanin (AcH). The cDNA comprises 11,433 bp, encompassing a 5'UTR of 77 bp, a 3'UTR of 1057 bp, and an open reading frame for a signal peptide of 20 amino acids plus a polypeptide of 3412 amino acids (Mr ca. 387 kDa). This polypeptide is the subunit of the cylindrical native hemocyanin (Mr ca. 8 MDa). It comprises eight different functional units (FUs: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) that have been identified immunobiochemically after limited proteolysis of AcH purified from the hemolymph. Each FU shows a highly conserved copper-A and copper-B site for reversible oxygen binding. FU AcH-h carries a specific C-terminal extension of ca. 100 amino acids that include two cysteines that may be utilized for disulfide bridge formation. Potential N-glycosylation sites are present in six FUs but lacking in AcH-b and AcH-c. On the basis of multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees and a statistically firm molecular clock were calculated. The latter suggests that the last common ancestor of Haliotis and Aplysia lived 373+/-47 million years ago, in convincing agreement with fossil records from the early Devonian. However, the gene duplication yielding the two distinct hemocyanin isoforms found today in Haliotis tuberculata occurred 343+/-43 million years ago."

To evaluate the effect of gene therapy for breast cancer by controlling adenovirus replication with human alpha-lactalbumin promoter, we investigated the activity of a 762-bp human alpha-lactalbumin promoter. Alpha-lactalbumin promoter showed significantly higher activity in MDA-MB-435S and T47D breast cancer cells than in normal breast cell lines or other tumor cell lines. We then developed two novel breast cancer-restricted replicative adenoviruses, AdALAE1a and AdE1aALAE1b. In AdALAE1a, expression of adenoviral E1a gene is under the control of alpha-lactalbumin promoter, and in AdE1aALAE1b, expression of both E1a and E1b genes is under the control of a single alpha-lactalbumin promoter. Both breast cancer-restricted replicative adenoviruses showed viral replication efficiency and tumor cell-killing capability similar to wild-type adenovirus in MDA-MB-435S and T47D cells. The replication efficiency and tumor cell-killing capability of both viruses were attenuated significantly in cells that did not support alpha-lactalbumin promoter. AdE1aALAE1b showed better breast cancer-restricted replication than AdALAE1a, suggesting that a transcriptional targeting modality with alpha-lactalbumin promoter controlling both E1a and E1b gene expression is superior to alpha-lactalbumin promoter controlling only E1a gene expression. Importantly, we found that AdE1aALAE1b could be used to target hormone-independent breast tumors in vivo by inhibiting the growth of MDA-MB-435S s.c. tumors. These data showed that alpha-lactalbumin promoter could regulate the replication of adenovirus to target hormone-independent breast cancers, suggesting that alpha-lactalbumin promoter can be used to develop a novel therapeutic modality for hormone-independent breast cancer."

They also may be useful in mosquito control through cytoplasmic incompatibility. To detect and characterize these bacteria in the filarial and mosquito-vectors in French Polynesia, a survey was conducted on field-collected mosquitoes and microfilariae from infected people.

Here we have studied expression and hypoxic regulation of the testis isoenzyme of PFKFB4 in several malignant cell lines from a female organ--the mammary gland. Our studies clearly demonstrated that PFKFB4 mRNA is also expressed in mammary gland malignant cells (MCF-7 and T47D cell lines) in normoxic conditions and that hypoxia strongly induces it expression. To better understand the mechanism of hypoxic regulation of PFKFB4 gene expression, we used dimethyloxalylglycine, a specific inhibitor of HIF-1alpha hydroxylase enzymes, which strongly increases HIF-1alpha levels and mimics the effect of hypoxia. It was observed that PFKFB4 expression in the MCF7 and T47D cell lines was highly responsive to dimethyloxalylglycine, suggesting that the hypoxia responsiveness of PFKFB4 gene in these cell lines is regulated by HIF-1 proteins. Moreover, desferrioxamine and cobalt chloride, which mimic the effect of hypoxia by chelating or substituting for iron, had a similar stimulatory effect on the expression of PFKFB mRNA. In other mammary gland malignant cell lines (BT549, MDA-MB-468, and SKBR-3) hypoxia and hypoxia mimics also induced PFKFB4 mRNA, but to variable degrees. The hypoxic induction of PFKFB4 mRNA was equivalent to the expression of PFKFB3, Glut1, and VEGF, which are known HIF-1-dependent genes. Hypoxia and dimethyloxalylglycine increased the PFKFB4 protein levels in all cell lines studied except MDA-MB-468. Through site-specific mutagenesis in the 5'-flanking region of PFKFB4 gene the hypoxia response could be limited. Thus, this study provides evidence that PFKFB4 gene is also expressed in mammary gland cancer cells and strongly responds to hypoxia via an HIF-1alpha dependent mechanism. Moreover, the PFKFB4 and PFKFB3 gene expression in mammary gland cancer cells has also a significant role in the Warburg effect which is found in all malignant cells."

In contrast, when human lymphoma U937 and Jurkat cells were treated with Pc 4-PDT, staurosporine (STS) or UVC, Mcl-1 was cleaved to generate a 28-kDa fragment over a 2-4 h period. The cleavage of Mcl-1 was accompanied by the activation of caspases-3, -9, and -8. The broad-specificity caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk completely blocked Mcl-1 cleavage induced by PDT, STS or UVC, providing evidence for Mcl-1 as a substrate for caspases. Western blot analysis localized Mcl-1 to mitochondria, ER, and cytosol of both MCF-7c3 and U937 cells, suggesting that Mcl-1 protein, unlike Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, is not a target for Pc 4-PDT, probably due to its localization to sites removed from those of Pc 4 binding. The 28-kDa cleaved fragment of Mcl-1, which has proapoptotic activity, was produced in PDT-treated lymphoid-derived cells, but not in cells of epithelial origin, suggesting that PDT-induced rapid and extensive apoptosis in lymphoma cells may result in part from the sensitivity of their Mcl-1 to caspase cleavage, removing an important negative control on apoptosis."

C57BL mice and saline-injected ICR mice were used as the respective non-diabetic controls. To assess oxidative damage, plasma malonedialdehyde (MDA), urine 8-isoprostane and 8-hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured. The mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx-1) in the kidney and heart were quantified using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. The KKAy mice demonstrated moderate hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, and the STZ mice showed severe hyperglycemia and hypolipidemia. The KKAy mice, but not the STZ mice, showed elevated plasma MDA relative to the non-diabetic controls. Urine 8-isoprostane and 8-OHdG in both diabetic mouse groups increased significantly.

To investigate the role of human antibodies in regulating tumor cell growth, we constructed a recombinant cDNA expression library of human IgG Fab from a patient with breast cancer. Clones were screened from the library with breast tumor cell lysate. Sequence analysis of the clones showed somatic hypermutations when compared to their closest VH/VL germ-line genes. Initial characterizations focused on five clones. All tested clones displayed stronger binding to antigen derived from primary breast cancers and established breast cancer cell lines than to normal breast tissues. In vitro functional studies showed that four out of five tested clones could stimulate the growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, and one out of five was able to promote MCF-7 cell growth as well. Involvement of ERK2 pathway was observed. By 1H-NMR spectra and Western blot analysis, it was evident that two tested antibody Fabs are capable of interacting with sialic acid. Our study suggests a possible role for human antibody in promoting tumor cell growth by direct binding of IgG Fab to breast tumor antigen. Such studies prompt speculation regarding the role of serum antibodies in mediating tumor growth as well as their contribution to disease progression."

In three independent experiments, NIH3T3, IMR90 and MDA MB 435 cells were infected with pLPC retroviruses carrying the adenovirus 12S E1A gene or the GFP gene. We analyzed cDNA expression by using the CNIO OncoChipTM, a cDNA microarray containing a total of 6386 genes represented by 7237 clones. uPA, uPAr, tPA, PAI-1 and PAI-2 were also studied at RNA and protein levels. Microarrays of cDNA expression, RT-PCR and Western blot performed in IMR90 E1A-expressing cells showed downregulation of uPA, uPAr, tPA, PAI-1 and upregulation of PAI-2. These results were confirmed in NIH3T3 and MDA MB 435 breast carcinoma cells, with PAI-2 upregulation by RT-PCR and Western blot. In addition, zymographic analysis demonstrated that E1A expression greatly reduced the gelatinase activity of the pro-MMP2 and -MMP9 proteins.

We examined the effect of antisense (AS) Bcl-2 in combination with anticancer drug for targeting therapy against Bcl-2 in gastric and breast cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One human gastric cancer cell line (MKN-45) and three breast cancer cell lines (BT-474, ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-231) were examined. The effects of antisense Bcl-2 phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (AS ODNs: 18 mer) on chemosensitivity were tested in vitro and in vivo. Chemosensitivity was evaluated by the MTT assay, and the antitumor effect assessed in vivo by the success of xenograft transplantation into nude mice.RESULTS: Treatment with AS Bcl-2 ODNs resulted in sequence-specific reduction in protein expression, which was compared to controls. Treatment of MKN-45 cells with AS Bcl-2 increased sensitivity to adriamycin (ADM), cisplatin (CDDP), and paclitaxel (PTX) in vitro and in vivo. Similarly, treatment of BT-474, ZR-75-1, and MDA-MB-231 cells with AS Bcl-2 increased chemosensitivity to ADM, mitomycin C (MMC), PTX, and docetaxel (DOC). This occurred in the setting of increased Bax and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, as well as decreased Bcl-2 and pAkt. AS Bcl-2 ODNs induced splenomegaly in association with increased serum IL-12, expression of CD80, CD83, CD86, and CD27, which was attenuated by methylation of the CpG-motifs of AS Bcl-2, suggesting the involvement of immunomodulatory effect of AS Bcl-2 through pDC and B cell although methylated CpG-failed to negate the increased antitumor effect of AS Bcl-2.CONCLUSION: Targeted therapy against Bcl-2 protein using AS ODNs might enhance the effects of chemotherapy in patients with gastric and breast cancer."

The temporal expression of zSeBP in the hemocytes was measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR after scallops were stimulated by either oxidative stress or microbial challenge. The expression of zSeBP was up-regulated progressively after stimulation, and then dropped gradually to the original level. Meanwhile, malondialdehyde (MDA) measured by the colorimetric method in the microbial challenged scallops increased immediately after scallops was challenged by microbes, and was significantly higher than that in the control scallops. Results indicated that the microbial infection could incense the disorder of oxidation/reduction and may result in high MDA production. The negative correlation between the expression level of zSeBP and the MDA content suggested that zSeBP could play an important role in mediating the anti-oxidation mechanisms and immune response in marine invertebrates."

Paracrine factors secreted by the metastatic cancer cells are thought to mediate these events. We previously isolated a novel bone metastasis-related factor (MDA-BF-1) from bone marrow aspirate samples from patients with prostate cancer and bone metastasis, and found that this factor stimulated osteoblast differentiation, possibly by interacting with a receptor on the osteoblasts. Identifying this putative MDA-BF-1 receptor biochemically requires the expression of MDA-BF-1 for receptor binding assays and for the preparation of a ligand-affinity column. We tagged MDA-BF-1 with a peptide containing a protein kinase A phosphorylation site plus a 7-histidine sequence to facilitate the labeling of MDA-BF-1 for receptor binding assay and the binding of MDA-BF-1 to an immobilized metal affinity column. The recombinant MDA-BF-1 protein (MDA-BF1-kinase-his) was expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system. About 0.8 mg of purified MDA-BF1-kinase-his protein was obtained from 4 x 10(8) Sf9 cells. MDA-BF1-kinase-his can be phosphorylated by PKA with a specific activity around 10(5)cpm/mug protein. Receptor binding assays using this (32)P-labeled MDA-BF-1 showed that MDA-BF-1 bound to membranes prepared from Saos-2, an osteosarcoma cell line, and C2C12, a mouse pluripotent mesenchymal precursor cell line that can be induced to become osteoblast by BMP-2. In contrast, MDA-BF-1 did not bind to membranes from PC-3 human prostate cancer cells or HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells. These observations suggest that the MDA-BF-1 receptor is expressed in cells of osteoblastic lineage. In addition to its use as a ligand for receptor binding assays, a ligand affinity column can be prepared by binding MDA-BF1-kinase-his to an IMAC for the purification of MDA-BF-1 receptor."

We show here that TReP-132 plays a role in the control of cell proliferation. In human HeLa cells, TReP-132 knockdown by using small interfering RNA resulted in increased G(1)--&gt;S cell cycle progression. The growth-inhibitory effects of TReP-132 was further shown to be mediated by induction of G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(WAF1) (p21) and p27(KIP1) (p27) expression levels. As a consequence, G(1) cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase activities and pRB phosphorylation were markedly reduced, and cell cycle progression was blocked in the G(1) phase. The stimulatory effect of TReP-132 on p21 and p27 gene transcription involved interaction of TReP-132 with the transcription factor Sp1 at proximal Sp1-binding sites in their promoters. Moreover, in different breast tumor cell lines, endogenous TReP-132 expression was positively related with a lower proliferation rate. In addition, TReP-132 knockdown resulted in enhanced cell proliferation and lowered p21 and p27 mRNA levels in the steroid-responsive and nonresponsive T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, respectively. Finally, a statistic profiling of human breast tumor samples highlighted that expression of TReP-132 is correlated with p21 and p27 levels and is associated with lower tumor incidence and aggressiveness. Together, these results identify TReP-132 as a basal cell cycle regulatory protein acting, at least in part, by interacting with Sp1 to activate the p21 and p27 gene promoters."

One hundred six isolates were selected from 278,308 Salmonella isolates based on resistance to ampicillin and cephalosporins and were subjected to further characterization. Nine isolates had a cefoxitin inhibition diameter &lt; or = 17 mm and were proven to be AmpC positive by multiplex PCR. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of bla(DHA-1), bla(CMY-2), and bla(CMY-4) genes. All nine isolates presented different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis restriction profiles. The AmpC genetic determinants were present in transferable plasmids of around 11, 42, 70, 98, and 99 MDa. A combination of size and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis showed that all the bla(CMY) plasmids investigated in our study were different, which suggests that bla(CMY) may be located in different plasmid environments. Some United Kingdom isolates linked to foreign travel showed RFLP plasmid patterns consistent with plasmids previously seen in the United States, which suggests that bla(CMY-2) has also been disseminated through plasmid transfer. The fact that two of the domestically acquired United Kingdom isolates presented previously unseen RFLP plasmid patterns could indicate that these strains have followed routes different from those prevalent in North America or other parts of the world. This study represents the first report of bla(CMY) genes in Salmonella isolates in the United Kingdom and the first report of CMY-4 in Salmonella enterica serotype Senftenberg worldwide."

Accordingly, considerable efforts are now being directed toward development and use of vectors capable of replicating in cancer cells. However, for replicating retroviruses, insertion of additional reading frames into the viral genome often resulted in the generation of unstable viruses. Here, we report a novel concept for the generation of replication-competent murine leukemia virus (MLV) vectors capable of mediating the secretion of soluble therapeutic proteins from infected cells. As a proof of principle, we inserted transgene regions encoding either a single-chain variable region fragment (scFv), here, the laminin-specific L36-scFv, or the T-cell-specific 7A5-scFv, or the cytokine GM-CSF into the MLV envelope (env) gene after +1 codon of the envelope (Env) protein, followed by a sequence specifying a furin protease cleavage site. The resulting viruses, termed L36-furin-A, 7A5-furin-A and GMCSF-furin-Mo, respectively, infected a variety of human cell lines, including HMEC-1 (endothelial), A301 (lymphoid), MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 (breast cancer) and HT1080 (fibrosarcoma) cells. Western blot analysis of conditioned culture medium from HT1080 cells infected by replicating L36-furin A, as an example, revealed that more than 90% of the Env fusion protein molecules were indeed intracellularly cleaved. After 5 days of infection, up to 3-4 mug/ml of soluble L36-scFv accumulated in the supernatant of HT1080 cells. The eukaryotically produced L36-scFv and 7A5-scFv were able to recognize their native antigens with high avidity, as assessed by ELISA and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the replicating viruses were genetically stable for more than 12 cell passages. In conclusion, a new generation of replication-competent retroviral vectors capable of mediating long-term and efficient secretion of therapeutic proteins suitable for cancer therapy was generated."

These cells, isolated from early lung metastasis, displayed increased anchorage independent growth in vitro and when transplanted ortho-topically into nude mice showed accelerated tumor growth rate and early lung spontaneous metastasis when compared to its parental counterpart. These cells, designated as MDA-MB-435-F-L, also showed intense wide spread early skeletal metastasis in vertebrae, mandible, femur, tibia and skull as detected by fluorescence imaging in an experimental bone metastasis model. Gene expression profiles from cDNA microarray showed up or downregulation of the expression of several significant genes regulating angiogenesis, apoptosis, ECM remodeling and metastasis in the MDA-MB-435-F-L cells in comparison to the parental cells. Among the up or downregulated genes, some have also been implicated in the survival of breast cancer patients. As such, the candidate genes selected in this breast cancer progression model system may serve as biomarkers of metastatic progression and also as potential tumor targets for breast cancer therapy."

We analyzed gene expression in 11 BCC lines among which 6 had already been extensively studied (BT-474, Hs578T, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, T-47D) and 5 were still poorly characterized (Evsa-T, IBEP-1, IBEP-2, IBEP-3, KPL-1). Some data obtained were verified or extended by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR), Northern blotting, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and cell growth studies. Clustering analysis of the low-density microarray data allowed the sorting of BCC lines into two classes and supported a major discriminatory role for ER alpha, confirming data from previous studies. A few genes that are highly and specifically expressed in one cell line were identified, such as MGB1 (mammaglobin 1) in Evsa-T cells, and PIP (prolactin-inducible protein) in MDA-MB-453 BCC, suggesting an apocrine origin for these latter cells. Two BCC lines (IBEP-1 and IBEP-3) that had been previously characterized as ER alpha-negative, were classified by the low-density microarray among ER alpha-positive lines (MCF-7, T-47D, IBEP-2, BT-474, KPL-1) and were indeed confirmed as receptor-positive (at both mRNA and protein levels) and hormone-responsive cells. In conclusion, our results support the utility of a low-density microarray approach in cases where the cost and exhaustiveness of high-density microarrays may constitute a drawback; for instance, in obtaining a rapid phenotype evaluation in cell populations freshly isolated from breast tumors."

The genomic organization was found to be similar to that of hST8Sia I and hST8Sia V. Transcriptional expression analysis showed that the newly identified gene was constitutively expressed at low levels in various human tissues and cell lines. We have isolated a full-length cDNA clone from the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 that encoded a type II membrane protein of 398 amino acid residues with the conserved motifs of sialyltransferases. We have established a mammary cell line (MDA-MB-231) stably transfected with the full-length hST8Sia VI and the analysis of sialylated carbohydrate structures expressed at the cell surface clearly indicated the disappearance of Neu5Acalpha2-3-sialylated structures. The transient expression of a truncated soluble form of the enzyme in either COS-7 cells or insect Sf-9 cells led to the production of an active enzyme in which substrate specificity was determined. Detailed substrate specificity analysis of the hST8Sia VI recombinant enzyme in vitro, revealed that this enzyme required the trisaccharide Neu5Acalpha2-3Galbeta1-3GalNAc (where Neu5Ac is N-acetylneuraminic acid and GalNAc is N-acetylgalactosamine) to generate diSia (disialic acid) motifs specifically on O-glycans."

Transient transfection of ERbeta cDNA into cells can decrease the estrogen-like properties of the ERalpha:tamoxifen complex, whereas an increase in the amount of ERbeta is associated with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. We have addressed each of these hypotheses by examining well characterized laboratory models. We determined whether changes in endogenous ERbeta are responsible for the estrogen-like or antiestrogenic properties of tamoxifen or raloxifene in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with cDNAs for ERalpha or mutants D351G, D351Y. We found that the amount of ERbeta mRNA in separate, stable transfectants of mutant ERalpha cDNA was always &lt; 2% of ERalpha. Since at least a 50:50 mixture of ERalpha:ERbeta is needed to silence the tamoxifen:ERalpha complex, we conclude that insufficient ERbeta mRNA is available for selective ER modulation in stable transfectants of D351G and D351Y ERalpha. Similarly, to test the hypothesis that ERbeta is up-regulated and plays an important role during the development of tamoxifen-stimulated tumor growth, we quantitatively analyzed ERbeta and ERalpha mRNA in tamoxifen-naïve (MCF-7:E2, ECC1:E2) and tamoxifen-stimulated tumors (MCF-7:TAM, EnCa 101:TAM). We found that ERbeta mRNA levels were not significantly elevated in tamoxifen-stimulated tumors and the ERalpha mRNA remained over 99% out of all ER species for all the tumors tested. The same results were also obtained when mRNA levels of ERbeta and ERalpha in a series of tamoxifen-naïve and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer was analyzed. We conclude that endogenous ERbeta may not play a dominant role in the modulation of the tamoxifen ERalpha complex, or in the development of tamoxifen-stimulated resistant tumor growth."

The human FGFRs share a high degree of sequence homology between themselves, as well as with their murine homologs. Consequently, it has been suggested that it may be difficult to prepare monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that are specific for the individual receptor types. In this communication, we report on the development and characterization of a panel of anti-human FGFR4 MAbs that were generated in mice using a rapid immunization protocol. Using a modified rapid immunization at multiple sites (RIMMS) protocol with the soluble extracellular domain of human FGFR4 (FGFR4-ECD), the immunized mice developed high levels of polyclonal IgG to the immunogen within 13 days of the first immunization. The lymph node cells isolated from the immunized animals were then fused with mouse myeloma cells for hybridoma generation. Use of an efficient hybridoma cloning protocol in combination with an ELISA screening procedure allowed for early identification of stable hybridomas secreting antihuman FGFR4 IgG. Several identified MAbs specifically reacted with the FGFR4 protein without binding to the other human isoforms (FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3). As evaluated by BIAcore analysis, most anti-FGFR4 MAbs displayed high affinities (8.6 x 10(8) approximately 3.9 x 10(10) M) to FGFR4. Furthermore, these MAbs were able to bind to FGFR4 expressed on human breast tumor cell lines MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the RIMMS strategy is an effective approach for generating class-switched, high-affinity MAbs in mice to evolutionarily conserved proteins such as human FGFR4. These MAbs may be useful tools for further investigation of the biological functions and pathological roles of human FGFR4."

In Turkey, canine hepatozoonosis was reported for the first time in 1933. In the present study, serum glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and ceruloplasmin levels were analysed in 14 dogs infected with Hepatozoon canis as well as in 10 healthy dogs. Blood smears were prepared from peripheral blood and ticks were collected for identification in the laboratory. Rhipicephalus sanguineus was found only on diseased dogs. No ticks were observed on healthy dogs. The diagnosis of H. canis is made mainly by the detection of gametocytes within neutrophils and monocytes. The haematological diagnosis was confirmed using PCR analyses by amplifying a partial 18S rRNA gene sequence of Hepatozoon spp. Infection was detected in 14 animals. Compared to controls, the serum GSH, MDA and NO levels in infected animals increased significantly (p&lt;0.05, &lt;0.01 for MDA), whereas the concentrations of ceruloplasmin in diseased animals remained unaltered. The results of the present study suggest that in dogs infected with H. canis increased levels of GSH, MDA and NO may be related to host's defences against parasitic infection."

Microarray and real-time PCR experiments showed an overexpression of this serine protease inhibitor in the metastatic tumors (M-4A4T) and its derived metastases (M4-Mets) compared with the weakly metastatic tumors (NM-2C5T), and its release into the blood was confirmed by western-blotting. However, functional assays in vivo using genetically engineered tumor cells demonstrated that ACT up-regulation was not, by itself, responsible for the metastatic phenotype. We also made observations that ACT gene regulation was sensitive to tumor-host interactions: inoculation of these lines into the mouse mammary gland greatly increased ACT production and accentuated the intrinsic difference observed when they are cultured in vitro. Sensitivity of tumor cells to their environment was further analyzed by in vitro experiments, which demonstrated that a purified ECM environment and soluble components from normal host mammary cells were both able to significantly promote ACT expression. In addition, we took advantage of the xenogeneic nature of the model to measure ACT expression by the host cells (mouse) and the tumor cells (human) within the neoplasm using species-specific primers in real-time PCR experiments. It was found that the presence of tumor cells, irrespective of their metastatic capabilities, induced local ACT production by host cells at the primary and secondary tumor sites. Thus, this work indicates that there is a specific association of ACT overexpression with the metastatic phenotype in our breast cancer metastasis model. Moreover, because of the xenogeneic nature of our system, we were able to provide evidence of tumor-host reciprocal regulation of ACT production."

The current study investigated the impact of Com-1 on oestrogen regulated cell growth of breast cancer cells and explored the potential link between Com-1 and ER-beta.METHOD: Full length Com-1 cDNA was isolated from normal mammary tissues. Ribozyme transgenes that specifically targeted human Com-1 were constructed using the pEF6/V5-His vector. Expression of Com-1 was assessed at both mRNA and protein levels. Interaction of Com-1 with other candidate molecules was studied using immunoprecipitation and Western blotting.RESULTS: Elimination of Com-1 by way of ribozyme transgenes results in breast cancer cells with increased rate of growth and increased invasive potential. In contrast, over-expression of Com-1 in the cancer cells had an opposite effect. In ER-alpha-negative/ER-beta positive MDA MB-231 cells, elimination of Com-1 caused more vigorous growth in response to 17-beta-estradiol. However, the effect of Com-1 modification on MCF-7, which is positive for both ER-alpha and ER-beta, was less clear. Protein interaction analysis has indicated that the Com-1 and ER-beta were mutually co-precipitated with each other in breast cancer cells. Immunocytochemical staining revealed that Com-1 was primarily present in the nucleus, with some degree of cytoplasmic staining, and that the distribution of Com-1 was identical to that of ER-beta. 17-Beta-estradiol stimulation resulted in reduction of nucleic staining of Com-1. This reduction of nucleic Com-1 can be reverted when ubiquitin inhibitor, ubiquitin aldehyde or the lactacystin proteosome inhibitor was present, suggesting a pivotal role of the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway in the Com-1/ER-beta complex.CONCLUSION: Com-1 plays a tumour suppressor role in breast cancer cells and is involved in oestrogen-regulated cell growth. This action is potentially exerted by interacting with ER-beta, in human breast cancer cells. The fate of Com-1 can be dually regulated by oestrogen and ubiquitin pathway."

We investigated the interaction between flavopiridol and gemcitabine in two human breast cancer cell lines. Experimental design. MCF-7 [Estrogen receptor (ER) positive] and MDA-MB-231 cells (ER negative) were treated with sub-cytotoxic concentrations of gemcitabine (G), flavopiridol (F), and flavopiridol followed by gemcitabine (F-G), or gemcitabine followed by flavopiridol (G-F) and assayed for biological activity.RESULTS: Growth inhibition assessed by serial cell counting and MTT assay was highest in the G-F group. Significant increase in apoptosis assessed by flow cytometry, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and Caspase-3 degradation was also highest in the G-F group. Expression of pro-apoptotic Bax was up-regulated and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 was down-regulated in only the G-F treated cells. Significant up regulation of p21(WAF-1) was demonstrated in the G-F group but not in the reverse regimen treated cells. No effect on protein kinase C (PKC) expression was seen in any of the treated cells.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, similar to the results in the gastrointestinal cell lines, a sequence dependent potentiation of the effect of gemcitabine by flavopiridol was demonstrated in breast cancer cell lines and it was independent of ER status. This was accompanied by enhanced apoptosis and the up regulation of p21(WAF-1) protein.

In addition, application of retinoids yields encouraging results for cancer prevention and therapy. Many tumors express no or low amounts of retinoic acid receptor-beta2 (RAR-beta2) due to epigenetic silencing via DNA hypermethylation. RAR-beta2 is the main mediator of the antiproliferative effect of retinoids. RAR-beta2 re-expression causes reversal of transformation, cell cycle arrest, and restoration of retinoid sensitivity. RAR-beta2 is thus a tumor suppressor. Western blotting, colorimetric in vitro cell proliferation assays, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the EGFR inhibitor PD153035 not only blocked activation of EGFR and inhibited cell growth, but also stimulated RAR-beta expression in MDA-MB-468 breast and OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma cells. Upregulation of RAR-beta by PD153035 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In contrast, expression of other retinoid receptors and of estrogen receptor-alpha was not affected. PD153035-mediated re-induction of RAR-beta was associated with demethylation of the RAR-beta2 gene promoter P2 as demonstrated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These novel results on the ErbB/retinoid receptor cross-talk may be useful for designing future anticancer combination regimens."

We designed a custom oligonucleotide microarray containing probes for 3531 secreted and cell surface genes to study 5 diverse human transformed cell lines and their derivative xenograft tumors. The origins of these human cell lines were lung (A549), breast (MDA MB-231), colon (HCT-116), ovarian (SK-OV-3) and prostate (PC3) carcinomas.RESULTS: Three different analyses were performed: (1) A PCA-based linear discriminant analysis identified a 54 gene profile characteristic of all tumors, (2) Application of MANOVA (Pcorr &lt; .05) to tumor data revealed a larger set of 149 differentially expressed genes. (3) After MANOVA was performed on data from individual tumors, a comparison of differential genes amongst all tumor types revealed 12 common differential genes. Seven of the 12 genes were identified by all three analytical methods. These included late angiogenic, morphogenic and extracellular matrix genes such as ANGPTL4, COL1A1, GP2, GPR57, LAMB3, PCDHB9 and PTGER3. The differential expression of ANGPTL4 and COL1A1 and other genes was confirmed by quantitative PCR.CONCLUSION: Overall, a comparison of the three analyses revealed an expression pattern indicative of late angiogenic processes. These results show that a xenograft model using multiple cell lines of diverse tissue origin can identify common tumorigenic cell surface or secreted molecules that may be important biomarker and therapeutic discoveries."

Collectively, our results prove that LCC15-MB cells currently available are MDA-MB-435 cells and we suggest their re-designation as MDA-MB-435-LCC15 cells.

Ligands for the AhR (i.e. dioxin) have also been shown to modulate the NF-kappaB signaling cascade, affecting physiological processes such as cellular immunity, inflammation, proliferation and survival. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of 5F 203 treatment on the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. Exposure of MCF-7 cells to 5F 203 increased protein-DNA complex formation on the NF-kappaB-responsive element as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, but this effect was eliminated in MDA-MB-435 cells, which are resistant to the antiproliferative effects of 5F 203. An increase in NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activity was confirmed by a significant increase in NF-kappaB-dependent reporter activity in sensitive MCF-7 cells, which was absent in resistant MDA-MB-435 cells and AhR-deficient subclones of MCF-7 cells. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation enhanced the increase in xenobiotic response element-dependent reporter activity in MCF-7 cells when treated with 5F 203. The drug candidate 5F 203 also induced mRNA levels of IL-6, an NF-kappaB-responsive gene, in MCF-7 cells, but not in MDA-MB-435 cells, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR. These findings suggest that 5F 203 activation of the NF-kappaB signaling cascade may contribute to 5F 203-mediated anticancer activity in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells."

We hypothesized that specific ectopic overexpression of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 in normal cells would inhibit radiation-induced apoptosis and thereby reduce radiation-induced toxicity in normal cells. To express Bcl-2 specifically in normal cells (which have wild-type (wt) p53) but not in cancer cells (which often have mutated p53), we constructed a Bcl-2 expression plasmid (PG13-Bcl-2) with a minimal promoter regulated by multiple wt p53 DNA-binding sites and found that the presence of wt p53 protein strongly upregulated Bcl-2 expression through this plasmid. Transfection of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, which express wt p53, with PG13-Bcl-2 increased cell survival and reduced apoptosis; however, transfection of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which have mutated p53, did not affect survival and apoptosis of those cells. These results indicate that irradiation of normal cells rapidly upregulates the expression of wt p53, which binds to the p53 binding sequence of the PG13-Bcl-2 plasmid and increases the transcriptional activity of Bcl-2. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 reduced radiation-induced apoptosis only in normal cells (not in cancer cells). Bcl-2 expression was detected in the lung from mice injected via a tail vein with LPD-PG13-Bcl-2 or LPD-CMV-Bcl-2, but did not in the lung from mice treated with DOTAP or LPD-PG13-mock. This novel approach to inhibiting radiation-induced apoptosis in normal cells may allow such cells to be protected from radiation-induced toxicity. Further preclinical in vivo studies are needed."

Imbalanced expression of genes with an as yet unknown regulatory mechanism seems to result in the hypertrophic development of fibroblastic cells and over-productions of collagen. To get information as to genes which function in the actively growing keloid fibroblasts, we have applied a gene expression DNA-microarray technique by analyzing broad range of genes at once in a systematic fashion.METHODS: Differential gene expressions of keloid fibroblastic cell lines against a normal skin fibroblastic cell line, all of the cell lines had been propagated in our lab, were analyzed using a cDNA-microarray technique. mRNA was extracted from the control normal skin cells and the two lines of keloid fibroblastic cells, one from ear-lobe keloid tissue and the other from chest keloid tissue, was subjected to a DNA microarray analysis which includes 1 100 human genes (TaKaRa Intelli Gene Human CHIP 1K Set I) .RESULTS: 8 genes were found to be expressed exclusively in ear-lobe keloid fibroblastic cell lines. Cells from chest keloid were detected to express 17 genes, specifically. Coagulation factor II (thrombin) receptor gene, KIAA0367 protein gene, and matrilin-2 gene were found to be the most commonly expressed genes in the keloid cells. Suppressor genes, like melanoma differentiation associated gene-7, Mda-7 (U16261), were expressed in normal skin fibroblasts but were not expressed in keloid fibroblasts may be implicated in the pathogenesis of the keloid lesions.CONCLUSIONS: Genes expressed specifically in keloid cells may be an adequate pathological diagnostic marker for keloids.

Among the various endogenous angiogenic inhibitors discovered, the human plasminogen kringle 5 (K5) has been demonstrated to be a potential inhibitor of the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells in vitro. The replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad) vector Adeno-X-CMV-K5 (Ad-K5) (where CMV is cytomegalovirus) was constructed and its antiangiogenic effect was tested on vascular endothelial cell and tumor cell. For the construction, the K5 cDNA was fused in-frame with human plasminogen signal sequence and inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 to form pcDNA3K5. The recombinant plasmid was subcloned into the shuttle plasmid pShuttle under the control of the constitutive CMV immediate-early promoter. The plasmid carrying the cDNA for K5 (pShuttleKS) was then recombined with the Adeno-X viral DNA and transformed into E. coli DH5alpha. The resultant recombinant plasmid pAd-K5 was transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with liposome. The adenovirus expressing human plasminogen kringle 5 (Ad-K5) was successfully packaged and propagated in 293 cells, as detected by the cytopathic effect (CPE) on the cells, and the viral titer in the supernatant was 5 x 10(8) pfu/mL by plaque assay.

Compared with uninfected control and Ad-LacZ infected control, Ad-K5 infected group at 80 MOI (multiplicity of infection) significantly inhibited ECV304 proliferation; the difference between uninfected control and Ad-LacZ infected control was not significant. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 among all the treatments. In addition, the Ad-K5 at 100 MOI inhibited the differentiation and tube formation of ECV304 on ECMatrix gel.

EGF receptor (EGFR) expresses on the surface of normal cells, and abnormally over-expresses on many kinds of tumor cells, especially on solid tumor cells. Adenovirus early region 4 open reading frame 4 protein (E4orf4) is a novel cytotoxin that can specifically induce p53-independent apoptosis in tumor cells. Based on the targeting of EGF and cytotoxicity of E4orf4, we proposed to design a novel fusion protein at molecular level by recombining EGF and E4orf4 to target and then kill tumor cells.METHODS: EGF and E4orf4 coding sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then genetically fused by overlapping PCR. EGF-E4orf4 fragment was cloned into the yeast expression vector. Recombinant plasmid DNA was transformed into the yeast Pichia pastoris. Fusion proteins were purified by SP Sepharose ion exchange chromatography. Cytotoxicity of EGF-E4orf4 on cultured BT325 and MDA-MB-231 cells was detected by MTT assay, and cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry.RESULTS: The fusion fragment has 805 base pairs, which consists of Kozak consensus sequence, and the sequences encoding alpha-factor signal peptide, EGF, flexible linker, and E4orf4. Recombinant plasmids pAO-EGF-E4orf4, and pAO-3EGF-E4orf4 were obtained, the latter contained 3 expression cassettes. Apparent molecular weight of fusion protein was 20 ku. Immunoblot analysis showed that the fusion protein was immunoreactive with rabbit-anti-human EGF polyclonal antibody. EGF-E4orf4 in high concentrations (5, and 0.5 microg/ml) inhibited growth of BT325 and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells as compared with controls. Apoptosis was induced in 15.4%-28.2% of MDA-MB-231 cells by EGF-E4orf4 at the dosage of 10-25 microg/3 x 10(5) cells.CONCLUSIONS: Fusion protein EGF-E4orf4 may enter cells mediated by EGFR, and thus inhibit growth of tumor cells."

Here we report that the highly conserved cysteine-rich C-terminal domain of the V proteins of a wide variety of paramyxoviruses binds melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (mda-5) product. mda-5 is an IFN-inducible host cell DExD/H box helicase that contains a caspase recruitment domain at its N terminus. Overexpression of mda-5 stimulated the basal activity of the IFN-beta promoter in reporter gene assays and significantly enhanced the activation of the IFN-beta promoter by intracellular dsRNA. Both these activities were repressed by coexpression of the V proteins of simian virus 5, human parainfluenza virus 2, mumps virus, Sendai virus, and Hendra virus. Similar results to the reporter assays were obtained by measuring IFN production. Inhibition of mda-5 by RNA interference or by dominant interfering forms of mda-5 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN-beta promoter by dsRNA. It thus appears that mda-5 plays a central role in an intracellular signal transduction pathway that can lead to the activation of the IFN-beta promoter, and that the V proteins of paramyxoviruses interact with mda-5 to block its activity."

Mycolactone, an unusual macrolide with cytotoxic and immunosuppressive properties, is responsible for the massive s.c. tissue destruction seen in Buruli ulcer. Here, we show that MU contains a 174-kb plasmid, pMUM001, bearing a cluster of genes encoding giant polyketide synthases (PKSs), and polyketide-modifying enzymes, and demonstrate that these are necessary and sufficient for mycolactone synthesis. This is a previously uncharacterized example of plasmid-mediated virulence in a Mycobacterium, and the emergence of MU as a pathogen most likely reflects the acquisition of pMUM001 by horizontal transfer. The 12-membered core of mycolactone is produced by two giant, modular PKSs, MLSA1 (1.8 MDa) and MLSA2 (0.26 MDa), whereas its side chain is synthesized by MLSB (1.2 MDa), a third modular PKS highly related to MLSA1. There is an extreme level of sequence identity within the different domains of the MLS cluster (&gt;97% amino acid identity), so much so that the 16 ketosynthase domains seem functionally identical. This is a finding of significant consequence for our understanding of polyketide biochemistry.

Two prohibitin homologues, Phb1 and Phb2, assemble into a high molecular weight complex of approximately 1.2 MDa in the mitochondrial inner membrane, but a nuclear localization of Phb1 and Phb2 also has been reported. Here, we have analyzed the biogenesis and structure of the prohibitin complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both Phb1 and Phb2 subunits are targeted to mitochondria by unconventional noncleavable targeting sequences at their amino terminal end. Membrane insertion involves binding of newly imported Phb1 to Tim8/13 complexes in the intermembrane space and is mediated by the TIM23-translocase. Assembly occurs via intermediate-sized complexes of approximately 120 kDa containing both Phb1 and Phb2. Conserved carboxy-terminal coiled-coil regions in both subunits mediate the formation of large assemblies in the inner membrane. Single particle electron microscopy of purified prohibitin complexes identifies diverse ring-shaped structures with outer dimensions of approximately 270 x 200 angstroms. Implications of these findings for proposed cellular activities of prohibitins are discussed."

Here, we found that ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) is localized at the invadopodia of the cultured breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, and its suppression by a small-interfering RNA duplex effectively blocks the invasive activities of the cells, such as invadopodia formation, localized matrix degradation and Matrigel transmigration but not the cell-adhesion activity. We also found that the GTP hydrolysis-defective mutant Arf6(Q67L) and the GTP-binding defective mutant Arf6(T27N) both blocked these invasive activities but not cell adhesion, suggesting the necessity of continued activation and cycling of the Arf6 GTPase cycle in invasion. Among the different human breast cancer cell lines that we examined, cell lines with high invasive activities expressed higher amounts of Arf6 protein than those in weakly invasive and noninvasive cell lines, although no notable correlation was found between Arf6 mRNA expression levels and invasive activities. Moreover, Matrigel-transmigration activity of all of these invasive cells was blocked effectively by an Arf6 small-interfering RNA duplex. Hence, Arf6 appears to be an integral component of breast cancer invasive activities, and we propose that Arf6 and the intracellular machinery regulating Arf6 during invasion should be considered as therapeutic targets for the prevention of breast cancer invasion."

Hence, substrate discovery is indispensable for understanding the biological role of proteases in vivo. Indeed, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), long associated with extracellular matrix degradation, are increasingly recognized as important processing enzymes of bioactive molecules. MS is now the primary proteomic technique for detecting, identifying, and quantitating proteins in cells or tissues. Here we used isotopecoded affinity tag labeling and multidimensional liquid chromatography inline with tandem MS to identify MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell proteins shed from the cell surface or the pericellular matrix and extracellular proteins that were degraded or processed after transfection with human membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP). Potential substrates were identified as those having altered protein levels compared with the E240A inactive MT1-MMP mutant or vector transfectants. New substrates were biochemically confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight MS and Edman sequencing of cleavage fragments after incubation with recombinant soluble MT1-MMP in vitro. We report many previously uncharacterized substrates of MT1-MMP, including the neutrophil chemokine IL-8, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, pro-tumor necrosis factor alpha, death receptor-6, and connective tissue growth factor, indicating that MT1-MMP is an important signaling protease in addition to its traditionally ascribed roles in pericellular matrix remodeling. Moreover, the high-throughput and quantitative nature of isotope-coded affinity tag labeling combined with tandem MS sequencing is a previously undescribed degradomic screen for protease substrate discovery that should be generally adaptable to other classes of protease for exploring proteolytic function in complex and dynamic biological contexts."

This synergy is dependent upon c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of a unique tyrosine on the EGFR, namely, tyrosine 845 (Y845). Phenylalanine substitution of Y845 (Y845F) was found to inhibit EGF-induced DNA synthesis without affecting the catalytic activity of the receptor or its ability to phosphorylate Shc or activate mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results suggest that synergism may occur through alternate signaling pathways mediated by phosphorylated Y845 (pY845). One such pathway involves the transcription factor Stat5b. Here we describe another pathway that involves cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (CoxII). CoxII was identified as a specific binding partner of a pY845-containing peptide in a phage display screen. EGF-dependent binding of CoxII to the wild type but not to the mutant Y845F-EGFR was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. This association also required the kinase activity of c-Src. Confocal microscopy, as well as biochemical fractionation, indicated that the EGFR translocates to the mitochondria after EGF stimulation, where it colocalizes with CoxII. Such translocation required the catalytic activity of the receptor but not phosphorylation of Y845. However, ectopic expression of the Y845F-EGFR prevented the EGF from protecting MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells from adriamycin-induced apoptosis, whereas two mutants of Stat5b, a dominant-interfering mutant (DNstat5b) and a tyrosine mutation at 699 (Y699F-Stat5b) did not. Taken together, these data suggest that, through the ability of EGFR to translocate to the mitochondria, the binding of proteins such as CoxII to pY845 on the EGFR may positively regulate survival pathways that contribute to oncogenesis."

However, the extent to which cultured preparations of human cancer lines display similar properties in vivo, where important host factors may influence tumor biology, remains unclear. Here, we address this question by conducting a functional proteomic analysis of the human breast cancer line MDA-MB-231 grown in culture and as orthotopic xenograft tumors in the mammary fad pad of immunodeficient mice. Using a suite of activity-based chemical probes, we identified carcinoma (human) enzyme activities that were expressed selectively in culture or in xenograft tumors. Likewise, distinct groups of stromal (mouse) enzyme activities were found that either infiltrated or were excluded from xenograft tumors, indicating a contribution by specific host components to breast cancer development. MDA-MB-231 cells isolated from tumors exhibited profound differences in their enzyme activity profiles compared with the parent cell line, including the dramatic posttranscriptional up-regulation of the serine proteases urokinase plasminogen activator and tissue plasminogen activator and down-regulation of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase. These altered enzyme activity profiles correlated with significantly greater tumor growth rates and metastases for xenograft-derived MDA-MB-231 cells upon reintroduction into mice. Collectively, these data indicate that the in vivo environment of the mouse mammary fat pad cultivates the growth of human breast cancer cells with elevated tumorigenic properties and highlight the value of activity-based protein profiling for identifying proteomic signatures that depict such changes in cancer cell biology."

There are no effective vaccines available to date for treatment of these protozoan diseases, while current drugs have limited efficacy, significant toxicity and suffer from increasing resistance. Trypanosomatids have several remarkable and unique metabolic and structural features that are of great interest for developing new anti-protozoan therapeutics. One such feature is &quot;RNA editing&quot;, an essential process in these pathogenic protozoa. Transcripts for key trypanosomatid mitochondrial proteins undergo extensive post-transcriptional RNA editing by specifically inserting or deleting uridylates from pre-mature mRNA in order to create mature mRNAs that encode functional proteins. The RNA editing process is carried out in a approximately 1.6 MDa multi-protein complex, the editosome. In Trypanosoma brucei, one of the editosome's core enzymes, the RNA editing ligase 1 (TbREL1), has been shown to be essential for survival of both insect and bloodstream forms of the parasite. We report here the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of TbREL1 at 1.2 A resolution, in complex with ATP and magnesium. The magnesium ion interacts with the beta and gamma-phosphate groups and is almost perfectly octahedrally coordinated by six phosphate and water oxygen atoms. ATP makes extensive direct and indirect interactions with the ligase via essentially all its atoms while extending its base into a deep pocket. In addition, the ATP makes numerous interactions with residues that are conserved in the editing ligases only. Further away from the active site, TbREL1 contains a unique loop containing several hydrophobic residues that are highly conserved among trypanosomatid RNA editing ligases which may play a role in protein-protein interactions in the editosome. The distinct characteristics of the adenine-binding pocket, and the absence of any close homolog in the human genome, bode well for the design of selective inhibitors that will block the essential RNA ligase function in a number of major protozoan pathogens."

The underlying rationale for the screen was that oncogenesis arises from a cellular dedifferentiation process culminating in uncontrolled proliferation and acquisition of invasive and metastatic potential. Identification of genes upregulated during the process of reactivation of faulty or inoperational differentiation maintenance programs was postulated to have cancer gene therapeutic potential. In this context, it is heartening to note that mda-7/IL-24 has made a methodical and progressive journey, from an unidentified novel sequence with little homology to known genes at its time of isolation to currently having the status of a molecule belonging to the IL-10-related family of cytokines, with considerable cancer gene therapeutic potential. Extensive in vitro and in vivo human tumor xenograft studies have established its transformed cell apoptosis-inducing capacity in various model systems. It has recently taken an important step for a candidate cancer gene therapeutic molecule, in the ultimate goal of benchtop to clinic, by being currently utilized in human Phase I/II clinical trials.

Others have reported the presence of putative estrogen responsive elements (ERE) in human mtDNA (mtEREs) and detection of ERs in mitochondria of rat uterine and ovary cells. Recently, we demonstrated the E2-enhanced mitochondrial localization of ERalpha and ERbeta, and E2-induced mtDNA transcript levels in MCF-7 cells. In this study, we applied electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to determine if mitochondrial extracts, recombinant human ERalpha (rhERalpha), and rhERbeta interact with mtEREs. Using EMSAs, we observed that ER-containing mitochondrial extracts bound to mtEREs and the binding was enhanced by E2, whereas the binding of mitochondrial proteins from ERbeta-deficient cells was almost undetectable. Both rhERalpha and rhERbeta bound to the mtEREs and their binding was altered by their respective antibodies. However, the ERalpha antibodies did not alter the binding of MCF-7 cell mitochondrial extracts to mtEREs whereas the binding MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell mitochondrial extracts to mtEREs was reduced by ERbeta antibody. These results suggest that the mtERE-bound mitochondrial protein is ERbeta. Using SPR, we observed the binding of both ERs to mtEREs and that the binding was increased by E2. These results indicate that the mitochondrial ERs can interact with mtEREs and suggest that they may be directly involved in E2 induction of mtDNA transcription."

We show that this induced migration, using MDA-MB-468 breast and PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells, can be inhibited by using specific, clinically established receptor antagonists to the beta2-adrenoceptor, the D2 receptor, or the neurokinin-1 receptor, respectively. All of the investigated neurotransmitters significantly activated the cyclic adenosine-monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB). Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed changes of gene expression toward a highly motile tumor cell type, including an upregulation of the alpha2 integrin, which is an essential adhesion receptor for collagen in migration. The gene for the tumor suppressor gelsolin was downregulated. These 2 critical alterations were confirmed on the protein level by flow-cytometry and immunoblotting, respectively. Neurotransmitters thus induce a metastatogenic tumor cell type by directly regulating gene expression and increased migratory activity, which can be prevented by established neurotransmitter antagonists."

Urokinase (uPA), only expressed by the highly invasive cancer cells, has been implicated in invasion, metastases, and angiogenesis of several malignancies including breast cancer. Because uPA expression is strongly correlated with its hypomethylated state, we utilized the uPA gene in the highly invasive MDA-231 human breast cancer cells as a model system to test the hypothesis that pharmacological reversal of the uPA promoter hypomethylation would result in its silencing and inhibition of metastasis. S-Adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) has previously been shown to cause hypermethylation and inhibit demethylation. Treatment of MDA-231 cells with AdoMet, but not its unmethylated analogue S-adenosylhomocysteine, significantly inhibits uPA expression and tumor cell invasion in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. The effects of AdoMet on uPA expression were reversed by the demethylating agent 5'-azacytidine, supporting the conclusion that AdoMet effects are caused by hypermethylation. Knockdown of the methyl-binding protein 2 also causes a significant inhibition of uPA expression in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. These treatments did not have any effects on estrogen receptor expression, suggesting that inhibition of hypomethylation will not affect genes already silenced by hypermethylation. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that hypomethylation of critical genes like uPA plays a causal role in metastasis. Inhibition of hypomethylation can thus be used as a novel therapeutic approach to silence the pro-metastatic gene uPA and block breast cancer progression into the aggressive and metastatic stages of the disease."

However, the role of AIB1 in breast cancer etiology is not known. Here, we show that AIB1 is rate-limiting for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)-dependent phenotypic changes and gene expression in human breast cancer cells. Reduction of endogenous AIB1 levels by small interfering RNA in MCF-7 breast cancer cells prevented IGF-I-stimulated anchorage-independent growth by reducing IGF-I-dependent anti-anoikis. cDNA array and immunoblot analysis of gene expression revealed that reduction in AIB1 levels led to a significant decrease in the expression of several genes controlling the cell cycle and apoptosis. These AIB1-dependent changes were also observed in the presence of estrogen antagonist and were corroborated in the estrogen receptor-negative cell line MDA MB-231. AIB1 reduction decreased the expression of the IGF-I receptor and IRS-1 in MCF-7 but not in MDA MB-231 cells. IGF-I-stimulated activation of AKT was reduced by AIB1 small interfering RNA treatment, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) activation by IGF-I was unaffected. We conclude that AIB1 is required for IGF-I-induced proliferation, signaling, cell survival, and gene expression in human breast cancer cells, independent of its role in estrogen receptor signaling."

Oligomers 40 kDa are detected in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay where the capture and detection antibodies recognize the same primary sequence epitope. Monomeric peptide with a single epitope does not react in this format. Abeta(1-40) peptide does not oligomerize readily under these conditions. The rate of oligomer formation has a steep linear temperature dependence but is weakly affected by ionic strength up to 0.5M NaCl or KCl. Oligomer formation is inhibited by concentrations of Tween 20 and several other detergents well below their critical micelle concentrations. Once formed, high-molecular-weight oligomers are stabilized by Tween 20. Gel permeation chromatography of an oligomer preparation formed at nanomolar concentrations indicates that the majority of the Abeta(1-42) peptide chromatographs as monomers/dimers of apparent mw approximately 10 kDa. The most abundant oligomers have apparent mobilities corresponding to 220 kDa (48-mer) and higher multiples of this without detectable concentrations of intermediate low-molecular-weight species. Very little immunoreactive peptide appears in the void volume (&gt;1.5 MDa) of a Superose 12 column. The oligomers are stable, rechromatographing at their original position. Abeta(1-42) oligomer formation at physiologic concentrations is a reproducible process that is amenable to kinetic analysis and inhibition."

We have previously described a group of genes that is rapidly up-regulated in these cells following dexamethasone (Dex) treatment. In an effort to dissect the mechanisms of GR-mediated breast epithelial cell survival, we now examine the molecular events downstream of GR activation. Here we show that GR activation leads to both the rapid induction of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) mRNA and its sustained expression. Induction of the MKP-1 protein in the MCF10A-Myc and MDA-MB-231 breast epithelial cell lines was also seen. Paclitaxel treatment resulted in MAPK activation and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and both processes were inhibited by Dex pretreatment. Furthermore, induction of MKP-1 correlated with the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity, whereas p38 activity was minimally affected. Blocking Dex-induced MKP-1 induction using small interfering RNA increased ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation and decreased cell survival. ERK1/2 and JNK inactivation was associated with Ets-like transcription factor-1 (ELK-1) dephosphorylation. To explore the gene expression changes that occur downstream of ELK-1 dephosphorylation, we used a combination of temporal gene expression data and promoter element analyses. This approach revealed a previously unrecognized transcriptional target of ELK-1, the human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). We verified the predicted ELK-1--&gt; tPA transcriptional regulatory relationship using a luciferase reporter assay. We conclude that GR-mediated MAPK inactivation contributes to cell survival and that the potential transcriptional targets of this inhibition can be identified from large scale gene array analysis."

Here, we show that activation of IL-1beta receptors on malignant HS578t and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells strongly induces IL-8 expression and that RNA stabilization is persistently activated at least 12-24 hr after stimulation. SB 203580 and rapamycin reversed the RNA stabilization effect of IL-1beta in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting involvement of the p38/MAP kinase and mTOR pathways. A luciferase reporter assay indicated that the stabilization effect was dependent on cis elements in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the IL-8 transcript. By UV cross-linking, we identified multiple cellular factors that interact with the IL-8 3'UTR, ranging 34-76 kDa. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that HuR, KSRP and TIAR bound to one or more loci in the 3'UTR. While the cross-linking patterns were similar, quantitative immunoprecipitation of native IL-8 RNA from IL-1beta-stimulated cytoplasmic extract revealed a 20-fold greater association of transcript with the stabilizing factor HuR vs. the destabilizing factor KSRP. In conclusion, IL-1beta is a potent cytokine stimulus for IL-8 RNA stabilization in breast cancer cells, possibly by enhanced binding of cytoplasmic HuR to the 3'UTR."

In the present study, we show that IL-8 overexpression in breast cancer cells involves a higher transcriptional activity of IL-8 gene promoter. Cloning of IL-8 promoter from MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells expressing high and low levels of IL-8, respectively, shows the integrity of the promoter in both cell lines. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the promoter demonstrate that NF-kappaB and AP-1 and to a lesser extent C/EBP binding sites play a crucial role in the control of IL-8 promoter activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. Knockdown of NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities by adenovirus-mediated expression of an NF-kappaB super-repressor and RNA interference, respectively, decreased IL-8 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. On the contrary, restoration of Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Jun, p50, p65, C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta expression levels in MCF-7 cells led to a promoter activity comparable to that observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data constitute the first extensive study of IL-8 gene overexpression in breast cancer cells and suggest that the high expression of IL-8 in invasive cancer cells requires a complex cooperation between NF-kappaB, AP-1 and C/EBP transcription factors."

Recent data obtained in different cell models suggested that in addition to its conventional role as a cytoplasmic signal transducer, IRS-1 has a function in the nuclear compartment. However, the role of nuclear IRS-1 in breast cancer has never been addressed. Here we report that in estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive MCF-7 cells, (1) a fraction of IRS-1 was translocated to the nucleus upon 17-beta-estradiol (E2) treatment; (2) E2-dependent nuclear translocation of IRS-1 was blocked with the antiestrogen ICI 182,780; (3) nuclear IRS-1 colocalized and co-precipitated with ERalpha; (4) the IRS-1:ERalpha complex was recruited to the E2-sensitive pS2 gene promoter. Notably, IRS-1 interaction with the pS2 promoter did not occur in ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, but was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells retransfected with ERalpha. Transcription reporter assays with E2-sensitive promoters suggested that the presence of IRS-1 inhibits ERalpha activity at estrogen-responsive element-containing DNA. In summary, our data suggested that nuclear IRS-1 interacts with ERalpha and that this interaction might influence ERalpha transcriptional activity."

This improved map clearly exhibits more structural detail and allows better defined docking of computationally predicted structural domain folds. Using sequence-based fold recognition, the N-terminal region of RyR1, residues 216-572, was predicted to have significant structural similarity with the IP3-binding core region of the type 1 IP3R.

We provide genetic confirmation of the hypothesis that MDA originates from fatty acids containing more than two methylene-linked double bonds, showing that tri-unsaturated fatty acids are the in vivo source of up to 75% of MDA. The abundance of the combined pool of free and reversibly bound MDA did not change dramatically in stress, although a significant increase in the free MDA pool under oxidative conditions was observed. The half-life of infiltrated MDA indicated rapid metabolic turnover/sequestration. Exposure of plants to low levels of MDA using a recently developed protocol powerfully upregulated many genes on a cDNA microarray with a bias towards those implicated in abiotic/environmental stress (e.g. ROF1 and XERO2). Remarkably, and in contrast to the activities of other reactive electrophile species (i.e. small vinyl ketones), none of the pathogenesis-related (PR) genes tested responded to MDA. The use of structural mimics of MDA isomers suggested that the propensity of the molecule to act as a cross-linking/modifying reagent might contribute to the activation of gene expression. Changes in the concentration/localisation of unbound MDA in vivo could strongly affect stress-related transcription."

Oxidized LDL is recognized by the immune system, and animal studies have suggested that these immune responses have a protective effect against atherosclerosis. Aldehyde-modified peptide sequences in apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) are major targets for these immune responses.METHODS AND RESULTS: Human IgG1 antibodies against 2 malondialdehyde (MDA)-modified apoB-100 peptide sequences were produced through screening of a single-chain antibody-fragment library and subsequent cloning into a pcDNA3 vector. Three weekly doses of these antibodies were injected into male apoE-/- mice. Phosphate-buffered saline and human IgG1 antibodies against fluorescein isothiocyanate were used as controls. One of the IgG1 antibodies significantly and dose-dependently reduced the extent of atherosclerosis as well as the plaque content of oxidized LDL epitopes and macrophages. In cell culture studies, human monocytes were incubated with native LDL or oxidized LDL, in the presence of antibodies. The same antibody induced an increase in monocyte binding and uptake of oxidized LDL.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that antibodies are important mediators of atheroprotective immune responses directed to oxidized LDL. Thus, passive immunization against MDA-modified apoB-100 peptide sequences may represent a novel therapeutic approach for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease."

To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for TGF-beta1 response on collagenase-3 promoter activity, a functional analysis of the promoter region of the collagenase-3 gene was carried out, and we identified the distal runt domain (RD) and proximal RD/activator protein-1 (AP-1) sites as necessary for full TGF-beta1-stimulated collagenase-3 promoter activity. Gel shift, real time reverse transcriptase-PCR, and Western blot analyses showed increased levels of c-Jun, JunB, and Cbfa1/Runx2 upon TGF-beta1 treatment in MDA-MB231 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation in vitro studies identified no physical interaction between JunB and Cbfa1/Runx2, whereas Smad3 interacted with both. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed interaction of Smad3 with JunB and Cbfa1/Runx2. Under basal conditions, Cbfa1/Runx2 bound to both the proximal RD/AP-1 and distal RD sites. In response to TGF-beta1, Cbfa1/Runx2 was seen only at the distal RD site, whereas JunB occupied the proximal RD/AP-1 site. An assemblage of Smad3, JunB, and Cbfa1/Runx2 at the distal RD site of the collagenase-3 promoter occurred in response to TGF-beta1 in MDA-MB231 cells. Co-transfection of Smad3, JunB, and Cbfa1/Runx2 constructs along with a constitutively active TGF-beta type I receptor construct identified functional interaction of these proteins and transcriptional activation of the collagenase-3 gene by TGF-beta1. Taken together, our results suggest that TGF-beta1 stimulated JunB and Cbfa1/Runx2 to bind to their respective DNA consensus sites and that Smad3 is likely to stabilize their interaction to confer functional TGF-beta1-stimulation of collagenase-3 expression in MDA-MB231 cells."

Previously, we showed that these drugs could activate the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappaB, in a DNA damage-dependent manner. We now show that these drugs can potentiate the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in MDA-MB 435 breast cancer cells treated with IFN-gamma. We observed that key markers of STAT1 activation, including tyrosine 701 and serine 727 phosphorylation, were enhanced in the presence of doxorubicin. This potentiation resulted in enhanced nuclear localization of activated STAT1 and led to an increase in the nuclear binding of activated STAT complexes. The observed potentiation was specific for STAT1 and IFN-gamma, as no effects were observed with either STAT3 or STAT5. Furthermore, the type I IFNs (alpha and beta) had little or no effect. The observed effects on STAT1 phosphorylation have previously been linked with maximal transcriptional activation and apoptosis. Cell viability was assessed by crystal violet staining followed by analysis with CalcuSyn to determine combination index values, a measure of synergy. We confirmed that significant synergy existed between IFN-gamma and doxorubicin (combination index = 0.34) at doses lower than IC(50) values for this drug (0.67 micromol/L). In support of this, we observed that apoptotic cell death was also enhanced by measuring poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3 cleavage. Finally, suppression of STAT1 expression by small-interfering RNA resulted in a loss of synergistic apoptotic cell death compared with cells, where no suppression of STAT1 expression was attained with scrambled small-interfering RNA control. We conclude that doxorubicin potentiates STAT1 activation in response to IFN-gamma, and that this combination results in enhanced apoptosis in breast cancer cells."

By screening a chemical library of &gt;1000 compounds, 17-allyaminogeldanamycin (17AAG) was identified as a potent inhibitor of uPA by the National Cancer Institute and is now in Phase I clinical trials. At this time, it remains unclear how 17AAG blocks uPA; one possibility is through disruption of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) pathway. This would be consistent with studies from our laboratory showing that activation of IGF-IR results in the induction of uPA protein. In the study described herein, we observed that IGF-IR and uPA were highly expressed in 87 and 55% of breast cancer by screening tumor tissue microarrays representing 930 cases. A significant proportion (52.1% = 354 of 680 cases, P &lt; 0.0001) of the patients had tumors expressing both proteins. uPA alone (P = 0.033) or in combination with IGF-IR (P = 0.0104) was indicative of decreased disease-specific survival. Next, we demonstrated that treating MDA-MB-231 cells with increasing concentrations of 17AAG resulted in IGF-IR degradation (IC(50) = 1.0 micro M) and blocked signal transduction through the Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Finally, we found that 17AAG had a robust inhibitory effect on the production of uPA mRNAand protein in the presence of IGF-I. Thus, our study raises the possibility that 17AAG could prove to be an effective therapeutic agent for a large number of breast cancer patients by inhibiting the IGF-IR and ultimately uPA."

There are many limitations to these techniques including, the number of chromosomes diagnosed for FISH or the quality of DNA issued from a single cell PCR. This report shows, for the first time, use of MDA for single cell whole genome amplification. A total of 16 short tandem repeats (STRs) were amplified successfully with a similar pattern to the genomic DNA. Furthermore, allelic drop out (ADO) derived from MDA was assessed in 40 single cells by analysing (i) heterozygosity for a known beta globin mutation (IVSI-5 C-G) and by studying (ii) the heterozygous loci present in the STRs. ADO turned out to be 10.25% for the beta globin gene sequencing and 5% for the fluorescent PCR analysis of STRs. Moreover, the amplification accuracy of MDA permitted the detection of trisomy 21 on a single cell using comparative genome hybridization-array. Altogether, these data suggest that MDA can be used for single cell molecular karyotyping and the diagnosis of any single gene disorder in PGD."

The second centered on aa 170 to 180, with the overlapping 20-mer peptides retaining about 30% of the activity of the full protein. Significant apoptotic abilities were observed for 11-mer motif peptides spanning aa 50 to 60 and aa 170 to 180, with a scrambled version of the 11-mer motif peptide corresponding to aa 50 to 60 showing no apoptotic ability. Hallmarks of apoptosis, such as the formation of DNA ladders and caspase activation, that were observed with the full-length protein were equally evident upon exposure of cells to these motif peptides. A CXCR4 antibody and the endogenous ligand SDF-1alpha were effective in blocking Nef peptide-induced apoptosis as well as the physical binding of a fluorescently tagged Nef protein, while CCR5 antibodies were ineffective. The CXCR4-negative cell line MDA-MB-468 was resistant to the apoptotic peptides and became sensitive to the apoptotic peptides upon transfection with a CXCR4-expressing vector. A fluorescently tagged motif peptide and Nef protein displayed physical binding to CXCR4-transfected MDA-MB-468 cells, but not to CCR5-transfected cells. The removal of the apoptotic motif sequences from the full-length protein completely eliminated the ability of Nef to induce apoptosis. However, these modified Nef proteins still retained the ability to enhance viral infectivity. Thus, specific sequences in the Nef protein appear to be necessary for Nef protein-induced apoptosis as well as for physical interaction with CXCR4 receptors."

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) showed a restricted expression pattern in both normal and cancerous breast tissues with most expressed at low levels. However, of the several MMPs expressed in significant quantities, the carcinoma samples showed only slightly elevated amounts other than for MMP-28 which was strongly elevated.

In another approach we used isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) labeling with tandem mass spectrometry to quantitate the levels of secreted or shed extracellular proteins in MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell cultures in the presence or absence of membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) overexpression. By this proteomic approach we identified and biochemically confirmed that IL-8, the serine protease inhibitor SLPI, the death receptor-6, pro-TNF-alpha and CTGF are novel substrates of MT1-MMP. The utility and quantitative nature of ICAT with MS/MS analysis as a new screen for protease substrate discovery based on detection of cleaved or shed substrate products should be readily adaptable to other classes of protease for assessing proteolytic function in a cellular context."

As the 26 S proteasome mainly localizes to the nucleus in yeast, we addressed the question how this 2-MDa multisubunit complex is imported into the nucleus. 26 S proteasomes consist of a 20 S proteolytically active core and 19 S regulatory particles, the latter composed of two subcomplexes, namely the base and lid complexes. We have shown that 20 S core particles are translocated into the nucleus as inactive precursor complexes via the classic karyopherin alphabeta import pathway. Here, we provide evidence that nuclear import of base and lid complexes also depends on karyopherin alphabeta. Potential classic nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) of base subunits were analyzed. Rpn2 and Rpt2, a non-ATPase subunit and an ATPase subunit of the base complex, harbor functional NLSs. The Rpt2 NLS deletion yielded wild type localization. However, the deletion of the Rpn2 NLS resulted in improper nuclear proteasome localization and impaired proteasome function. Our data support the model by which nuclear 26 S proteasomes are assembled from subcomplexes imported by karyopherin alphabeta."

Technical hurdles to this process are the introduction of amplification bias and/or the inhibitory effects of formalin fixation on DNA amplification. Here we demonstrate a balanced-PCR procedure that allows unbiased amplification of genomic DNA from fresh or modestly degraded paraffin-embedded DNA samples. Following digestion and ligation of a target and a control genome with distinct linkers, the two are mixed and amplified in a single PCR, thereby avoiding biases associated with PCR saturation and impurities. We demonstrate genome-wide retention of allelic differences following balanced-PCR amplification of DNA from breast cancer and normal human cells and genomic profiling by array-CGH (cDNA arrays, 100 kb resolution) and by real-time PCR (single gene resolution). Comparison of balanced-PCR with multiple displacement amplification (MDA) demonstrates equivalent performance between the two when intact genomic DNA is used. When DNA from paraffin-embedded samples is used, balanced PCR overcomes problems associated with modest DNA degradation and produces unbiased amplification whereas MDA does not. Balanced-PCR allows amplification and recovery of modestly degraded genomic DNA for subsequent retrospective analysis of human tumors with known outcomes."

Resistance phenotypes (ampicillin, aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone) suggested the presence of an ESBL enzyme, but cefoxitin MICs (&gt;/= 32 mg/L) suggested the presence of an AmpC-like enzyme. Synergism experiments with benzo(b)thiophene-2-boronic acid (BZBTH2B) and isoelectric focusing (IEF) revealed the presence of an AmpC beta-lactamase with a pI &gt;/= 9. amp C multiplex PCR, sequence, and Southern analyses indicated that only the Salmonella isolate had a plasmid-encoded AmpC beta-lactamase CMY-2 on a nonconjugative 60-MDa plasmid. PCR and sequence analysis of the E. coli ampC promoter identified mutations at positions -88(T), -82(G), -42(T), -18(A), -1(T) and +58(T) in all the isolates. In addition one strain had two extra-mutations at positions +23(A) and +49(G), and another strain had one extra-mutation at position +32(A). DNA fingerprinting revealed that all the E. coli isolates were different clones. It also showed that the U.K. Salmonella isolate was indistinguisable from a Canadian Salmonella isolate from turkeys; both had identical resistance phenotypes and produced CMY-2. This is the first report of a CMY-2 Salmonella isolate in the United Kingdom. These data imply that beta-lactam resistance in animal isolates can be generated de novo as evidenced by the E. coli strains, or in the case of the Salmonella strains be the result of intercontinental transmission due to an acquired resistance mechanism."

Even if isomers differing by leucine/isoleucine are excluded, the latter numbers are 14% and 38%--those isomeric peptides cannot be distinguished based on mass alone, and tandem mass spectrometry and/or other additional constraints are needed. However, for nominally isobaric peptides, the mass accuracy and resolving power of broadband Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry theoretically and experimentally suffice to resolve virtually all peptide doublets differing by up to two amino acids--including the smallest mass difference of 3.4 mDa. We demonstrate experimental resolution of another pair of peptides differing by 11 mDa, even when present in a complex mixture of hundreds of other peptides."

Quantitative RT-PCR indicated that ParvB mRNA was downregulated, by at least 60%, in four of nine breast tumors, relative to patient-matched normal mammary gland tissue. We also found that ParvB protein levels were reduced by &gt; or =90% in five of seven advanced tumors, relative to matched normal breast tissue. Conversely, ILK protein and kinase activity levels were elevated in these tumors, suggesting that downregulation of ParvB stimulates ILK signaling. Western blot analyses indicated very low levels of ParvB protein in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 breast cancer cells, facilitating functional studies of the effects of ParvB on ILK signaling. Expression of ParvB in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells increased cell adhesion to collagen. ParvB inhibited ILK kinase activity, anchorage-independent cell growth and in vitro matrigel invasion by MDA-MB-231 cells. EGF-induced phosphorylation of two ILK targets, PKB (Ser473) and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (Ser9), was also inhibited by ParvB. These results indicated that ParvB inhibits ILK signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. Our results suggest that loss of ParvB expression is a novel mechanism for upregulating ILK activity in tumors."

To avoid the genetic complexities associated with established breast cancer cell lines, we employed NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts engineered to overexpress human Her-2/neu coding sequence. NIH-3T3/Her-2 cells demonstrated a significant upregulation of FAS protein expression, which was dependent on the upstream activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT pathways. Remarkably, pharmacological FAS blockade using the mycotoxin cerulenin or the novel small compound C75 completely suppressed the state of Her-2/neu-induced malignant transformation by inhibiting the ability of NIH-3T3/Her-2 cells to grow under either anchorage-independent (i.e., to form colonies in soft agar) or low-serum monolayer conditions. Moreover, NIH-3T3/Her-2 fibroblasts were up to three times more sensitive to chemical FAS inhibitors relative to untransformed controls as determined by MTT-based cell viability assays. In addition, pharmacological FAS blockade preferentially induced apoptotic cell death of NIH-3T3/Her-2 fibroblasts, as determined by an ELISA for histone-associated DNA fragments and by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated nick end labeling assay (TUNEL). Interestingly, the degree of Her-2/neu oncogene expression in a panel of breast cancer cell lines was predictive of sensitivity to chemical FAS inhibitors-induced cytotoxicity, while low-FAS expressing and chemical FAS inhibitors-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells became hypersensitive to FAS blockade when they were engineered to overexpress Her-2/neu. Our observations strongly suggest that inhibition of FAS activity may provide a new molecular avenue for chemotherapeutic prevention and/or treatment of Her-2/neu-related breast carcinomas."

However, it was unclear whether endogenous p27(kip1) is phosphorylated at T198 in the living cell. In the present work we describe the generation and characterization of a polyclonal antibody able to recognize recombinant, transfected as well as endogenous T198-phosphorylated p27(kip1). Using this antibody, we demonstrate that: (1) endogenous p27(kip1) is phosphorylated at T198 in 4 breast cancer cells lines (MCF7, MDA-MB231, MDA- MB436 and MDA-MB468); (2) T198 phosphorylation is increased in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary epithelial cells (HMEC); (3) T198-phosphorylated p27(kip1) is exclusively cytoplasmic; (4) T198 phosphorylation is dependent on the activity of the PI3K-PKB/Akt pathway, being it drastically reduced by the pharmacological PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or stimulated by the constitutive activation of PKB/Akt. Finally, in primary human breast carcinomas, cytoplasmic accumulation of T198-phosphorylated p27(kip1) parallels Akt activation. We conclude that in breast cancer cells p27(kip1) is phosphorylated at T198 in a PI3K/Akt dependent manner and that this phosphorylation may contribute to p27(kip1) cytoplasmic mislocalization observed in breast cancer."

Here, we sought to investigate whether substitution of serine 305 in ER with glutamic acid (ER alpha-S305E), which mimics the phosphorylation state, would influence the status of ER-target genes. To explore this possibility, we generated clones overexpressing ER alpha-S305E in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells and analyzed the status of ER-regulated genes using a gene array. Results indicated that the expression of ER alpha-S305E is sufficient to upregulate the expression of a few but not all ER-regulated genes, i.e., cyclin D1 and zinc finger protein 147 (estrogen-responsive finger protein), while there was no significant change in the expression of remaining genes on the array. In addition, we found an increased expression as well as nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 protein in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing ER alpha-S305E as compared to the level of cyclin D1 in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing WT-ER alpha or pcDNA. Furthermore, ER alpha-S305E, but not mutation of ER alpha-S305 to alanine, enhanced the cyclin D1 promoter activity. These findings suggest that ER alpha activation at S305 is sufficient to upregulate the expression of cyclin D1, an ER-regulated gene that is implicated in the progression of breast cancer. Phosphorylation of ER alpha by Pak1 or its upstream regulators could upregulate the expression of a subset of ER-target genes in a ligand-independent manner and hence, might contribute toward the development of hormone independence in breast cancer cells."

Gene transfer using adenoviral mda-7/IL-24 (Ad-mda7) exhibits minimal toxicity on normal cells while inducing potent apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines. Ad-mda7-transduced cells express high levels of MDA-7 protein intracellularly and also secrete a soluble form of MDA-7 protein. In this study, we sought to determine whether the intracellular or secreted MDA-7 protein was responsible for anti-tumor activity in H1299 lung tumor cells. Ad-mda7 transduction of lung tumor cells increased expression of stress-related proteins, including BiP, GADD34, PP2A, caspases 7 and 12, and XBP-1, consistent with activation of the UPR pathway, a key sensor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated stress. Blocking secretion of MDA-7 did not inhibit apoptosis, demonstrating that intracellular MDA-7 was responsible for cytotoxicity. Consistent with this result, when applied directly to lung cancer cells, soluble MDA-7 protein exhibited minimal cytotoxic effect. We then generated mda-7 expression constructs using vectors that target the expressed protein to various subcellular compartments, including cytoplasm, nucleus, and ER. Only full-length and ER-targeted MDA-7 elicited cell death in tumor cells. Thus in lung cancer cells, Ad-mda7 activates the UPR stress pathway and induces apoptosis via intracellular MDA-7 expression in the secretory pathway."

The identification of molecules whose expression is specifically correlated with the metastatic spread of cancer would facilitate the design of therapeutic interventions to inhibit this lethal process. In order to facilitate metastasis gene discovery we have previously characterized a pair of monoclonal cell lines from the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-435 that have different metastatic phenotypes in immune-compromised mice. In this study, serum-free conditioned media was collected from the cultured monoclonal cell lines and a mass mapping technique was applied in order to profile a component of each cell line proteome. We utilized chromatofocusing in the first dimension to obtain a high resolution separation based on protein pI, and nonporous silica reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography was used for the second dimension. Selected proteins were identified on the basis of electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF MS) intact protein mapping and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) peptide mass fingerprinting. Using this approach we were able to map over 400 proteins and plot them as a 2-D map of pI versus accurate M(r). This was performed over a pI range of 4.0-6.2, and a mass range of 6-80 kDa. ESI-TOF MS data and further analysis using MALDI-TOF MS confirmed and identified 27 differentially expressed proteins. Proteins associated with the metastatic phenotype included osteopontin and extracellular matrix protein 1, whereas the matrix metalloproteinase-1 and annexin 1 proteins were associated with the non-metastatic phenotype. These findings demonstrate that the mass mapping technique is a powerful tool for the detection and identification of proteins in complex biological samples and which are specifically associated with a cellular phenotype."

Human tensin3 cDNA encodes a 1445 amino acid sequence that shares extensive homology with tensin1, tensin2, and COOH-terminal tensin-like protein. Tensin3 is expressed in various tissues and in different cell types such as endothelia, epithelia, and fibroblasts. The potential role of tensin3 in EGF-induced signaling pathway is explored. EGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of tensin3 in MDA-MB-468 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but it is independent of an intact actin cytoskeleton or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Activation of EGF receptor is necessary but not sufficient for tyrosine phosphorylation of tensin3. It also requires Src family kinase activities. Furthermore, tensin3 forms a complex with focal adhesion kinase and p130Cas in MDA-MB-468 cells. Addition of EGF to the cells induces dephosphorylation of these two molecules, leads to disassociation of the tensin3-focal adhesion kinase-p130Cas complex, and enhances the interaction between tensin3 and EGF receptor. Our results demonstrate that tensin3 may function as a platform for the disassembly of EGF-related signaling complexes at focal adhesions."

In this report we describe the cloning of a 1.4kb cDNA with an open reading frame of 344 amino acids that encodes the P-40 protein. Analysis of the P-40 amino acid sequence showed it is identical to the human annexin I (Anx-I) protein. The identity of the isolated P-40 cDNA as Anx-I was confirmed by the specific binding of IPM96 mAb to a 40kDa protein following the in vitro expression of P-40 full-length cDNA. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from drug-sensitive and -resistant cells revealed an increase in P-40 (or Anx-I) mRNA in drug-resistant cells relative to drug-sensitive cells. Transfection of Anx-I cDNA into drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells was carried out without further drug selection and showed 2- to 5-fold increase in resistance of transfected cells to adriamycin, melphalan, and etoposide. Conversely, transfection of reverse Anx-I cDNA into SKOV-3 cells decreased the expression of Anx-I without affecting the expression of other members of the annexin family and showed a 3- to 8-fold increase in sensitivity to these drugs. Of interest was the correlation between the presence of Anx-I and MDR in MDA-MB-231 cells when compared to MCF-7 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells show 3- to 20-fold increase in resistance to adriamycin, melphalan, and etoposide in the absence of detectable levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp1), the multidrug resistance protein (MRP1) or the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).

Stat3 has been classified as an oncogene, because constitutively active Stat3 can mediate oncogenic transformation in cultured cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Since Stat3 appears to play an important role in breast cancer, it is of interest to investigate Stat3-regulated genes and elucidate Stat3-mediated oncogenesis. In this study, we investigated the Stat3-regulated genes in human breast epithelial cells. Upon overexpression of Stat3-C, a constitutively active Stat3 form, in nonmalignant telomerase immortalized breast (TERT) cells, the total mRNA was extracted and subjected to Affymetrix microarray analysis. Our results showed that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 (MEK5) was markedly induced (more than 22-fold increase, P&lt;0.001) by Stat3-C expression. RT-PCR result also demonstrated that MEK5 mRNA was significantly induced by Stat3-C in TERT cells. The upregulation of MEK5 by Stat3-C was further confirmed by Western blot in MCF10A breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, in MDA-MB-435s breast carcinoma cells, which express high levels of activated Stat3 and MEK5, MEK5 protein was significantly reduced by using Stat3 short interfering RNA. The reduction of MEK5 was consistent with Stat3 knockdown in this breast carcinoma cell line. We also investigated MEK5 expression in different breast carcinoma cell lines and breast cancer tissues using tissue array analysis. Compared with nonmalignant breast epithelial cells or normal tissues without constitutively active Stat3 signaling, MEK5 protein levels are remarkably higher in breast carcinoma cell lines and cancer tissues with constitutively activated Stat3. Taken together, our findings suggest that constitutively active Stat3 upregulates MEK5 in the breast epithelial cells.

Our recent work has shown that the missing region in Siva-2 encodes a unique twenty amino acid putative amphipathic helical region (SAH, residues 36-55 in Siva-1). Despite the fact that Siva-1 does not belong to the BCL-2 family, it specifically interacts with the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL and sensitizes MCF7 breast cancer cells expressing BCL-XL to UV radiation induced apoptosis. Deletion mutagenesis has mapped the necessary region to the SAH in Siva-1. In this paper we demonstrate that the SAH region in Siva-1 is sufficient to specifically interact with the anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family such as BCL-XL and BCL-2 but not its apoptotic member BAX. Using transient transfections and direct microinjection of synthetic SAH peptides, we also demonstrate that the SAH region is sufficient to inhibit the BCL-XL mediated cell survival and render MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 breast cancer cells expressing BCL-XL highly susceptible to UV radiation induced apoptosis. The underlying mechanism of action of SAH mediated inhibition of BCL-XL (and/or BCL2) cell survival appears to be due to loss of mitochondrial integrity as reflected in enhanced cytochrome c release leading to the activation of caspase 9 and finally caspase 3."

We demonstrate here that MCF-7 human breast cancer cells are sensitive to aminoflavone both in vitro and when grown in vivo as xenografts in athymic mice. As previous work has indicated that aminoflavone requires metabolic activation by cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), we investigated the effect of aminoflavone on CYP1A1 expression and on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcriptional regulator of CYP1A1. In aminoflavone-sensitive but not aminoflavone-resistant cells, the drug caused a 100-fold induction of CYP1A1 mRNA and a corresponding increase in ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity. An AhR-deficient variant of the MCF-7 breast carcinoma, AH(R100), with diminished CYP1A1 inducibility, exhibits cellular resistance to aminoflavone and is refractory to CYP1A1 mRNA induction by the drug. The increase in CYP1A1 mRNA in the aminoflavone-sensitive MCF-7 breast tumor cell results from transcriptional activation of xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE)-controlled transcription. Aminoflavone treatment causes a translocation of the AhR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus with subsequent formation of AhR-XRE protein DNA complexes. In contrast to the aminoflavone-sensitive MCF-7 cells, the resistant cell lines (MDA-MB-435, PC-3, and AH(R100)) demonstrated constitutive nuclear localization of AhR. Additionally, aminoflavone failed to induce ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity, CYP1A1 transcription, AhR-XRE complex formation, and apoptosis in aminoflavone-resistant cells. These results suggest that the cytotoxicity of aminoflavone in a sensitive breast tumor cell line is the result of the engagement of AhR-mediated signal transduction."

Coactivation of ERalpha by DRIP150 in ZR-75 cells was activation function 2-dependent and required an intact helix 12 that typically interacts with LXXLL motifs (NR box) in p160 steroid receptor coactivators. DRIP150 contains C- and N-terminal NR boxes (amino acids 1182-1186 and 69-73, respectively), and deletion analysis of DRIP150 showed that regions containing these sequences were not necessary for coactivation of ERalpha. Analysis of multiple DRIP150 deletion mutants identified a 23-amino-acid sequence (789-811) required for coactivation activity. Analysis of the protein crystal structure data base identified two regions at amino acids 789-794 and 795-804, which resembled alpha-helical motifs in Lanuginosa lipase/histamine N-methyltransferase and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1, respectively. By using a squelching assay and specific amino acid point mutations within each alpha-helix, the NIFSEVRVYN (795-804) region was identified as the critical sequence required for the activity of DRIP150. These results demonstrate that coactivation of ERalpha by DRIP150 in ZR-75 cells is NR box-independent and requires a novel sequence with putative alpha-helical structure."

NRP1 plays versatile roles in angiogenesis, axon guidance, cell survival, migration, and invasion. NRP1 contains three distinct extracellular domains, a1a2, b1b2, and c. We report here the identification of two novel soluble human NRP1 isoforms, which we named sIIINRP1 and sIVNRP1. These soluble NRP1 isoforms were generated by alternative splicing of the NRP1 gene, a common regulatory mechanism occurring in cell surface receptor families. Both sIIINRP1 and sIVNRP1 contain a1a2 and b1b2 domains, but no c domain, and the rest of the NRP1 sequence. Additionally, sIIINRP1 is missing 48 amino acids within the C-terminus of the b2 domain. Both sIIINRP1 and sIVNRP1 are expressed in human cancerous and normal tissues. These molecules are capable of binding to VEGF165 and Sema3A. Furthermore, recombinant sIIINRP1 and sIVNRP1 proteins inhibit NRP1-mediated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell migration. These results indicate the multiple levels of regulation in NRP1 function and suggest that these two novel NRP1 isoforms are useful antagonists for NRP1-mediated cellular activities."

Normal cells may also be exposed to hypoxia under certain physiological conditions. Tumor hypoxia has been shown to associate strongly with tumor propagation and malignant progression. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha is stable under hypoxia and induces transcription of target genes by binding to the hypoxia-response element (HRE). Here we investigated the oncolytic effects of a novel adenovirus mutant with a deleted E1B55 gene (Ad.Delta55.HRE), in which the expression of E1A, which is essential for adenoviral replication, is regulated under the control of an HRE-expression system. Ad.Delta55.HRE expressed E1A under normoxia and more E1A under hypoxia and exhibited oncolytic effects on various cultured tumor cells, but its cytotoxic effect is relatively attenuated in normal fibroblast cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Ad.Delta55.HRE lysed Huh-7 hepatoma cells stably expressing HIF-1alpha more effectively compared to parental cells. Ad.Delta55.HRE treatment exhibited significant antitumor activity in PC-3 prostate- and MDA-MB-435 breast tumor-bearing nude mice in which HIF-1alpha protein was immunohistochemically detected. The E1A and hexon proteins of adenovirus were immunostained in MDA-MB-435 xenografts after Ad.Delta55.HRE treatment, suggestive of viral replication. Our results suggest that Ad.Delta55.HRE may be useful for the treatment of solid tumors."

We have demonstrated a second-generation antisense antihuman-MDM2 oligonucleotide to have antitumor activity when administered alone or in combination with cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the antisense oligonucleotide on radiation therapy.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The in vitro radiosensitization activity was determined in cell lines of human cancers of prostate (LNCaP and PC3), breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468), pancreas (PANC-1), and glioma (U87-MG and A172) and its in vivo radiosensitization activity in xenograft models of LNCaP, PC3, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, and PANC-1.RESULTS: In cells containing at least one functional p53 allele (LNCaP, U87-MG, and A172), after specific inhibition of MDM2 expression, p53 and p21 levels were elevated. In LNCaP cells, the Bax level was increased, and Bcl-2 and E2F1 levels were decreased. In PC3 cells that are p53 null, after inhibition of MDM2 expression, Bax and p21 levels were elevated, and E2F1 levels were decreased. On the basis of in vitro clonogenic assay, the antisense oligonucleotide, in a sequence-specific manner, significantly increased radiation-induced antiproliferation effects. It also increased radiation-induced inhibitory effects on tumor growth in SCID or nude mice bearing LNCaP, PC3, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, and PANC-1 xenografts.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MDM2 has a role in radiation therapy of human cancers, regardless of p53 status, providing a basis for future development of MDM2 inhibitors, such as antisense oligonucleotides, as radiosensitizers."

We found that all-trans retinoic acid (RA) decreases IRS-1 protein levels in MCF-7, T47-D, and ZR75.1 breast cancer cells, which are growth arrested by RA, but not in the RA-resistant MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Based on prior reports of ubiquitin-mediated degradation of IRS-1, we investigated the ubiquitination of IRS-1 in RA-treated breast cancer cells. Two proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 and lactacystin, blocked the RA-mediated degradation of IRS-1, and RA increased ubiquitination of IRS-1 in the RA-sensitive breast cancer cells. In addition, we found that RA increases serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. To elucidate the signaling pathway responsible for this phosphorylation event, pharmacologic inhibitors were used. Two PKC inhibitors, but not a MAPK inhibitor, blocked the RA-induced degradation and serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. We demonstrate that RA activates PKC-delta in the sensitive, but not in the resistant cells, with a time course that is consistent with the RA-induced decrease of IRS-1. We also show that: (1) RA-activated PKC-delta phosphorylates IRS-1 in vitro, (2) PKC-delta and IRS-1 interact in RA-treated cells, and (3) mutation of three PKC-delta serine sites in IRS-1 to alanines results in no RA-induced in vitro phosphorylation of IRS-1. Together, these results indicate that RA regulates IRS-1 levels by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, involving a PKC-sensitive mechanism."

We reported previously that mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors induced apoptosis in nonanchored MDA-MB231 and HBC4 human breast cancer cells, whereas anchored cells remained viable. Here, we report that activation of the BH3-only protein BimEL is the major mechanism for induction of anoikis sensitivity by MEK inhibitors in MDA-MB231 and HBC4 cells. On treatment with MEK inhibitors, BimEL in MDA-MB231 and HBC4 cells rapidly increased, irrespective of the state of anchorage. However, it translocated to mitochondria only in nonanchored cells, explaining why attached cells remain viable. MDA-MB231 and HBC4 cells had exceedingly low basal levels of BimEL compared with other breast cancer cells, suggesting that maintenance of low BimEL amount is important for survival of these cells. MEK inhibitors also induced the electrophoretic mobility shift of BimEL, indicative of reduced phosphorylation. In vitro, BimEL was phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase on Ser(69), which resides in the BimEL-specific insert region. Using phosphospecific antibody against this site, we show that this residue is actually phosphorylated in cells. We also show that phosphorylation of Ser(69) promotes ubiquitination of BimEL. We conclude that MEK inhibitors sensitize MDA-MB231 and HBC4 cells to anoikis by blocking phosphorylation and hence degradation of BimEL, a mechanism that these cells depend on to escape anoikis."

Molecular epidemiological characterization was performed by plasmid profiling, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and mutation analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of gyrA by sequencing.RESULTS: Plasmid patterns of the current ciprofloxacin-resistant strains from India, Nepal and Bangladesh were very similar to those of the 1978, 1984 and 1994 epidemic isolates of S. dysenteriae 1, except for the presence of a new plasmid of approximately 2.6 MDa, which was found in one recent ciprofloxacin-resistant strain isolated in Bangladesh. PFGE analysis showed that the ciprofloxacin-resistant strains isolated in Bangladesh, India and Nepal belonged to a PFGE type (type A), which was possibly related to that of the 1984 and 1994 clone of S. dysenteriae 1, but different from 1978 epidemic strains. The current ciprofloxacin-resistant strains belong to five subtypes (A3-A7), all of which were found in India, but in Bangladesh and Nepal, only A3 existed. Mutation analysis of the QRDR of gyrA revealed that amino acid substitutions at positions 83 and 87 of ciprofloxacin-resistant strains isolated in Bangladesh were similar to those of the strains isolated in Nepal, but different (at position 87) from ciprofloxacin-resistant strains isolated in India.CONCLUSIONS: PFGE and mutation analysis of gyrA showed differences between the current ciprofloxacin-resistant S. dysenteriae 1 strains isolated in south Asia and those associated with epidemics in 1978, 1984 and 1994."

Here, we characterize activities of two &quot;Andro&quot; prohormones, androstenedione (A-dione) and 4-androsten-3beta,17beta-diol (A-diol) in MDA-MB-453 (MDA) and LNCaP cells. A-dione and A-diol, like cyproterone acetate, were partial agonists of transfected mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and endogenous prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoters. Different from bicalutamide but similar to CPA, both are inducers of LNCaP cell proliferation with only mild suppression of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-enhanced cell growth. Like bicalutamide and cyproterone acetate, A-dione and A-diol significantly antagonized DHT/R1881-induced PSA expression by up to 30% in LNCaP cells. Meanwhile, in MDA cells, EC(50)s for the MMTV promoter were between 10 and 100nM. Co-factor studies showed GRIP1 as most active for endogenous androgen receptor (AR), increasing MMTV transcription by up to five-fold, without substantially altering EC(50)s of DHT, A-dione or A-diol. Consistent with their transcriptional activities, A-dione and A-diol bound full-length endogenous AR from MDA or LNCaP cells with affinities of 30-70nM, although binding to expressed ligand-binding domain (LBD) was &gt;20-fold weaker. In contrast, DHT, R1881, and bicalutamide bound similarly to LBD or aporeceptor. Together, these data suggest that A-dione and A-diol are ligands for AR with partial agonist/antagonist activities in cell-based transcription assays. Binding affinities for both are most accurately assessed by AR aporeceptor complex. In addition to being testosterone precursors in vivo, either may impart its own transcriptional regulation of AR."

In the genetic dissection of common disease it is now recognised that thousands of samples and hundreds of thousands of markers, mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), will have to be analysed. In order to achieve these aims, both an ability to boost quantities of archived DNA and to genotype at low costs are highly desirable. We have investigated phi29 polymerase Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA)-generated DNA product (MDA product), in combination with highly multiplexed BeadArray genotyping technology. As part of a large-scale BeadArray genotyping experiment we made a direct comparison of genotyping data generated from MDA product with that from genomic DNA (gDNA) templates.RESULTS: Eighty-six MDA product and the corresponding 86 gDNA samples were genotyped at 345 SNPs and a concordance rate of 98.8% was achieved. The BeadArray sample exclusion rate, blind to sample type, was 10.5% for MDA product compared to 5.8% for gDNA.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the BeadArray technology successfully produces high quality genotyping data from MDA product. The combination of these technologies improves the feasibility and efficiency of mapping common disease susceptibility genes despite limited stocks of gDNA samples."

Current trends in the treatment of human breast cancer are with drug combinations that result in improved responses as well as the ability to use less toxic concentrations of the drugs. Here, we envisioned that combinations of conventional chemotherapeutic agents with novel compounds directed against breast cancer-associated FAS hyperactivity may provide increased efficacy over existing therapy for human breast cancer. Specifically, we examined the ability of the mycotoxin cerulenin, a potent and non-competitive inhibitor of FAS activity, to enhance the cytotoxic effects of vinorelbine (Navelbine), a derivative of vinca alkaloid that interferes with tubulin assembly and exhibits activity against metastatic breast cancer. SK-Br3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines were employed as models of high, moderate and low levels of FAS ('cerulenin-target'), respectively. Combinations of cerulenin with vinorelbine were tested for synergism, additivity or antagonism using the isobologram and the median-effect plot (Chou-Talalay) analyses. Breast cancer cells were either simultaneously exposed to cerulenin and vinorelbine for 24 h or sequentially to cerulenin for 24 h followed by vinorelbine for 24 h. Concurrent exposure to cerulenin and vinorelbine resulted in synergistic interactions in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, while additivity was found in SK-Br3 cells. Sequencing cerulenin followed by vinorelbine resulted in synergism for SK-Br3 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas it showed additive effects in MCF-7 cells. FAS activity blockade was found to synergistically enhance apoptosis-inducing activity of vinorelbine, as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for histone-associated DNA fragments. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating that breast cancer-associated FAS is playing an active role in human breast cancer chemosensitivity. We suggest that pharmacological inhibition of FAS activity is a novel molecular approach to enhance the cytotoxic effects of existing chemotherapeutic agents in human breast cancer."

Our previous studies suggested that these proteins are likely to functionally interact with one another. Here, we show that attenuation of endogenous PKCalpha expression (siPalpha) by RNA interference leads to reduced Ets1 protein expression in a variety of cancer cells. Pulse-chase experiments and treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 revealed that siPalpha interferes with both Ets1 protein synthesis and stability. The effect of siPalpha on Ets1 expression could be partially prevented by KN-93, suggesting that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), a modulator of Ets1 activity, may play a role in PKCalpha-dependent Ets1 regulation. In contrast, Ets1-regulating kinases ERK1/2 were not found to be involved in this process. To assess the importance of the PKCalpha/Ets1 interaction, we compared the biological responses of MDA-MB-231 cells to PKCalpha- and Ets1-specific siRNAs (siE1). While only siPalpha induced changes in cellular morphology and anchorage-independent growth, both siRNAs similarly affected cellular responses to the antitumor drug mithramycin A and to UV light. Microarray analyses further showed that the expression of a certain set of genes was equally affected by siPalpha and siE1. The data suggest that Ets1 serves as an effector for PKCalpha to fulfil certain functions in cancer cells."

Breast cancers can have an inherent or acquired resistance to docetaxel but the causes of this resistance remain unclear. However, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation are key mechanisms by which most chemotherapeutic agents exert their cytotoxic effects.METHODS: We created two docetaxel-resistant human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and performed cDNA microarray analysis to identify candidate genes associated with docetaxel resistance. Gene expression changes were validated at the RNA and protein levels by reverse transcription PCR and western analysis, respectively.RESULTS: Gene expression cDNA microarray analysis demonstrated reduced p27 expression in docetaxel-resistant breast cancer cells. Although p27 mRNA expression was found to be reduced only in MCF-7 docetaxel-resistant sublines (2.47-fold), reduced expression of p27 protein was noted in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 docetaxel-resistant breast cancer cells (2.83-fold and 3.80-fold, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that reduced expression of p27 is associated with acquired resistance to docetaxel in breast cancer cells. An understanding of the genes that are involved in resistance to chemotherapy may allow further development in modulating drug resistance, and may permit selection of those patients who are most likely to benefit from such therapies."

Here, we report the result of this experiment and describe the developmental expression pattern in the ventral midbrain of three of the isolated genes, HNF3alpha, synaptotagmin I, and Ebf3. Though not regulated by engrailed-1 and -2, the expression of all three genes is limited to mDA neurons and a few other brain areas. HNF3alpha appears in the precursors of mDA neurons at E9 and is expressed in the adult brain almost exclusively by this neuronal population. Synaptotagmin I is expressed from E14 into adulthood. Ebf3, in contrast, is transiently expressed during early postmitotic differentiation."

Both mRNAs were detected but with levels of expression lower than those found in normal breast epithelial cells. This downregulation was much more visible for DeltaLf since its expression was either significantly diminished (BT-20, MCF-7 cell lines) or practically absent (MDA-MB-231, T-47D, HBL 100 cell lines). In order to determine whether Lf gene products are useful prognosic tools, we further analyzed their expression levels in 99 primary breast cancer biopsies. DeltaLf transcripts were found in all of the samples, whereas Lf transcripts were found in 88% of them. Lf and DeltaLf expression levels were positively correlated (p = 0.003). Lf expression was related to tumor type with a higher recovery in lobular-type tumors (p = 0.04). DeltaLf expression was related to the histoprognostic grading (p = 0.02).

AS can be used to down-regulate the mRNA and protein expression by annealing to specific region of the target mRNA which is responsible for the malignancy. Glucose transporter 5 (Glut5) is a tissue specific transporter that can be found on breast cancer tissues but not on normal breast tissues. Therefore, it is of clinical interest to investigate whether AS against Glut5 mRNA can tackle breast cancer. In this study, two cell lines, MCF-7 which is estrogen-receptor positive and MDA-MB-231 which is estrogen-receptor negative, were used to mimic breast cancer tissues at early and late stages, respectively. A 15-base sequence around the start codon of Glut5 was used. It was found that AS against Glut5 exerted anti-proliferative effect on both of these two breast tumor cell lines and seemed to exert its effect via the suppression of expression of Glut5 proteins in the cells. AS against Glut5 exhibited no effect on human hepatoma HepG2 cells which do not possess any Glut5. The results imply an alternative way in treating breast tumor as the AS against Glut5, unlike tamoxifen, takes effect on breast tumor cells via suppressing the expression of Glut5 that they specifically possess, and regardless whether the breast tumors are estrogen dependent or not."

The efficacy of the whole genome amplification (WGA) method, termed multiple displacement amplification (MDA), was assessed for detecting heterozygous sequence variants, mutation scanning, and PCR for challenging segments. Fifteen common polymorphisms from 10 genes located on 8 chromosomes were genotyped by direct sequencing of 300 PCR products from 115 high-quality MDA-amplified DNA samples extracted by different methods. The GC content of these analyzed segments ranges from 30% to 69%. Genotyping results demonstrate 100% accuracy. For heterozygotes, the relative intensity of peaks generated by the two alleles is highly similar for genomic and MDA-amplified genomic DNA, independent of GC content. In contrast, one of four heterozygous loci was mistyped when lower quality MDA-amplified DNA samples were used. The results of single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP)-type of mutation scanningfor seven MDA-amplified DNA samples in four genes were concordant with the genomic DNA samples. PCR on MDA-amplified DNA was routinely successful for challenging 10- and 12-kb segments with GC content ranging from 30% to 80%, demonstrating that rather long segments, which are difficult to amplify with PCR, are amplified well with MDA.

The activity of this promoter is responsible for the ERalpha gene transcription in bone tissue. The methylation status of promoter F was here evaluated, for the first time, by direct sequencing of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA, at 10 CpG specific sites localized in a region of about 800 bp. An heterogeneous methylation pattern was observed. The most notable difference was found at four particular CpGs, distant from the exon F transcription start site, showing a methylation status that correlates with the expression level, being ERalpha mRNA transcription reduced in a partially methylated cells but preserved in demethylated cells. The other CpG sites, localized around the transcription start site, were always demethylated except for MG-63 cells showing the lowest level of ERalpha expression. By quantitative RT-PCR analysis we demonstrated that ERalpha gene expression was higher in primary osteoblasts than in bone-derived cells (MG-63 and SaOS-2) and in all cases the ERalpha mRNA is represented by the isoform F. The same 10 CpG sites were investigated in non-osseous cell lines and were found fully methylated in ERalpha-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and completely demethylated in ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells (MCF7). The overall results suggest that methylation of the CpG sites inside ERalpha gene promoter F here analyzed may contribute to ERalpha transcriptional control, directly or indirectly, influencing the tissue specific expression of the gene."

SCC-112 cDNA (6744 bp) encodes a longest open reading frame (ORF) comprised of 1297 amino acids, representing a approximately 150-kDa nuclear protein. SCC-112 mRNA and protein levels were relatively high during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle in MDA-MB 435 breast cancer cells. Transient expression of SCC-112 cDNA in COS-1 cells led to an increase in the number of cells in sub-G1 phase and enhanced activity of caspase-3, a downstream effector of apoptosis. Stable transfection of SCC-112 cDNA in MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells also led to an increase in the number of cells in sub-G1 phase ( approximately 2-3-fold), indicative of apoptosis. The examination of the paired sets of human normal and tumor tissues revealed that the SCC-112 mRNA level was significantly high in normal breast and kidney tissues as compared to the corresponding primary tumor tissues (P&lt;0.0001; breast, n=50, and kidney, n=20). Consistent with these observations, SCC-112 protein expression (150 kDa) was high in a majority of the normal renal tissues examined as compared to the matched renal tumor tissues (67%, 1.2-fold to&gt;10-fold, n=18). Taken together, these findings suggest that the SCC-112 gene expression is likely to be associated with normal cell growth and proliferation."

Signal peptides, located at the N-terminus of nascent secreted proteins, characteristically have three domains: (1) a basic domain at the N-terminus, (2) a central hydrophobic core, and (3) a carboxy-terminal cleavage region. In this study, we investigated whether alterations in the basic and/or the hydrophobic domains of a commonly used signal peptide from interleukin-2 (IL-2) affected secretion of two proteins: placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) and endostatin.METHODS: A series of modifications in the basic and/or hydrophobic domains of the IL-2 signal peptide were made by polymerase chain reaction with endostatin or AP plasmids as templates. Transfection of wild-type or modified IL-2 signal peptides fused in-frame with endostatin or AP were done with Superfect in vitro or by the hydrodynamic method in vivo.RESULTS: Increasing both the basicity and hydrophobicity of the signal peptide augmented the secretion of AP and endostatin by approximately 2.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively, from MDA-MB-435 cells in vitro. Over a range of DNA concentrations and times, the most effective IL-2 signal peptide increased AP levels in the medium compared to the wild-type IL-2 signal peptide. Comparable results from these modified IL-2 signal peptides were found to increase AP levels in the medium from bovine aortic endothelial cells. Moreover, the combined changes in basic and hydrophobic domains of the IL-2 signal peptide augmented serum levels of endostatin and placental AP by 3-fold when the optimal plasmid constructs were injected in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: Modification of the IL-2 signal peptide augments protein secretion both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, optimizing the signal peptide should be considered for increasing the therapeutic levels of secreted proteins."

We tested the hypothesis that up-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) will lead to methylation and silencing of uPA and inhibition of the invasiveness of metastatic breast cancer cells. Since RAS was previously shown to up-regulate DNA methylation, we examined the effects of ectopic expression of constitutively active RAS on methylation and expression of uPA. Transfection of Ha-RAS into MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells resulted in a significantly shorter cell doubling time compared with the controls. However, expression and activity of the metastatic gene uPA and invasive capacity of the cells were significantly reduced by the oncogene RAS. Silencing of uPA by RAS is mediated by a cis modification of the uPA promoter and not through an effect on a trans-acting factor, since a transiently transfected unmethylated uPA-luicferase reporter is expressed at a similar level in RAS-transfected and control cells. We then examined the levels of DNMT1 and methylated DNA-binding protein 2 (MBD2) expressions in these cells to determine whether this reduction in uPA expression is associated with changes in the DNA methylation machinery. Our results showed that ectopic expression of RAS induced DNMT1 expression and activity and inhibited MBD2 expression. Consistent with methylation-mediated repression, uPA was partially methylated in RAS-transfected cells and uPA expression was induced upon treatment of RAS transfectants with the demethylating agent 5'-azacytidine. These results therefore imply that the RAS-DNMT1 DNA methylation pathway which promotes oncogenic growth in many cancers can exert an opposite effect on the invasive capacity of the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells, thus illustrating the divergence of growth and metastasis promoting pathways in cancer. This has important implications for new therapeutic approaches to metastasizing cancer."

In an attempt to understand the role of ERalpha in regulating breast cancer cells invasiveness, we have demonstrated that cell adhesion on fibronectin (Fn) and type IV Collagen (Col) induces ERalpha-mediated transcription and reduces cell migration in MCF-7 and in MDA-MB-231 cell lines expressing ERalpha. Analysis of deleted mutants of ERalpha indicates that the transcriptional activation function (AF)-1 is required for ERalpha-mediated transcription as well as for the inhibition of cell migration induced by cell adhesion on extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In addition, the nuclear localization signal region and some serine residues in the AF-1 of the ERalpha are both required for the regulation of cell invasiveness as we have observed in HeLa cells. It is worth noting that c-Src activation is coincident with adhesion of cells to ECM proteins and that the inhibition of c-Src activity by PP2 or the expression of a dominant-negative c-Src abolishes ERalpha-mediated transcription and partially reverts the inhibition of cell invasiveness in ERalpha-positive cancer cells. These findings address the integrated role of ECM proteins and ERalpha in influencing breast cancer cell motility through a mechanism that involves c-Src and seems not to be related to a specific cell type."

The discovery of ERbeta, also present in breast cancer cells, has added a new level of complexity to this malignancy. To determine the retinoid response in ERbeta-expressing breast cancer cells, we used retroviral transduction of ERbeta in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence confirmed expression and nuclear localization of ERbeta, whereas functionality was shown using an estrogen response element-containing reporter. A significant retinoic acid (RA)-mediated growth inhibition was observed in the transduced ERbeta-positive cells as shown by proliferation assays. Addition of estradiol, tamoxifen, or ICI 182,780 had no effect on cell growth and did not alter RA sensitivity. We observed that retinoids altered ERbeta-mediated transcriptional activity from an estrogen response element, which was confirmed by decreased expression of the pS2 gene, and from an activator protein response element. Conversely, the expression of ERbeta altered RA receptor (RAR) beta expression, resulting in greater induction of RARbeta gene expression on RA treatment, without altered expression of RARalpha. Our data provide evidence of transcriptional crosstalk between ERbeta and RAR in ERbeta-positive breast cancer cells that are growth inhibited by RA."

It interacts through its cytoplasmic domain with beta-catenin which in turn interacts with the Wnt (wingless) signaling pathway. We have compared the effects of different tumor-derived E-cadherin variants with those of normal E-cadherin on Wnt signaling and on genes involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition. We established an in-house cDNA microarray composed of 1105 different, sequence verified cDNA probes corresponding to 899 unique genes that represent the majority of genes known to be involved in cadherin-dependent cell adhesion and signaling ('Adhesion/Signaling Array'). The expression signatures of E-cadherin-negative MDA-MB-435S cancer cells transfected with E-cadherin variants (in frame deletions of exon 8 or 9, D8 or D9, respectively, or a point mutation in exon 8 (D370A)) were compared to that of wild-type E-cadherin (WT) transfected cells. From the differentially expressed genes, we selected 38 that we subsequently analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and/or Northern Blot. A total of 92% of these were confirmed as differentially expressed. Most of these genes encode proteins of the cytoskeleton, cadherins/integrins, oncogenes and matrix metalloproteases. No significant expression differences of genes downstream of the Wnt-pathway were found, except in E-cadherin D8 transfected cells where upregulation of three Tcf/Lef-transcribed genes was seen. One possible reason for the lack of expression differences of the Tcf/Lef-regulated genes is upregulation of SFRP1 and SFRP3; both of which are competitive inhibitors of the Wnt proteins. Interestingly, known E-cadherin transcriptional repressors, such as SLUG (SNAI2), SIP1 (ZEB2), TWIST1, SNAIL (SNAI1) and ZEB1 (TCF8), but not E12/E47 (TCF3), had a lack of upregulation in cells expressing mutated E-cadherin compared to WT. In conclusion, E-cadherin mutations have no influence on expression of genes involved in Wnt-signaling, but they may promote their own expression by blocking upregulation of E-cadherin repressors."

Flow cytometry analysis showed a G(1)/S phase cell cycle-arrest after treatment of the cells with 10 microM lycopene for 48 h. mRNA expression was studied by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the Taqman method. We observed an increase of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA in the oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive cell lines (MCF-7 and HBL-100), and a decrease (MDA-MB-231) or no change (MCF-10a) in the ER-negative cell lines. BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins were quantified by perfusion affinity chromatography. No variation in their expression was observed. These preliminary results on the effects of lycopene on the expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 oncosuppressor genes in breast cancer may reflect cross-talk between the oestrogen and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) pathways."

Detailed understanding of these intricate effects is important for the understanding of cytotoxicity. In this study, we examined apoptosis induction by ellipticines, a class of cytotoxic plant alkaloids known to inhibit topoisomerase II. The potent ellipticine derivative 6-propanamine ellipticine (6-PA-ELL) induced rapid apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, preceded by a conformational change in Bak and cytochrome c release. Experiments using knock-out mouse embryo fibroblasts established that Bak was of particular importance for cytotoxicity. 6-PA-ELL increased the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperones GRP78/BiP and GRP94, suggesting induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Induction of GRP78 expression was dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum stress response element (ERSE) of the GRP78 promoter. Examination of different ellipticine derivatives revealed a correlation between pro-apoptotic activity and the ability to induce GRP78 expression. Furthermore, 6-PA-ELL was found to induce splicing of the mRNA encoding the XBP1 transcription factor, characteristic of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and to induce activation of the endoplasmic reticulum-specific caspase-12 in mouse colon cancer cells. We finally demonstrate that 6-PA-ELL induces apoptotic signaling also in enucleated cells, consistent with the existence of a cytoplasmic target for this compound. Our data suggest that induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress may contribute to the cytotoxicity of ellipticines."

Because ErbB signaling has been implicated in various angiogenic mechanisms, the effect of NTAK (which has at least nine isoforms due to alternative splicing) in angiogenesis is explored. One isoform, NTAKgamma, inhibited cell growth in terms of DNA synthesis and cell numbers in vascular endothelial cells specifically, whereas NTAKalpha and beta had no activity. On the other hand, NTAKgamma secreted by transfected MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited endothelial cell growth, and NTAKgamma expressed in endothelial cells by adenovirus infection suppressed cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. The EGF-like domain of NTAKgamma did not have this activity. The NTAKdelta isoform, which had the Ig-like domain but not the EGF-like domain, inhibited proliferation of endothelial cells. NTAKdelta prevented hyper-phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and caused G(1) arrest in endothelial cells. Both NTAKgamma and delta isoforms displayed anti-angiogenic activity in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane in vivo. These results suggest that the active site of NTAK is localized outside of the EGF-like domain but within the N-terminal region, including the Ig-like domain, of NTAK."

The human vimentin promoter contains multiple DNA elements, some of which enhance gene expression and one that inhibits. A silencer element (at -319) binds the repressor ZBP-89. Further upstream (at -757) is an element, which acts positively in the presence of the silencer element and, thus, is referred to as an antisilencer (ASE). Previously, we showed that Stat1alpha binds to this element upon induction by IFN-gamma. However, substantial binding and reporter gene activity was still present in nontreated cells. Here, we have found that Stat3 binds to the ASE element in vitro. Transfection experiments in COS-1 cells with various vimentin promoter--reporter constructs show that gene activity is dependent upon the cotransfection and activation of Stat3. Moreover, activated Stat3 can overcome ZBP-89 repression. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that Stat3 and ZBP-89 can interact and confocal microscopy detects these factors to be colocalized in the nucleus. Moreover, a correlation exists between the presence of activated Stat3 and vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is lacking in MCF7 cells where vimentin is not expressed. In the light of these results, we propose that the interaction of Stat3 and ZBP-89 may be crucial for overcoming the effects of the repressor ZBP-89, which suggests a novel mode for Stat3 gene activation."

Whether the induction of these cytokines by MDA-7 is mediated through activation of NF-kappaB or whether it regulates cytokine signaling is not known. In the present report we investigated the effect of MDA-7 on NF-kappaB activation and on TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation and apoptosis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Stable or transient transfection with mda-7 into 293 cells failed to activate NF-kappaB. However, TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation was significantly enhanced in mda-7-transfected cells, as indicated by DNA binding, p65 translocation, and NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression. Mda-7 transfection also potentiated NF-kappaB reporter activation induced by TNF receptor-associated death domain and TNF receptor-associated factor-2. Cytoplasmic MDA-7 with deleted signal sequence was as effective as full-length MDA-7 in potentiating TNF-induced NF-kappaB reporter activity. Secretion of MDA-7 was not required for the potentiation of TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation. TNF-induced expression of the NF-kappaB-regulated gene products cyclin D1 and cyclooxygenase-2, were significantly up-regulated by stable expression of MDA-7. Furthermore, MDA-7 expression abolished TNF-induced apoptosis, and suppression of NF-kappaB by IkappaBalpha kinase inhibitors enhanced apoptosis. Overall, our results indicate that stable or transient MDA-7 expression alone does not substantially activate NF-kappaB, but potentiates TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation and NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression. Potentiation of NF-kappaB survival signaling by MDA-7 inhibits TNF-mediated apoptosis."

These are the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive, weakly invasive, luminal epithelial-like MCF-7 and the ERalpha-negative, highly invasive, fibroblast-like MDA-MB-231. They express constitutively low and high PKC activities, respectively. After a 24-h exposition to 100 nM PMA, the number of genes showing an altered expression at the 2-fold change level was much higher in MCF-7 (n=435) than in MDA-MB-231 (n=18) BCC. Four of these genes, namely CDC2, CENPA, NR4A1 and MMP10, were altered in the same way in both cell lines. Two genes were regulated in an opposite way: ID1 and EVA1. Many of the genes down-regulated in MCF-7 BCC appeared to be preferentially expressed in the G1, S, and/or G2 phases of the cell cycle. The ERalpha gene, ESR1, and other genes associated to the ERalpha-positive, luminal epithelial-like BCC phenotype were down-regulated, while a series of genes related to a more aggressive, fibroblast-like BCC phenotype were up-regulated. Other altered genes were notably linked to cell architecture, supporting profound effects of PMA on cell morphology and motility, as well as on the interactions between BCC and their neighboring proteins. Of note, all the modulated genes involved in proteolysis and its control were up-regulated. In summary, PMA effects suggest that PKC activation may induce, to some extent, a more fibroblast-like phenotype in the ERalpha-positive, luminal epithelial-like MCF-7 BCC, and significantly modulate the interactions of these cells with their environment."

Some bivalves and annelids have hemoglobins that are capable of binding sulfide for detoxification and/or transporting it to internal bacterial symbionts. Annelids living in the sulfide-rich environments have giant (approximately 3.6 MDa) hemoglobin, consisting of 144 globin chains arranged in a hexagonal bilayer structure held together by 36 nonglobin linker chains. Some globin chains contain either a free cysteine residue at positions Cys+1 or at position Cys+11 relative to the E7 distal residue in the E helix and EF interhelical region, respectively, which bind sulfide. The hexagonal bilayer hemoglobins of annelids living in environments lacking sulfide, do not have the corresponding free cysteine residues and cannot bind sulphide. Given that the early stages of life occurred under anoxic conditions in the presence of sulfide, it is possible that the sulfide binding function from modern annelid globins inhabiting sulphide rich habitats is an evolutionary relic. This proposal seems supported by the recent finding of &quot;protoglobins&quot; which also have a corresponding cysteine residue in Archea known to exist in hyperthermophilic and sulfide-rich environments."

The cDNAs were expressed in the libraries as fusion to bacteriophage lambda protein D. Lambda-displayed libraries were efficiently screened with sera from patients with breast cancer.RESULTS: A panel of 21 clones representing 18 different antigens, including eight proteins of unknown function, was identified. Three of these antigens (T7-1, T11-3 and T11-9) were found to be overexpressed in tumors as compared to normal breast.

We investigated the effect of sequence and time interval between administration of both drugs on the severity of cardiotoxicity of the combination. Male Wistar rats were divided into seven groups. DOX was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a single dose of 5 mg x kg(-1) every other 2 days, 2 doses per week for a total cumulative dose of 20 mg x kg(-1). PTX was administered by an i.p. route at a dose of 20 mg x kg(-1) every other 2 days. Both drugs were injected either alone or sequentially in combination. In one case, DOX preceded PTX by 30 min and 24 h and in the other case, PTX preceded DOX by 30 min and 24 h. Cardiotoxicity was evaluated by both biochemical and histopathological examination, 48 h after the last DOX dose. DOX-induced cardiotoxicity was manifested by abnormal biochemical changes including marked increases in serum creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity levels. Myocardial tissue from DOX-treated rats showed significant increases in malondialdehyde (MDA) production and total nitrate/nitrite (NOx) levels, parallel with depletion of &quot;endogenous antioxidant reserve,&quot; including GSH contents and GSH-Px activity level. PTX treatment produced significant changes in the biochemical parameters measured by a lower magnitude than those changes produced by DOX alone. Combination of both drugs resulted in aggravation of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity regardless the sequence and time interval between administration of either drug. Administration of PTX 30 min and 24 h after DOX treatment showed exaggeration of combination-induced cardiotoxicity compared with the reverse sequence. This exacerbation was manifested by much more pronounced changes in serum and cardiac tissue parameters measured. Histopathological examination of ventricles of rat's heart revealed that DOX treatment produced myo-cytolysis and myocardial necrosis. Administration of PTX following DOX treatment showed extensive myocardial necrosis compared with those rats treated with either DOX alone or the reverse sequence of administration. Moreover, rats treated with PTX 24 h after DOX treatment showed exaggeration of the combination-induced cardiotoxicity. In conclusion, PTX might synergistically aggravate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.

DMN was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats for 2 and 5 weeks to induce different degrees of hepatic fibrosis. Liver tissues were assessed for the degree of fibrosis and gene expression. Histological examination of the liver showed a progressive increase in fibrosis scores (1.33 +/- 0.21 and 3.03 +/- 0.29, respectively) and expansion of fibrous septa with collagen-staining fibers in rats after 2 and 5 weeks of DMN administration. Hepatic protein contents of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and total collagen were significantly higher in rats administered DMN for both 2 and 5 weeks compared with those in control rats. Hepatic mRNA expressions of alpha-SMA, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), connective tissue growth factor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and procollagen I and III were increased in DMN rats after 2 and 5 weeks. Abnormal increases in plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, plasma and mitochondrial MDA levels, and portal venous pressure were also noted in DMN rats. DMN administration to rats for 2 and 5 weeks induced progressive increases in hepatic fibrosis scores, hepatic mRNA expressions of TGF-beta1 and procollagen I and III genes, plasma levels of ALT and AST, and portal venous pressure, as well as progressive decreases in both liver and body weights.

Once delivered into cells, decoy ODNs are predicted to bind to nuclear transcription factors, preventing their binding to consensus sequences in target genes. Using a fluorescein-labeled decoy ODN containing a consensus sequence for the AP-1 transcription factor, we show that lipid-complexed decoys were readily transfectable into cells, but were consistently detectable in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus. The same phenomenon was observed in three different cell lines including KB-3, CHO and MDA-MB-231. The AP-1 decoy ODNs failed to inhibit the transcriptional activity of an AP-1-dependent luciferase reporter. The effect of cytoplasmic AP-1 decoy ODNs on the subcellular localization and function of c-Jun induced by the microtubule inhibitor vinblastine, which strongly induced c-Jun expression, was assessed. No difference in protein level or nuclear localization of vinblastine-induced c-Jun, or of one of its target genes, p53, was noted when cells were transfected with wild-type or mutated forms of the decoy ODNs. We suggest that subcellular localization is an unappreciated and key limiting factor for the use of transcription factor decoy ODNs that must be addressed before meaningful data interpretation can be made."

Here, we compare the capability of oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative cells (MDA-231) versus ER-positive tamoxifen-sensitive cells (MCF-7) to handle DNA repair, transmit signals from damaged DNA, initiate cell death via apoptosis, and then to control transmitted signals from the cell cycle and to synthesize growth factors and receptors. Genes related to these events were studied by cDNA micro-array. Normal human breast cells (H2F) and human lymphoblastoid tumour cells (CEM) were used as controls. Of the 18 genes investigated, 10 genes showed differences in their expression between the cell types. The ER-negative cells showed higher expressions of BRCA1, BRCA2, cdc2, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, cyclin E, IGFBP-3, TGF-alpha, TGF beta 2 and a lower expression of TGF beta R1. No differences in the expressions of bax, bcl-2, p53, p21 and GADD45 were found between the two cell lines. We found that the ER-negative cells were characterized by: (1) a stimulated expression of growth factors and cell cycle regulation compounds, (2) improved DNA repair capacity, but (3) no change in DNA damage signals and apoptotic pathways. Improved DNA repair capacity of ER-negative cells would have a growth advantage over ER-positive tumours when receiving antitumour therapy."

Previously, we identified a rat gene named mob-5, which encodes a secreted protein that shares a high degree of homology with human IL-24. Expression of mob-5 and its putative cell surface receptors was shown to be upregulated by oncogenic ras. Here we show that not only do rat mob-5 and human IL-24 share a strikingly similar genomic structure but also that the rat MOB-5 protein can bind to and signal through the human IL-24 receptors. Like human IL-24, binding of the rat MOB-5 protein to the human IL-24 receptors leads to activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, which in turn supports receptor-dependent survival and proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. Furthermore, using human colon cancer cell lines with somatic knockout of either the mutant or the wild-type k-ras allele, we demonstrate that the human IL-24 receptors also are upregulated by oncogenic ras. Taken together, these results provide strong experimental evidence that MOB-5 is indeed the rat homolog of human IL-24."

However, the downstream pathways involved in nm23-mediated suppression of metastasis have not been elucidated. In the present investigation, we used cDNA microarrays to identify novel genes and functional pathways in nm23-mediated spontaneous breast metastasis. Microarray experiments were performed in a pair of cell lines, namely, C-100 (only vector transfected; highly metastatic) and H1-177 (nm23 transfected; low metastatic), derived from human mammary carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-435. The cDNA microarray analysis using GeneSpring software revealed significant as well as consistent alterations in the expression (up- and downregulation) of 2158 genes in a total of 18889 genes between high and low metastatic cells. Some of these genes were grouped into 6 functional categories, namely, invasion and metastasis, apoptosis and senescence, signal transduction molecules and transcription factors, cell cycle and repair, adhesion, and angiogenesis to extrapolate an association between these genes and different functional pathways involved in nm23-regulated metastasis. The results suggest that nm23 gene plays a major role in metastasis and its mechanism of action of metastasis suppression may involve downregulation of genes associated with cell adhesion, motility (integrins alpha2, -8, -9, -L and -V, collagen type VIII alpha1, fibronectin 1, catenin, TGF-beta2, FGF7, MMP14 and 16, ErbB2) and possibly certain tumor/metastasis suppressors (2 members of SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated proteins 2 and 5 and PTEN)."

The 5' region of the two transcripts contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs) encoding potential peptides of 20 and 18 amino acids. The peptides have five C-terminal residues in common. These studies were undertaken to determine if the uORFs and encoded peptides differentially affected expression of ER. Expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs containing upstream proximal promoter transcript sequences with the first 18 codons of ER fused to GFP was tested in HeLa cells. The cells expressed reduced levels of GFP as compared to the pEGFP-N1 parent vector; the effect was dependent on the presence of an intact proximal ER transcript uORF. Similar regulation by the uORF was seen in transfected MCF-7, MDA MB-231 and Ishikawa cells. Only protein expression was affected by eliminating the uORF; RNA levels were unchanged. This indicates the mechanism is translational rather than being an effect of the introduced point mutations on either mRNA stability or transcription. Eliminating the uORF did not significantly increase expression from similar distal promoter transcript ER-GFP constructs. However, study of in-frame fusions of GFP to the entire proximal and distal uORFs and to their translational start motifs showed that the translational start region of the distal uORF was inherently better at initiating translation than the AUG environment of the proximal promoter transcript uORF. The data indicate there are regulatory properties suppressing expression from the ER translation start which are specific to the unique regions of the ER proximal promoter transcript and these are likely associated with the proximal transcript uORF peptide product."

Its clinical use is limited by the presence of some undesired side effects, like as oto- and nephro toxicity, whose mechanisms of action are not understood. One of the possible CDDP toxicity mechanism seems to involve the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), that can impair morphology and function of hair cells (HC) in the organ of Corti. To test this hypothesis we evaluated the effect of CDDP treatment on RNA steady-state levels of 15,000 genes by microarray analysis, using, as a experimental model, the OC-k3 cell line, obtained from the organ of Corti of transgenic mice and constitutively expressing the large SV40 T antigen. We have found overexpression of several genes related to arachidonate mobilization including phospholipase A2, group IV and V, phospholipase A2 activating protein and lysophospholipase I and III, as well as lipoxygenation like arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein. In addition, we found significant transcription of genes regulating cell respiration, including cyt c oxidase, as well as genes involved in xenobiotic detoxification and lipid peroxidation such as cyt P450, and other oxidases including spermine oxidase and monoamine oxidase. As a whole, overexpression of the group of different genes seems to indicate that an oxidative burst could take place during cisplatin administration. We therefore searched for evidences of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by means of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and flow cytometry, but failed to detect them. On the other hand, we found an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) synthesis and protein carbonylation products, indicating the occurence of lipid peroxidative degradation. When we tested the effectiveness of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), dithiothreitol (DTT) and N-acetylcysteine (N-Ac) as cytoprotectants, all of them reduced protein carbonylation to control levels and significantly protected OC-k3 from CDDP-induced cell death, with an higher protection when using the lipophylic antioxidant BHT. The same antioxidants prevented also the onset of protein carbonylation, which extent was decreased to basal levels. These data indicate that CDDP is able to stimulate gene expression up to 12 h after the beginning of the treatment. This increase in gene transcription involves a large number of genes potentially able to increase the level of cell ROS. Consistently, cells survival is improved by cotreatment with antioxidants, in particular lipophilics."

The same finding was detected in rats that were drunk by Maotai liquor continued for 56 days. This study was to investigate the effects of Maotai liquor on the liver and its mechanism of preventing hepatic fibrosis.METHODS: After ingestion of Maotai for 56 consecutive days, male SD rats were killed for detecting the levels of metallothionein and malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver tissues. Rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and human HSCs were cultured in vitro to observe the effect of Maotai on HSCs proliferation and collagen synthesis. After ingestion of Maotai for 14 consecutive weeks, the livers of male SD rats were harvested for pathohistological examination.RESULTS: The level of metallothionein in the liver of Maotai-induced rats increased by 22 folds, whereas the levels of hepatic lipid peroxide and MDA was decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) in Maotai-induced animals suffering from CCl4. Maotai demonstrated obvious inhibitory effect on proliferation of HSCs and the inhibition was concentration-dependent. Gene expression and protein secretion of collagens could also be inhibited by Maotai. In alcoholic group, typical liver cirrhosis was observed. In Maotai group, however, though fatty degeneration of hepatocytes and mild fibrosis of the interstitium were observed, no obvious hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis were found.CONCLUSION: It might be an important mechanism of interfering the progress of hepatic fibrosis that Maotai increases the level of metallothionein in the liver and inhibits the activation of HSCs and the synthesis of collagen proteins."

Several recent studies have demonstrated that expression of human X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) is associated with ERalpha status in breast tumors and overexpressed in a subset of breast tumors. XBP-1 has two splicing variants, which were designated as XBP-1S and XBP-1U, respectively. However, little is known about the expression pattern of XBP-1S and XBP-1U in breast cancer cells and about their roles in ERalpha signaling. In this study, the expression of two splicing forms of XBP-1 was detected in breast cancer cell lines with RT-PCR. Estrogen response element (ERE) -containing luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the effects of XBP-1S and XBP-1U on the transcription activity of ERalpha in MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. The result showed that both XBP-1S and XBP-1U enhanced the transcription activity of ERalpha in a hormone-independent and dose-dependent manner and the activity of of XBP-1S is higher than that of XBP-1U. Enhancement of ERE-containing luciferase reporter gene expression by XBP-1S and XBP-1U was dependent on ERalpha.

The cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is frequently down-regulated or mutated in tumors. In addition to down-regulation of cell adhesion, degradation of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases is necessary for tumor cell spread. To investigate a possible link between E-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), we examined expression of MMP-3 in human MDA-MB-435S cells transfected with wild-type (wt) or three different tumor-associated mutant E-cadherin variants with alterations in exons 8 or 9, originally identified in gastric carcinoma patients. In the presence of wt E-cadherin, the MMP-3 protein level was decreased in cellular lysates and in the supernatant where a secreted form of the protein is detectable. Down-regulation of MMP-3 was not found in MDA-MB-435S transfectants expressing mutant E-cadherin variants which indicates that E-cadherin mutations interfere with the MMP-3 suppressing function of E-cadherin. The mechanism of regulation of MMP-3 by E-cadherin is presently not clear. We have previously found that cell motility is enhanced by expression of the mutant E-cadherin variants used in this study. Here, we found that application of the synthetic inhibitor of MMP-3 NNGH and small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against MMP-3 reduce mutant E-cadherin-enhanced cell motility. Taken together, our results point to a functional link between MMP-3 and E-cadherin. MMP-3 is differentially regulated by expression of wt or mutant E-cadherin. On the other hand, MMP-3 plays a role in the enhancement of cell motility by mutant E-cadherin. Both observations may be highly relevant for tumor progression since they concern degradation of the extracellular matrix and tumor cell spread."

High expression of MUC1 is associated with aggressive tumors, and MUC1 antigen is used as a marker to monitor disease progression in breast cancer patients. Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that the overexpression of MUC1 contributes to cancer progression and metastasis. In this report, we demonstrate that the naturally occurring cancer preventative, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), inhibits the expression of MUC1 in breast cancer cells. I3C inhibited both MUC1 mRNA and protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This inhibition was seen in the estrogen responsive MCF-7 cells as well as unresponsive MDA-MB-468 cells, indicating that the inhibitory pathway is independent of estrogen receptor. Gene expression studies using the human MUC1 gene promoter connected to a luciferase reporter demonstrated that I3C inhibits the transcription of the MUC1 gene. Promoter deletion studies indicate that the region containing up to 600 bp upstream (-600) of the initiation site is sufficient for inhibition by I3C. Furthermore, I3C represses the activation of transcription mediated by the region between -600 and -450 bp. A putative xenobiotic response element was located within this region but the binding of AhR/Arnt heterodimer to this site was undetectable by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Our results may point to the existence of a novel pathway of transcriptional inhibition by I3C in cancer cells as well as a new mechanism of MUC1 gene inhibition.

Consequently, we have studied the role of the FoxO transcription factors in determining cellular response to paclitaxel. Western blotting revealed that in a panel of nine breast cancer cell lines expression of FoxO1a and FoxO3a correlated with the expression of the pro-apoptotic FoxO target Bim, which was associated with paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. In MCF-7 cells, which were paclitaxel-sensitive, the already high basal levels of FoxO3a and Bim protein increased dramatically after drug treatment, as did Bim mRNA, which correlated with apoptosis induction. This was not observed in MDA-231 cells, which expressed low levels of FoxOs and Bim. Gene reporter experiments demonstrated that in MCF-7 cells maximal induction of Bim promoter was dependent on a FoxO binding site, suggesting that FoxO3a is responsible for the transcriptional up-regulation of Bim. Gene silencing experiments showed that small interference RNA (siRNA) specific for FoxO3a reduced the levels of FoxO3a and Bim protein as well as inhibited apoptosis in paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, siRNA specific for Bim reduced the levels of Bim protein and inhibited apoptosis in paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells.

In cancer, some genes are repressed by the inappropriate recruitment of HDACs, e.g., tumor suppressor genes. To understand the genomic effects of HDAC inhibition on gene transcription we studied the gene expression profiles of T24 bladder and MDA breast carcinoma cells treated with three HDAC inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, trichostatin A, and MS-27-275. The gene expression profiles of the HDAC inhibitors were generally similar to one another and differed substantially from those produced by structurally related inactive analogues; consequently, the changes in gene expression are mechanism-based. Hierarchical clustering of expression profiles demonstrated a greater similarity between the two hydroxamate-containing inhibitors (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and trichostatin A) than with MS-27-275. This difference was also supported by cell phenotypic experiments. As many genes were down-regulated as up-regulated by HDAC inhibitor treatment. Comparison of the data sets defined a common (&quot;core&quot;) set of 13 genes regulated by all of the HDAC inhibitors in three cell lines, 8 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated. Ten of 13 genes were confirmed in dose response studies in T24 cells by quantitative-PCR.

In the absence of stress, inactivation of Parc induces nuclear localization of endogenous p53 and activates p53-dependent apoptosis. Overexpression of Parc promotes cytoplasmic sequestration of ectopic p53. Furthermore, abnormal cytoplasmic localization of p53 was observed in a number of neuroblastoma cell lines; RNAi-mediated reduction of endogenous Parc significantly sensitizes these neuroblastoma cells in the DNA damage response.

Deletion analyses show that the carboxyl-terminal 42 amino acids of BRMS1 are not critical for interaction with much of the mSin3 complex and that BRMS1 appears to have more than one binding point to the complex.

MDA induced up to a 15-fold increase in mutation frequency in the supF reporter gene compared with untreated DNA. Sequence analysis revealed that the majority of MDA-induced mutations occurred at GC base pairs. The most frequent mutations were large insertions and deletions, but base pair substitutions were also detected. MDA-induced mutations were completely abolished when the adducted shuttle vector was replicated in cells lacking nucleotide excision repair. MDA induction of large deletions and the apparent requirement for nucleotide excision repair suggested the possible involvement of a DNA interstrand cross-link as a premutagenic lesion. Indeed, MDA formed interstrand cross-links in duplex plasmids and oligonucleotides. Substrates containing the sequence 5'-d(CG) were preferentially cross-linked, consistent with the observation of base pair substitutions in 5'-d(CG) sites in the MDA-induced mutation spectrum. These experiments provide biological and biochemical evidence for the existence of MDA-induced DNA interstrand cross-links that could result from endogenous oxidative stress and likely have potent biological effects."

Using a differentiation induction subtraction hybridization (DISH) approach with human melanoma cells, melanoma differentiation associated (mda) genes were isolated that display elevated expression as a function of irreversible growth arrest, cancer reversion and terminal differentiation. This screening paradigm resulted in the cloning of mda-7 in the context of terminal differentiation of human melanoma cells. Based on its structure, chromosomal location, sequence homology and cytokine-like properties, mda-7 has now been renamed IL-24 and classified as a member of the expanding IL-10 cytokine gene family. Expression of mda-7/IL-24 inversely correlates with melanoma progression and administration of mda-7/IL-24 by means of a replication incompetent adenovirus, Ad.mda-7, results in growth suppression and apoptosis in melanoma cells as well as in a broad-spectrum of additional cancer cell types. In contrast, Ad.mda-7 does not elicit deleterious effects in normal cells, including those of epithelial, fibroblast, astrocyte, melanocyte or endothelial origin. Based on these distinctive properties and anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activities in human tumor xenograft animal models, mda-7/IL-24 has now entered the clinical arena. A Phase I/II clinical trial in patients with advanced carcinomas involving intratumoral administration of mda-7/IL-24 [using a replication incompetent adenovirus; ING241 (Ad.mda-7)] has documented that this gene is safe and well tolerated by patients and a single virus injection elicits apoptosis in a majority of the tumor. Current data suggests that mda-7/IL-24 may function as a dual-acting cytokine in which its normal physiological functions may be related to specific aspects of the immune system and over-expression culminates in cancer-specific apoptosis. This review will provide a prospectus of our current understanding of mda-7/IL-24."

CTIP1 and CTIP2 are also sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that repress transcription through direct, COUP-TF-in-dependent binding to a GC-rich response element. CTIP1- and CTIP2-mediated transcriptional repression is insensitive to trichostatin A, an inhibitor of known class I and II histone deacetylases. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that expression of CTIP2 in mammalian cells resulted in deacetylation of histones H3 and/or H4 that were associated with the promoter region of a reporter gene. CTIP2-mediated transcriptional repression, as well as deacetylation of promoter-associated histones H3/H4 in CTIP2-transfected cells, was reversed by nicotinamide, an inhibitor of class III histone deacetylases such as the mammalian homologs of yeast Silent Information Regulator 2 (Sir2). The human homolog of yeast Sir2, SIRT1, was found to interact directly with CTIP2 and was recruited to the promoter template in a CTIP2-dependent manner. Moreover, SIRT1 enhanced the deacetylation of template-associated histones H3/H4 in CTIP2-transfected cells, and stimulated CTIP2-dependent transcriptional repression. Finally, endogenous SIRT1 and CTIP2 co-purified from Jurkat cell nuclear extracts in the context of a large (1-2 mDa) complex. These findings implicate SIRT1 as a histone H3/H4 deacetylase in mammalian cells and in transcriptional repression mediated by CTIP2."

In vivo, PIC assembly is a major point of regulation by sequence-specific transcription regulators (activators and repressors) and is hindered by the packaging of promoter DNA into nucleosomes and higher order chromatin structures. Genetic and biochemical studies have recently identified a variety of transcription cofactors/co-regulators (coactivators and corepressors) that interact with sequence-specific regulators and/or various components of the general/basal transcription machinery and are essential for regulated transcription. An emerging view from these studies is that regulators must target two types of transcription cofactors: chromatin-modifying/remodeling cofactors and general cofactors that associate with and/or influence the activities of components of the general/basal transcription machinery. The recent biochemical identification and characterization of many different chromatin-modifying and general transcription cofactors has revealed their often complex multi-subunit nature and a previously unsuspected level of structural and functional redundancy. Another emerging theme is the multi-functional nature of chromatin-modifying cofactor complexes that appear to couple gene-specific transcription to other cellular processes."

The PcG proteins ESC and E(Z) are present in a prominent 600-kDa complex as well as in a number of higher-molecular-mass complexes. Here we identify and characterize a 1-MDa ESC/E(Z) complex that is distinguished from the 600-kDa complex by the presence of the PcG protein Polycomblike (PCL) and the histone deacetylase RPD3. In addition, the 1-MDa complex shares with the 600-kDa complex the histone binding protein p55 and the PcG protein SU(Z)12. Coimmunoprecipitation assays performed on embryo extracts and gel filtration column fractions indicate that, during embryogenesis E(Z), SU(Z)12, and p55 are present in all ESC complexes, while PCL and RPD3 are associated with ESC, E(Z), SU(Z)12, and p55 only in the 1-MDa complex. Glutathione transferase pulldown assays demonstrate that RPD3 binds directly to PCL via the conserved PHD fingers of PCL and the N terminus of RPD3. PCL and E(Z) colocalize virtually completely on polytene chromosomes and are associated with a subset of RPD3 sites. As previously shown for E(Z) and RPD3, PCL and SU(Z)12 are also recruited to the insertion site of a minimal Ubx Polycomb response element transgene in vivo. Consistent with these biochemical and cytological results, Rpd3 mutations enhance the phenotypes of Pcl mutants, further indicating that RPD3 is required for PcG silencing and possibly for PCL function. These results suggest that there may be multiple ESC/E(Z) complexes with distinct functions in vivo."

Considering its unique structure, consisting of a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and an RNA helicase domain, it was hypothesized that mda-5 contributes to apoptosis occurring during terminal differentiation. We have currently examined the expression pattern of mda-5 in normal tissues, during induction of terminal differentiation and after treatment with type I IFNs. In addition, we have defined its genomic structure and chromosomal location. IFN-beta, a type I IFN, induces mda-5 expression in a biphasic and dose-dependent manner. Based on its temporal kinetics of induction and lack of requirement for prior protein synthesis mda-5 is an early type I IFN-responsive gene. The level of mda-5 mRNA is in low abundance in normal tissues, whereas expression is induced in a spectrum of normal and cancer cells by IFN-beta. Expression of mda-5 by means of a replication incompetent adenovirus, Ad.mda-5, induces apoptosis in HO-1 cells as confirmed by morphologic, biochemical and molecular assays. Additionally, the combination of Ad.mda-5+MEZ further augments apoptosis as observed in Ad.null or uninfected HO-1 cells induced to terminally differentiate by treatment with IFN-beta+MEZ. The mda-5 gene is located on human chromosome 2q24 and consists of 16 exons, without pseudogenes, and is conserved in the mouse genome. Present data documents that mda-5 is a novel type I IFN-inducible gene, which may contribute to apoptosis induction during terminal differentiation and during IFN treatment.

Recently, studies have shown that MUC1 interacts with beta-catenin, erbB receptors, src, GSK-3beta and protein kinase Cdelta, possibly in a complex that promotes the disassembly of adherens junctions and the invasion of cells. Here we show that the deletion of Muc1 expression from MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic mice results in a significant increase in the time to mammary gland tumor onset. Analysis of MMTV-Wnt-1 tumors on a wild-type Muc1 background shows a tumor-specific complex formation between Muc1 and beta-catenin that can be observed in both the membrane and the cytoplasm of transformed epithelium. Analysis of primary human adenocarcinomas revealed that this MUC1/beta-catenin interaction occurs in both primary and metastatic tumors, but is dramatically increased in metastatic lesions. Addition of MUC1-cytoplasmic domain peptides to the invasive MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines increases their invasive capability, and these peptides colocalize with both beta-catenin and the focal adhesion protein vinculin, primarily at sites of membrane invasion into a collagen matrix. These data indicate a potential mechanism for MUC1 promotion of invasive tumorigenesis in the breast through the modulation of beta-catenin localization and subsequent cytoskeletal dynamics."

This difference comes essentially from the lower aggressiveness and invasiveness of ER-positive tumors. Here, we demonstrate, that interleukin-8 (IL-8) was clearly overexpressed in most ER-negative breast, ovary cell lines and breast tumor samples tested, whereas no significant IL-8 level could be detected in ER-positive breast or ovarian cell lines. We have also cloned human IL-8 from ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, and we show that IL-8 produced by breast cancer cells is identical to monocyte-derived IL-8. Interestingly, the invasion potential of ER-negative breast cancer cells is associated at least in part with expression of IL-8, but not with IL-8 receptor levels. Moreover, IL-8 increases the invasiveness of ER-positive breast cancer cells by two fold, thus confirming the invasion-promoting role of IL-8. On the other hand, exogenous expression of estrogen receptors in ER-negative cells led to a decrease of IL-8 levels. In summary, our data show that IL-8 expression is negatively linked to ER status of breast and ovarian cancer cells. We also support the idea that IL-8 expression is associated with a higher invasiveness potential of cancer cells in vitro, which suggests that IL-8 could be a novel marker of tumor aggressiveness."

Although it is evident that 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits growth of both estrogen receptor alpha-positive [ER alpha(+)] and -negative [ER alpha(-)] breast cancer cells, the cellular pathways contributing to these effects remain unclear. We studied the gene expression patterns in ER alpha(+) MCF-7 and ER alpha(-) MDA MB 231 human breast cancer cells following 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, using cDNA expression arrays. Both cell lines showed a significant induction of the 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent 24-hydroxylase gene, a marker for the actions of 1,25(OH)2D3. In MCF-7 cells, 51 genes were up-regulated and 19 genes were down-regulated. The up-regulated genes encoded cell adhesion molecules, growth factors/modulators, steroid receptors/co-activators, cytokines, kinases and transcription factors. Of the up-regulated genes, 40% were implicated in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis and included cyclin G1 and cyclin I, p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK-1), p53, retinoblastoma like-2 [Rb2 (p130)], insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP5) and caspases. Among the down-regulated genes were ER alpha, growth factors, cytokines and several kinases. Some of these results were confirmed by real-time PCR. In MDA MB 231 cells, 20 genes were up-regulated and 13 genes were down-regulated. Very few genes directly implicated in cell cycle regulation were up-regulated. The matrix metalloproteinases formed a major class of genes that were down-regulated in the MDA MB 231 cells. Seven genes were commonly up-regulated in both cell lines and these included transforming growth factor (TGFbeta2) and Rb2 (p130).

To further understand the role of the type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor (IGF1R) in cancer metastasis we inhibited signaling via IGF1R using a C-terminal-truncated IGF1R. The truncated receptor retains the ligand binding domain but lacks the autophosphorylated tyrosine residues in the carboxyl terminus. Cells stably transfected with this truncated receptor (LCC6-DN cells) overexpressed the truncated IGF1R messenger RNA nearly 50-fold over endogenous receptor. The truncated receptor in the LCC6-DN cells behaved in a dominant negative manner to inhibit endogenous IGF1R activation by IGF-I. Compared with the LCC6-WT cells, LCC6-DN cells failed to phosphorylate the adaptor proteins insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 in response to IGF-I and did not activate Akt after exposure to IGF-I. Unlike LCC6-WT cells, LCC6-DN cells did not show enhanced motility in response to IGF-I. To assay for metastasis, LCC6-WT and LCC6-DN cells were injected into the mammary fat pads of mice, and the primary xenograft tumors were removed after 21 days. Mice sacrificed 5 weeks later showed multiple lung metastases derived from LCC-WT xenografts, whereas mice harboring LCC6-DN xenografts showed no lung metastases.

Regulation of the COX-2 gene expression at the post-transcriptional level is poorly understood. For example, protein factors that regulate the post-transcriptional mRNA metabolism of COX-2 have not been fully characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that the RNA-binding protein HuR binds to COX-2 mRNA and regulates its expression. We show that there are three binding sites for HuR in the 3'-untranslated region of human COX-2. These sites are located at the following positions in the COX-2 3'-untranslated region: 39-84 nucleotides (nt), 1155-1187 nt, and 1244-1256 nt (hereinafter referred to as Sites I, II and III, respectively). Although all three sites are present in the 4.6-kb COX-2 mRNA, only site I is present in the shorter 2.8-kb isoform. HuR in MDA-MB-231 cell extracts associated with COX-2 mRNA at the identified sites. Further, HuR location in the cytoplasm was induced by serum withdrawal, a stimulus known to induce COX-2 mRNA. Down-regulation of HuR by two independent methods, namely RNA interference as well as antisense RNA expression, significantly attenuated serum withdrawal-induced increase in COX-2 mRNA (both the 4.6- and 2.8-kb isoforms) and protein levels. These data suggest that HuR binding to COX-2 is critical for its post-transcriptional mRNA stabilization."

ER activity is positively and negatively regulated by transcriptional regulators such as histone deacetylase (HDAC), which is known to be a negative ER regulator. Here, we evaluated using ER beta as an alternative target for tamoxifen therapy by treating ER alpha-negative, beta-positive breast cancer cells with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), and testing whether tamoxifen responsiveness increased following upregulation of ER beta. TSA enhanced the overall ER transcriptional activity in these cells, as visualized by estrogen response element-regulated reporter and the expression of progesterone receptor, a known ER target, without ER alpha restoration. Additionally, TSA induced the expression and nuclear translocation of ER beta but not alpha, suggesting that these actions leading to increase of ER transcriptional activity are mediated through ER beta rather than alpha. Furthermore, following treatment with TSA, the formerly unresponsive MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T breast cancer cells became responsive to tamoxifen. However, reduction of ER beta expression by short interfering RNA abrogated this TSA-induced sensitization effect in these cells. Together, these results show that the HDAC inhibitor TSA sensitized ER alpha-negative, antihormone-unresponsive breast cancer cells to tamoxifen treatment possibly by upregulating ER beta activity."

The complex pattern of response to these agents revealed unexpected relationships between their effects, including a profound overlap in genes regulated by both steroids and epidermal growth factor, and striking overlaps between fulvestrant and all-trans-retinoic acid. Estrogen-responsive genes could be divided into two major clusters, only one of which is associated with cell proliferation. Gene ontology analysis was used to highlight functionally distinct biological responses to different mitogens. Significant correlations were identified between several clusters of drug-responsive genes and genes that discriminate estrogen receptor status or disease outcome in patient samples. The majority of estrogen receptor status discriminators were not responsive in our dataset and are therefore likely to reflect underlying differences in histogenesis and disease progression rather than growth factor signaling. This article highlights the overall impact at the gene expression level of diverse regulators of breast cancer growth and links the behavior of breast cancer cells in culture to important clinical properties of human breast tumors."

While several host cell factors have been shown to be important for chromatin remodeling and/or basal transcription, no specific mechanism that relieves the transcriptional repression imposed by nuc-1, a positioned nucleosome that impedes the start site of transcription, has been found. Since phorbol esters cause the rapid disruption of nuc-1 and markedly stimulate HIV-1 transcription, we looked for protein factors that associate with this region of the HIV-1 promoter in a phorbol-ester-dependent manner. We report here that ATF-3, JunB, and BRG-1 (the ATPase subunit of the 2-MDa human chromatin remodeling machine SWI/SNF) are recruited to the 3' boundary of nuc-1 following phorbol myristate acetate stimulation in Jurkat T cells. Analysis of the recruitment of BRG-1 in nuclear extracts prepared from Jurkat T cells and reconstitution of an in vitro system with purified components demonstrate that ATF-3 is responsible for targeting human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) to the HIV-1 promoter. Importantly, this recruitment of hSWI/SNF required HMGA1 proteins. Further support for this conclusion comes from immunoprecipitation experiments showing that BRG-1 and ATF-3 can exist together in the same complex. Although ATF-3 clearly plays a role in the specific targeting of BRG-1 to the HIV-1 promoter, the maintenance of a stable association between BRG-1 and chromatin appears to be dependent upon histone acetylation. By adding BRG-1 back into a BRG-1-deficient cell line (C33A cells), we demonstrate that trichostatin A strongly induces the 5'-LTR-driven reporter transcription in a manner that is dependent upon BRG-1 recruitment."

Forty-five SNPs were genotyped and the WGA methods were evaluated with respect to genotyping success, signal-to-noise ratios, power of genotype discrimination, yield and imbalanced amplification of alleles in the MDA product. Both PEP and MDA products provided genotyping results with a high concordance to genomic DNA. For PEP products the power of genotype discrimination was lower than for MDA due to a 2-fold lower signal-to-noise ratio. MDA products were indistinguishable from genomic DNA in all aspects studied. To obtain faithful representation of the SNP alleles at least 0.3 ng DNA should be used per MDA reaction. We conclude that the use of WGA, and MDA in particular, is a highly promising procedure for producing DNA in sufficient amounts even for genome wide SNP mapping studies."

Using homology to the rat mta1 gene, we cloned the human MTA1 gene and found it to be over-expressed in a variety of human cell lines (breast, ovarian, lung, gastric and colorectal cancer but not melanoma or sarcoma) and cancerous tissues (breast, esophageal, colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancer). We found a close similarity between the human MTA1 and rat mta1 genes (88% and 96% identities of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences, respectively). Both genes encode novel proteins that contain a proline rich region (SH3-binding motif), a putative zinc finger motif, a leucine zipper motif and 5 copies of the SPXX motif found in gene regulatory proteins. Using Southern blot analysis the MTA1 gene was highly conserved, and using Northern blot analysis MTA1 transcripts were found in virtually all human cell lines (melanoma, breast, cervix and ovarian carcinoma cells and normal breast epithelial cells). However, the expression level of the MTA1 gene in normal breast epithelial cells was approximately 50% of that found in rapidly growing adenocarcinoma and atypical epithelial cell lines. Experimental inhibition of MTA1 protein expression using antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides resulted in inhibition of growth and invasion of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with relatively high MTA1 expression. Furthermore, the MTA1 protein was localized in the nuclei of cells transfected with a mammalian expression vector containing a full-length MTA1 gene. Although some MTA1 protein was found in the cytoplasm, the vast majority of MTA1 protein was localized in the nucleus. Examination of recombinate MTA1 and related MTA2 proteins suggests that MTA1 protein is a histone deacetylase. It also appears to behave like a GATA-element transcription factor, since transfection of a GATA-element reporter into MTA1-expressing cells resulted in 10-20-fold increase in reporter expression over poorly MTA1-expressing cells. Since it was reported that nucleosome remodeling histone deacetylase complex (NuRD complex) involved in chromatin remodeling contains MTA1 protein and a MTA1-related protein (MTA2), we examined NuRD complexes for the presence of MTA1 protein and found an association of this protein with histone deacetylase. The results suggest that the MTA1 protein may serve multiple functions in cellular signaling, chromosome remodeling and transcription processes that are important in the progression, invasion and growth of metastatic epithelial cells."

The short-patch BER pathway, beginning with the simple glycosylase N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG), is responsible for the removal of damaged bases such as 3-methyladenine and 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine from the DNA after alkylation or oxidative DNA damage. The resulting apurinic site is further processed by the other members in the pathway, resulting in the insertion of the correct nucleotide. If apurinic sites accumulate, they are mutagenic and cytotoxic to the cell. To evaluate its efficacy in sensitizing breast cancer cells to chemotherapy, MPG has been overexpressed in the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB231. With MPG overexpression, an increase in DNA damage and increased cytotoxicity to methyl methanesulfonate as well as increased apoptosis levels was observed in these cells. Because mitochondrial DNA has been shown to be more sensitive to DNA damage than nuclear DNA, a construct containing mitochondrial-targeted MPG using the human manganese superoxide dismutase mitochondrial-targeting sequence was made. Overexpression of the mitochondrially targeted MPG dramatically increased the breast cancer cells' sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate. In conclusion, we believe that the increase in sensitivity to DNA damage by overexpression of nuclear MPG is because of an imbalance in the BER pathway, and an even greater increase in cell sensitivity is observed when mitochondrial DNA is targeted."

We previously reported that coculturing MDA PCa 2b prostate cancer cells with primary mouse osteoblasts (PMOs) induced PMO proliferation and differentiation. An osteoblastic reaction was also observed in vivo after injection of MDA PCa 2b cells into the bones of severe combined immunodeficient disease mice. The aim of this study was to identify the sequence of events that leads to these osteoblastic lesions in vivo and, using this in vitro model, to define the contributions of various genes and cellular pathways in the pathophysiology of osteoblastic bone metastases of prostate cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS: We show histological evidence of de novo bone formation as early as 2 weeks after injection of MDA PCa 2b cells in the bone of severe combined immunodeficient disease mice. In vitro, we show that PMOs induce MDA PCa 2b proliferation, suggesting a synergistic paracrine loop between these cells and PMOs. Endothelin (ET)-1, which is a mitogen for several cell types, is produced by all prostate cancer cell lines tested, and Atrasentan, an antagonist of ET-1 receptor A, partially reversed PMO proliferation induced by MDA PCa 2b cells. ET-1 is known to be comitogenic with a number of growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I. In this study, we report that IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 transcripts (that regulate levels of free IGF) are down-regulated in prostate cancer cells cocultured with PMO, whereas prostate-specific antigen (a protease known to cleave IGFBP-3) is detected in the 150-400 ng/ml range. Accordingly, IGFBP-3 has antiproliferative effects in PMOs, which were attenuated in our in vitro system. Taken together, our studies also implicate the IGF axis to play a role in this model of bone metastases. Secondly, the transcript level of mouse double minute 2 (a protein that regulate p53) was increased in prostate cancer cells grown with PMOs. The p53-dependent and -independent oncogenic activities of mouse double minute 2 suggest that osteoblasts induce a survival advantage in prostate cancer cells. Lastly, we show that expression of osteoprotegerin is decreased and of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand is increased in PMOs cultured in the presence of MDA PCa 2b cells, two events associated with osteoclast activation and bone resorption.CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that multiple and distinct molecular events affecting both bone formation and bone resorption concur to the increase bone mass in prostate cancer bone metastases. These data also provide a rationale for developing therapeutic strategies designed to target these molecular changes."

This study addresses the hypothesis that specific inhibition of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1, by antisense oligonucleotides (DNMT1 ASO) is sufficient to re-express the ER gene in ER-negative human breast cancer cell lines. MDA-MB-231 and Hs578t cells were transfected with 100 nM and 150 nM DNMT1 ASO respectively for three consecutive days and evidence of DNMT1 downregulation and functional ER re-expression was sought. Significant growth reduction was observed within 48 hr and persisted after 96 hr. DNMT1 expression was blocked after exposure to DNMT1 ASO as detected by RT-PCR, Western blot and enzymatic assay whereas a mutant DNMT1 ASO had little effect. This was associated with enhanced ER mRNA and protein expression and restoration of estrogen responsiveness in MDA-MB-231 cells as demonstrated by the ability of the induced ER protein to elicit ERE-regulated reporter activity from a luciferase reporter construct. Methylation specific PCR showed that the ER CpG island was minimally demethylated, suggesting that other epigenetic events, introduced by specific DNMT1 inhibition, might also be involved in ER re-expression. Our results suggest that specific inhibition of DNMT1 expression alone is sufficient to re-express ERa in human breast cancer cell lines."

Estrogen and antiestrogen activation of hERalpha/Sp1 was dependent on overlapping and different regions of the C, D, E, and F domains of ERalpha. Antiestrogen-induced activation of hERalpha/Sp1 was lost using hERalpha mutants deleted in zinc finger 1 [amino acids (aa) 185-205], zinc finger 2 (aa 218-245), and the hinge/helix 1 (aa 265-330) domains. In contrast with antiestrogens, E2-dependent activation of hERalpha/Sp1 required the C-terminal F domain (aa 579-595), which contains a beta-strand structural motif. Moreover, in peptide competition experiments overexpression of a C-terminal (aa 575-595) F domain peptide specifically blocked E2-dependent activation of hERalpha/Sp1, suggesting that F domain interactions with nuclear cofactors are required for ERalpha/Sp1 action."

A hydrophilic TTS component homologous to F1/V1-ATPases is ubiquitous and essential for secretion. We show that hrcN encodes the putative TTS ATPase of Pseudomonas syringae pathovar phaseolicola and that HrcN is a peripheral protein that assembles in clusters at the membrane. A decahistidinyl HrcN derivative was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity in a folded state. Hydrodynamic analysis, cross-linking, and electron microscopy revealed four distinct HrcN forms: I, 48 kDa (monomer); II, approximately 300 kDa (putative hexamer); III, 575 kDa (dodecamer); and IV, approximately 3.5 MDa. Form III is the predominant form of HrcN at the membrane, and its ATPase activity is dramatically stimulated (&gt;700-fold) over the basal activity of Form I.

Prior studies have established critical roles for gelatinase A transcriptional regulation by defined enhancer elements. To determine possible functional single nucleotide polymorphisms within these elements, we determined the single nucleotide polymorphism distribution within 1,665 bp of the gelatinase A 5'-flanking region, using a healthy homogeneous Caucasian study group of 463 individuals. Among the polymorphisms detected, a G --&gt; A transition at bp -1575 was located immediately 5' to a half-palindromic potential estrogen receptor binding site. In estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells the -1575G allele functioned as an enhancer, whereas the -1575A allele reduced transcription activity significantly. Gel shift assays confirmed that the differences in allelic expression affected binding of the estrogen receptor-alpha to this region. Cotransfection experiments with an estrogen receptor-alpha expression vector in MDA-MB-231 cells, which do not constitutively express an estrogen receptor, revealed that estrogen receptor is absolutely required for enhancing activity. Allelic distribution analysis indicated that a previously reported C --&gt; T transition within an Sp1 binding site at -1306 was in linkage disequilibrium with the -1575G --&gt; A transition. Luciferase reporter studies of the linked variant -1575A -1306T allele versus the wild type -1575G -1306C allele demonstrated an additive reduction in estrogen-dependent reporter activity. The frequency of the -1575G --&gt; A transition deviated significantly from the expected Hardy-Weinberg distribution in two independently assembled study populations consisting of healthy adult blood donors and newborns of Caucasian origin, both with a calculated 21% reduction in genetic fitness. Gelatinase A is a known estrogen-responsive gene and the demonstration of a loss of function polymorphism within an operational estrogen receptor binding site associated with a decrease in genetic fitness underscores the biologic significance of promoter polymorphism analyses."

Recently, we demonstrated that cerivastatin also reduces the proliferation and invasion of aggressive breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231. In this report, a molecular mechanism to explain its anti-cancer action is proposed by combining the study of cerivastatin effect on both gene expression (microarray) and signal transduction pathways. Firstly, the expression of 13 genes was modified by cerivastatin and confirmed at protein level. They could contribute to the inhibition of both cell proliferation (down-regulation of cyclin D1, PCNA, c-myc and up-regulation p21(Waf1), p19(INK4d), integrin beta8) and cell invasion, either directly (decrease in u-PA, MMP-9, u-PAR, PAI-1 and increase in anti-oncogenes Wnt-5a and H-cadherin) or indirectly by stimulating an anti-angiogenic gene (thrombospondin-2). The anti-angiogenic activity was confirmed by in vivo experiments. Secondly, we demonstrated that the biochemical mechanism of its anti-cancer action could be mainly explained by the inhibition of RhoA-dependent cell signalling. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that a RhoA inhibitor (C3 exoenzyme) or a dominant negative mutant RhoA (N19RhoA) induced similar effects to those of cerivastatin. In conclusion, cerivastatin, by preventing RhoA prenylation, inhibits (i) the RhoA/ROCK pathway, leading to defective actin stress fibres formation responsible for the loss of traction forces required for cell motility and (ii) the RhoA/FAK/AKT signalling pathway that could explain the majority of cancer-related gene modifications described above. Thus, the inhibition of RhoA cell signalling could be a good strategy in therapy of aggressive forms of breast cancer."

Conversion of ovalbumin to a maspin-like molecule.";"Maspin, an ov-serpin, inhibits tumor invasion and induces cell adhesion to extracellular matrix molecules. Here, we use maspin/ovalbumin chimeric proteins and the maspin reactive site loop (RSL) peptide to characterize the role of the RSL in maspin-mediated functions. Replacement of the RSL plus the C-terminal region or the RSL alone of maspin with that of ovalbumin resulted in the loss of the stimulatory effect on adhesion of corneal stromal cells to type I collagen, fibronectin, and laminin and of mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells to fibronectin. Maspin with ovalbumin as the C-terminal region retained activity, suggesting the maspin C-terminal polypeptide is not required. An R340Q mutant retained full maspin activity; however, an R340A mutant lost activity. This indicates the arginine side chain at the putative P1 site forms a hydrogen bond and not an ionic bond. The RSL peptide (P10-P5', amino acids 330-345) alone induced cell-matrix adhesion of mammary carcinoma cells and corneal stromal cells and inhibited invasion of the carcinoma cells. Substitution of the RSL of ovalbumin with that of maspin converted inactive ovalbumin into a fully active molecule. Maspin bound specifically to the surface of the mammary carcinoma cells with a kd of 367 +/- 67 nM and 32.0 +/- 2.2 x 10(6) binding sites/cell. The maspin RSL peptide inhibited binding, suggesting the RSL is involved in maspin binding to cells. Sufficiency of the maspin RSL for activity suggests the mechanism by which maspin regulates cell-matrix adhesion and tumor cell invasion does not involve the serpin mechanism of protease inhibition."

Unfortunately ER-negative breast cancers are more aggressive and unresponsive to anti-estrogens. Other targeted therapies are thus urgently needed, based on breast cancer oncogene inhibition or suppressor gene activation as far as molecular studies have demonstrated the alteration of expression, or structure of these genes in human breast cancer. Using the MDA-MB.231 human breast cancer cell line as a model of ER-negative breast cancers, we are investigating two of these approaches in our laboratory. Our first approach was to transfect the ER or various ER-deleted variants into an ER-negative cell line in an attempt to recover anti-estrogen responsiveness. The unliganded receptor, and surprisingly estradiol, were both found to inhibit tumor growth and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms of these inhibitions in ER-negative cancer cells are being studied, in an attempt to target the ER sequence responsible for such inhibition in these cancer cells. Another strategy is trying to inhibit the activity or expression of an oncogene specifically overexpressed in most breast cancers. This approach was recently shown by others to be efficient in breast cancer therapy with HER2-Neu oncogene amplification using Herceptin. Without excluding other molecular putative targets, we have focused our research on cathepsin D as a potential target, since it is often overexpressed in aggressive human breast cancers, including ER-negative tumors, and rarely associated with HER2-Neu amplification. Our first results obtained in vitro on cell lines and in vivo in tumor xenografts in nude mice, illustrate that the mode of action of cathepsin D in breast cancer is useful to guide the development of these therapies. In the past 20 years we have learned that the action of cathepsin D is complex and involves both intracellular and extracellular activities due to its proteolytic activity and to interactions with membrane components without catalytic activity. Each of these mechanisms could be potentially inhibited in an attempt to prevent tumor growth. Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous and multigenic disease and different targeted therapies adapted to each category of breast cancer are therefore required. Validated assays in the primary tumor of molecular markers such as ER, HER2-Neu and cathepsin D should help to predict which targeted therapy should be applied to cure breast cancer patients."

Adenoviral mda-7 (Ad-mda7) induces apoptosis and cell death selectively in tumor cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor activity of Ad-mda7 in breast and lung cancer lines were investigated. Microarray analyses implicated both the beta-catenin and the PI3K signaling pathways. Ad-mda7 treatment increased protein expression from tumor suppressor genes, including E-cadherin, APC, GSK-3beta, and PTEN, and decreased expression of proto-oncogenes involved in beta-catenin and PI3K signaling. Ad-mda7 caused a redistribution of cellular beta-catenin from the nucleus to the plasma membrane, resulting in reduced TCF/LEF transcriptional activity, and upregulated the E-cadherin-beta-catenin adhesion complex in a tumor cell-specific manner. Expression of the PI3K pathway members (p85 PI3K, FAK, ILK-1, Akt, and PLC-gamma) was downregulated and expression of the PI3K antagonist PTEN was increased. Consistent with this result, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin did not abrogate killing by Ad-mda7. Killing of breast cancer cells by Ad-mda7 required both MAPK and MEK1/2 signaling pathways, whereas these pathways were not essential for MDA-7-mediated killing in lung cancer cells. Thus, in breast and lung tumor cells MDA-7 protein expression modulates cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling via coordinate regulation of the beta-catenin and PI3K pathways."

We searched for well-tolerated compounds that could elevate Nm23 metastasis suppressor expression in metastatic human breast cancer cell lines.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells were treated with dexamethasone or medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in cultures containing either charcoal-stripped serum or FCS. Aspects of nm23 expression and function were determined.RESULTS: Previous investigation of the nm23-H1 promoter suggested that glucocorticoids may contribute to the elevation of Nm23-H1 expression. Dexamethasone elevated Nm23-H1 and Nm23-H2 protein levels in two metastatic human breast carcinoma cell lines 2-3-fold over a 4-day time course when cultured in steroid-free culture medium, with high-dose inhibition, via a traditional transcriptional mechanism. Elevation of Nm23-H1 expression was not observed using FCS-containing culture medium, which contains endogenous levels of corticosteroids, limiting the potential in vivo use of dexamethasone. MPA was investigated as a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. MPA elevated breast carcinoma Nm23-H1 protein expression 3-fold over a 10 nM to 1 micro M dose range when cultured in steroid-free or FCS-containing medium, with a shorter time course. Elevation of Nm23-H1 expression in the presence of endogenous corticosteroids found in FCS involved a distinct, glucocorticoid receptor-dependent, posttranscriptional mechanism of action. MPA had no effect on proliferation in vitro but reduced the soft agar colonization of metastatic breast cancer cell lines by approximately 50%.CONCLUSIONS: MPA represents a first generation lead agent for the elevation of Nm23-H1 metastasis suppressor expression and the inhibition of metastatic colonization."

Euglycemia was maintained for 24 hours by insulin infusion. Participants were fed a high-fat test supper equivalent to a McDonald's Big Mac Meal. Blood was drawn for measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), malonyldialdehyde (MDA), and total radical antioxidant parameter (TRAP) before and during the 4 hours after the test meal. Studies were performed in random sequence with vitamin E 800 IU and vitamin C 1 g given either before breakfast or before supper in a double-blind manner on the day of the test meal. Control studies were performed with no vitamins and no test meal administered. There was a significant rise in CRP and PAI-1 after the test supper (P&lt;0.05 compared with &quot;no meal&quot;). Either presupper or prebreakfast vitamins E and C prevented the meal-induced rise in CRP (P=0.03), although presupper vitamins were more effective (P=0.03 compared with prebreakfast vitamins). Only prebreakfast vitamins prevented the meal-induced rise in PAI-1 (P=0.006). There were no significant meal-related changes in the concentrations of IL-6, MDA, or TRAP.CONCLUSIONS: The timing of administration of antioxidant vitamins has variable effects on markers of meal-induced inflammation and fibrinolysis.

This study was undertaken to examine the effects of V-PYRRO/NO on acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. Mice were given V-PYRRO/NO via osmotic pumps (1.8-5.4 mg/mL, 8 microL/h) 4 to 16 hours before a hepatotoxic dose of acetaminophen (600 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [ip]). V-PYRRO/NO administration dramatically reduced acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as evidenced by reduced serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, reduced hepatic congestion, apoptosis, and improved hepatocellular pathology. The protection afforded by V-PYRRO/NO does not appear to be caused by a decrease in the formation of toxic acetaminophen metabolites, which consumes glutathione (GSH), because V-PYRRO/NO did not alter acetaminophen-induced hepatic GSH depletion. Acetaminophen-induced lipid peroxidation, as determined by the concentrations of 4-hydroxyalkenals (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA), was reduced significantly by V-PYRRO/NO treatment. Although pretreatment was most effective, administration of V-PYRRO/NO simultaneously with acetaminophen also was able to reduce acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Genomic analysis of the liver samples 10 hours after acetaminophen intoxication showed the enhanced expression of genes associated with stress/oxidative stress, apoptosis/cell death, and DNA damage/repair. Acetaminophen-induced alterations in gene expression were attenuated significantly by V-PYRRO/NO. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western-blot analysis confirmed microarray results. In conclusion, V-PYRRO/NO is effective in blocking acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. This protection may involve the reduction of oxidative stress, the inhibition of apoptosis, and possibly the maintenance of hepatic vasculature to prevent congestion."

The efficiency of this approach is often limited by insuf-ficient targeting and delivery of anticancer drugs into the tumors. Phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) directed against PLK1 and BCL-2 were administered systemically via the tail vein into nude mice bearing A549, MDA-MB-435, and Detroit562 xenografts. To enhance tumor-specific uptake and to reduce systemic toxicity of antisense ODNs membrane electroporation transfer was applied in vivo. Northern and Western blot analyses were used to assess PLK1 and BCL-2 expression. Tumor mass was assessed after resection of tumors. All three cell lines and corresponding xenografts expressed high levels of PLK1 and were sensitive towards antisense PLK1 treatment. Antisense BCL-2 therapy was effective in tumors expressing high levels of BCL-2, but not in A549 cells and corresponding xenografts, which express low levels of BCL-2. Administration of antisense ODNs in a dose of 5 mg/kg, twice weekly during four weeks supported by the membrane electroporation transfer, eradicated 60-100% of the xenografted tumors. Antitumor effect in BCL-2 overexpressing MDA-MB-435 cells was synergistic for BCL-2 and PLK1 combination therapy.

This series includes 1-[4-(O(CH(2))(n)NMe(2))phenyl]-1-phenyl-2-ferrocenyl-but-1-ene and 1-[4-(-O(CH(2))(n)NMe(2))phenyl]-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-ferrocenyl-but-1-ene, with n=2, 3, 5 and 8, and 1-[4-(-O(CH(2))(2)NMe(2))phenyl]-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-ferrocenylethene. Most of these molecules have been synthesised by McMurry cross-coupling of the appropriate ketones, except for the ethene complexes, which were prepared by a four-step reaction sequence starting from the ferrocenylacetic acid. All these compounds were obtained as mixtures of Z and E isomers. The isomers were separated in the cases of the ferrocenyl derivatives of tamoxifen and hydroxytamoxifen (n=2). No isomerisation of the Z and E isomers occurred in DMSO after one day, while a 50:50 mixture of the isomers was obtained within one hour in chloroform. The X-ray structure of (E)-1-[4-(-O(CH(2))(2)NMe(2))phenyl]-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-ferrocenyl-but-1-ene has been determined. The relative binding affinity (RBA) values of the hydroxyferrocifens for the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) was good to moderate, with values decreasing progressively with the length of the basic chain. The RBA values found for the estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) are equal to or slightly less than those found for the alpha form. The lipophilicity of the hydroxyferrocifens are superior to the values found for estradiol and increase with lengthening of the chain. The antiproliferative effects of the four hydroxyferrocifens with n=2, 3, 5 and 8 were studied on four breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB231, RTx6 and TD5) possessing different levels of ERalpha. On MCF7 cells containing high levels of ERalpha, hydroxyferrocifens behave as antiestrogens. At a molarity of 1 microM the effect is close to that of hydroxytamoxifen (used for reference) when n=2 or 5, more marked when n=3, and weaker when n=8. Ferrocene alone has no effect. For the MDA-MB231 cells, classed as a hormone-independent breast cancer cell line, on the other hand, the hydroxyferrocifens show remarkable antiproliferative behaviour while the hydroxytamoxifen is completely inactive. Hydroxyferrocifens therefore show the unique property of being active both on hormone-dependent and on hormone-independent breast cancer cell lines. The molecular modelling study provides some clues for understanding of the antagonist effect of these molecules, while an additional cytotoxic effect due to the vectorised ferrocenyl unit is revealed in some occasions."

Exogenous siRNA is frequently used in RNAi studies. However, due to profound differences in the activity of siRNAs targeted to different regions of a gene, several reagents may have to be screened for optimal activity. This approach is expensive due to the cost of chemical synthesis of RNAs. We report a technically simple, quick and cost-effective method for the production of siRNAs that makes use of in vitro transcription and deoxyribozyme digestion of the transcripts to produce the desired sequence and length. The method allows for several siRNAs to be produced in parallel at much reduced costs. The siRNAs produced with this method were tested in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells for efficacy against the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) mRNA and they caused dose-dependent inhibition of IGF1R expression comparable to that induced by chemically synthesised siRNAs of the same sequence. This method is also useful for producing long RNA fragments of defined length and sequence that may be difficult to synthesise chemically, and also for producing large quantities of RNAs for applications including structural studies and the study of interactions between RNA and other molecules, such as proteins, other nucleic acids and drugs."

In previous studies, we were able to destroy prostate cancers in vitro and in vivo with lytic peptide conjugates. Hecate, hecate-betaCG and LHRH-hecate were added to cultures of the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435S. Hecate and its conjugates showed concentration dependent toxicity to both cell lines. The lytic peptide alone showed similar EC50 values for both cell lines; however, there was a significant difference between the EC50 values when the conjugates were tested. The hormone dependent MCF-7 cell line was less sensitive to the betaCG conjugate than to the LHRH conjugate; the reverse was found for the hormone independent MDA-MB-435S cells. Removal of steroids decreased the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to both lytic peptide conjugates and this sensitivity could be restored by adding estradiol. Activation of protein kinase C further increased the sensitivity to the drug. MDA-MB-435S xenografts were established in intact female athymic nude mice, which were treated once a week for 3 weeks with hecate-betaCG via the lateral tail vein. The ability of hecate-betaCG to destroy xenografts of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-435S) in nude mice was demonstrated for the first time.

Thioredoxin (Trx) is a dithiol-reducing enzyme known to be involved in the redox regulation of a number of transcription factors, and in this study, we have investigated the redox-dependent regulation of the DNA binding activity of Sp1 by thioredoxin. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to show that both recombinant Sp1 produced in Escherichia coli and endogenous Sp1 expressed by MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells is subject to redox regulation. We found that thioredoxin alone or in conjunction with the full thioredoxin system (comprising thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase [TR], and alpha-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH]) can increase Sp1 DNA binding activity in vitro to an oligonucleotide containing the Sp1 consensus sequence. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that recombinant Sp1 can bind to Sp1 consensus sequences within a 330-base pair (bp) thioredoxin promoter fragment and that this interaction can also be enhanced by the presence of thioredoxin. Luciferase reporter assays using this same minimal thioredoxin promoter region demonstrated that both Sp1 and Sp3 can bind to the promoter and act to enhance transcription. When the three identified Sp1 consensus sequences within the reporter construct were deleted, there was a loss of basal promoter activity, showing that these closely positioned sites are important for regulation of thioredoxin gene expression."

The mechanisms that guide organ-specific metastasis and the molecular players that are involved remain to be established. To gain insight into this problem, we used an orthotopic model of breast cancer in which the MDA-MB-435 cells are implanted into the mouse mammary fat pad. Sublines that preferentially metastasized to specific sites were isolated by excising metastatic tumors and growing explants of these tumors in culture. Cells lines that preferentially metastasize to the lymph node and thoracic cavity were obtained. The gene expression profiles of primary tumors from these sublines were then compared with cDNA arrays containing 5,800 known genes. In tumors that preferentially metastasize to the lymph node, several genes encoding adhesion and matrix proteins were upregulated. Genes encoding proteins involved in metabolism were downregulated. One of the upregulated genes in lymph-homing tumors was CD73. Immunohistochemistry showed that the CD73 protein is also upregulated in primary tumors of this cell line and that its expression is elevated in the lymph node metastases. CD73 is a transmembrane protein that has previously been implicated in the homing of normal lymphocytes to the nodes. This raises the hypothesis that tumors preferentially metastasize to lymph nodes by using CD73 to mimic part of the lymphocyte homing process."

It has many domains with a variety of functions, and stretches from the Z-line to the M-line in the muscle sarcomere. Close to the M-line, titin contains a kinase domain, which is known to phosphorylate the Z-line protein telethonin in developing muscle (Mayans, O., van der Ven, P. F., Wilm, M., Mues, A., Young, P., Furst, D. O., Wilmanns, M. and Gautel, M. (1998) Nature 395, 863-869). This phosphorylation is thought to be important for initiating or regulating myofibrillogenesis. We used a gene-targeting approach in cultured myoblasts to truncate the titin gene so that the kinase domain and other domains downstream of the kinase were not expressed. We recovered cells in which one allele was targeted. We found that these cells expressed both the full-length and a truncated titin that was approximately 0.2 MDa smaller than the corresponding band from wild-type cells. Myofibrillogenesis in these cells was impaired, in that the myotubes were shorter, and the organisation of the muscle sarcomeres, M- and Z-lines was poorer than in wild-type cells. There was also an overall reduction in levels of titin and skeletal myosin expression. These results suggest that the activity of the titin kinase domain and downstream sequence are important in organising myofibrils both at the M- and the Z-line early in myofibrillogenesis."

To evaluate the impact of anthracyclines on p44/42-MAPK in breast cancer, A1N4-myc human mammary and BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells were studied. Treatment with doxorubicin or epirubicin resulted in increased phospho-p44/42-MAPK levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. This was associated with p44/42 activation, as reflected by increased p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase and Bad phosphorylation. Activation of p44/42 appeared to be antiapoptotic, since MAPK stimulation with epidermal growth factor or a dominant-positive p42 construct inhibited apoptosis. Modest activation of the upstream MAPK kinase MEK was noted under some conditions, but inhibition of MEK did not abolish p44/42 activation, suggesting a contribution from another mechanism. Anthracyclines were found to decrease expression of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) both in vitro and in vivo. MKP-1 mRNA levels were decreased in anthracycline-treated cells, and transcription from the MKP-1 promoter was repressed. Inhibition of MKP-1 expression through the use of small interfering RNAs decreased the ability of anthracyclines to induce phospho-p44/42. Wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) treated with doxorubicin showed increased phospho-p44/42-MAPK levels, but MEFs from MKP-1 heterozygous and homozygous knockout mice had blunted p44/42 activation. These studies support the ability of anthracyclines to activate antiapoptotic p44/42-MAPK phosphorylation in breast cancer, and indicate that this occurs in part through the novel mechanism of repression of MKP-1 transcription."

The purpose of this research was to determine if there is differential expression of CUL-5 in breast epithelial cells versus breast cancer cell lines, and normal human tissues versus human tumors. The expression of CUL-5 in breast epithelial cells (HMEC, MCF-10A), and breast cancer cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) was examined using RT-PCR, Northern blot analysis, and Western blot analysis. The expression of mRNA for other CUL family members (CUL-1, -2, -3, -4A, and -4B) in these cells was evaluated by RT-PCR. A normal human tissue expression array and a cancer profiling array were used to examine CUL-5 expression in normal human tissues and matched normal tissues versus tumor tissues, respectively.RESULTS: CUL-5 is expressed at the mRNA and protein levels by breast epithelial cells (HMEC, MCF-10A) and breast cancer cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231). These cells also express mRNA for other CUL family members. The normal human tissue expression array revealed that CUL-5 is widely expressed. The cancer profiling array revealed that 82% (41/50) of the breast cancers demonstrated a decrease in CUL-5 expression versus the matched normal tissue. For the 50 cases of matched breast tissue there was a statistically significant approximately 2.2 fold decreased expression of CUL-5 in tumor tissue versus normal tissue (P &lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate no apparent decrease in CUL-5 expression in the breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) versus the breast epithelial cells (HMEC, MCF-10A). The decrease in CUL-5 expression in breast tumor tissue versus matched normal tissue supports the hypothesis that decreased expression of CUL-5 may play a role in breast tumorigenesis."

The family of Smad proteins acts as intracellular signal transducers of TGF-beta and related peptides. Smad4, a common mediator Smad (co-Smad), performs a central role in transmitting signals from TGF-beta, BMP, and activins. Schistosoma mansoni receptor-regulated Smad1 and SmSmad2 were previously identified and shown to act in TGF-beta signaling. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of a Smad4 homologue from S. mansoni and provide details about its role in mediation and down-regulation of TGF-beta signaling in schistosomes. In order to identify the schistosome co-Smad, we designed degenerate primers based on the sequence of the conserved MH1/MH2 domains of Smad4 proteins, which were used in PCR to amplify a 137-bp PCR product. A S. mansoni adult worm pair cDNA library was screened resulting in the isolation of a cDNA clone that encodes a 738 amino acid protein (SmSmad4). SmSmad4 was shown to interact with schistosome R-Smads (SmSmad1 and SmSmad2) in vivo and in vitro. The interaction with SmSmad2 was dependent on the receptor-mediated phosphorylation of SmSmad2. In addition, several potential phosphorylation sites for Erk1/2 kinases were identified in the SmSmad4 linker region and shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by an active mutant of mammalian Erk2. Furthermore, Erk-mediated phosphorylation of SmSmad4 decreased its interaction with the receptor-activated form of SmSmad2, in vitro. SmSmad4 was shown to complement a human Smad4 deficiency through the restoration of TGF-beta-responsiveness in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells."

MDA-MB-231 cells were stably transfected with ERbeta cDNA and clones were screened by estrogen response element (ERE)-luciferase assay and ERbeta mRNA expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Three stable MDA-MB-231/ERbeta clones were compared with S30 cells with respect to their growth properties, ability to activate ERE- and activating protein-1 (AP-1) luciferase reporter constructs, and the ability to activate the endogenous ER-regulated transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) gene. ERbeta6 and ERbeta27 clones express 300-400-fold and the ERbeta41 clone express 1600-fold higher ERbeta mRNA levels compared with untransfected MDA-MB-231 cells. Unlike S30 cells, 17beta-estradiol (E2) does not inhibit ERbeta41 cell growth. ERE-luciferase activity is induced six-fold by E2 whereas neither 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) nor ICI 182, 780 activated an AP-1-luciferase reporter. TGFalpha mRNA is induced in response to E2, but not in response to 4-OHT. MDA-MB-231/ERbeta clones exhibit distinct characteristics from S30 cells including growth properties and the ability to induce TGFalpha gene expression. Furthermore, ERbeta, at least in the context of the MDA-MB-231 cellular milieu, does not enhance AP-1 activity in the presence of antiestrogens. In summary, the availability of both ERalpha and ERbeta stable breast cancer cell lines now allows us to compare and contrast the long-term consequences of individual signal transduction pathways."

The 1.9 A resolution crystal structure of the central 12S hexameric core, which catalyzes the first carboxylation reaction, has been solved bound to its substrate methylmalonyl-CoA. Overall, the structure reveals two stacked trimers related by 2-fold symmetry, and a domain duplication in the monomer. In the active site, the labile carboxylate group of methylmalonyl-CoA is stabilized by interaction with the N-termini of two alpha-helices. The 12S domains are structurally similar to the crotonase/isomerase superfamily, although only domain 1 of each 12S monomer binds ligand. The 12S reaction is similar to that of human propionyl-CoA carboxylase, whose beta-subunit has 50% sequence identity with 12S.

Here we demonstrate high levels of FGF-BP expression in invasive human breast cancer, relative to normal breast and in situ carcinoma, and in MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells. In these cells, FGF-BP was up-regulated by treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF), dependent on protein kinase C and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Mutational analysis revealed that the activator protein 1 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) sites on the FGF-BP gene promoter were required for the EGF effect, whereas deletion of the C/EBP site resulted in a significant increase in promoter basal activity indicating a basal repressive control mechanism. These data suggest that the C/EBP site is a central regulatory element for the regulation of FGF-BP promoter activity in MDA-MB-468 cells. We found that MDA-MB-468 cells express high endogenous levels of both the activating (LAP) and repressive (LIP) isoforms of C/EBPbeta. Overexpression of C/EBPbeta-LAP in MDA-MB-468 cells resulted in a large 80-fold increase in FGF-BP promoter basal activity, which was reversed by coexpression of LIP. Gel-shift analysis revealed that four LIP- and LAP-containing complexes (a-d) bind to the C/EBP site. DNA binding of the LIP and LAP-containing c complex and the b complex in the presence of EGF was modulated by inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, suggesting a role for these complexes in the EGF induction of the FGF-BP promoter. This study suggests that along with its well-defined role in mammary gland development, C/EBPbeta may well play a role in the pathology of breast cancer, in particular in the control of angiogenesis in the invasive phenotype."

In invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, transforming growth factor beta-regulated PTHrP synthesis is mediated by an Ets1/Smad3-dependent activation of the PTHrP P3 promoter. In the present study, we studied the regulation of PTHrP expression in non-invasive, Ets1-deficient and transforming growth factor beta-resistant MCF-7 cells. We found PMA to be a strong stimulator of P3-dependent PTHrP expression in MCF-7 cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase 1 (MEK-1)/ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 interfered with this activity. Promoter studies revealed that the PMA effect depended on the Ets and stimulating protein-1 (Sp1)-binding sites. Of several Ets factors tested, Ets2, but not Ese-1, Elf-1 or Ets1, supported the PMA-dependent increase in promoter activity. PD98059 and a threonine to alanine mutation of the ERK1/2-responsive Ets2 phosphorylation site at position 72 inhibited the Ets2/PMA effect. Activated protein kinase C (PKC) epsilon could mimic PMA by stimulating the P3 promoter alone or in co-operation with Ets2 in an MEK-1/ERK1/2-dependent manner. Activated PKC alpha, although capable of co-operating with Ets2, failed to induce transcription from the P3 promoter on its own. The Ets2/PKalpha synergistic effect was neither sensitive to PD98059 nor to Thr(72)/Ala(72) mutation. PMA neither increased the expression of Sp1 nor modulated the transcriptional activity of Sp1. However, it induced the displacement of a yet unknown factor from the Sp1-binding site, which may result in Sp1 recruitment to the promoter. Our results suggest an ERK1/2-dependent Ets2/PKC epsilon synergism to be involved in PTHrP expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells."

The MT-2A isoform was observed to be differentially upregulated in the invasive phenotype. The MT-1E isoform was found to be present in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T) but not detectable in the estrogen receptor-positive cell lines (T47D, MCF7, and ZR75-1 cells). Only the myoepithelial cells exhibited the presence of the MT-1G transcript. Direct sequencing of the RT-PCR products revealed the occurrence of a variant MT-1H isoform with changes in amino acid residues in the protein sequence and notable differences in the predicted secondary protein structure.

In initial experiments with cultured cells, we found that synthetic BH-P inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of tumor cells. It also blocked the growth of tumors on the chorioallantoic membranes of 10-day chicken embryos. In addition, MDA-435 melanoma cells that had been transfected with an expression vector for BH-P grew at a slower rate in nude mice than the vector-alone transfectants. Final studies revealed that the BH-P could activate caspase-8, caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and trigger the apoptosis of tumor cells.

Daily injection of contortrostatin into the primary tumor of human breast cancer MDA-MB-435 carried in nude mice significantly inhibited tumor growth and neovascularization of the tumor tissue. On the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane, contortrostatin inhibited angiogenesis induced by MDA-MB-435 cells, basic fibroblast growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition, contortrostatin effectively blocked adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to immobilized vitronectin and significantly inhibited invasion of HUVEC through a Matrigel barrier. Competitive binding assays and adhesion assays with different integrin antibodies suggested that integrin alpha(v)beta3 is a binding site for contortrostatin on vascular endothelial cells. Detachment of HUVEC from vitronectin by contortrostatin induced apoptosis. HUVEC adhered and spread well on immobilized contortrostatin without undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that it is the inhibition of adhesion and spreading of HUVEC on extracellular matrix proteins, rather than binding of contortrostatin to integrins per se, that triggers apoptosis. We conclude that contortrostatin binds to alpha(v)beta3, and interferes with the anchorage-dependent survival mechanism of the vascular endothelial cells, and the mobility of the cells. The consequent suppression of angiogenesis is an important component of the antineoplastic activity of contortrostatin."

They facilitate vascular arrest of cancer cells via adhesion to beta4 integrin and promote early, intravascular, metastatic growth. Here we identify the interacting binding domains of endothelial CLCA proteins (e.g. hCLCA2, mCLCA5, mCLCA1, and bCLCA2) and beta4 integrin. Endothelial CLCAs share a common beta4-binding motif (beta4BM) in their 90- and 35-kDa subunits of the sequence F(S/N)R(I/L/V)(S/T)S, which is located in the second extracellular domain of the 90-kDa CLCA and near the N terminus of the 35-kDa CLCA, respectively. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent, pull-down, and adhesion assays, we showed that glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of beta4BMs from the 90- and 35-kDa CLCA subunits bind to the beta4 integrin in a metal ion-dependent manner. Fusion proteins from fibronectin and the integrins beta1 and beta3 served as negative controls. beta4BM fusion proteins competitively blocked the beta4/CLCA adhesion and prevented lung colonization of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. A disrupted beta4BM in hCLCA1, which is not expressed in endothelia, failed to interact with beta4 integrin. The corresponding CLCA-binding domain of the beta4 integrin is localized to the specific determining loop (SDL). Again enzyme-linked immunosorbent, pull-down, and adhesion assays were used to confirm the interaction with CLCA proteins using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein representing the C-terminal two-thirds of beta4 SDL (amino acids 184-203). A chimeric beta4 integrin in which the indicated SDL sequence had been replaced with the corresponding sequence from the beta1 integrin failed to bind hCLCA2. The dominance of the CLCA ligand in beta4 activation and outside-in signaling is discussed in reference to our previous report that beta4/CLCA ligation elicits selective signaling via focal adhesion kinase to promote metastatic growth."

Although a role for BSP in mineralization has been indicated, BSP also appears to function in patho-physiological processes, including the metastasis of breast and prostate cancer cells to bone. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of BSP in the homing of cancer cells and to provide insights into the role of BSP in physiological as well as pathological processes. We established cultures of MDA-231 breast cancer cells stably transfected with DNA constructs of pIRES2-EGFP (green fluorescent protein) expressing human BSP (hBSP) cDNA (231BSP) under a CMV promoter, or with an antisense sequence of hBSP cDNA (231BSPAS), or with an empty vector as a control (231EV). These 3 cell groups were selected for neomycin resistance using G418 and analyzed by flow cytometry for GFP expression. The resultant cultured cells expressed different levels of hBSP as detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. Among the three, 231BSP expressed the highest levels of hBSP while 231BSPAS expressed the lowest. The capacity of the tumor cells to metastasize to bone was determined in nude mice (5 in each group) by intra-cardiac injection of the cells from the 3 different groups. Four weeks after inoculation, radiological examination revealed that all the 5 mice in the 231BSP cell group had developed osteolytic bone metastases. In the 231BSPAS group only 1 mouse demonstrated metastatic bone lesions while 3 out of 5 mice in the control group (231EV) developed metastatic lesions in the bone.

To isolate cellular complexes that are formed with Hupf1 and to explore the role of cellular proteins in NMD, we generated a HeLa cell line that stably expresses Hupf1 bearing a double-affinity tag (termed Hupf1-2tag). Hupf1-2tag is localized in the cytoplasm similar to the endogenous Hupf1 protein, and the Hupf1-2tag cell line is fully NMD-competent. Using affinity chromatography, Hupf1-2tag-associated proteins were isolated. MS and immunoblotting identified the NMD factors Hupf2 and Hupf3a/b as interaction partners of Hupf1. Size-exclusion chromatography indicates that the NMD factors Hupf1, Hupf2 and the large isoform of Hupf3a might exist in a stable, high-molecular-mass complex of approx. 1.3 MDa. Interestingly, the poly(A)-binding protein was also identified by MS to be associated specifically with Hupf1-2tag. In contrast with the interaction with Hupf2 and Hupf3a/b, the association of poly(A)-binding protein with Hupf1 is highly sensitive to treatment of the isolated complexes with RNase. Components of the exon-exon junction complex or the translational eukaryotic release factor (eRF) 3 were not identified in complexes associated with Hupf1-2tag.

In this paper, we investigated the involvement of protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck in the redox-regulated activation of NFkappaB following H/R in highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) and low invasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that H/R induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p56lck, nuclear translocation of NFkappaB, NFkappaB-DNA binding, and transactivation of NFkappaB through tyrosine phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. Transfection of these cells with wild type Lck but not with mutant Lck F394 followed by H/R induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB (IkappaBalpha) and transcriptional activation of NFkappaB, and these are inhibited by Lck inhibitors. In vitro kinase assay demonstrated that immunoprecipitated p56lck but not Lyn or Fyn directly phosphorylate IkappaBalpha in presence of H/R. Pervanadate, H2O2, and H/R induce the interaction between Lck and tyrosine-phosphorylated IkappaBalpha, and this interaction is inhibited by Src homology 2 domain inhibitory peptide, suggesting that tyrosine-phosphorylated IkappaBalpha interacts with Src homology 2 domain of Lck. Luciferase reporter gene assay indicated that Lck induces NFkappaB-dependent urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) promoter activity in presence of H/R. Furthermore, H/R stimulates the cell motility through secretion of uPA. To our knowledge, this is the first report that p56lck in presence of H/R regulates NFkappaB activation, uPA secretion, and cell motility through tyrosine phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and further demonstrates an important redox-regulated pathway for NFkappaB activation following H/R injury that is independent of IkappaB kinase/IkappaBalpha-mediated signaling pathways."

However, the commonly used breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, T47-D and MCF7) do not express STn antigen. The key step in the biosynthesis of STn is the transfer of a sialic acid residue in alpha2,6-linkage to GalNAc alpha-O-Ser/Thr. This reaction is mainly catalyzed by a CMP-Neu5Ac GalNAc alpha2,6-sialyltransferase: ST6GalNAc I. In order to generate STn-positive breast cancer cells, we have cloned a cDNA encoding the full-length human ST6GalNAc I from HT-29-MTX cells. The stable transfection of MDA-MB-231 with an expression vector encoding ST6GalNAc I induces the expression of STn antigen at the cell surface. The expression of STn short cuts the initial O-glycosylation pattern of these cell lines, by competing with the Core-1 beta1,3-galactosyltransferase, the first enzyme involved in the elongation of O-glycan chains. Moreover, we show that STn expression is associated with morphological changes, decreased growth and increased migration of MDA-MB-231 cells."

In this study, the cloning and identification of a Murabutide-downregulated gene, named RH116, bearing classical motifs that are characteristic of the DExH family of RNA helicases, are reported. The 116 kDa encoded protein shares 99.9 % similarity with MDA-5, an inducible RNA helicase described recently. Ectopic expression of RH116 in HeLa-CD4 cells inhibited cell growth and cell proliferation but had no measurable effect on programmed cell death. RH116 presented steady state cytoplasmic localization and could translocate to the nucleus following HIV-1 infection. Moreover, the endogenous expression of RH116, at both the transcript and protein levels, was found to be considerably upregulated after infection. Overexpression of RH116 in HIV-1-infected HeLa-CD4 cells also resulted in a dramatic increase in the level of secreted viral p24 protein. This enhancement in virus replication did not stem from upregulated proviral DNA levels but correlated with increased unspliced and singly spliced viral mRNA transcripts. These findings implicate RH116 in the regulation of HIV-1 replication and point to an apoptosis-independent role for this novel helicase in inducing cell growth arrest."

In the cancer microenvironment, hypoxia plays a significant role in forming a tumor phenotype and tumor progression. We aimed to identify the genes upregulated by hypoxia in human breast cancer cell lines, a hormone-dependent MCF-7 and a hormone-independent MDA-MB-231, using microarray analysis. These cells were exposed to two oxygen concentrations such as 21% and 1% in a time-course. Out of 12625 genes, 26 genes were identified as commonly upregulated in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Some of these genes were already reported as hypoxia-related, but some of those were identified newly. These commonly upregulated genes between hormone-dependent and hormone-independent cells would be a clue to study hypoxia-related events and to explore the novel therapeutic targets in human breast cancer."

H., Ogikubo, O., Otsuka, T., and Ohkubo, I. (2001) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 288, 975-980). In this study, we found that the amino acid sequence His-Gly-Lys (HGK) in D5H is the core motif for inhibition of adhesion and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro. P-5m (484GHGKHKNK491, Gly484-Lys491), an octapeptide including the HGK motif derived from D5H, and HGK, a tripeptide, inhibited both cell adhesion and invasion in vitro. However, an octapeptide designated P-5m (K487R), in which Lys487 was changed to Arg, did not inhibit either cell adhesion or invasion, and peptides HGR and HGG also had no inhibitory effect. Recombinant GST-D5H expressed in Escherichia coli had a stronger inhibitory effect on cell adhesion and invasion in vitro than did GST-D5H (K487R) in which Lys487 was changed to Arg. Furthermore, P-5m (Gly484-Lys491) peptide clearly suppressed lung metastasis in mice experimentally induced by using B16-F10 cells, but P-5m (G487R) had no effect. These data strongly indicate that both the HGK motif and lysine residue (Lys487) play essential roles in inhibition of cell adhesion and invasion in vitro and in prevention of metastasis of cancer cells in vivo. We tried to identify the HGK motif binding protein on the surface of cancer cells. A 95-kDa surface biotin-labeled membrane protein was specifically detached from GST-D5H by P-5 (His479-Lys493) peptide but not by P-1 (Gly402-Lys420) peptide originating from the N-terminal region of D5H."

However, downstream-signalling of TRAIL-receptor is not well defined. A functional genetic screening was performed to isolate genes interfering with TRAIL-induced apoptosis using cDNA retroviral library. Bcl-X(L) and FLIP were identified after DNA sequencing analysis of cDNA rescued from TRAIL-resistant clones. We found that increased expression of Bcl-X(L), but not Bcl-2, suppressed TRAIL-induced apoptosis in tumour cells. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses showed that expression of Bcl-X(L), but not Bcl-2, was highly increased in human breast cancer tissues. Exposure of MDA-MB-231 breast tumour cells to TRAIL induced apoptosis accompanied by dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and enzymatic activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9. However, SK-BR-3 breast tumour cells exhibiting increased expression level of Bcl-X(L) were resistant to TRAIL, though upon exposure to TRAIL, caspase-8 and Bid were activated. Forced expression of Bcl-X(L), but not Bcl-2, desensitised TRAIL-sensitive MDA-MB-231 cells to TRAIL. Similar inhibitory effects were also observed in other tumour cells such as HeLa and Jurkat cells stably expressing Bcl-X(L), but not Bcl-2. These results are indicative of the crucial and distinct function of Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 in the modulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis."

In the present study, we have explored the functional role of Etk in mediating EGF-induced apoptosis, using MDA-MB-468 cell line as a model. We first demonstrated that EGF treatment induces Etk tyrosine phosphorylation in both HeLa and MDA-MB-468 cells. Overexpression of Etk by recombinant adenovirus in MDA-MB-468 cells potentiates the extent of EGF-induced cell apoptosis. The observed Etk-enhanced MDA-MB-468 cell apoptosis is associated with the Stat1 activation, as demonstrated by electrophoresis mobility shift assays and reporter gene assays. By contrast, a kinase domain deletion mutant EtkDeltaK, functioning as a dominant-negative mutant, ameliorates EGF-induced Stat1 activation and apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells. To explore whether the activated Etk alone is sufficient for inducing apoptosis, a conditionally activated Etk (DeltaEtk-ER), a chimeric fusion protein of PH domain-truncated Etk and ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptor, was introduced into MDA-MB-468 cells. Upon beta-estradiol ligand activation, the DeltaEtk-ER could stimulate Stat1 activity and confer cell apoptosis independent of EGF treatment. Taken together, our findings indicate that Etk is a downstream signaling molecule of EGF receptor and suggest that Etk activation is essential for transducing the EGF-induced apoptotic signaling."

Many reports have documented glucocorticoid-like effects of progesterone in various tissues. This study addresses the issue of cross-talk between corticosteroids and PR using PR-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells ABC28 and vector-transfected control cells CTC15. At physiological concentrations, dexamethasone, cortisol, and aldosterone mimic the effects of progesterone by inducing significant growth inhibition, cell spreading, and focal adhesions in PR-positive ABC28 cells. These hormones also induce progesterone-like effects in increasing the expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) protein and decreasing the level of phospho-p42/p44 mAPK. Two lines of evidence suggest that these effects are mediated by cross-talk with PR. First, these compounds do not exhibit the same progesterone-like effects in PR-negative CTC15 cells. Second, PR blocker ZK98299 abolishes their effect on cell spreading and focal adhesion in ABC28 cells. The cross-talk is corticosteroid specific because estradiol and thyroid hormone triiodothyronine have no effect on PR-transfected cells ABC28. It is also interesting to note that dexamethasone induces a small but detectable increase of focal adhesions and limited growth stimulation in vector-transfected cells CTC15. In contrast, progesterone exhibits no detectable effect on CTC15 cells. This study provides evidence that glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid cross-talk with PR to produce progesterone-like effects in breast cancer cells. Glucocorticoid receptor and PR share some overlapping activity in mediating focal adhesion but not in regulating cell proliferation."

These complexes are abundant at the brush border membranes of kidney proximal tubule cells and epithelial cells of the intestine, and are also expressed in certain leucocytes and cancer cells. Meprins cleave bioactive peptides such as gastrin, cholecystokinin and parathyroid hormone, cytokines such as osteopontin and monocyte chemotactic peptide-1, as well as proteins such as gelatin, collagen IV, fibronectin and casein. Database predictions and initial data indicate that meprins are also capable of shedding proteins, including itself, from the cell surface. Membrane-bound meprin subunits are composed of dimeric meprin beta subunits or tetrameric hetero-oligomeric alpha beta complexes of approx. 200-400 kDa, and can be activated at the cell surface; secreted forms of homo-oligomeric meprin alpha are zymogens that form high-molecular-mass complexes of 1-6 MDa. These are among the largest extracellular proteases identified thus far. The latent (self-associating) homo-oligomeric complexes can move through extracellular spaces in a non-destructive manner, and deliver a concentrated form of the metalloproteinase to sites that have activating proteases, such as sites of inflammation, infection or cancerous growth. Meprins provide examples of novel ways of concentrating proteolytic activity at the cell surface and in the extracellular milieu, which may be critical to proteolytic function."

In the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, MT-3 expression has been shown to inhibit cell growth and increase drug resistance. The goal of the present study was to determine if MT-3 overexpression would influence the growth of human breast cancer cell lines. To determine this, the coding sequence of the MT-3 gene was stably transfected into two estrogen receptor positive (MCF-7 and T-47D) and two estrogen receptor negative cell lines (Hs578T and MDA-MB-231) having no basal expression of MT-3. Cell growth was determined by counting DAPI-stained nuclei, cadmium resistance by the colony formation assay, MT mRNA expression by RT-PCR, and MT protein by immuno-blot. It was demonstrated that MCF-7 and Hs578T cells that overexpress the MT-3 gene were growth inhibited compared to untransfected cells. In contrast, T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cells that overexpress MT-3 were not growth inhibited. Stable transfection of the MT-1E gene had no effect on the growth of any of the four cell lines. It was also demonstrated that the overexpression of both MT-3 and MT-1E only increased the resistance of MCF-7 cells to Cd(+2). In all instances, stable transfection of the MT-3 or MT-1E gene had no effect on the expression of the other MT isoforms.

However, MDA is strongly associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), a rare hereditary autosomal disorder characterized by benign hamartomatous polyposis in the gastrointestinal tract and mucocutaneous pigmentation. A serine threonine kinase gene, STK11, has been identified as the tumor suppressor gene responsible for the PJS. In this study we investigated the possible direct role of STK11 in the development of MDA of the uterine cervix. Eleven rare cases of mucinous MDA, not known to be associated with PJS, were screened for the presence of mutations in the STK11 gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified DNA fragments. Subsequently our findings were confirmed with cloning and sequencing. As a control, 24 cases of endocervical adenocarcinomas of other histologic subtypes, with no family history of PJS (19 mucinous adenocarcinomas, 4 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, and 1 clear cell adenocarcinoma), 15 cases of squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix, 5 cases of endocervical glands with pyloric gland metaplasia, and 2 deeply situated nabothian cysts were investigated. Somatic mutations of the STK11 gene were confirmed in 6 (55%) of the 11 mucinous MDAs and 1 (5%) of the 19 mucinous adenocarcinomas, but not in the 5 nonmucinous adenocarcinomas, the 15 squamous cell carcinomas, nor the 5 endocervical glands with gastric metaplasia. MDAs with the STK11 mutation had a significantly poorer prognosis than MDAs without the STK11 mutation (p = 0.039). A germline mutation of STK11 was detected in one PJS patient with mucinous adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. These results suggest that mutations in the STK11 gene may play an important role in the etiology of MDA of the uterine cervix and may distinguish this rare tumor from other common types of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix."

Among other serotypes of S. dysenteriae, Nal(r) type 2 strains were isolated in 2001 and 2002. Although heterogeneous plasmid profiles were obtained depending on the presence or absence of a single plasmid, core plasmids were defined for particular serotypes. On the other hand, the same plasmid profile was found to be shared by different serotypes. Interestingly, plasmid patterns of types 2 and 4 were almost identical except that a middle-range plasmid of 70 to 60 MDa was present in type 4 in addition to the core plasmids.

However, the cellular targets that mediate the effects of USF on cellular proliferation and transformation remain uncharacterized. IGF2R, with multiple functions in both normal growth and cancer, was investigated here as a possible USF target in both nontumorigenic and tumorigenic breast cell lines. The 5'-flanking sequences of the human IGF2R gene contain multiple, highly conserved E boxes almost identical to the consensus USF DNA-binding sequence. These E boxes were found to be essential for IGF2R promoter activity in the nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. USF1 and USF2 bound the IGF2R promoter in vitro, and both USF1 and USF2, but not c-Myc, were present within the IGF2R promoter-associated chromatin in vivo. Overexpressed USF2, but not USF1, transactivated the IGF2R promoter, and IGF2R mRNA was markedly decreased by expression of a USF-specific dominant negative mutant, identifying IGF2R as a USF2 target. IGF2R promoter-driven expression was USF-independent in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, suggesting that a defect in USF function may contribute to down-regulation of IGF2R expression in cancer cells."

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), methyltrienolone (R1881), methyltestosterone, danazol, and androstenedione increased luciferase activity, with EC50 values between 0.11 nM (R1881), 0.14 nM (DHT), and 73.5 nM (androstenedione). DHT-induced luciferase gene expression was inhibited by nonsteroidal antiandrogens, hydroxyflutamide, flutamide, bicalutamide, and vinclozolin. In contrast, the steroidal AR agonist/antagonist cyproterone actetate showed agonistic activity in the absence and presence of DHT, which was not blocked by hydroxyflutamide and thus seems not to be mediated by AR. GR-mediated activation of luciferase by dexamethasone was 100 times less potent than DHT and was not antagonized by hydroxyflutamide.

The cytotoxic action of these drugs has been linked to their ability to inhibit microtubule depolymerization, causing growth arrest and subsequent cell death. Studies by a number of laboratories have also linked suppression of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to enhanced Taxol toxicity. The present study examined the interactions of the semi-synthetic taxane Taxotere with MEK1/2 inhibitors in epithelial tumor cells. Concurrent treatment of MDA-MB-231 mammary and DU145 prostate carcinoma cells with Taxotere and MEK1/2 inhibitor resulted in protection from the anti-proliferative effects of Taxotere in MTT assays. In contrast, in MCF-7 mammary cells, concurrent Taxotere and MEK1/2 inhibitor treatment weakly enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of the taxane. Sequential treatment of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with Taxotere followed by MEK1/2 inhibitor also enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of the taxane in MTT assays. However, no enhancement was observed in DU145 or PC-3 cells. Colony formation assays, including isobologram analyses, provided a more definitive demonstration that MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were sensitized to the toxic effects of Taxotere by U0126. Similar data were observed using Laulimalide, which binds to tubulin at a different site to Taxotere. The enhancement in Taxotere anti-proliferative effects by U0126 correlated with increased cell killing, 48-72h after treatment of cells that was blocked by inhibition of caspase 9, but not caspase 8, function. This observation was associated with prolonged suppression of ERK1/2 and AKT activity, without alteration in either p38 or JNK1/2 activity. Collectively these findings demonstrate that sequential administration of Taxotere followed by MEK1/2 inhibition can lead to increased cell death and loss of reproductive capacity in some, but not all, human tumor cells."

Here we report the complete sequence for projectin from crayfish claw closer muscle (8625 residues; 962,634 Da). The N-terminal sequence contains 12 unique 19-residue repeats rich in glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K). This region, termed the EK region, is clearly distinguishable from the PEVK-like domain of Drosophila projectin. The sequence of crayfish flexor projectin differs from that of closer muscle projectin in that there is a 114-residue deletion and a 35-residue insertion in the N-terminal region. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that projectin is mainly localized within the sarcomeric A band in both closer and flexor muscles, although the N-terminal region was shown to extrude into the I band region. In the closer muscles, invertebrate connectin (D-titin) connects the Z line to the edge of the A band (Fukuzawa et al., 2001).

Here we explored the molecular basis for the decrease or loss of hRFC gene expression in seventeen tumor cell lines with resistance to multiple antifolates due to impaired antifolate transport. We studied the role of various cis-acting elements including CRE/AP-1-like element and GC-box in hRFC promoters A and B, respectively, as well as AP-2, Mzf-1 and E-box that are contained within or near four tandemly repeated sequences upstream of promoter A. Decreased or abolished binding either to [32P]GC-box, Mzf-1, AP-1, E-box, or CRE oligonucleotides was detected in approximately 50-80% of antifolate-resistant cell lines. Strikingly, approximately 80% of the cell lines displayed a simultaneously decreased binding to three or more of these hRFC promoter elements, whereas normal AP-2 binding was retained. The possible contribution of promoter methylation to hRFC gene silencing was also explored. None of the antifolate-resistant cell lines, except for MDA-MB-231 cells, showed hRFC promoter methylation; consistently, MDA-MB-231 was the only cell line that retained binding to all six cis-acting elements. Western blot analysis demonstrated decreased expression of transcriptional activators (pCREB-1, pATF-1, USF-1, c-Fos, c-Jun, Sp1, and Sp3) and/or increased expression of repressors (short Sp3 isoforms), whereas normal AP2alpha levels were retained. Transient expression of the relevant transcription factors restored, at least partially, both promoter binding and hRFC gene expression.

This gene maps to 9p21 and loss of this chromosomal region in tumors offers an unique opportunity for chemoselective treatment, since MTAP is an important salvage enzyme for the formation of adenine that is needed for DNA synthesis. L-Alanosine, an antibiotic from Streptomyces alanosinicus, blocks the common de novo purine biosynthesis pathway and, thereby, inhibits tumor cells with MTAP deficiency. Normal cells escape the detrimental effects of L-alanosine due to their proficiency in the MTAP salvage pathway. The present analysis was undertaken to gain insights into the molecular architecture of tumor cells that determines the response to L-alanosine apart from the MTAP gene. Analysis of cell doubling times and IC(50) values for L-alanosine showed that slowly growing cell lines were more resistant to L-alanosine than rapidly growing ones. Mining the database of the National Cancer Institute (N.C.I.), for the mRNA expression of 9706 genes in 60 cell lines by means of Kendall's tau-test, false discovery rate calculation, and hierarchical cluster analysis pointed to 11 genes or expressed sequence tags whose mRNA expression correlated with the IC(50) values for L-alanosine. Furthermore, we tested L-alanosine for cross-resistance in multidrug-resistant cell lines which overexpress selectively either the P-glycoprotein/MDR1 (CEM/ADR5000), MRP1 (HL-60/AR), or BCRP (MDA-MB-231-BCRP) genes. None of the multidrug-resistant cell lines was cross-resistant to L-alanosine indicating that L-alanosine may be suitable to treat multidrug-resistant, refractory tumors in the clinic. Finally, the IC(50) values for L-alanosine of the 60 cell lines were correlated to the p53 mutational status and expression of p53 downstream genes. We found that p53 mutated cell lines were more resistant to L-alanosine than p53 wild type cell lines."

This work was carried out to elucidate the molecular mechanism of LIGHT-sensitized, interferon gamma (IFNgamma)-mediated apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells. It was revealed that LIGHT treatment resulted in down-regulation of anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 family member: Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Bag-1, and Mcl-1; up-regulation of pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 family member: Bak and Ser (112)-phosphor-Bad; down-regulation of pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 member Bax; the other pro-apoptosis member Bid remains unaltered. LIGHT treatment also resulted in activation of caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7, caspase-8, caspase-9, DFF45, and PARP. However, caspase activation and caspase activity, especially caspase-3 activity, is not required for LIGHT-induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells, since caspase-3 inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone, and a broad range caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-val-ala-asp-fluoromethylketone failed to block the apoptosis induced by LIGHT and IFNgamma in MDA-MB-231 cells. In summary, LIGHT-sensitized IFNgamma-mediated apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells is probably through down-regulation of anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 family members; it could be caspase (especially caspase-3)-independent, even though extensive caspase activation was observed."

To characterize more completely the pathways involved in 5F-203 toxicity, cDNA microarrays were used to determine gene expression changes in MCF-7, a 5F-203-sensitive breast cancer cell line, after treatment with 1 microM 5F-203. The mRNA expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 were both increased approximately 20-fold after 24 h, but less after 6 h of treatment, confirming previous results. However, the most pronounced drug-induced change was in the PLAB gene, encoding one of the bone morphogenic proteins in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. Other induced gene expressions included the apoptosis-initiating receptor TNFRSF6 (CD95/FAS), the DNA-damage response genes CDKN1A (p21/Cip1), p53-induced gene-3, and DNA binding protein 2. In contrast, the transcription factor c-Myc showed reduced expression. Western blot analysis also showed induction of p53 protein expression in response to 5F-203 treatment. In contrast to the MCF-7 data, MDA-MB-435, a cancer cell line resistant to 5F-203, showed no change in expression of any of these genes or the p53 protein under the same conditions of 5F-203 treatment. These data are consistent with the idea that CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 activation leads to 5F-203 toxicity through DNA damage-induced apoptosis, as well as signaling through a variant member of the TGF-beta superfamily."

These cell lines constitute a stable and accessible experimental system for the identification of metastasis-related genes and for the study of their role in the process of metastasis. In this study, we used a combination of RNA arbitrarily primed-polymerase chain reaction (RAP-PCR) fingerprinting and cDNA arrays (here termed &quot;RAP-array&quot;) to identify genes differentially expressed with respect to metastatic phenotype. RAP-PCR was used to generate radioactive probes of reduced complexity for hybridization to nylon membranes containing 588 cDNAs of known identity. Single RAP-PCR fingerprint probes hybridized from 61 (10.4%) to 116 (19.7%) of the filter array targets, with a signal detection overlap of approximately 21%. A total of 344 (57%) of the 588 target genes were detected by five single RAP-PCR fingerprints. The advantage of using reduced complexity probes was highlighted by the fact that the combination of RAP probes before hybridization compromised the overall detection rate by up to 40%. Sequential application of RAP-PCR probes allowed the screening of a greater, and an alternative fraction of the transcript population than was achieved with a radiolabeled total cDNA probe. Verification by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR confirmed significantly increased expression of keratin 9 (&gt;100-fold) in nonmetastatic breast tumor cells and of CD70 (fivefold) in metastatic cells. The differential expression of keratin 9 and CD70 was maintained between cells grown as primary xenografts in athymic mice. The RAP-array method enabled the detection of genes not revealed using other screening methods and that are candidates for further investigation in the context of metastatic phenotype."

To investigate the clinical relevance of melanoma differentiation antigens (MDAs) as T-cell targets, the relationship between the presence and localization of T-cell subsets and the expression of MDAs was studied by immunohistochemistry and the diversity of CD8+ T cells in regressive melanomas was assessed using laser-assisted microdissection. While MDA expression as well as T-cell subset distribution, as assessed by immunohistochemical analysis, was heterogeneous within and between lesions, they were histologically independent phenomena. In four lesions studied in detail by PCR analysis of microdissected T cells, a limited T-cell diversity and evidence for clonally expanded tumour infiltrating lymphocytes were found. However, no major differences in T-cell diversity, as assessed by PCR analysis, between peri-and intra-tumoural areas became apparent, this despite the known clinical significance of the specific localization of a T-cell infiltrate. T cells of clonal origin did not show preferential localization to regressive tumour areas. Moreover, clonally related cells were found in two lesions with a non-brisk infiltrate, while in two lesions with a brisk infiltrate (clinically, a good prognostic factor) no evidence for clonally expanded tumour infiltrating lymphocytes was found. These data support the notion that specific immune reactivity and homing of specific cells to the tumour can occur in melanoma patients. However, they also show that the presence of clonally expanded T cells in the tumour is not necessarily associated with an effective anti-tumour immune response and may, for instance, represent regulatory cells. It appears that the clinical impact of an anti-tumour immune response is largely decided at the tumour site, where micro-environmental conditions dictate the functional state of the T cells. Full understanding of these processes can only be achieved by performing more dynamic analyses of the local host-tumour interactions."

Polymers and copolymers of N-ethoxyethylacrylamide (NEEA) and N-methoxyethylacrylamide (NMEA) were synthesized by aqueous-phase free-radical polymerization and characterized by tandem gel permeation chromatography-multi-angle laser light scattering. These copolymer matrices exhibit &quot;re-entrant&quot;-type volume phase transitions, forming entangled networks with high shear viscosity at low (&lt; 20 degrees C) and high (&gt; 35 degrees C) temperatures, and undergoing a &quot;coil-to-globular&quot;, lower critical solution temperature (LCST)-like phase transition over an intermediate temperature range (20-35 degrees C). Hence, matrix viscosity is relatively low at room temperature (25 degrees C), and increases rapidly above 35 degrees C. The material properties and phase behavior of these thermogelling polymer networks were studied by steady-shear rheometry. These matrices are easily loaded into capillary arrays at room temperature while existing as viscous fluids, but thermogel above 35 degrees C to form transparent hydrogels via a thermo-associative phase transition. The extent of the intermediate viscosity drop and the final viscosity increase depends on the composition of the copolymers. DNA sequencing by capillary array electrophoresis with four-color laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection shows that these thermogelling networks provide enhanced resolution of both small and large DNA sequencing fragments and longer sequencing read lengths, in comparison to appropriate control (closely related, nonthermogelling) polymer networks. In particular, a copolymer comprised of 90% w/w NMEA and 10% w/w NEEA, with a molecular mass of approximately 2 MDa, delivers around 600 bases at 98.5% base-calling accuracy in 100 min of electrophoresis."

Mol. Biol. 251: 703-720, 1995). The cDNA sequences of the five major constituent chains, globin chains IIA, IIB, B, and C and linker chain L1, are reported here. The globins and linkers share 30%-50% and 20%-30% identity, respectively, with other annelid sequences. Furthermore, IIB and C align with strain A of annelid sequences, whereas IIA and B align with the strain B sequences. Although chains B and C are monomeric, chains IIA and IIB form the main disulfide-bonded dimer. They also have some unusual features: the distal His (E7) is replaced by Phe in IIA, and the highly conserved CD1Phe is replaced by Leu in IIB. In spite of these unusual features, the functional properties of Macrobdella Hb are comparable to those of other HBL Hbs. A phylogenetic analysis of the globin sequences from Macrobdella, the polychaete Tylorrhynchus, the oligochaete Lumbricus, and the vestimentiferan Lamellibrachia, indicates that the two strains originated by gene duplication followed by additional duplication of each of the two strains. The mutation rate of the linkers appeared to be faster than that of the globin chains. The phylogenetic trees constructed using the Maximum Likelihood, Neighbor-Joining and Fitch methods showed the Macrobdella globin sequences to be closest to Lumbricus, in agreement with a view of annelid evolution in which the divergence of the polychaetes occurred before the divergence of the leeches from oligochaetes."

Bombesin (BN) peptides that bind specifically to these receptors are useful for detection of bombesin receptor-expressing cancers in vivo. A new 99mTc-labelled-BN peptide for targeting bombesin receptor-expressing cancers was prepared and characterized.MATERIALS AND METHODS: MAG3-coupled BN peptide (MAG3-BN) was prepared by solid-phase synthesis and radiolabelled with 99mTc by an exchange method. In vitro cell binding assays were conducted on human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. In vivo biodistribution studies were performed in normal and nude mice bearing bombesin receptor-positive tumors.RESULTS: Radiolabelling of MAG3-BN with 99mTc produces a single radioactive species (&gt; 95%). In vitro cell-binding indicated the affinity and specificity of 99mTc-MAG3-BN towards bombesin receptors. In vivo biodistribution in mice demonstrated that 99mTc-MAG3-BN cleared rapidly from the blood and most non-targeted tissues and was excreted mainly via the kidneys. Uptake in bombesin receptor-positive tissues and in the tumor was low to moderate.CONCLUSION: 99mTc-MAG3-BN displays good radiolabelling together with certain favorable biological characteristics and might be a useful peptide radiopharmaceutical in the detection of bombesin receptor-expressing cancers in vivo."

TXAS is a non-classic cytochrome P450 in that it does not require molecular oxygen or an external electron donor for catalysis. Difficulty in obtaining crystals from the membrane-bound TXAS prompted us to modify the protein to a soluble form. Results from site-directed mutagenesis, hydropathy analysis, and homology modeling led us to identify a putative membrane association segment near the end of helix F in TXAS. We report here the generation of a soluble form of TXAS by deletion of the amino-terminal membrane-anchoring domain and replacement of the helix F and F-G loop region with the corresponding region of the structurally characterized microsomal P450 2C5. The resultant TXAS/2C5 chimera is expressed in bacteria as a cytosolic and monomeric protein. Addition of an amino-terminal leader sequence to enhance expression and a tetra-histidine segment at the carboxyl-terminus to facilitate purification yielded approximately 4 mg of nearly homogeneous TXAS/2C5 per liter of bacterial culture. The TXAS/2C5 chimera contains heme at nearly a 1:1 molar ratio and catalyzes the formation of TXA2, MDA, and HHT at a 1:1:1 ratio, although with a reduced catalytic activity compared to wild type TXAS. TXAS/2C5 exhibits electronic absorption spectra similar to wild type TXAS and has similar affinities toward distal heme ligands such as imidazole and U44069. The chimera was mono-dispersive and thus is promising for crystallization trials."

The active substance was identified as the 15-membered peptaibol type peptide Ampullosporin. Although to date more than 300 peptaibols have been discovered, their biosynthetic machinery has not been characterized yet. By improving the culture conditions it was possible to grow S. ampullosporum in a submerged culture and to increase Ampullosporin production by more than three times to 33 mg/l at reduced fermentation times. The appearance of two high molecular weight proteins, HMWP1 (1.5 MDa) and HMWP2 (350 kDa) was closely related to the production of Ampullosporin during the course of fermentation. Both proteins showed a cross-reaction with antibodies against a core fragment of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Biochemical characterization of the partially purified enzymes exhibited selectivity for the substrate amino acid alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib). substantiating their involvement in Ampullosporin biosynthesis. Our data suggest that Ampullosporin synthetase has been isolated, and provides the basis for the characterization of the entire biosynthetic gene cluster. Furthermore, this knowledge will enable the manipulation of its NRPS template, in order to engineer mutant strains of Sepedonium ampullosporum which could produce more potent analogues of Ampullosporin."

To date, the reason for such selectivity in the site of metastasis remains largely unknown. The bone is a rich source of many chemokines and growth factors, including: insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I and II, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), interleukins, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). We propose that exposure of breast cancer cells to the bone microenvironment results in alterations in gene expression that favour the growth and proliferation of tumour cells in the bone. To investigate this hypothesis, MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells were exposed to bone-derived conditioned media (BDCM) generated by culturing fetal rat calvaria for 24 h under serum free conditions. Using cDNA microarray technology, we have identified the insulin-like growth factor family of binding proteins (IGFBPs) as genes whose expression profiles are consistently and significantly altered with exposure to this simulated bone environment in vitro, when compared to untreated controls. Our data suggests that the upregulation of IGFBP-3 seen with exposure to the bone microenvironment is directly linked to an increase in TGF-beta mediated cell proliferation. Furthermore, this process appears to be functioning through an IGF-independent mechanism."

A prominent early response gene for DNA damage is the gene encoding p21(WAF-1/CIP-1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that regulates progression through the cell cycle. In this study, we explored the feasibility of imaging p21(WAF-1/CIP-1) gene expression at the mRNA level using an 18-mer phosphorothioated antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) labeled with (111)In. The known induction of the p21(WAF-1/CIP-1) gene in MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells following exposure to epidermal growth factor (EGF) was used as an experimental tool. Treatment of MDA-MB-468 cells in vitro with EGF (20 n M) increased the ratio of p21(WAF-1/CIP-1) mRNA/beta-actin mRNA threefold within 2 h as measured by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A concentration-dependent inhibition of EGF-induced p21(WAF-1/CIP-1) protein expression was achieved in MDA-MB-468 cells by treatment with antisense ODNs with up to a tenfold decrease observed at 1 microM. There was a fourfold lower inhibition of p21(WAF-1/CIP-1) protein expression by control sense or random sequence ODNs. Intratumoral injections of EGF (15 microg/dayx3 days) were employed to induce p21(WAF-1/CIP-1) gene expression in MDA-MB-468 xenografts implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice. RT-PCR of explanted tumors showed a threefold increased level of p21(WAF-1/CIP-1) mRNA compared with normal saline-treated tumors. Successful imaging of EGF-induced p21(WAF-1/CIP-1) gene expression in MDA-MB-468 xenografts was achieved at 48 h post injection of (111)In-labeled antisense ODNs (3.7 MBq; 2 microg). Tumors displaying basal levels of p21(WAF-1/CIP-1) gene expression in the absence of EGF treatment could not be visualized. Biodistribution studies showed a significantly higher tumor accumulation of (111)In-labeled antisense ODNs in the presence of EGF induction of the p21(WAF-1/CIP-1) gene (0.32%+/-0.06% injected dose/g) compared with normal saline-treated control mice (0.11%+/-0.07% injected dose/g). The tumor/blood ratio for antisense ODNs in the presence of EGF induction of the p21(WAF-1/CIP-1) gene (4.87+/-0.87) was also significantly higher than for control random sequence ODNs (2.14+/-0.69) or for mice receiving antisense ODNs but not treated with EGF (2.07+/-0.37). We conclude that antisense imaging of upregulated p21(WAF-1/CIP-1) gene expression is feasible and could represent a promising new molecular imaging strategy for monitoring tumor response in cancer patients. To our knowledge, this study also describes the first report of molecular imaging of the upregulated expression of a downstream gene target of the EGFR, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor."

For ATRA to induce growth inhibition, it needs to bind to retinoic acid receptors and modulate gene transcription via retinoic acid response elements (RAREs). We hypothesized that HER2/neu suppresses RARE binding activity to prevent ATRA from inducing growth arrest in breast cancer cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that when HER2/neu was inhibited by the trastuzumab antibody, RARE binding activity increased, indicating that HER2/neu suppresses RARE binding. Since trastuzumab also decreased Akt activity, we determined whether Akt regulates RARE binding activity. Compared to parental MDA-MB-453 cells, MDA-MB-453 cells transfected with a dominant negative Akt mutant (MDA-MB-453/DN-Akt) had higher RARE binding activity. However, trastuzumab did not further increase RARE binding activity in MDA-MB-453/DN-Akt cells. These data indicate that HER2/neu predominantly uses Akt to suppress RARE binding activity, which may be one mechanism by which HER2/neu induces ATRA resistance in breast cancer cells."

Seventy-four sequences were cloned and the differential expression of five genes was confirmed using dot-blots. These were identified as procollagen type-IV, Tie-2/Tek receptor tyrosine kinase, NADH dehydrogenase subunit-6, and ferritin heavy-chain, which were up-regulated, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5, which was down-regulated.

We intended to examine the presence of estrogenic growth factor effects in an ER alpha-negative breast cancer cell line. By means of reporter gene assays, we investigated the activation of estrogen response elements (EREs) by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the estrogen-unresponsive cell line MDA-MB-231. Our results demonstrate the H-ras-dependent activation of EREs after EGF treatment in this estrogen-unresponsive cell line, an effect which was not observed in the ERalpha/beta-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7. In MDA-MB-231 cells, the transcriptional activity of an ERE-containing promotor was enhanced dose dependently by all tested EGF concentrations. This effect could be blocked by co-treatment with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors AG1478 and ZD1839, as well as by co-transfection with a vector coding for a dominant negative H-ras mutant, but not by co-treatment with the pure antiestrogen ICI182,780. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active H-ras was shown to be sufficient to activate EREs in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results suggest alternative utilization of ERE-mediated gene regulation in an estradiol-unresponsive breast cancer cell line in response to an EGF stimulus. This mechanism was shown to be dependent on EGFR and H-ras activity, but independent of the presence of functional ERalpha."

The E2-responsive constructs contained promoter inserts from the human complement C3 (pC3), human cathepsin D (pCD) and rat creatine kinase B (pCKB) genes. Minimal ER beta-dependent transactivation (&lt;2.5-fold induction) was observed for E2 only in ECC1 and MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pCKB or pC3, whereas 4-OHT was inactive as an ER beta agonist for all promoters in the four cell lines. The ER alpha agonist and/or antagonist activities for E2 and 4-OHT were highly variable and the transactivation was dependent on ER subtype, ER alpha variant expressed, gene promoter, and cell context. For example, E2 did not activate pCD in HepG2 cells transfected with wild-type or variant ER alpha, whereas E2 activated reporter gene activity in the four endometrial and breast cancer cell lines transfected with ER alpha and pCD, pCKB or pC3. Hormone activation of these constructs by ER alpha-AF1 or ER alpha-AF2 was highly variable among the different cell lines and even in the same cell line transfected with the three E2-responsive constructs. Similar variability was observed for 4-OHT. For example, 4-OHT activates pC3 in HepG2 cells transfected with ER alpha or ER alpha-AF1, and pCKB in HEC1A cells. However, AF1-dependent activation by 4-OHT is not observed for pCKB in ECC1 cells or for pC3 and pCD in HEC1A or ECC1 endometrial cancer cells. The results of this study suggest that transcriptional activation by E2 and 4-OHT induces recruitment of different transcription factor complexes that are dependent on the cell type and also the gene promoter."

Expression vector pGEX2T was transfected into E. coli (BL-21) and hEGF-CH1 expressed by induction of the lac Iq promotor with 50 microM isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). hEGF- CH1 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was isolated and purified by affinity chromatography. GST was cleaved using thrombin. SDS-PAGE demonstrated a protein with the expected M(r) (18 kDa) positive for hEGF by Western blot. hEGF-linker-CH1 exhibited preserved binding to A431 (2-3 x 10(6) EGFR/cell) and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (1-2 x 10(6) EGFR/cell). hEGF-CH1 without the linker exhibited poor receptor binding. hEGF-linker-CH1 also exhibited strong binding to soluble EGFR equivalent to that of hEGF. The tumor and normal tissue distribution of hEGF-linker-CH1 labeled with 123I was compared with 123 I-hEGF at 24 h after i.v. injection to mice implanted with s.c. MDA-MB-468 xenografts. Fusion of hEGF with CH1 increased its retention in the blood 14-fold but did not significantly increase tumor uptake. Tumor/blood ratios were higher for hEGF than for hEGF-linker-CH1. We conclude that hEGF is more attractive than hEGF-linker-CH1 for imaging EGFR-positive tumors."

The p160 nuclear receptor coactivator, AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1), is frequently amplified and overexpressed in human breast cancer and has been shown to enhance estrogen-dependent transactivation.METHODS: To better understand the molecular and physiological consequences of AIB1 overexpression in breast cancer cells, an AIB1 cDNA was transfected into the low AIB1 expressing, estrogen-receptor (ER) negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-436. The features of a derivative cell line, designated 436.1, which expresses high levels of AIB1, are described and compared with the parental cell line.RESULTS: A significant increase in the levels of CREB binding protein (CBP) was observed in 436.1 cells and immunofluorescent staining revealed altered AIB1 and CBP staining patterns compared to the parental cells. Further, transient transfection assays demonstrated that the overall estrogen-dependent transactivation in 436.1 cells is approximately 20-fold higher than the parental cells and the estrogen dose-response curve is repositioned to the right. Finally, cDNA microarray analysis of approximately 7,100 cDNAs identified a number of differentially expressed genes in the 436.1 cells.CONCLUSION: These observations lend insight into downstream signaling pathways that are influenced by AIB1."

The amplified ERbeta gene was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3, generating pCDNA3-ERbeta. The ERbeta expression was detected by Western blot and in vitro translation. The biological activity of ERbeta was detected by transfecting the pCDNA3-ERbeta into SV40-transformed embryonic kidney cell line 293T,breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, SKBR3, and prostate cancer cell line PC-3, with reporters containing estrogen response elements.RESULTS: The recombinant plasmid pCDNA3-ERbeta was confirmed by restriction analysis to contain the ERbeta gene. The 63 000 ERbeta expression was shown by Western blot and further confirmed by in vitro translation. The ERbeta expression in different cancer cells was demonstrated to stimulate the expression of the reporters containing estrogen response elements, ERE and C3.CONCLUSION: ERbeta protein is successfully expressed and has biological activity, laying solid foundation for further study on its role in cancer cells."

Because DNA yield from human samples is frequently limiting, much effort has been invested in developing methods for whole genome amplification (WGA) by random or degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR. However, existing WGA methods like degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR suffer from incomplete coverage and inadequate average DNA size. We describe a method, termed multiple displacement amplification (MDA), which provides a highly uniform representation across the genome. Amplification bias among eight chromosomal loci was less than 3-fold in contrast to 4-6 orders of magnitude for PCR-based WGA methods. Average product length was &gt;10 kb. MDA is an isothermal, strand-displacing amplification yielding about 20-30 microg product from as few as 1-10 copies of human genomic DNA. Amplification can be carried out directly from biological samples including crude whole blood and tissue culture cells. MDA-amplified human DNA is useful for several common methods of genetic analysis, including genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms, chromosome painting, Southern blotting and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, subcloning, and DNA sequencing. MDA-based WGA is a simple and reliable method that could have significant implications for genetic studies, forensics, diagnostics, and long-term sample storage."

Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (mda-5) as a gene induced during differentiation, cancer reversion, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). This gene contains both a caspase recruitment domain and putative DExH group RNA helicase domains. Atypical helicase motifs of MDA-5 deviate from consensus sequences but are well conserved in a potentially new group of cloned and hypothetical proteins. mda-5 is an early response gene inducible by IFN and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, responding predominantly to IFN-beta. Protein kinase C activation by mezerein further augments mda-5 expression induced by IFN-beta. Expression of mda-5 is controlled transcriptionally by IFN-beta, and the MDA-5 protein localizes in the cytoplasm. mda-5 displays RNA-dependent ATPase activity, and ectopic expression of mda-5 in human melanoma cells inhibits colony formation. In these contexts, mda-5 may function as a mediator of IFN-induced growth inhibition and/or apoptosis.

These include activating signal cointegrator 2 (ASC-2), a recently isolated transcriptional coactivator molecule, which is amplified in human cancers and stimulates transactivation by nuclear receptors and numerous other transcription factors. In this report, we show that ASC-2 belongs to a steady-state complex of approximately 2 MDa (ASC-2 complex [ASCOM]) in HeLa nuclei. ASCOM contains retinoblastoma-binding protein RBQ-3, alpha/beta-tubulins, and trithorax group proteins ALR-1, ALR-2, HALR, and ASH2. In particular, ALR-1/2 and HALR contain a highly conserved 130- to 140-amino-acid motif termed the SET domain, which was recently implicated in histone H3 lysine-specific methylation activities. Indeed, recombinant ALR-1, HALR, and immunopurified ASCOM exhibit very weak but specific H3-lysine 4 methylation activities in vitro, and transactivation by retinoic acid receptor appears to involve ligand-dependent recruitment of ASCOM and subsequent transient H3-lysine 4 methylation of the promoter region in vivo. Thus, ASCOM may represent a distinct coactivator complex of nuclear receptors. Further characterization of ASCOM will lead to a better understanding of how nuclear receptors and other transcription factors mediate transcriptional activation."

Fusion proteins consisting of different repeats of Mub and the maltose-binding protein (MBP) were produced. These proteins adhered to pig mucus components, with molecular masses ranging from &lt;0.1 to &gt;2 MDa, to pig gastric mucin and to hen intestinal mucus. The binding of Mub to mucus components occurred in the pH range 3-7.4, with maximum binding at pH 4-5 and could be partly inhibited by the glycoprotein fetuin. Affinity-purified antibodies against recombinant Mub were used in immunofluorescence microscopy to demonstrate the presence of Mub on the cell surface of strain 1063. By using the antibodies in a Western blot analysis, Mub could also be detected in the growth medium.

The key to NF-kappaB regulation is the inhibitory IkappaB proteins. During response to diverse stimuli, IkappaBs are rapidly phosphorylated by IkappaB kinases (IKKs), ubiquitinated and undergo degradation. We have investigated the expression and function of NF-kappaB, IkappaB inhibitors and IKKs in normal prostate epithelial cells and prostate carcinoma (PC) cell lines LNCaP, MDA PCa 2b, DU145, PC3, and JCA1. We found that NF-kappaB was constitutively activated in human androgen-independent PC cell lines DU145, PC3, JCA1 as well as androgen-independent CL2 cells derived from LNCaP. In spite of a strong difference in constitutive kappaB binding, Western blot analysis did not reveal any significant variance in the expression of p50, p65, IkappaBs, IKKalpha, and IKKbeta between primary prostate cells, androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PC cells. However, we found that in androgen-independent PC cells IkappaBalpha was heavily phosphorylated and displayed a faster turnover. Using an in vitro kinase assay we demonstrated constitutive activation of IKK in androgen-independent PC cell lines. Blockage of NF-kappaB activity in PC cells by dominant-negative IkappaBalpha resulted in increased constitutive and TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that increased IKK activation leads to the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB 'survival signaling' pathway in androgen-independent PC cells. This may be important for the support of their androgen-independent status and growth advantage."

Fluorescent F3 accumulated in HL-60 and MDA-MB-435 tumors after an i.v. injection, appearing in the nuclei of tumor endothelial cells and tumor cells. Thus, F3 can carry a payload (phage, fluorescein) to a tumor and into the cell nuclei in the tumor. This peptide may be suitable for targeting cytotoxic drugs and gene therapy vectors into tumors."

We have generated constructs comprising the cytoplasmic segment of DEP-1 fused to the maltose-binding protein to identify potential substrates and thereby suggest a physiological function for DEP-1. We have shown that the substrate-trapping mutant form of DEP-1 interacted with a small subset of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from lysates of the human breast tumor cell lines MDA-MB-231, T-47D, and T-47D/Met and have identified the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor receptor Met, the adapter protein Gab1, and the junctional component p120 catenin as potential substrates. Following ligand stimulation, phosphorylation of specific tyrosyl residues in Met induces mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic responses. When co-expressed in 293 cells, the full-length substrate-trapping mutant form of DEP-1 formed a stable complex with the chimeric receptor colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF)-Met and wild type DEP-1 dephosphorylated CSF-Met. Furthermore, we observed that DEP-1 preferentially dephosphorylated a Gab1 binding site (Tyr(1349)) and a COOH-terminal tyrosine implicated in morphogenesis (Tyr(1365)), whereas tyrosine residues in the activation loop of Met (Tyr(1230), Tyr(1234), and Tyr(1235)) were not preferred targets of the PTP. The ability of DEP-1 preferentially to dephosphorylate particular tyrosine residues that are required for Met-induced signaling suggests that DEP-1 may function in controlling the specificity of signals induced by this PTK, rather than as a simple &quot;off-switch&quot; to counteract PTK activity."

The Arg(388) allele was also found in cell lines derived from a variety of other tumor types as well as in the germ-line of cancer patients and healthy individuals. Analysis of three geographically separated groups indicated that it occurs in approximately 50% of the human population. Investigation of the clinical data of 84 breast cancer patients revealed that homo- or heterozygous carriers of the Arg(388) allele had a significantly reduced disease-free survival time (P = 0.01) within a median follow-up of 62 months. Moreover, the FGFR4 Arg(388) allele was associated with early lymph node metastasis and advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage in 82 colon cancer patients. Consistent with this finding, MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells expressing FGFR4 Arg(388) exhibited increased motility relative to cells expressing the FGFR4 Gly(388) isotype.

To determine whether this natural indole has a direct growth inhibitory effect on human breast cancer cells, we examined the cell cycle regulatory effects of DIM in estrogen-dependent (MCF-7) and estrogen-independent (MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer cell lines. Results of flow cytometry studies showed that DIM treatment produced a marked increase (from 51 to 79%) in the proportion of cells in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle, regardless of estrogen-receptor status. Analyses of G(1)-acting cell cycle components indicated that the enzymatic activity of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 was also strongly reduced. Western blot analyses showed that, concurrent with the DIM-induced cell cycle arrest, DIM stimulated a rapid and pronounced increase in levels of the CDK inhibitor, p21(WAF1/CIP1) (p21). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that DIM increased p21 mRNA expression with a maximal 6-7-fold induction, and exposure to cycloheximide did not block the response. Similar increases in expression of p21 protein and mRNA were observed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, suggesting that DIM induction of p21 expression is independent of estrogen-receptor signaling and p53. Transient transfection of 5'-deletion constructs of the p21 promoter demonstrated that the first 291 bp segment of the proximal promoter, which contains six promoter specific transcription factor 1 (Sp1) elements, maintained DIM responsiveness. Consistent with a role for Sp1 in this response, a reporter construct driven by three consensus Sp1 binding sites was responsive to DIM. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that DIM induced the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the consensus Sp1 responsive element. Thus, our observations have uncovered an antiproliferative pathway for DIM that implicates Sp1/Sp3-induced expression of p21 as a target for cell cycle control in human breast cancer cells."

In this study human breast tumor cells were found to exhibit diverse gap junction phenotypes including (a) undetectable Cx43 and no intercellular communication (HBL100); (b) low levels of Cx43 and sparse intercellular communication (MDA-MB-231); and (c) significant levels of Cx43 and moderate intercellular communication (Hs578T). Although retroviral delivery of Cx43 and Cx26 cDNAs to MDA-MB-231 cells did not achieve an expected substantial rescue of intercellular communication, overexpression of connexin genes did result in a dramatic suppression of tumor growth when connexin-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells were implanted into the mammary fat pad of nude mice. Subsequent immunolocalization studies on xenograph sections revealed only cytoplasmic stores of Cx43 and no detectable gap junctions. Moreover, DNA array and Western blot analysis demonstrated that overexpression of Cx43 or Cx26 in MDA-MB-231 cells down-regulated fibroblast growth factor receptor-3. Surprisingly, these results suggest that Cx43 and Cx26 induce their tumor-suppressing properties by a mechanism that is independent of significant gap junctional intercellular communication and possibly through the down-regulation of key genes involved in tumor growth. Moreover, our studies show that retroviruses are effective vehicles for delivering connexins to human breast tumor cells, facilitating potential gene therapy applications."

Recent studies indicate that 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) modulates VEGF expression in breast and uterine cells, involving transcriptional activation through estrogen receptor (ER) alpha. However, molecular mechanisms of VEGF regulation mediated by the two ER subtypes and the potential role of ERbeta in the control of breast cancer angiogenesis have not yet been investigated. In transient transfection assays using the VEGF(-2275/+54) promoter-luciferase construct, E(2) (1 nM) increased transcription activity in MCF-7 cells (either untransfected or cotransfected with ERalpha) and it increased transcription activity in MDA-MB-231 cells cotransfected with ERalpha or ERbeta (1.8- and 2-fold induction, respectively). The positive effect was abolished when MCF-7 cells were treated with pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 or the agonist/antagonist tamoxifen (1 micro M). To identify response elements involved in this transcriptional regulation, MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with several deletion constructs of the VEGF promoter. Deletion of 1.2-2.3 kb upstream to the transcription start in the VEGF promoter abrogated E(2)-dependent transcription in these cells. This region contains an imperfect estrogen-responsive element (ERE), ERE1520, and one activator protein 1 site. Transfection of MCF-7 cells (ERalpha) with the ERE1520-luciferase construct conferred transcriptional activity with 1 nM E(2) (1.9-fold induction). Also, the imperfect ERE formed a complex with ERalpha or ERbeta proteins in gel shift assay using MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts. In contrast to ERalpha, ERbeta could transactivate VEGF reporter construct in MDA-MB-231 cells, in the presence of E(2) or tamoxifen, suggesting different transactivational mechanisms between ERalpha and ERbeta in the presence of tamoxifen. Interestingly, E(2) inhibited VEGF transcription in MCF-7 cells transfected with ERbeta or MDA-MB-231 cells cotransfected with ERalpha and ERbeta, suggesting that heterodimerization of ERalpha/ERbeta has the ability to inhibit E(2)-induced VEGF expression in breast cancer cells. These results demonstrate that VEGF is a target gene for ERalpha and ERbeta in breast cancer cells; it remains to be determined whether ERalpha and ERbeta expression in breast biopsies correlates with VEGF expression and vascular density."

The autocatalytic degradation product is a cell surface 44-kDa fragment of MT1-MMP (Gly(285)-Val(582)) in which the ectodomain consists of only the linker, hemopexin C domain and the stalk segment found before the transmembrane sequence. In the collagenases, hemopexin C domain exosites bind native collagen, which is required for triple helicase activity during collagen cleavage. Here we investigated the collagen binding properties and the role of the hemopexin C domain of MT1-MMP and of the 44-kDa MT1-MMP ectodomain in collagenolysis. Recombinant proteins, MT1-LCD (Gly(285)-Cys(508)), consisting of the linker and the hemopexin C domain, and MT1-CD (Gly(315)-Cys(508)), which consists of the hemopexin C domain only, were found to bind native type I collagen but not gelatin. Functionally, MT1-LCD inhibited collagen-induced MMP2 activation in fibroblasts, suggesting that interactions between collagen and endogenous MT1-MMP directly stimulate the cellular activation of pro-MMP2. MT1-LCD, but not MT1-CD, also blocked the cleavage of native type I collagen by MT1-MMP in vitro, indicating an important role for the MT1-MMP linker region in triple helicase activity. Similarly, soluble MT1-LCD, but not MT1-CD or peptide analogs of the MT1-MMP linker, reduced the invasion of type I collagen matrices by MDA-MB-231 cells as did the expression of recombinant 44-kDa MT1-MMP on the cell surface. Together, these studies demonstrate that generation of the 44-kDa MT1-MMP autolysis product regulates collagenolytic activity and subsequent invasive potential, suggesting a novel feedback mechanism for the control of pericellular proteolysis."

Nse1p is essential for cell proliferation and localizes primarily in the nucleus. nse1 mutants are highly sensitive to DNA-damaging treatments and exhibit abnormal cellular morphologies, suggesting aberrant mitosis as a terminal morphological phenotype. These results are consistent with the reported features of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe SMC6 gene, rad18, which is thought to be involved in recombinational DNA repair.

In vitro, the MDA-MET cells have a similar growth rate to the parental MDA-231 cells yet demonstrate distinct adhesive and invasive phenotypes. MDA-MET cells show increased early adhesion to type IV collagen and are significantly more invasive through Matrigel than MDA-231 cells. Analysis of the gene expression profile in the metastatic MDA-MET versus poorly metastatic MDA-231 cells identified relatively few genes whose expression was altered &gt;2-fold. Of particular interest was the lack of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) mRNA expression, which was supported at the protein level by immunoradiometric assay. These data support the idea that PTHrP is not predictive of the metastasis of human breast cancer to bone. Another important difference between the two cell lines was the elevated expression by MDA-MET cells of the cytokine IL-8. Reverse transcriptase-PCR and ELISA confirmed the increased expression of IL-8 in MDA-MET cells. In addition, IL-8 mRNA expression is also elevated in a variety of human cancer cell lines with different metastatic potential in vivo. These experiments suggest that the elevated expression of IL-8 (and not PTHrP) by MDA-MET cells is a phenotypic change that may be related to their enhanced ability to metastasize to the skeleton."

We hypothesized that proteins that interact with histidine kinases throughout evolution may represent partners for Nm23-H1 and focused on the interaction of Arabidopsis &quot;two-component&quot; histidine kinase ERS with CTR1. A mammalian homolog of CTR1 was previously reported to be c-Raf; we now report that CTR1 also exhibits homology to the kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), a scaffold protein for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Nm23-H1 co-immunoprecipitated KSR from lysates of transiently transfected 293T cells and at endogenous protein expression levels in MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells. Autophosphorylated recombinant Nm23-H1 phosphorylated KSR in vitro. Phosphoamino acid analysis identified serine as the major target, and two peaks of Nm23-H1 phosphorylation were identified upon high performance liquid chromatography analysis of KSR tryptic peptides. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that Nm23-H1 phosphorylated KSR serine 392, a 14-3-3-binding site, as well as serine 434 when serine 392 was mutated. Phosphorylated MAPK but not total MAPK levels were reduced in an nm23-H1 transfectant of MDA-MB-435 cells. The data identify a complex in vitro histidine-to-serine protein kinase pathway, which may contribute to signal transduction and metastasis."

However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. In the current study, we report the first evidence that endogenous maspin expression in mammary carcinoma cells MDA-MB-435 enhanced staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis as judged by the increased fragmentation of DNA, increased proteolytic inactivation of poly-[ADP-ribose]-polymerase (PARP), as well as the increased activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. In parallel, recombinant maspin did not directly regulate the proteolytic activities of either caspase-3 or caspase-8 in vitro. Consistent with this result, maspin expressing normal mammary epithelial cells underwent more rapid STS-induced apoptosis as compared to breast carcinoma cells. Interestingly, maspin transfectant cells did not undergo spontaneous apoptosis in the absence of STS. Moreover, neither purified maspin protein added from outside nor endogenous maspin secreted to the cell culture media sensitized cells to STS-induced apoptosis. To investigate the structural determinants of maspin in its apoptosis-sensitizing effect, MDA-MB-435 cells were also transfected with maspin/PAI-1 and PAI-1/maspin chimeric constructs resulting from swapping the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains between maspin and PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1). The resulting stable transfectant clones expressing maspin/PAI-1 and PAI-1/maspin, respectively, did not undergo spontaneous apoptosis, and were similarly inhibited as maspin transfectant cells in motility assay. Interestingly, however, expression of both maspin/PAI-1 and PAI-1/maspin in MDA-MB-435 cells failed to sensitize these cells to STS-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our evidence provides new insights into the complex molecular mechanisms of maspin that may suppress breast tumor progression not only at the step of invasion and motility, but also by regulating tumor cell apoptosis. The sensitizing effect of maspin on apoptosis is to be contrasted by the pro-survival effect of several other serpins."

Northern blot analysis revealed mda-7/IL-24 expression in human tissues associated with the immune system such as spleen, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes and normal melanocytes. The MDA-7/IL-24 mouse counterpart, FISP, appears to be a Th2-specific protein and the rat counterpart, C49A/MOB-5, is associated with wound healing and is also induced as a consequence of ras-transformation. A notable property of MDA-7/IL-24 is its ability to induce apoptosis in a large spectrum of human cancer derived cell lines, in mouse xenografts and upon intratumoral injection in human tumors (phase I clinical trials). Various aspects of this intriguing molecule including its cytokine and anti-tumoral effects are described and discussed."

We have previously reported that this transcript accumulates in epithelial cells in approximately 10% of breast cancers. To gain further insight on how the overexpression of the H19 gene affects the phenotype of human breast epithelial cells, we investigated the oncogenic potential of RNA that was abundantly expressed from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells stably transfected with the genomic sequence of the human H19 gene. The amount of H19 RNA did not affect cell proliferation capacity, timing of cell cycle phases or anchorage-dependent ability of H19-transfected clones in vitro. But in anchorage-independent growth assays the H19-recombined cells formed more and larger colonies in soft-agar versus control cells. To explore this phenotypic change, we analysed tumour development after subcutaneous injection of H19-recombined cells into scid mice. Results showed that H19 overexpression promotes tumour progression. These data support the hypothesis that an overload of H19 transcript is associated with cells exhibiting higher tumorigenic phenotypes and therefore we conclude that the H19 gene has oncogenic properties in breast epithelial cells."

Overexpression of PLK1 is observed in the majority of hitherto analysed human tumors. PLK1 overexpression is a negative prognostic factor in patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck tumors, esophageal carcinomas and melanomas. In order to define the role of PLK1 for mitotic progression of human cells and for neoplastic cell growth, phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were tested to selectively downregulate PLK1 expression in MDA-MB-435 (breast cancer), HeLa S3 (cervical carcinoma) and A549 (non-small cell lung cancer) cells. ASOs were identified which suppress PLK1 mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent and sequence-specific manner. This approach also led to reduced PLK1 serine/threonine kinase activity. Downregulation of cellular PLK1 levels in cancer cells altered cell cycle progression moderately with an elevated percentage (20-30%) of cells in G(2)/M. Furthermore, cells with reduced PLK1 protein gained a rounded phenotype with multiple centrosomes. Moreover, ASO treatment resulted in potent antiproliferative effects in cell culture. Considerable antitumor activity was observed in vivo against A549 cells. This study suggests that antisense inhibitors targeted against PLK1 at well tolerated doses may be considered as a cancer therapeutic agent."

Moreover, we have identified another gene in the Drosophila genome encoding a second ADA2 homologue (dADA2b). The two dADA2 homologues, as well as many putative ADA2 homologues from different species, all contain, in addition to the ZZ and SANT domains, several evolutionarily conserved domains. The dada2a/rpb4 and dada2b genes are differentially expressed at various stages of Drosophila development. Both dADA2a and dADA2b interacted with the GCN5 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and dADA2b, but not dADA2a, also interacted with Drosophila ADA3. Both dADA2s further potentiate transcriptional activation in insect and mammalian cells. Antibodies raised either against dADA2a or dADA2b both immunoprecipitated GCN5 as well as several Drosophila TATA binding protein-associated factors (TAFs). Moreover, following glycerol gradient sedimentation or chromatographic purification combined with gel filtration of Drosophila nuclear extracts, dADA2a and dGCN5 were detected in fractions with an apparent molecular mass of about 0.8 MDa whereas dADA2b was found in fractions corresponding to masses of at least 2 MDa, together with GCN5 and several Drosophila TAFs. Furthermore, in vivo the two dADA2 proteins showed different localizations on polytene X chromosomes. These results, taken together, suggest that the two Drosophila ADA2 homologues are present in distinct GCN5-containing HAT complexes."

Our experiments demonstrate that curcumin's antiproliferative effects are estrogen dependent in ER (estrogen receptor)-positive MCF-7 cells, being more pronounced in estrogen-containing media and in the presence of exogenous 17-beta estradiol. Curcumin inhibits the expression of ER downstream genes including pS2 and TGF-beta (transforming growth factor) in ER-positive MCF-7 cells, and this inhibition is also dependent on the presence of estrogen. Curcumin also decreases ERE (estrogen responsive element)-CAT activities induced by 17-beta estradiol. In addition, we demonstrate that curcumin exerts strong anti-invasive effects in vitro that are not estrogen dependent in the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. These anti-invasive effects appear to be mediated through the downregulation of MMP-2 (matrix metalloproteinase) and the upregulation of TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase), 2 common effector molecules that have been implicated in regulating tumor cell invasion. Our study also demonstrates that curcumin inhibits the transcript levels of 2 major angiogenesis factors VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and b-FGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) mainly in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells."

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of alpha 2,6-sialylation on the adhesion properties of breast carcinoma cells. To this end mammary carcinoma cells, MDA-MB-435, were sense-transfected with sialyltransferase ST6Gal-I cDNA or antisense-transfected with a part of the ST6Gal-I sequence. Sense transfectants showed an enhanced ST6Gal-I mRNA expression and enzyme activity and an increased binding of the lectin Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), specific for alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid. Transfection with ST6Gal-I in the antisense direction resulted in less enzyme activity and SNA reactivity. A sense-transfected clone carrying increased amounts of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid adhered preferentially to collagen IV and showed reduced cell-cell adhesion and enhanced invasion capacity. In contrast, antisense transfection led to less collagen IV adhesion but enhanced homotypic cell-cell adhesion. In another approach, inhibition of ST6Gal-I enzyme activity by application of soluble antisense-oligodeoxynucleotides was studied. Antisense treatment resulted in reduced ST6 mRNA expression and cell surface 2,6-sialylation and significantly decreased collagen IV adhesion. Our results suggest that cell surface alpha 2,6-sialylation contributes to cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion of tumor cells. Inhibition of sialytransferase ST6Gal-I by antisense-oligodeoxynucleotides might be a way to reduce the metastatic capacity of carcinoma cells."

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1) is a central component of this pathway. We found in human MDA-468 breast cancer cells that EGF up-regulates p21(WAF1) mRNA and protein, through a combination of increased mRNA stability and transcription. The decay rate of a hybrid luciferase reporter full-length p21(WAF1) 3'-untranslated region (UTR) mRNA was significantly faster than that of a control mRNA. Transfections with a variety of p21(WAF1) 3'-UTR constructs identified multiple cis-acting elements capable of reducing basal reporter activity. Short wavelength ultraviolet light induced reporter activity in constructs containing the 5' region of the p21(WAF1) 3'-UTR, whereas EGF induced reporter activity in constructs containing sequences 3' of the UVC-responsive region. These cis-elements bound multiple proteins from MDA-468 cells, including HuR and poly(C)-binding protein 1 (CP1). Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that HuR and CP1 associate with p21(WAF1) mRNA in MDA-468 cells. Over- and underexpression of HuR in MDA-468 cells did not affect EGF-induced p21(WAF1) protein expression or growth inhibition. However, binding of HuR to its target 3'-UTR cis-element was regulated by UVC but not by EGF, suggesting that these stimuli modulate the stability of p21(WAF1) mRNA via different mechanisms. We conclude that EGF-induced p21(WAF1) protein expression is mediated largely by stabilization of p21(WAF1) mRNA elicited via multiple 3'-UTR cis-elements. Although HuR binds at least one of these elements, it does not appear to be a major modulator of p21(WAF1) expression or growth inhibition in this system. CP1 is a novel p21(WAF1) mRNA-binding protein that may function cooperatively with other mRNA-binding proteins to regulate p21(WAF1) mRNA stability."

LOX inhibitor treatment also reduced the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and increased the levels of the pro-apoptotic protein bax.

In humans, infections with Salmonella resistant to ESCs threaten the efficacy of ceftriaxone, the drug of choice for treating salmonellosis in children. To determine the occurrence of resistance to ESCs, we examined 8426 strains isolated from food-producing animals in Canada in 1994-99 for reduced susceptibility or resistance to ceftriaxone. Of the 8 such strains identified (7 from turkeys and 1 from cattle), 5 had reduced susceptibility, and 3 were resistant; 2 were isolated in 1995, 1 was isolated in each of 1996 and 1997, and 4 were isolated in 1999. Isoelectric focusing showed that all 8 isolates produced a beta-lactamase with a pI &gt; or = 9. The strains were resistant to cefoxitin and not inhibited by clavulanic acid. Primers specific for the Citrobacter freundii blaAmpC gene produced the expected product in the polymerase chain reaction. DNA sequencing showed that all isolates possessed the blaCMY-2 gene. Plasmid DNA from all 8 isolates transformed Escherichia coli DH10B, whereas only 1 isolate transferred blaCMY-2 conjugally. All transformants and the transconjugant were resistant to ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftiofur, cephalothin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Southern blots of plasmids from the isolates, the transformants, and the transconjugant showed that blaCMY-2 was located on similar-sized plasmids (60 or 90 MDa) in the transformants and the transconjugant. In the S. Typhimurium DT104 and S. Ohio isolates, the floSt gene was found on the same plasmid. Class 1 integrons with the aadB gene cassette were detected in the S. Bredeney isolates but not in their transformants or the transconjugant.

To understand the gene regulation of human IL-19, we identified a human IL-19 genomic clone and analyzed its promoter region. Five fusion genes containing different regions upstream of exon 1 linked to a luciferase reporter gene were expressed in the canine kidney epithelial-like Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. A fusion gene containing 394 bp showed luciferase activity 7- to 8-fold higher than the negative control of the promoterless fusion gene. We also isolated a full-length mouse cDNA clone. Mouse IL-19 shared 71% amino acid identity with human IL-19. Treatment of monocytes with mouse IL-19 induced the production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha.

Herein we describe the development of a novel stable cell line, MDA-kb2, for screening of androgen agonist and antagonists and to characterize its specificity and sensitivity to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453, was stably transformed with the MMTV.luciferase.neo reporter gene construct. Since both GR and AR are present in the MDA-MB-453 cells, and both receptors can act through the MMTV promoter, compounds that act through either AR or GR activate the MMTV luciferase reporter. As expected, AR agonists such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and GR agonists such as dexamethasone (DEX), corticosterone, and aldosterone induce luciferase expression at appropriate concentrations. DHT consistently produced 3-9-fold induction at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 nM. At 1 to 1000 nM, DEX induced luciferase activity 1.3-19.5-fold. To distinguish AR- from GR-mediated ligands, chemicals were assayed concurrently with the antiandrogen, hydroxyflutamide (OHF), which blocks AR- but not GR-mediated responses. In addition, known AR antagonists, including hydroxyflutamide, vinclozolin, vinclozolin metabolites M1 and M2, p,p'-DDE, and linuron inhibited DHT-induced luciferase gene expression at appropriate concentrations in this system. We have found that these cells are relatively easy to culture and maintain. Responsiveness was monitored over time and was stable for more than 80 passages. Some advantages of this assay are that it is relatively rapid (2 days), eliminates the need for transfection, can be conducted in a 96-well plate format, and produces consistent reproducible results. In summary, we have developed a cell line that can be used to screen chemicals, not just for AR- but for GR-mediated activities as well."

We developed a universally applicable polymerase chain reaction method for the detection of a human-specific 850-bp fragment of the alpha-satellite DNA on human chromosome 17. The method allows the detection of one human cell in 10(6) murine cells and could be established as both, a conventional DNA polymerase chain reaction-assay for routine screening, and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-assay using TaqMan-methodology. It was applied to the following xenotransplantation systems in SCID and NOD/SCID mice: (1) In a limiting dilution assay, cells of the MDA-MB 435 breast carcinoma were injected into the mammary fat pad of NOD/SCID mice. It could be shown that 10 cells mouse(-1) were sufficient to induce a positive polymerase chain reaction signal in liver and lung tissue 30 days after transplantation as an indicator for micrometastasis. At this time a palpable tumour was not yet detectable in the mammary fat pad region. (2) Cells of a newly established human acute lymphatic leukaemia were administered intraperitoneally to SCID mice. These cells apparently disseminated and were detectable as early as day 50 in the peripheral blood of living mice, while the leukaemia manifestation was delayed by day 140. (3) In a transplantation experiment using mature human lymphocytes we wanted to standardise conditions for a successful survival of these cells in NOD/SCID mice. It was established that at least 5 x 10(7) cells given intravenously were necessary and that the mice had to be conditioned by 2 Gy body irradiation to get positive polymerase chain reaction bands in several organs. (4) Engraftment studies with blood stem cells originating from cytapheresis samples of tumour patients or from cord blood were undertaken in NOD/SCID mice in order to define conditions of successful engraftment and to use this model for further optimisation strategies. The polymerase chain reaction method presented allowed a reliable prediction of positive engraftment and agreed well with the results of immunohistochemical or FACS analysis. All together, the polymerase chain reaction method developed allows a sensitive and reliable detection of low numbers of human cells in immunodeficient hosts. In combination with real-time (TaqMan) technique it allows an exact quantification of human cells. As this method can be performed with accessible material of living animals, follow up studies for the monitoring of therapeutic interventions are possible in which the survival time of mice as evaluation criteria can be omitted."

(2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 47901-47905). Currently, it is not clear what upstream and downstream signaling molecules of p38 MAPK mediate alphav integrin-mediated uPA up-regulation. In the present study, we found that alphav integrin ligation activated small GTPase Rac1 preferentially, and dominant negative Rac1 inhibited alphav integrin-mediated p38 MAPK activation. Using constitutively active MAPK kinases, we found that both constitutively active MKK3 and MKK6 mutants were able to activate p38 MAPK and up-regulate uPA expression, but only dominant negative MKK3 blocked alphav integrin-mediated p38 MAPK activation and uPA up-regulation. These results suggest that MKK3, rather than MKK6, mediates alphav integrin-induced p38 MAPK activation. Among the potential downstream effectors of p38 MAPK, we found that only MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 affects alphav integrin-mediated uPA up-regulation significantly. Finally, using beta-globin reporter gene constructs containing uPA mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR) and adenosine/uridine-rich elements-deleted 3'-UTR, we demonstrated that p38 MAPK/MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 signaling pathway regulated uPA mRNA stability through a mechanism involving the adenosine/uridine-rich elements sequence in 3'-UTR of uPA mRNA."

We also showed that the DNAzyme induces apoptosis and markedly inhibits endothelial cell growth compared with a disabled DNAzyme and untreated controls. In contrast, the DNAzyme did not inhibit the growth of MDA-MB-435 cells in vitro. The DNAzyme in complex with a nonviral carrier also significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo. After the fourth injection, there was nearly a 75% reduction of tumor size in the DNAzyme-treated group compared with the saline-injected control group (P = 0.024). Marked cell death in the peripheral regions of the tumor accompanied by a reduction in blood vessel density is consistent with the antiangiogenic mechanism of the DNAzyme.

All of the strains contained a middle-range plasmid (35 to 62 MDa) as well as a number of stable small plasmids, yielding mainly two plasmid profiles which were different from those of 4a and 4b strains. Conjugation and curing experiments suggested that the middle-range plasmids harbored a self-transferable multiple antibiotic resistance marker. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of all of the tested strains yielded two types with numerous subtypes, whereas ribotyping yielded only two types which were completely different from those of types 4a and 4b.

Expression analysis showed that the expression level of syntenin was well correlated with invasive and metastatic potential in various human breast and gastric cancer cell lines. Moreover, gastric tumor tissues exhibited a much higher syntenin mRNA expression than their normal counterparts. Syntenin-transfected MCF7 cells migrated more actively, and showed an increased invasion rate relative to vector-transfectants or parental MCF7 in vitro, without evidencing any effect on the adhesion to fibronectin, type I collagen and laminin. Similarly, the forced expression of syntenin to human gastric cancer cell line Az521 increased its migratory and invasive potential in vitro. Syntenin-expressing MCF7 cells were associated with the appearance of numerous cell surface extensions and with pseudopodia formation on collagen I, suggesting that syntenin may be involved in the signaling cascade to actin-reorganization. Mutation study suggested that PDZ2 domain of syntenin could be an essential role in its stimulatory effect on the cell migration. This is the first demonstration that syntenin, a PDZ motif-containing protein, can be overexpressed during the metastatic progression of human breast and gastric cancer cells and that it can function as a metastasis-inducing gene."

High density and prevalent core 2-based glycosylation.";"Knowledge about the O-linked glycan chains of tumor-associated MUC1 is primarily based on enzymatic and immunochemical evidence. To obtain structural information and to overcome limitations by the scarcity of endogenous mucin, we expressed a recombinant glycosylation probe corresponding to six MUC1 tandem repeats in four breast cancer cell lines. Comparative analyses of the O-glycan profiles were performed after hydrazinolysis and normal phase chromatography of 2-aminobenzamide-labeled glycans. Except for a general reduction in the O-glycan chain lengths and a high density glycosylation, no common structural pattern was revealed. T47D fusion protein exhibits an almost complete shift from core 2 to core 1 expression with a preponderance of sialylated glycans. By contrast, MCF-7, MDA-MB231, and ZR75-1 cells glycosylate the MUC1 repeat peptide preferentially with core 2-based glycans terminating mostly with alpha 3-linked sialic acid (MDA-MB231, ZR75-1) or alpha 2/3-linked fucose (MCF-7). Endogenous MUC1 from T47D and MCF-7 cell supernatants revealed almost identical O-glycosylation profiles compared with the respective recombinant probes, indicating that the fusion proteins reflected the authentic O-glycan profiles of the cells. The structural patterns in the majority of cells under study are in conflict with biosynthetic models of MUC1 O-glycosylation in breast cancer, which claim that the truncation of normal core 2-based polylactosamine structures to short sialylated core 1-based glycans is due to the reduced activity of core 2-forming beta 6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases and/or to overexpression of competitive alpha 3- sialyltransferase."

PAI-1 is linked to several processes in the metastatic cascade. However, the role of PAI-1 in metastatic processes, which may be independent of protease inhibitory activity, is not fully understood. We report herein that PAI-1, when added exogenously to or stably transfected in human MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells, had disparate effects on adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and motility in vitro. Specifically, exogenously added PAI-1 inhibited cell adhesion to vitronectin but not fibronectin, in agreement with the literature. By contrast, stably transfected PAI-1 stimulated adhesion to both proteins. Wild-type PAI-1 was required for this stimulation, because expression of a non-protease inhibitory P14 (T333R) PAI-1 mutant failed to enhance adhesion. Compared with non-inhibitory PAI-1, wild-type PAI-1 also increased cell motility in chemotaxic assays. Furthermore, stable transfection of a related serine protease inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-3 (PAI-3, or protein C inhibitor) gave results similar to wild-type PAI-1. The stimulatory activity of PAI-3 was not seen with a non-protease inhibitory P14 PAI-3 mutant (T341R). We show that a downstream effect of endogenous wild-type PAI-1 and PAI-3 overexpression, but not their non-inhibitory counterparts, was the altered expression of alpha(2), alpha(3), alpha(4), alpha(5), and beta(1) integrin subunits. Additionally, blocking antibodies to beta(1) integrin inhibited PAI-1-induced adhesion. Our data provide experimental support for the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of PAI-1 in metastasis and introduce PAI-3 as another serpin potentially important in malignant disease."

Effect on the urokinase-type plasminogen activator gene production and tumor invasion.";"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is a member of the serine protease family and can break down various components of the extracellular matrix to promote growth, invasion, and metastasis of several malignancies including breast cancer. In the current study we examined the role that the DNA methylation machinery might be playing in regulating differential uPA gene expression in breast cancer cell lines. uPA mRNA is expressed in the highly invasive, hormone-insensitive human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 but not in hormone-responsive cell line MCF-7. Using methylation-sensitive PCR, we show that 90% of CpG dinucleotides in the uPA promoter are methylated in MCF-7 cells, whereas fully demethylated CpGs were detected in MDA-MB-231 cells. uPA promoter activity, which is directly regulated by the Ets-1 transcription factor, is inhibited by methylation as determined by uPA promoter-luciferase reporter assays. We then tested whether the state of expression and methylation of the uPA promoter correlates with the global level of DNA methyltransferase and demethylase activities in these cell lines. We show that maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity is significantly higher in MCF-7 cells than in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas demethylase activity is higher in MDA-MB-231 cells. We suggest that the combination of increased DNA methyltransferase activity with reduced demethylase activity contributes to the methylation and silencing of uPA expression in MCF-7 cells. The converse is true in MDA-MB-231 cells, which represents a late stage highly invasive breast cancer. The histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A, induces the expression of the uPA gene in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in MCF-7 cells. This supports the hypothesis that DNA methylation is the dominant mechanism involved in the silencing of uPA gene expression. Taken together, these results provide insight into the mechanism regulating the transcription of the uPA gene in the complex multistep process of breast cancer progression."

We have developed an in vitro system in which some SERMs (4-hydroxytamoxifen and resveratrol) demonstrate estrogenic response through wild-type (wt) ER, whereas others (raloxifene and GW7604) remain antiestrogenic. This system mimics the tamoxifen-resistant phenotype in clinic, when resistant tumors contain wtER. We used Atlas cDNA arrays to study gene expression profiles after ER activation by different SERMs in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells stably transfected with wtER. Cells were treated with estradiol, four different SERMs, and the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780. The obtained expression data were analyzed using GeneSpring software. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was used to verify the array data. Our results showed that treatment with various compounds altered the expression of a diverse group of genes, revealing sets of overlapping genes that may represent a complex network of genes of interrelated signal transduction pathways. Sets of &quot;agonistic&quot; and &quot;antagonistic&quot; genes were identified on the basis of the known response to different SERMs. Further analysis of selected sets of genes revealed functionally related group of genes in each set, encoding proteins that were related to cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. Flow cytometry data indicated an antiapoptotic activity in cells treated with agonists versus apoptotic activity in cells treated with antagonists. A model for estradiol-like (survival) and antiestrogen-like (apoptosis) activities of SERMs on the basis of their gene expression profiles is suggested."

The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) system is responsible for invasion through uPA enzymatic activity and for migration through the binding of uPA to the uPA receptor (uPAR). Constitutively high levels of uPA are characteristic of the highly metastatic breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, but the mechanisms underlying constitutive uPA expression are not fully characterized. In this report we show that inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) represses constitutive (nonstimulated) migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis I) inhibits cell migration and constitutive activation of transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB, suggesting that PKC is responsible for increased migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. It is clear that the inhibition of PKC occurs at the transactivation levels of AP-1 and NF-kappaB because Bis I did not affect constitutive DNA binding of AP-1 and NF-kappaB. Furthermore, we show that Bis I did not affect the levels of IkappaBalpha, suggesting that PKC-mediated cell migration is IkappaBalpha independent. Finally, we demonstrate that constitutive secretion of uPA is repressed by Bis I, implying an important role for AP-1 and NF-kappaB in cell migration. Our data demonstrate a connection among PKC, constitutively active AP-1 and NF-kappaB, constitutive secretion of uPA, and cell migration of highly invasive breast cancer cells. Thus, PKC controls cell motility by regulating expression of uPA through the activation of AP-1 and NF-kappaB. The disruption of PKC, AP- 1, and NF-kappaB signaling in breast cancer may be used to develop therapies for breast cancer prevention and intervention by reducing the secretion of uPA."

Enforced reexpression of prostasin in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435s reduced the in vitro invasiveness of either cell line by 50%. Examination of the prostasin gene promoter and first exon revealed a GC-enriched region that contains transcription regulatory elements. The promoter and exon 1 region of the prostasin gene was investigated for DNA methylation in NHMEC and the carcinoma cell lines. The results revealed a methylation pattern that correlates with prostasin expression in these cells. Demethylation coupled with histone deacetylase inhibition resulted in reactivated expression of the prostasin mRNA in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435s cells. These results suggest that prostasin expression in breast cancer cells may be regulated by DNA methylation and that an absence of prostasin expression may contribute to breast cancer invasiveness and metastatic potential."

A total of 1162 loci met the criteria of ECISTs from an initial screening of 7776 CpG island tags. This ECIST panel was used to analyze the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, which was treated with a demethylating agent. Microarray profile analysis identified 30 methylation-silenced genes, the expression of which could be directly reactivated by demethylation. An additional group of 96 up-regulated genes was also identified but appeared to be downstream from this epigenetic cascade. Thus, this study shows that the ECIST microarray can be used to differentiate the primary and secondary causes of demethylation and provides an effective tool to elucidate the mechanisms of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer."

Compared with control cells, cells that produced increased amounts of TGF-beta proliferated in vitro more slowly. In vivo, however, tumors derived from these cells exhibited increased proliferation and grew at an accelerated pace. To evaluate the role of autocrine TGF-beta signaling, cells were also transfected with a dominant-negative truncated type II TGF-beta receptor (TbetaRII). Disruption of autocrine TGF-beta signaling in the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells reduced their in vivo growth rate. Co-inoculation of Matrigel with the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells expressing the truncated TbetaRII compensated for their diminished in vivo growth capacity, compared with the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells with an intact autocrine loop. Tissue invasion by the tumor was a distinctive feature of the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells, whether or not the autocrine loop was intact. Furthermore, tumors derived from TGF-beta-overexpressing cells, irrespective of the status of the autocrine TGF-beta-signaling pathway, had a higher incidence of lung metastasis. Consistent with the suggestion that TGF-beta's enhancement of invasion and metastasis is paracrine-based, we observed no significant differences among the cell clones in an in vitro invasion assay. Thus, in this experimental model system in vitro assays of cell proliferation and invasion do not accurately reflect in vivo observations, perhaps due to autocrine and paracrine effects of TGF-beta that influence the important in vivo-based phenomena of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis."

Screening of a murine cDNA library led to the identification of a 1.4 kb cDNA with a sequence revealing 85% homology to human BRMS1 within the open reading frame. The predicted protein sequence for the murine ortholog is 95% identical, suggesting that it is strongly conserved across these 2 species. The cloned cDNA was used to screen a murine strain SV129 BAC library to obtain brms1 genomic DNA. Three BAC clones [226(I4), 226(H4) and 239(N7)] were confirmed to encode the entire brms1 gene. Detailed analysis of BAC clone 226(I4) shows that the gene spans 8.5 kb and, like the human gene, is organized into 10 exons and 9 introns. While the exons share a high degree of homology, there are greater differences when comparing intron structures between the human and murine genes. The 5' upstream region shares about 64% homology with its human counterpart, retaining several of the many putative regulatory elements. Like the human genomic BRMS1, the murine ortholog of the iGnT gene is found upstream of brms1 and the murine ortholog of the RIN1 gene is found downstream of brms1. brms1 was then tested for suppression of metastasis of mouse mammary carcinoma cell line 66cl4 in syngeneic BALB/c mice. Transfection with brms1 did not inhibit 66cl4 primary tumor formation but significantly suppressed its metastatic capability. This suggests that the murine ortholog functions similarly to BRMS1."

MC/SD calculations were performed on wild-type (WT) CB(1) and two mutants, Y5.39(275)F and Y5.39(275)I.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies of tyrosine 5.39 to phenylalanine (Y--&gt;F) or isoleucine (Y--&gt;I) in both CB(1) and CB(2) were performed to determine the functional role of this amino acid in each receptor subtype.

It is 300 to 500 nm long and has a rigid, rod-like structure protruding from the cell surface. MUC1 expressed by normal cells has heavily O-glycosylated tandem repeat domain while MUC1 on malignant cells is aberrantly O-glycosylated. Substantially reduced (aberrant) glycosylation of the tandem repeat region of tumor MUC1 results in uncovering of the polypeptide core. This new structural feature may play an important role in the attachment of metastasizing tumor cells to tissues at distant sites. We show that MDA-MB-231 cells attaching to the immobilized extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) are higher MUC1 expressers than those non-attaching and that the attachment is inhibited by the addition of non-glycosylated, MUC1 peptide. This 100 a.a. peptide composed of 5 tandem repeats from the tandem repeat domain mimics the forms of MUC1 found in ascites fluid of cancer patients. We also show that this synthetic form of MUC1 inhibited attachment of breast tumor cells to sections of normal human lung tissue and immobilized ECM. We did not find correlation between the expression of Tn (GalNAc-Ser/Thr) epitope and the ability of tumor cells to adhere to the immobilized ECM. These results indicate that the non-glycosylated form of MUC1 plays a role in the initial attachment of carcinoma cells to tissues at distant sites, which may facilitate establishment of metastatic foci."

Differential screening of the library isolated 28 genes which by Northern analysis were highly expressed in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 compared to the normal breast cell line MCF12A. Sequence analysis revealed that 15 clones coded for previously described genes such as SNAP43, Cyr61, Thymosin beta4, tra1, elongation factor 1alpha, BSF-2/IL6, BiP, and GDP/GTP exchange protein. The remaining 13 clones did not match sequences in GenBank/EMBL database, indicating that they may be novel genes. SNAP43, a subunit of the TBP-TAF complex, was expressed 20-fold higher in MDA-MB-231 compared to MCF12A and several breast cancer cell lines, implying that SNAP43 may be involved in tumorigenesis of a specific subset of breast cancers. Amplification of SNAP43 was not found by Southern analysis. However, genetic alterations of MDA-MB-231 included a deletion of chromosome 14 with a reciprocal translocation t(6;14) and two additional translocations [t(12;14) and t(14;15)] as determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with YAC 823G8 located at chromosome 14q23 which contained SNAP43. Because of the numerous alterations observed by FISH in MDA-MB-231, we further explored the genetic abnormalities in this breast cancer cell line using multiplex FISH (M-FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).

In this study, we used a panel of 36 human cancer cell lines, flow cytometry and oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze further these two compounds in a parallel fashion with regard to both antitumor activity (phenotype) and gene expression (genotype) bases.RESULTS: The cancer panel experiment established that activity patterns of Et 743 and Pt 650 were essentially the same with their IC(50) values ranging from pM to low nM. By means of flow cytometric cell cycle analysis using HCT116 cells, they were shown to disrupt S phase progression after a 12-h treatment at 2.0 nM, eventually resulting in the late S and G2/M accumulation at the 24-h time point. Array-based gene expression monitoring also demonstrated that the Et 743 and Pt 650 profiles were highly similar in two distinct cancer cell lines, HCT116 colon and MDA-MB-435 breast. Characteristic changes were observed in subsets of genes involved in DNA damage response, transcription and signal transduction. In HCT116 carrying the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor gene, the up-regulation of several p53-responsive genes was evident. Furthermore, a subset of genes encoding DNA-binding proteins to specific promoter regions (e.g. the CCAAT box) was down-regulated in both cell lines, suggesting one potential mode of action of this series of antitumor agents.CONCLUSION: A combination of gene expression analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays and flow cytometry confirms an earlier finding that Et 743 and Pt 650 have remarkably similar biological activities."

With development of a genomically integrated, ErbB2 promoter-reporting breast cancer cell screen, ErbB2 promoter inhibiting activity was observed by the HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate. Paradoxically, these agents stimulated the episomal form of this ErbB2 promoter-reporter introduced by transient transfection. Transcriptional run-off assays in ErbB2 amplified and overexpressing breast cancer cells confirmed that within 5 h, TSA exposure profoundly inhibits ErbB2 transcript synthesis from the amplified oncogene yet preserves transcription from single copy genes such as the epithelial-specific Ets family member, ESX. Northern analyses of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer lines (SKBR3, BT-474, and MDA-453) showed that within 24 h of submicromolar treatment by TSA, ESX transcript levels increase while ErbB2 transcript levels rapidly decline, with no TSA effect apparent on the open chromatin configuration of either gene as monitored by DNase I hypersensitivity. Actinomycin D studies confirmed that in addition to inhibiting ErbB2 transcript synthesis, TSA selectively destabilizes mature ErbB2 transcripts enhancing their decay. Whereas TSA markedly reduced ErbB2 protein levels in these overexpressing cell lines, TSA treatment of MCF/HER2-18 cells engineered to overexpress the ErbB2 receptor under control of a heterologous promoter increased their expression of ErbB2 protein. These findings suggest that further studies are warranted to determine whether ErbB2-positive human cancers represent unusually sensitive clinical targets for HDAC inhibitor therapy."

MCF7 cells were treated with oligonucleotide 4625, doxorubicin, paclitaxel or cyclophosphamide alone, or with combinations of oligonucleotide and the anti-cancer drugs. As measured in cell viability assays, treatment with the various combinations reduced the number of viable MCF7 cells more effectively than treatment with the single drugs alone. Treatment with a sequence control oligonucleotide did not affect cell viability. All combination treatments induced apoptosis as demonstrated by the appearance of massive nuclear condensation in a high proportion of the cells. To further characterize the interaction between 4625 and doxorubicin, paclitaxel or cyclophosphamide, the median-effect method was used. In MCF7 cells all combinations resulted in potent synergistic effects over a broad range of toxicity with combination indices ranging from 0.8 to 0.1.

Connexin 26 (Cx26) is a structural component of gap junctions expressed by breast epithelial cells. Expression levels of Cx26 are reduced in many breast tumors. Methylation-sensitive single-stranded conformation analysis showed variable methylation in the promoter region CpG island in 11 out of 20 (55%) breast cancer patients. Heterogeneity in methylation patterns was observed both between and within tumors. The degree of methylation ranged from a few CpG dinucleotides to almost all the CpG dinucleotides in the analyzed region. The most frequently methylated CpG was in an Sp1 site known to be important for Cx26 gene expression. One of eight breast cancer cell lines (MD-MBA-453) was methylated in the promoter region and did not express Cx26. Treatment of MDA-MB-453 with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in the re-expression of Cx26 mRNA. Methylation of the promoter region is likely to be an important mechanism in modulating the expression of Cx26 in breast cancer."

The extracellular portion of the mature transmembrane protein consists of five homologous domains. The four sequences linking these domains contain the structural amino acid motif DXXD that is thought to be involved in direct calcium binding. In gastric cancer patients mutations affecting this motif between the second and third domain are frequently seen. In order to determine the functional significance of similar sequence alterations with regard to their location, we analyzed single amino acid substitutions changing the DXXD motif to DXXA in each linker region according to a mutation found in gastric cancer (D370A). The cDNA sequences coding for DQND, DVLD and DVND were changed (D257A, D479A, D590A, respectively) and stably expressed in E-cadherin negative MDA-MB-435S mammary carcinoma cells. We found that the D257A and D370A mutations result in abnormal protein localization, changes in the actin cytoskeleton, markedly reduced homophilic cell adhesion, and altered cell morphology. Unexpectedly, the tumor-associated D370A mutation but not the D257A mutation induced increased cell motility. The D479A mutation only had slight functional consequences whereas cells expressing the D590A mutant did not differ from cells expressing the wild-type molecule. Although the putative calcium binding motif DXXD is located at repetitive positions in the extracellular portion of E-cadherin, our results indicate that it has different functions depending on the location. Remarkably, tumor cells select for mutations in the most critical domains resulting both in loss of function (decreased cell adhesion) and in gain of function (increased cell motility). Since multiple DXXD motifs are typically seen in other cadherins, our structure-function study is relevant for this gene family in general."

Transfection and DNA-protein binding experiments using high levels of either oestrogen receptor (ER)alpha or ERbeta imply a direct interaction of these transcription factors with the multiple hormone response element (HRE) at approximately -160 from the transcription start site of the OT gene in most species. In an extensive set of experiments, we show, using both transfection and protein-DNA binding, that low to moderate amounts of either oestrogen receptor, while being able to interact directly with a classic oestrogen response element (ERE) fail to interact with the human OT -160 HRE. Instead, this element, similar to its bovine counterpart, has a high affinity for the orphan receptors steroidogenic factor 1 and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor. Second, the human and bovine OT promoter can be made artificially responsive towards oestrogen in a cotransfection system over-expressing ERalpha or ERbeta, but not in cells expressing natural levels of these steroid receptors. Interestingly, nuclear extracts from both ERalpha-positive MCF7 cells and ERalpha-negative MDA-MB231 cells both contain a transcription factor which binds specifically to both the hOT-HRE element and to a classic ERE, and which has orphan receptor-like binding properties rather than those of an oestrogen receptor. Together, these and other results suggest that oestrogen action in vivo on the OT gene in all species is more likely to involve a DNA-independent mechanism than classic direct interactions with dimeric oestrogen receptors."

It is speculated that some POCs that can interfere with estrogen receptor-mediated responses are involved in the initiation and progression of human breast cancer. The tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 plays a role in cell-cycle control, in DNA repair, and in genomic stability, and it is often downregulated in sporadic mammary cancers. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether POCs have the potential to alter the expression of BRCA1.METHODS: Using human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, the effect on BRCA1 expression of chemicals belonging to different classes of organochlorine chemicals (the pesticide toxaphene, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and three polychlorinated biphenyls [PCB#138, PCB#153 and PCB#180]) was measured by a reporter gene construct carrying 267 bp of the BRCA1 promoter. A twofold concentration range was analyzed in MCF-7, and the results were supported by northern blot analysis of BRCA1 mRNA using the highest concentrations of the chemicals.RESULTS: All three polychlorinated biphenyls and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin reduced 17beta-estradiol (E2)-induced expression as well as basal reporter gene expression in both cell lines, whereas northern blot analysis only revealed a downregulation of E2-induced BRCA1 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells. Toxaphene, like E2, induced BRCA1 expression in MCF-7.CONCLUSION: The present study shows that some POCs have the capability to alter the expression of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 without affecting the cell-cycle control protein p21Waf/Cip1. Some POCs therefore have the potential to affect breast cancer risk."

Recently, it has been reported that homozygosity for a valine to alanine substitution in the mitochondrial targeting sequence of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) represents a risk factor for severe ALD. Because this mutation is postulated to modify enzyme transport into mitochondria, we have sought confirmatory evidence of this association in a larger group of patients and investigated whether this polymorphism might influence alcohol-induced oxidative stress. Genotyping for the valine-alanine (Val-Ala) polymorphism of the Mn-SOD gene in 281 patients with advanced ALD (cirrhosis/fibrosis) and 218 drinkers without liver disease showed no differences in either the heterozygote (55% vs. 50%) or the homozygote (19% vs. 23%) frequency for the alanine allele. By measuring the titers of circulating antibodies against oxidized cardiolipin (OX-CL) and malondialdehyde (MDA) or hydroxy-ethyl radical (HER) adducts as markers of oxidative stress, we found a significant increase in ALD patients compared with healthy controls. However, the carriers of the alanine Mn-SOD allele had titers of anti-MDA, anti-HER, and anti-OX-CL IgG comparable with heterozygotes and patients homozygous for the valine allele. Similarly, the frequency of subjects with antibody titers above the 95th percentile of controls was not increased among homozygotes for the alanine Mn-SOD allele. In conclusion, in our population Val-Ala polymorphism in Mn-SOD influences neither susceptibility to alcohol-induced liver fibrosis nor alcohol-induced oxidative stress."

The mdm2 gene is transcribed into two different mRNAs, namely L-mdm2 and S-mdm2, which are generated from promoters P1 (constitutive) and P2 (regulated by tumor suppressor p53), respectively. To cast light on the mechanisms of MDM2 overexpression, we measured the expression levels of these mdm2 mRNAs using RT-PCR analysis in three human breast cancer cell lines and 15 breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. ER(alpha)-positive MCF-7 cells, which possess wild-type p53, displayed dominant expression of S-mdm2. In contrast, two other cell lines with mutant p53, T47-D (ER(alpha)-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (ER(alpha)-negative), showed almost equivalent expression of L-mdm2 and S-mdm2. Treatment of 17beta-estradiol (E2) significantly enhanced the expression of S-mdm2 but not that of L-mdm2 in MCF-7. Among 6 breast cancer samples regarded as ER(alpha)-positive with wild-type p53, 5 samples showed increased expression of S-mdm2. Expression of S-mdm2 was stimulated in 2 ER(alpha)-positive samples with mutant p53. In contrast, 4 of 5 samples which express mutant p53 without ER(alpha) showed poor expression of S-mdm2. There is a tendency that ER(alpha)-positive breast cancers with wild-type p53 preferably use P2 promoter for the expression of mdm2, possibly through E2-induced accumulation of p53. However, wild-type p53 and ER(alpha) are not necessarily enough for the utilization of S-mdm2. Tumors with mutant p53 also showed expression of S-mdm2 in some cases. These results strongly suggest that other factor(s) is also implicated in the promoter usage of mdm2 gene in human breast cancer tissues."

In this work we report the characterisation and genetic organisation of this plasmid. Analysis of the gene content of what appears to be a typical broad host range conjugative plasmid, its presence in non-BPF strains as revealed by Southern hybridisation, and the recent discovery of plasmid-lacking BPF strains, has led us to conclude that it is unlikely to play a critical role in bacterial virulence. Establishing its entire sequence has nonetheless been an important step on the road to delineating, by comparison of BPF and non-BPF strains, chromosomal genetic loci that are involved in the special virulence of the BPF clone."

A DD-PCR protocol was then used to amplify expressed products, which were resolved using PAGE and used as probe to hybridize with representative human arrays and cDNA libraries. The probe derived from the tumor-stroma comparison was hybridized with a gene array and an arrayed cDNA library derived from a GCT of bone; 21 known genes or expressed sequence tags were detected, of which 17 showed differential expression. These included factors associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (vimentin), the cargo selection protein (TIP47) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3). Northern blot analysis was used to confirm those genes also expressed by representative breast cancer cell lines. Notably, 6 genes of unknown function were restricted to tumor while the majority of stroma-associated genes were known. When applied to transformed breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-435 and T47D) that are known to have different metastatic potential, DD array analysis revealed a further 20 genes; 17 of these genes showed differential expression. Use of microdissection and the DD-PCR array protocol allowed us to identify factors whose localized expression within the breast may play a role in abnormal breast development or breast carcinogenesis."

The differences between adjacent masses in this data set are greater than 10 mDa for more than 80% of the values. Using this mass list, the majority of low mass ions in quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectra of peptides from tryptic digests and from an elastase digest could be assigned. Besides the a(2)/b(2) ions, which carry residues 1-2 from the N-terminus, a variety of internal dipeptide b ions were regularly observed. In case internal proline was present, corresponding dipeptide b ions carrying proline at the N-terminal position occurred. By assigning the dipeptide b ions on the basis of their accurate mass, bidirectional or unidirectional sequence information was obtained, which is localized to the peptide N-terminus (a(2)/b(2) ions) or not localized (internal b ions). Identification of the y(1) and y(2) ions by their accurate mass provides unidirectional sequence information localized to the peptide C-terminus.

Previous test systems have used cells transfected with plasmid containing a reporter gene. Here we report the use of transduction for gene delivery and assessment of the modulation of DHT-induced gene activation. Transduction, the ability of replication-defective viruses to deliver biologically competent genes, is a well understood biological process, which has been utilized to repair defective genes in humans as well as to express exogenous genes in rodent models. Human breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-453) containing endogenous copies of the androgen (hAR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors were transduced with replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 containing the luciferase (Luc) reporter gene driven by the AR- and GR-responsive glucocorticoid-inducible hormone response element found with the mammary tumor virus LTR (Ad/MLUC7). In a second set of experiments, CV-1 cells were transduced as above with MMTV-luc and also hAR. Cells were subcultured in 96-well plates, transduced with virus, exposed to chemicals, incubated for 48 h, lysed, and assayed for luciferase. Luc gene expression was induced in a dose-dependent manner by DHT, estradiol, and dexamethasone (MDA only) and inhibited by AR antagonist hydroxyflutamide (OHF), hydroxy-DDE, HPTE (2,2-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1, 1-trichloroethane), a methoxychlor metabolite, and M1 and M2 (vinclozolin metabolites). The transduced cells responded to AR agonists and antagonists as predicted from our other studies, with a very robust and reproducible response. Over all replicates, 0.1 nM DHT induced luc expression by about 45-fold in CV-1 cells (intra-assay CV = 20%) and 1micromolar OHF inhibited DHT by about 80%. In the transduced MDA cells, 0.1 nM DHT induced luc by about 24-fold (intra-assay CV = 33%), which was inhibited by OHF by about 85%. DHT-induced luciferase activity peaked in both cell lines between 1 and 100 nM, displaying about 64- and 115-fold maximal induction in the CV-1 and MDA 453 cells, respectively. For agonists, a two-fold induction of luc over media control was statistically significant. For AR antagonists, a 25-30% inhibition of DHT-induced luc expression was typically statistically significant. Comparing the two assays, the transduced CV-1 cells were slightly more sensitive to AR-mediated responses, but the transduced MDA 453 cells were more responsive to GR agonists. In summary, these assays correctly identified the endocrine activity of all chemicals examined and displayed sensitivity with a relatively low variability and a high-fold induction over background. Adenovirus transduction for EDC screening has the potential to be employed in a high-throughput mode, and could easily be applied to other cell lines and utilized to deliver other receptors and reporter genes."

In this study we examined the pattern of cyclin B1 promoter activity in three breast cancer cell lines, BT-549, MDA-MB-157, T-47D, and the immortalized breast cell line MCF-10F. Using cells stably transfected with a cyclin B1 promoter-luciferase reporter, luciferase activity was measured throughout the cell cycle in lovastatin synchronized cells and in G1 and S/G2 phases of asynchronized cells by flow cytometry. Results demonstrate that the cyclin B1 promoter activity increases, as expected, during the S/G2 period in all the cell lines. However, some promoter activity can be detected in G1 phase of the different cell line with BT-549 displaying the more altered pattern. Functional cyclin B1-cdk 1 protein complex was detected in G1 phase of BT-549 and T-47D cell lines.

In this report, a 2.5-kb truncated version of the L-plastin promoter was placed 5' to the E1A gene of a wild-type adenovirus. The vector generated (Ad-Lp-E1A) was directly cytotoxic to established breast and ovarian cancer cell lines and to primary explant cultures derived from ovarian cancer, but was not cytotoxic to explant cultures of normal mammary epithelial cells. This vector was not cytotoxic to cell lines in which the L-plastin E1A transcription unit was not expressed, whereas the same cell lines were sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of a replication-competent adenoviral vector in which the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter drove E1A expression. When the tyrosinase promoter/enhancer was placed 5' to the E1A gene in the adenoviral backbone, the resulting vector (Ad-Tyr-E1A) was selectively toxic to melanoma cells and one percent as toxic to explants of ovarian cancer cells as the Ad-Lp-E1A vector.

In this study, we compared Rb function in two established breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and in an established immortalized mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A. Cells were synchronized in G0/G1 and were released for several durations, at which time total Rb protein, mRNA, and Rb/E2F/DNA complex formation were evaluated. Rb protein was significantly higher in the tumor cells than in MCF10A cells. However, Rb function was high for a longer duration in MCF10A cells as compared with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data support the general conclusion that Rb function, but not necessarily Rb protein, is lower in highly malignant breast adenocarcinoma cells as compared with lower grade tumor cells.

The mode of action of the Escherichia coli homolog DnaK is representative of all HSP70 chaperones, including the endoplasmic reticulum variant BiP/GRP78. DnaK has been shown to be effective in assisting refolding of a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins, including the alpha-helical homodimeric secretory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). We screened solid-phase peptide libraries from human and mouse IFN-gamma to identify DnaK-binding sites. Conserved DnaK-binding sites were identified in the N-terminal half of helix B and in the C-terminal half of helix C, both of which are located at the IFN-gamma dimer interface. Soluble peptides derived from helices B and C bound DnaK with high affinity in competition assays. No DnaK-binding sites were found in the loops connecting the alpha-helices. The helix C DnaK-binding site appears to be conserved in most members of the superfamily of interleukin (IL)-10-related cytokines that comprises, apart from IL-10 and IFN-gamma, a series of recently discovered small secretory proteins, including IL-19, IL-20, IL-22/IL-TIF, IL-24/MDA-7 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene), IL-26/AK155, and a number of viral IL-10 homologs. These cytokines belong to a relatively small group of homodimeric proteins with highly interdigitated interfaces that exhibit the strongly hydrophobic character of the interior core of a single-chain folded domain. We propose that binding of DnaK to helix C in the superfamily of IL-10-related cytokines may constitute the hallmark of a novel conserved regulatory mechanism in which HSP70-like chaperones assist in the formation of a hydrophobic dimeric &quot;folding&quot; interface."

The plasmid content and antibiogram were determined.RESULTS: Twenty-two of 181 isolates (12%) exhibited high levels of resistance to tetracycline (MICs &gt;/=16 microg/ml) and harbored a putative 25.2-Mda plasmid that contained the tet(M) gene. A high percentage of isolates (95%; 21/22) presented the Dutch type tet(M) gene. One isolate from 1999 revealed a new restriction pattern. Such a pattern had been previously noted in 1991. This new restriction pattern has not been described previously as occurring in isolates of N gonorrhoeae. The tet(M) amplimer sequence showed 100% identity with a previously described tet(M)-carrying plasmid from N meningitidis.CONCLUSION: A new HpaII restriction pattern of the tet(M) gene is present in low frequency. The tet(M) sequence was different from the gonococcal tet(M) sequences already known and not typable with the use of a differential PCR assay. Accordingly, with the genetic diversity already present within the tet(M) sequence of N gonorrhoeae isolates, we should be aware of the sensitivity of the PCR assays in use for tetracycline-resistant N gonorrhoeae detection."

Cycloheximide inhibited this stimulation, indicating that de novo protein synthesis was essential for this response. We examined whether mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or Smad pathways are involved in TGF-beta1-stimulated collagenase-3 expression in MDA-MB231 cells. Biochemical blockade of extracellular regulated kinase-1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways partially abolished TGF-beta1-stimulated collagenase-3 mRNA expression; whereas overexpression of a dominant negative form of Smad3 completely blocked the TGF-beta1-response. These data indicate that TGF-beta1-induced MAPK and Smad pathways are involved in TGF-beta1-stimulated collagenase-3 expression in MDA-MB231 cells."

Previously, we found NQO1*3 in one allele of HCT-116 cells, and in both alleles of the mitomycin C-resistant subline, HCT-116R30A. The NQO1 protein content of HCT-116R30A is 5% that of HCT-116. RT-PCR revealed an exon-4-deleted NQO1 mRNA in both cell lines indicating alternative splicing. However, the cause of the lower expression of NQO1 in HCT-116R30A is unknown. Current data show that HCT-116R30A cells are able to express NQO1 protein from transfected cDNA constructs when RNA splicing is omitted. The ratio of full-length to exon-4-deleted mRNA measured by semiquantitative PCR shows that HCT-116 and HCT-116R30A have ratios of 64 : 36 and 34 : 66, respectively. All other cell lines tested have a ratio of 90 : 10, including HT-29, NIH-125 and NCI-H1688 (homozygous NQO1*1); MCF-7 and HL-60 (heterozygous NQO1*1/*2); and MDA-MB231 (homozygous NQO1*2/*2). Alternative splicing of NQO1 at the 5'-splice site of intron-4 increased in cells with NQO1*3. The 465C&gt;T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) disrupts the consensus sequence at the 5'-splice site, which is required for binding by U1 small nuclear RNA (U1 snRNA) in spliceosomes. This defective RNA splicing was partially corrected by transfecting HCT-116R30A cells with U1 snRNA constructs, containing base changes to compensate for the 465 SNP. NQO1 protein and enzymatic activity increased with corrected splicing. The 465 SNP was the major cause of increased alternative splicing and decreased expression of NQO1 protein in HCT-116R30A cells."

After deprotection, this primary amine provided a site for introduction of a maleimide group that enabled linkage to proteins. This maleimido derivative of geldanamycin (GMB-APA-GA) was linked to the monoclonal antibody Herceptin after the antibody had been modified with Traut's reagent to introduce thiol groups. By this sequence, a new immunoconjugate (H:APA-GA) was generated that showed greater antiproliferative activity than the previously reported analogous immunoconjugate created with a 1,4-diaminobutane spacer derivative of geldanamycin to form an immunoconjugate, H:ABA-GA. Both immunoconjugates inhibited in vitro the growth of MDA-361/DYT2 cells, a cell line overexpressing the HER2 antigen, while Herceptin alone was ineffective. However, H:APA-GA showed better efficacy than H:ABA-GA (IC(50) = 0.2 vs 0.58 mg/mL and cell doubling time &gt;12 vs 6 days, respectively). Results of the in vivo therapy experiments in a xenograft model were consistent with the in vitro findings. Treatment with Herceptin prolonged the survival of the tumor-bearing mice when compared with the control group, but H:ABA-GA and H:APA-GA were each more efficacious than unmodified Herceptin. However, unlike H:ABA-GA, the immunoconjugate H:APA-GA caused stable tumor regression (in 25% of the recipients), showing a qualitative improvement with potential clinical relevance."

Of the available human prostate cancer cell lines, only LNCaP mirrors this phenotype. We investigated whether the prostate cancer cell lines MDA PCa 2a and MDA PCa 2b share this phenotype.METHODS: GSTP1 protein and mRNA levels were assessed in the MDA PCa 2a and MDA PCa 2b cell lines by Western and Northern blot. DNA methylation was evaluated by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA digested with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes BssHII, NotI, and SacII. Re-expression of GSTP1 was determined by RT-PCR following treatment with 5-azacytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, and/or the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA).RESULTS: Like all human prostatic carcinomas in vivo, both the MDA PCa 2a and 2b cell lines lack protein and mRNA expression of GSTP1. This lack of expression is associated with methylation in the GSTP1 gene promoter. Treatment with the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine resulted in re-expression of GSTP1. By itself, TSA did not result in re-expression of GSTP1, nor did it augment expression induced by 5-azacytidine.CONCLUSIONS: MDA PCa 2a and 2b appear to be useful models of human prostatic carcinoma in that they lack expression of GSTP1 due to gene silencing via promoter methylation. Inhibition of histone acetylation does not appear to affect GSTP1 expression."

However, these chimeras weakly bind to ErbB-3 alone. To further dissect the ligand binding selectivity of the ErbB network, we have applied the phage display technique to examine the role of the linear N-terminal region in EGF for interaction with ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers. A library of EGF variants was constructed in which residues 2, 3, and 4 were randomly mutated, followed by selection for binding to intact MDA-MB-453 cells that overexpress ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 but lack ErbB-1. Analysis of the selected phage EGF variants revealed clones with high binding affinity to ErbB-2/ErbB-3 while maintaining high affinity to ErbB-1. In these variants, Trp (or alternatively His) was almost exclusively present at position 2, while specific combinations of hydrophobic, basic, and small residues were found at positions 3 and 4. The mitogenic activity of the phage EGF variants corresponded with their relative binding affinity. Two of the selected EGF variants, EGF/WVS and EGF/WRS, were further characterized as recombinant proteins. In contrast to previously characterized chimeras of EGF with NRG-1 or TGF-alpha, these variants did not only show high binding affinity for ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers but also for ErbB-3 alone. These data show that the linear N-terminal region of EGF-like growth factors is directly involved in binding to ErbB-3."

The Se supplementation group received 400 micrograms selenium per day for 7 days before surgery. We used biochemical techniques, atomic absorption, RT-PCR and cDNA sequence testing methods to evaluate and compare the changes during ischemia/reperfussion (I/R) in myocardial melondialdehyde (MDA) level, GPX activity and gene expression level, GPX cDNA nucleotide sequence, selenium and calcium and magnesium concentration.RESULTS: Before ischemia, taking selenium for 7 days did not change the selenium concentration in either plasma or blood cells in either group. The GPX mean activity level in the selenium group was slightly lower than that in the control group, and the MDA level was equal in both. After 30 minutes of reperfusion, the Se level in plasma and blood cells remained constant, while the myocardial Se concentration and GPX gene expression in the Se group increased significantly. The MDA level in the Se group reduced 4.2%, compared to an 8.2% rise in the control group. The mean level of GPX activity in the Se group was slightly lower than that in the control group. Both pre- and post-myocardial reperfusion, the Se group had a higher rate of myocardial GPX gene expression, and the nucleotide sequence was normal. These results indicate that supplementing Se is not likely to enhance myocardial GPX activity, but it could increase the GPX gene expression level, and thereby enhance the Se patients' myocardial antioxidant level during I/R, allowing free radicals to be scavenged as soon as they are generated.CONCLUSION: Se supplementation could increase myocardial selenium content and improve GPX gene expression during I/R, and in this way defend against free radical peroxide damage to the myocardium."

The adhesion mediated by the classical type I cadherins is strengthened through catenin-mediated coupling of the cytoplasmic domain to the cytoskeleton. This cytoskeletal interaction may not be essential for the adhesion promoted by all cadherins, several of which lack cytosolic catenin-binding sequences. Cadherin-11, a classical cadherin, possesses a cytoplasmic domain that interacts with catenins, but may also occur as a variant form expressing a truncated cytoplasmic domain. To study the role of the cytoplasmic sequence in cadherin-11 mediated adhesion we have constructed and expressed a truncated cadherin-11 protein lacking the cytoplasmic domain and unable to bind beta-catenin. Expression of the truncated cadherin-11 in MDA-MB-435S human mammary carcinoma cells reduced their motility and promoted calcium-dependent cell aggregation, frequent cell contacts, and functional gap-junctions. We conclude that the intracellular catenin-binding domain of cadherin-11, and by inference cytoskeletal interaction, is not required for the initiation and formation of cell adhesion."

However, the mechanism of the abnormal secretion of procathepsin D remains unclear. Since the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGF2R) plays a central role in the intracellular transport and endocytosis of M6P-containing lysosomal enzymes, a deficiency in functional M6P/IGF2R may underlie the hypersecretion of procathepsin D in invasive tumors.METHODS: In the present study, we compared the profiles of cathepsin D and the M6P/IGF2R between the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 and the non-invasive MCF-7 cell lines.RESULTS: MDA-MB-231cells were confirmed to secrete a much larger proportion of procathepsin D into the medium than MCF-7 cells. Addition of M6P to the culture medium significantly altered the secretion of procathepsin D by MCF-7 cells, but had little effect on cathepsin D distribution in MDA-MB-231cells. Both the M6P-binding capacity and the endocytosis of exogenous M6P-bearing proteins in MDA-MB-231 cells were far less than those in MCF-7 cells. mRNA analysis indicated that the levels of the M6P/IGF2R mRNA in MDA-MB-231 cells were not lower but were even higher than that in MCF-7 cells. Sequence analysis indicated a difference in the 3'-untranslated region of M6P/IGF2R between the two cell lines, but no mutation in the M6P-binding domain of the receptor.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a potential defect in a post-transcriptional process (e.g., translation) may exist during synthesis of the M6P/IGF2R in MDA-MB-231cells, leading to failure to express sufficient functional M6P/IGF2R and thereby resulting in the hypersecretion of procathepsin D."

ORF2 showed a homology to Haemophilus ducreyi pilin, fragments of Streptomyces and Mycobacterium integral membrane proteins, and eukaryotic transcriptional regulators. The omegon proved to be inserted into orfX1/X2 which possibly has a deletion and shows a GC content untypical for A. brasilense genes.

The mechanism of preferential metastasis of breast cancer to bone is unknown. We hypothesize that breast cancer cells that develop bone metastases have the capacity to facilitate their colonization in bone. To examine this hypothesis, we established bone-seeking (MDA-231BO) and brain-seeking (MDA-231BR) clones of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 by repeated sequential passages in nude mice and in vitro of metastatic cells obtained from bone and brain metastases, respectively. These clones were examined for distinguishing biological characteristics and compared with the MDA-231 parental cells (MDA-231P) in vivo and in vitro. Both the MDA-231BR and the MDA-231BO showed identical tumorigenicity to MDA-231P at the orthotopic site. MDA-231P that was inoculated into the heart developed metastases in bone, brain, ovary, and adrenal glands. On the other hand, MDA-231BO exclusively metastasized to bone with larger osteolytic lesions than MDA-231P. MDA-231BR exclusively disseminated to brain and failed to develop bone metastases. In culture, MDA-231BO produced greater amounts of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP) than MDA-231BR and MDA-231P in the absence or presence of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Furthermore, the anchorage-independent growth of MDA- 231BO in soft agar was not inhibited by TGF-beta, whereas TGF-beta profoundly inhibited the growth of MDA-231P and MDA-231BR. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) markedly promoted the anchorage-independent growth of MDA-231BO, whereas marginal or no stimulation was observed in MDA-231BR or MDA-231P, respectively. Our data suggest that these phenotypic changes allow breast cancer cells to promote osteoclastic bone resorption, survive, and proliferate in bone, which consequently leads to the establishment of bone metastases."

Our previous studies showed that treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha-negative human breast cancer cells with the DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) led to ER mRNA and protein re-expression. Also, the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) could induce ER transcript about 5-fold. Here we show that 5-aza-dC alone induced ER transcript about 30-40-fold, and the addition of TSA elevated ER mRNA expression about 10-fold more in the human ER-negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435. Overall, the combination of 5-aza-dC and TSA induced a 300-400-fold increase in ER transcript. Restoration of estrogen responsiveness was demonstrated by the ability of the induced ER protein to elicit estrogen response element-regulated reporter activity from an exogenous plasmid as well as induce expression of the ER target gene, progesterone receptor. The synergistic activation of ER occurs concomitantly with markedly reduced soluble DNMT1 expression and activity, partial demethylation of the ER CpG island, and increased acetylation of histones H(3) and H(4). These data suggest that the activities of both DNMT1 and HDAC are key regulators of methylation-mediated ER gene silencing."

In breast cancer, however, loss of TGF-beta growth inhibition often occurs without a loss of these signaling components. A genome-wide analysis of rapid TGF-beta gene responses in MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells shows that c-myc repression, a response that is key to the TGF-beta program of cell cycle arrest, is selectively lost in the cancer cell line. Transformation of MCF-10A cells with c-Ha-ras and c-erbB2 oncogenes also led to a selective loss of c-myc repression and cell cycle arrest response. TGF-beta stimulation of epithelial cells rapidly induces the formation of a Smad complex that specifically recognizes a TGF-beta inhibitory element in the c-myc promoter. Formation of this complex is deficient in the oncogenically transformed breast cells. These results suggest that a Smad complex that specifically mediates c-myc repression is a target of oncogenic signals in breast cancer."

The mechanisms for these activities remain incompletely defined, although uPAR was recently identified as a cis-acting ligand for the beta2 integrin CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1). Here we show that a major beta1 integrin partner for uPAR/uPA signaling is alpha3.

A critical role of alpha3beta1 in uPA signaling was verified by studies of epithelial cells from alpha3-deficient mice. Thus, uPAR preferentially complexes with alpha3beta1, promoting direct (Vn) and indirect (Fn, Col) pathways of cell adhesion, the latter a heterotrimeric G protein-dependent mechanism of signaling between alpha3beta1 and other beta1 integrins."

It was observed that the genomic area spanned by WWOX is affected by chromosomal translocations and homozygous deletions. Furthermore, the high incidence of allelic loss in breast, ovarian, prostate, and other cancers affecting this region suggests that WWOX is a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Expression of WWOX is highly variable in breast cancer cell lines, with some cases showing low or undetectable levels of expression. In this report, we demonstrate that ectopic WWOX expression strongly inhibits anchorage-independent growth in soft agar of breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-435 and T47D. Additionally, we observed that WWOX induces a dramatic inhibition of tumorigenicity of MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells when tested in vivo. We also detected the common occurrence of aberrant WWOX transcripts with deletions of exons 5-8 or 6-8 in various carcinoma cell lines, multiple myeloma cell lines, and primary breast tumors. These aberrant mRNA forms were not detected in normal tissues. Interestingly, we further observed that proteins encoded by such aberrant transcripts display an abnormal nuclear localization in contrast to the wild-type WWOX protein that localizes to the Golgi system. Our data indicate that WWOX behaves as a potent suppressor of tumor growth and suggest that abnormalities affecting this gene at the genomic and transcriptional level may be of relevance in carcinogenesis."

Up to 30% of the enzyme associates with the surface of intact cells upon lysis of neighboring bacteria. The role of the enzyme at the extracellular location has been a subject of controversy because the purified enzyme is irreversibly inactivated below pH 5. We have determined the crystal structure of H. pylori urease, which has a 1.1 MDa spherical assembly of 12 catalytic units with an outer diameter of approximately 160 A. Under physiologically relevant conditions, the activity of the enzyme remains unaffected down to pH 3. Activity assays under different conditions indicated that the cluster of the 12 active sites on the supramolecular assembly may be critical for the survival of the enzyme at low pH. The structure provides a novel example of a molecular assembly adapted for acid resistance that, together with the low Km value of the enzyme, is likely to enable the organism to inhabit the hostile niche."

The CCR4-NOT proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae exist in two complexes, 1.9x10(6) Da and 1.0x10(6) Da (1.0 MDa) in size, and individual components of these complexes display such disparate functions as binding to and restricting TFIID functions, contacting SAGA and contributing to mRNA deadenylation. As a first step in characterizing the functional roles of the 1.0 MDa complex, we have purified it to near homogeneity. Mass spectrometric analysis was subsequently used to identify all the components of the complex. The 1.0 MDa complex was found to contain CCR4, CAF1, NOT1-5 and two new proteins, CAF40 and CAF130. CAF130 and CAF40 are two unique yeast proteins, with CAF40 displaying extensive homology to proteins from other eukaryotes. Immunoprecipitation and gel filtration experiments confirmed that CAF130 and CAF40 are components of both of the 1.9 MDa and 1.0 MDa CCR4-NOT complexes. Biochemical analysis indicated that the CAF40 and CAF130 proteins bind to the NOT1 protein and exist in a location separate from the two other subsets of proteins in the complex: the CCR4 and CAF1 proteins, and the NOT2, NOT4 and NOT5 proteins. Moreover, CAF40 was able to interact with human NOT1, suggesting that human CAF40 would also be a component of the recently identified human CCR4-NOT complex. Analysis of caf40 and caf130 deletions indicated that they elicited phenotypes shared by defects in other CCR4-NOT genes. The distinct location of CAF40 and CAF130 and the evolutionary conservation of CAF40 implicate them in novel roles in the function of the CCR4-NOT complex."

Because the absence of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) gene expression has been associated with aberrant methylation of its CpG island in a significant fraction of breast cancers, we tested whether histone deacetylase activity contributes to the transcriptional inactivation of the methylated ER gene in a panel of ER-negative human breast cancer cells. Treatment of these cells with trichostatin A, a specific histone deacetylase inhibitor, led to dose- and time-dependent re-expression of ER mRNA as detected by reverse transcription-PCR without alteration in ERalpha CpG island methylation. Trichostatin A-induced ER re-expression was associated with increased sensitivity to DNase I at the ER locus in MDA-MB-231 cells. These data implicate inactive chromatin mediated by histone deacetylation as a critical component of ER gene silencing in human breast cancer cells. Therefore, histone deacetylation may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of a subset of ER-negative breast cancers."

Treatment of human melanoma cells with recombinant fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) and the protein kinase C activator mezerein (MEZ) results in an irreversible loss in growth potential, suppression of tumorigenic properties and induction of terminal cell differentiation. Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7), as a gene induced during these physiological changes in human melanoma cells. Ectopic expression of mda-7 by means of a replication defective adenovirus results in growth suppression and induction of apoptosis in a broad spectrum of additional cancers, including melanoma, glioblastoma multiforme, osteosarcoma and carcinomas of the breast, cervix, colon, lung, nasopharynx and prostate. In contrast, no apparent harmful effects occur when mda-7 is expressed in normal epithelial or fibroblast cells. Human clones of mda-7 were isolated and its organization resolved in terms of intron/exon structure and chromosomal localization. Hu-mda-7 encompasses seven exons and six introns and encodes a protein with a predicted size of 23.8 kDa, consisting of 206 amino acids. Hu-mda-7 mRNA is stably expressed in the thymus, spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes. De novo mda-7 mRNA expression is also detected in human melanocytes and expression is inducible in cells of melanocyte/melanoma lineage and in certain normal and cancer cell types following treatment with a combination of IFN-beta plus MEZ. Mda-7 expression is also induced during megakaryocyte differentiation induced in human hematopoietic cells by treatment with TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate). In contrast, de novo expression of mda-7 is not detected nor is it inducible by IFN-beta+MEZ in a spectrum of additional normal and cancer cells. No correlation was observed between induction of mda-7 mRNA expression and growth suppression following treatment with IFN-beta+MEZ and induction of endogenous mda-7 mRNA by combination treatment did not result in significant intracellular MDA-7 protein. Radiation hybrid mapping assigned the mda-7 gene to human chromosome 1q, at 1q 32.2 to 1q41, an area containing a cluster of genes associated with the IL-10 family of cytokines. Mda-7 represents a differentiation, growth and apoptosis associated gene with potential utility for the gene-based therapy of diverse human cancers."

We approached this problem by purifying capsids from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the only other known human gammaherpesvirus. The results from our biochemical and imaging analyses demonstrate that KSHV capsids possess a typical herpesvirus icosahedral capsid shell composed of four structural proteins. The hexameric and pentameric capsomers are composed of the major capsid protein (MCP) encoded by open reading frame 25. The heterotrimeric complexes, forming the capsid floor between the hexons and pentons, are each composed of one molecule of ORF62 and two molecules of ORF26. Each of these proteins has significant amino acid sequence homology to capsid proteins in alpha- and betaherpesviruses. In contrast, the fourth protein, ORF65, lacks significant sequence homology to its structural counterparts from the other subfamilies. Nevertheless, this small, basic, and highly antigenic protein decorates the surface of the capsids, as does, for example, the even smaller basic capsid protein VP26 of herpes simplex virus type 1. We have also found that, as with the alpha- and betaherpesviruses, lytic replication of KSHV leads to the formation of at least three capsid species, A, B, and C, with masses of approximately 200, 230, and 300 MDa, respectively. A capsids are empty, B capsids contain an inner array of a fifth structural protein, ORF17.5, and C capsids contain the viral genome."

Vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) is considered to be the most important directly acting angiogenic protein that has been shown to be up-regulated in breast cancer cells. Hypoxia seems to be an important stimulus for inducing VPF/VEGF mRNA expression in human mammary tumors. Here, we have studied the roles of the tumor suppressor gene p53 and the proto-oncogene c-Src in regulating the transcription of VPF/VEGF in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB 435 under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. p53 significantly inhibited the transcription of VPF/VEGF involving the transcription factor Sp1. Increased binding of Sp1 to the VPF/VEGF promoter has been observed when the cells were exposed to hypoxia. It has been shown that p53 makes a complex with Sp1 and inhibits its binding to the VPF/VEGF promoter to prevent the transcriptional activation. Furthermore, c-Src kinase activity was found to be increased in the hypoxic condition, and in the presence of antisense of Src, there was down-regulation of the total mRNA level and also the promoter activity of VPF/VEGF. The present study indicates that p53 can also inhibit the hypoxic induction of Src kinase activity and thereby may prevent VPF/VEGF transcription. Taken together, our data suggest a central role of p53, through which it can inhibit VPF/VEGF expression by regulating the transcriptional activity of Sp1 and also by down-regulating the Src kinase activity, under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions."

Recently, it has been suggested that non lipid-related effects of statins could play a beneficial role in cancer therapy. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which statins inhibit cancer and the types of cancers which could benefit from this therapy. In MDA-MB-231 cells, an aggressive breast cancer cell line with spontaneous activation of Ras and NFkappaB and overexpression of RhoA, cerivastatin induced inhibition of both cell proliferation and invasion through Matrigel. This anti-proliferative effect was related to G(1)/S arrest due to an increase in p21(Waf1/Cip1). The anti-invasive effect was observed from 18 h and could be explained by RhoA delocalization from the cell membrane, resulting in disorganization of the actin fibers and disappearance of focal adhesion sites. The importance of RhoA inactivation in both these inhibitory effects was proved by their reversion by GGPP but not by FPP. Moreover, cerivastatin was also shown to induce inactivation of NFkappaB, in a RhoA inhibition-dependent manner, resulting in a decrease in urokinase and metalloproteinase-9 expression, two proteases involved in cell migration. The participation of Ras inactivation is considered a subsidiary mechanism for the effects of cerivastatin, as they were not rescued by FPP. Prolonged treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with high doses of cerivastatin induced a loss of cell attachment. Interestingly, the effect of cerivastatin was considerably lower on poorly invasive MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that cerivastatin inhibits cell signaling pathways involved in the invasiveness and metastatic properties of highly invasive cancers."

Bcl-2, typically an inhibitor of apoptosis, has also been demonstrated to have pro-apoptotic activity (Cheng, E. H., Kirsch, D. G., Clem, R. J., et al. (1997) Science 278, 1966-1968). The pro-apoptotic activity has been attributed to the cleavage of Bcl-2 by caspase-3, which converts Bcl-2 to a pro-apoptotic molecule. Bcl-2 is a membrane protein that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, the outer mitochondrial membrane, and the nuclear envelope. Here, we demonstrate that transient expression of Bcl-2 at levels comparable to those found in stably transfected cells induces apoptosis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in the human breast cell line MDA-MB-468 cells. Furthermore, we have targeted Bcl-2 specifically to either the ER or the outer mitochondrial membrane to test whether induction of apoptosis by Bcl-2 is dependent upon its localization within either of these membranes. Our findings indicate that Bcl-2 specifically targeted to the mitochondria induces cell death, whereas Bcl-2 that is targeted to the ER does not. The expression of Bcl-2 does result in its cleavage to a 20-kDa protein; however, mutation of the caspase-3 cleavage site (D34A) does not inhibit its ability to induce cell death. Additionally, we find that transiently expressed ER-targeted Bcl-2 inhibits cell death induced by Bax overexpression. In conclusion, the ability of Bcl-2 to promote apoptosis is associated with its localization at the mitochondria. Furthermore, the ability of ER-targeted Bcl-2 to protect against Bax-induced apoptosis suggests that the ER localization of Bcl-2 may play an important role in its protective function."

Excluding the terminal hairpin loops, the YLDV genome is 144,575 bp in length and contains inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of 1883 bp. Within 20 nucleotides of the termini, there is a sequence that is conserved in other poxviruses and is required for the resolution of concatemeric replicative DNA intermediates. The nucleotide composition of the genome is 73% A+T, but the ITRs are only 63% A+T. The genome contains 151 tightly packed open reading frames (ORFs) that either are &gt; or =180 nucleotides in length or are conserved in other poxviruses. ORFs within 23 kb of each end are transcribed toward the termini, whereas ORFs within the central region of the genome are encoded on either DNA strand. In the central region ORFs have a conserved position, orientation, and sequence compared with vaccinia virus ORFs and encode many enzymes, transcription factors, or structural proteins. In contrast, ORFs near the termini are more divergent and in seven cases are without counterparts in other poxviruses. The YLDV genome encodes several predicted immunomodulators; examples include two proteins with similarity to CC chemokine receptors and predicted secreted proteins with similarity to MHC class I antigen, OX-2, interleukin-10/mda-7, poxvirus growth factor, serpins, and a type I interferon-binding protein.

Differential screening of the library isolated the growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene Cyr61, a secreted, cysteine-rich, heparin binding protein that promotes endothelial cell adhesion, migration, and neovascularization. Northern analysis revealed that Cyr61 was expressed highly in the invasive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, T47D, and MDA-MB-157; very low levels were found in the less tumorigenic MCF-7 and BT-20 breast cancer cells and barely detectable amounts were expressed in the normal breast cells, MCF-12A. Univariate analysis showed a significant or borderline significant association between Cyr61 expression and stage, tumor size, lymph node positivity, age, and estrogen receptor levels. Interestingly, expression of Cyr61 mRNA increased 8- to 12-fold in MCF-12A and 3- to 5-fold in MCF-7 cells after 24- and 48-h exposure to estrogen, respectively. Induction of Cyr61 mRNA was blocked by tamoxifen and ICI182,780, inhibitors of the estrogen receptor. Stable expression of Cyr61 cDNA under the regulation of a constitutive promoter in MCF-7 cells enhanced anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar and significantly increased tumorigenicity and vascularization of these tumors in nude mice. Moreover, overexpression of Cyr61 in MCF-12A normal breast cells induced their tumor formation and vascularization in nude mice. In summary, these results suggest that Cyr61 may play a role in the progression of breast cancer and may be involved in estrogen-mediated tumor development."

Despite intensive analysis, the genetic changes that mediate pancreatic cancer development and effective therapies for diminishing the morbidity associated with this disease remain unresolved. Through subtraction hybridization, we have identified a gene associated with induction of irreversible growth arrest, cancer reversion, and terminal differentiation in human melanoma cells, melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7). Ectopic expression of mda-7 when using a recombinant adenovirus, Ad.mda-7, results in growth suppression and apoptosis in a broad spectrum of human cancers with diverse genetic defects, without exerting deleterious effects in normal human epithelial or fibroblast cells. Despite the apparently ubiquitous antitumor effects of mda-7, pancreatic carcinoma cells are remarkably refractory to Ad.mda-7 induced growth suppression and apoptosis. In contrast, the combination of Ad.mda-7 with antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, which target the K-ras oncogene (a gene that is mutated in 85 to 95% of pancreatic carcinomas), induces a dramatic suppression in growth and a decrease in cell viability by induction of apoptosis. In mutant K-ras pancreatic carcinoma cells, programmed cell death correlates with expression and an increase, respectively, in MDA-7 and BAX proteins and increases in the ratio of BAX to BCL-2 proteins. Moreover, transfection of mutant K-ras pancreatic carcinoma cells with an antisense K-ras expression vector and infection with Ad.mda-7 inhibits colony formation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo in nude mice. These intriguing observations demonstrate that a combinatorial approach, consisting of a cancer-specific apoptosis-inducing gene and an oncogene inactivation strategy, may provide the foundation for developing an effective therapy for pancreatic cancer."

Now we demonstrate that HB-EGF also binds to a novel 140 kDa receptor on MDA-MB 453 cells. Purification of this receptor showed it to be identical to N-arginine dibasic convertase (NRDc), a metalloendopeptidase of the M16 family. Binding to cell surface NRDc and NRDc in solution was highly specific for HB-EGF among EGF family members. When overexpressed in cells, NRDc enhanced their migration in response to HB-EGF but not to EGF. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous NRDc expression in cells by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides inhibited HB-EGF-induced cell migration. Anti-erbB1 neutralizing antibodies completely abrogated the ability of NRDc to enhance HB-EGF-dependent migration, demonstrating that this NRDc activity was dependent on erbB1 signaling. Although NRDc is a metalloproteinase, enzymatic activity was not required for HB-EGF binding or enhancement of cell migration; neither did NRDc cleave HB-EGF. Together, these results suggest that NRDc is a novel specific receptor for HB-EGF that modulates HB-EGF-induced cell migration via erbB1."

BRAF35 contains a nonspecific DNA binding HMG domain and a kinesin-like coiled coil domain. Similar to BRCA2, BRAF35 mRNA expression levels in mouse embryos are highest in proliferating tissues with high mitotic index.

We used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify proteins that interact with neurofascin intracellularly and therefore might link it to trafficking, spatial targeting, or signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that rat syntenin-1, previously published as syntenin, mda-9, or TACIP18 in human, is a neurofascin-binding protein that exhibits a wide-spread tissue expression pattern with a relative maximum in brain. Syntenin-1 was found not to interact with other vertebrate members of the L1 subgroup such as L1 itself or NrCAM. We confirmed the specificity of the neurofascin-syntenin-1 interaction by ligand-overlay assay, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and colocalization of both proteins in heterologous cells. The COOH terminus of neurofascin was mapped to interact with the second PDZ domain of syntenin-1. Furthermore, we isolated syntenin-2 that may be expressed in two isoforms. Despite their high sequence similarity to syntenin-1, syntenin-2alpha, which interacts with neurexin I, and syntenin-2beta do not bind to neurofascin or several other transmembrane proteins that are binding partners of syntenin-1.

Analysis of MMP expression by RT-PCR showed expression of MMP-1. MMP-3, and MMP-13 in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells, but not in slightly invasive cell lines. The extracellular secretion of MMP-1 and MMP-3 by MDA-MB 231 cells could be also shown by ELISA. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNAs were found in all cell lines, however, the extracellular secretion of both TIMPs was much higher in MDA-MB-231 cells than in the other cell lines. When the cells were cultured on Matrigel matrix, MMP-9 expression was induced in MDA-MB-231 cells only, as assessed by RT-PCR and zymography experiments.

An analogous linkage has now been investigated as a stable surrogate using the self-complementary oligodeoxynucleotide sequence 5'-d(AGGCG*CCT)(2,) in which G* represents guanines linked via a trimethylene chain between N(2) positions. The solution structure, obtained by NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics using a simulated annealing protocol, revealed the cross-link only minimally distorts duplex structure in the region of the cross-link. The tether is accommodated by partially unwinding the duplex at the lesion site to produce a bulge and tipping the guanine residues; the two guanines and the tether attain a nearly planar conformation. This distortion did not result in significant bending of the DNA, a result which was confirmed by gel electrophoresis studies of multimers of a 21-mer duplex containing the cross-link."

PTHrP induces local osteolysis that leads to activation of bone matrix-borne transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta). In turn, TGF beta stimulates PTHrP expression and, thereby, accelerates bone destruction. We studied the mechanism by which TGF beta activates PTHrP in invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that TGF beta 1 up-regulates specifically the level of PTHrP P3 promoter-derived RNA in an actinomycin D-sensitive fashion. Transient transfection studies revealed that TGF beta 1 and its effector Smad3 are able to activate the P3 promoter. This effect depended upon an AGAC box and a previously described Ets binding site. Addition of Ets1 greatly enhanced the Smad3/TGF beta-mediated activation. Ets2 had also some effect, whereas other Ets proteins, Elf-1, Ese-1, and Erf-1, failed to cooperate with Smad3. In comparison, Ets1 did not increase Smad3/TGF beta-induced stimulation of the TGF beta-responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) promoter. Smad3 and Smad4 were able to specifically interact with the PTHrP P3-AGAC box and to bind to the P3 promoter together with Ets1. Inhibition of endogenous Ets1 expression by calphostin C abrogated TGF beta-induced up-regulation of the P3 transcript, whereas it did not affect the TGF beta effect on PAI expression. In TGF beta receptor II- and Ets1-deficient, noninvasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, TGF beta 1 neither influenced endogenous PTHrP expression nor stimulated the PTHrP P3 promoter. These data suggest that TGF beta activates PTHrP expression by specifically up-regulating transcription from the PTHrP P3 promoter through a novel Smad3/Ets1 synergism."

Laminin-5 is markedly down-regulated in breast cancer cells. Little is known about the regulation of laminin gene transcription in normal breast cells, nor about the mechanism underlying the down-regulation seen in cancer. In the present study, we cloned the promoter of the gene for the human laminin alpha3A chain (LAMA3A) and investigated its regulation in functionally normal MCF10A breast epithelial cells and several breast cancer cell lines. Using site-directed mutagenesis of promoter-reporter constructs in transient transfection assays in MCF10A cells, we find that two binding sites for Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4/GKLF/EZF) are required for expression driven by the LAMA3A promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal absence of KLF4 binding activity in extracts from T47D, MDA-MB 231, ZR75-1, MDA-MB 436, and MCF7 breast cancer cells. Transient transfection of a plasmid expressing KLF4 activates transcription from the LAMA3A promoter in breast cancer cells. A reporter vector containing duplicate KLF4-binding sites in its promoter is expressed at high levels in MCF10A cells but at negligible levels in breast cancer cells. Thus, KLF4 is required for LAMA3A expression and absence of laminin alpha3A in breast cancer cells appears, at least in part, attributable to the lack of KLF4 activity."

Dyneins have masses of approximately 1-2 MDa and consist of up to 15 different polypeptides. Nucleotide binding/hydrolysis and MT motor activity are associated with the heavy chains, and we detail here our current model for the substructural organization of these approximately 520-kDa proteins. The remaining polypeptides play a variety of roles in dynein function, including attachment of the motor to cargo, regulation of motor activity in response to specific inputs, and their necessity for the assembly and/or stability of the entire complex.

In development of breast cancer, loss of ER alpha gene expression is one of the most important steps in acquiring hormone resistance, though the mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent studies have reported that methylation of the ER alpha gene promoter A and exon 1 was inversely associated with ER alpha gene expression in human breast cancer and cell lines. The methylation status of the promoter B region, which is responsible for overexpression of ER alpha protein in cancer tissue, has not been investigated. In this report, we found that the methylation status of promoter B, as well as that of promoter A, was inversely associated with ER alpha gene expression in human breast cancer and cell lines. Specific methylation of ER alpha gene promoters in vitro directly decreased transcription of the ER alpha gene in a reporter assay. Demethylating treatment induced transcription of ER alpha mRNA from promoter B in ZR-75-1 cells, which showed no transcription from promoter B, despite weak ERBF-1 expression, but not in ER alpha-negative MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells, which lack ERBF-1. ZR-75-1 cells showed promoter activity equal to that of MCF-7 cells in a reporter assay. Our results indicate that methylation of promoter B of the ER alpha gene is important for loss of ER alpha gene expression in human breast cancer, and methylation of the promoters can directly modulate ER alpha gene expression. However, loss of critical transcriptional factors such as ERBF-1 may also be involved in some ER alpha-negative cases."

The mechanism of ligand-activated estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-dependent activation of gene expression through the SRE was determined by mutational analysis of the promoter, analysis of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation by E2, and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) as a positive control. In addition, ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and Chinese hamster ovary cells were used as reference cell lines. The results showed that transcriptional activation of the SRE by E2 was due to ERalpha activation of the MAPK pathway and increased binding of the serum response factor and Elk-1 to the SRE. Subsequent studies with dominant negative Elk-1, wild type, and variant GAL4-Elk-1 fusion proteins confirmed that phosphorylation of Elk-1 at serines 383 and 389 in the C-terminal region of Elk-1 is an important downstream target associated with activation of an SRE by E2. Both E2 (ERalpha-dependent) and growth factors (ERalpha-independent) activated the SRE in breast cancer cells via the Ras/MAPK pathway; however, in ER-negative CHO cells that do not express a receptor for TGF-alpha, only hormone-induced activation was observed in cells transfected with ERalpha."

It is possible that activation of IGF-IR and elevations in uPA are mechanistically linked. Our laboratory recently showed that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) induces uPA protein and mRNA in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. We also found that IGF-IR and uPA were commonly overexpressed in primary breast cancers. In this study, we investigated the signal transduction pathway through which IGF-I regulates uPA. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and p70 kinase were inhibited with LY294002, PD98059, and rapamycin, respectively. Induction of uPA protein by IGF-I was partially inhibited by LY294002 (60% inhibition) or PD98059 (30% inhibition) but not by rapamycin. The production of uPA protein induced by IGF-I was blocked up to 90% by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. Furthermore, herbimycin A suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT and Erk1/2. Next, we tested the impact of the signal transduction inhibitors on uPA gene expression. Both LY294002 and PD98059 were required to completely inhibit uPA mRNA expression, whereas each drug alone resulted in approximately 50% reduction in uPA expression. Next, using a minimal uPA-luciferase promoter construct containing the binding sites for the AP-1 and Ets transcription factors, we observed that IGF-I stimulated the uPA promoter via these sites. Furthermore, both Ly294002 and PD98059 were necessary to block IGF-I-stimulated uPA-Luc activity. In summary, we conclude that IGF-I requires both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-dependent pathways to optimally induce uPA expression. These findings suggest that the development of drugs targeting these pathways may benefit breast cancer patients at a high risk of recurrence, such as those who have primary tumors overexpressing IGF-IR and uPA."

Transfection of MDA-MB-231 cells with RFC cDNA restored methotrexate uptake and increased methotrexate sensitivity by approximately 50-fold. A CpG island in the promoter region of RFC was found to be methylated in MDA-MB-231 cells, but was unmethylated in RFC expressing, methotrexate-sensitive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies against acetylated histones H3 and H4 showed that the RFC promoter was enriched for acetylated histones on expressed, unmethylated alleles only. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored RFC expression but also led to increased methotrexate efflux and did not reverse methotrexate resistance. This suggests that 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine up-regulates both methotrexate uptake and some methotrexate-resistance mechanism(s). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed increased expression levels of several ATP-dependent efflux pumps in response to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment, including P-glycoprotein and members of the multidrug resistance-associated protein family. Up-regulation of P-glycoprotein in response to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine was associated with demethylation of a CpG island in the MDR1 promoter, whereas the mechanism(s) for 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-induced up-regulation of multidrug resistance-associated proteins is probably indirect. Dipyridamole inhibited methotrexate efflux and reversed methotrexate resistance in 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-treated MDA-MB-231 cells."

The data presented here demonstrate that, in contrast to activation by the cytokine, growth hormone (GH), the activation of STAT5b by the growth factor, epidermal growth factor (EGF), requires overexpression of the EGF receptor (EGFR). We have shown that EGF activates STAT5b not only in a HEK293 cell model in which the EGFR is stably overexpressed but also in the MDA-MB468 breast cancer cell line. Furthermore, EGF (but not GH) is able to activate tyrosine phosphorylation of a Tyr-699 mutant of STAT5b. Using metabolic labeling studies as well as site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified three novel EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-725, Tyr-740, and Tyr-743. Luciferase assays using a STAT5-specific DNA sequence demonstrate that, although Tyr-699 is absolutely required for transcriptional activation, tyrosines 725, 740, and 743 may be involved in a negative regulation of transcription. Because overexpression of the EGFR is common in many cancers, including advanced breast cancer, characterization of EGF-induced STAT5b may have direct implications in therapeutic applications."

We show 1) that in both cell lines, androgens stimulate the expression of fatty acid synthase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase, two key lipogenic genes representative for the fatty acid and the cholesterol synthesis pathway, respectively; 2) that treatment with androgens results in increased nuclear levels of active SREBP; 3) that the effects of androgens on promoter-reporter constructs derived from both lipogenic genes (fatty acid synthase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase) depend on the presence of intact SREBP-binding sites; and 4) that cotransfection with dominant-negative forms of SREBPs abolishes the effects of androgens. Related to the mechanism underlying androgen activation of the SREBP pathway, we show that in addition to minor effects on SREBP precursor levels, androgens induce a major increase in the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), an escort protein that transports SREBPs from their site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to their site of proteolytical activation in the Golgi. Both time course studies and overexpression experiments showing that increasing levels of SCAP enhance the production of mature SREBP and stimulate lipogenic gene expression support the contention that SCAP plays a pivotal role in the lipogenic effects of androgens in tumor cells."

In insensitive cells, little metabolism occurs. Because CYP1A1 can metabolize DF 203, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) may mediate drug action. We demonstrate here that DF 203 increases CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 transcription in sensitive MCF-7 cells, accompanied by AhR translocation to the nucleus, increase in xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE)-driven luciferase activity, and induction of protein/DNA complexes on the XRE sequence of the CYP1A1 promoter. MDA-MB-435 and PC3 cells, resistant to DF 203, did not show drug-induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 gene expression. AhR was observed to be constitutively localized in the nucleus, with no induction of XRE-driven luciferase activity in transiently transfected cells and weak or no induction of protein/DNA complexes on the XRE sequence of CYP1A1. Taken together, these data elucidate a novel basis for antitumor drug action: induction in sensitive cells of a metabolizing system for the drug itself. These results suggest that clarification of the basis for differential engagement of AhR-related signaling in different tumor cell types may aid in further preclinical development and perhaps early clinical studies."

However, the downstream alterations in gene expression resulting from this pathway have not been established. On the basis of cDNA microarray and semiquantitative RT-PCR assays, we found that MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells preincubated with HGF/SF and then exposed to Adriamycin (ADR), a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, exhibit an altered pattern of gene expression, as compared with cells treated with ADR only. [HGF/SF+ADR]-treated cells showed altered expression of genes involved in the DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, metabolism, and development. Some of these alterations suggest mechanisms by which HGF/SF may exert its protective activity, e.g., up-regulation of polycystic kidney disease-1 (a survival-promoting component of cadherin-catenin complexes), down-regulation of 51C (an inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase), and down-regulation of TOPBP1 (a topoisomerase IIB binding protein). We showed that enforced expression of the cdc42-interacting protein CIP4, a cytoskeleton-associated protein for which expression was decreased in [HGF/SF+ADR]-treated cells, inhibited HGF/SF-mediated protection against ADR. The cDNA microarray approach may open up new avenues for investigation of the DNA damage response and its regulation by HGF/SF."

The ER agonist activities of the synthetic mono and dihydroxy aromatic compounds are comparable in all three-cell lines, whereas the activities of naringenin, kepone and resveratrol are dependent on cell context and expression of wild-type or variant forms of ER alpha. In contrast, the ER antagonist activities for these compounds were highly complex and, with the exception of 3Cl-PCB-OH, all compounds inhibited E2-induced wild-type or variant ER action.

The eukaryotic proteasome has evolved from a simpler archaebacterial form, similar in structure but containing only three different peptides. One of these peptides is an ATPase belonging to the AAA (Triple-A) family of ATPASES: Gene duplication and diversification has resulted in six paralogous ATPases being present in the eukaryotic proteasome. While sequence analysis studies clearly show that the six eukaryotic proteasomal ATPases have evolved from the single archaebacterial proteasomal ATPase, the deep node structures of the phylogenetic constructions lack resolution. Incorporating physical data to provide support for alternative phylogenetic hypotheses, we have constructed a model of a possible evolutionary history of the proteasomal ATPASES:"

EGF binds with high affinity to the EGF-R and activates a variety of second messenger pathways that affect cellular proliferation. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in the regulation of EGF-R expression in breast cancer cells are yet to be described. Here we show that the EGF-induced upregulation of EGF-R mRNA in two human breast cancer cell lines that overexpress EGF-R (MDA-MB-468 and BT-20) is accompanied by stabilization (&gt;2-fold) of EGF-R mRNA. Transient transfections using a luciferase reporter identified a novel EGF-regulated approximately 260-nucleotide (nt) cis-acting element in the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of EGF-R mRNA. This cis element contains two distinct AU-rich sequences (~75 nt), EGF-R1A with two AUUUA pentamers and EGF-R2A with two AUUUUUA extended pentamers. Each independently regulated the mRNA stability of the heterologous reporter. Analysis of mutants of the EGF-R2A AU-rich sequence demonstrated a role for the 3' extended pentamer in regulating basal turnover. RNA gel shift analysis identified cytoplasmic proteins (~55 to 80 kDa) from breast cancer cells that bound specifically to the EGF-R1A and EGF-R2A cis-acting elements and whose binding activity was rapidly downregulated by EGF and phorbol esters. RNA gel shift analysis of EGF-R2A mutants identified a role for the 3' extended AU pentamer, but not the 5' extended pentamer, in binding proteins. These EGF-R mRNA-binding proteins were present in multiple human breast and prostate cancer cell lines. In summary, these data demonstrate a central role for mRNA stabilization in the control of EGF-R gene expression in breast cancer cells. EGF-R mRNA contains a novel complex AU-rich 260-nt cis-acting destabilizing element in the 3'-UTR that is bound by specific and EGF-regulated trans-acting factors. Furthermore, the 3' extended AU pentamer of EGF-R2A plays a central role in regulating EGF-R mRNA stability and the binding of specific RNA-binding proteins. These findings suggest that regulated RNA-protein interactions involving this novel cis-acting element will be a major determinant of EGF-R mRNA stability."

The antagonistic substance was identified as macrocyclic peptide antibiotic micrococcin P1, which had previously not been reported for the genus Staphylococcus. Micrococcin P1, also a potent inhibitor of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is structurally related to thiostrepton, thiocillins and nosiheptide. Although all of these peptide antibiotics have been known for quite a long time, their mode of biosynthesis had not been determined in detail yet. By using degenerated PCR, a gene fragment encoding a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) could be amplified from S. equorum. The corresponding chromosomal locus was disrupted by insertional mutagenesis, and it could be shown that all mutants obtained displayed a micrococcin P1-deficient phenotype. Sequence analysis of a coherent 2.8-kb fragment revealed extensive homology to known NRPSs, and allowed the assignment of the domain organization 'condensation-adenylation-thiolation-condensation'; an arrangement predicted only for two loci within the presumably 14-modular, 1.6-MDa biosynthetic NRPS template. Biochemical characterization of the adenylation domain exhibited selectivity for the substrate amino-acid threonine. All of these data substantiate that the macrocyclic peptide antibiotic is biosynthesized nonribosomally, and provide the basis for the characterization of the entire biosynthetic gene cluster. The biosynthetic machinery of micrococcin will serve as a model system for structurally related, pharmacologically important pyridinyl polythiazole class peptide antibiotics. Furthermore, this knowledge will enable the manipulation of its NRPS template, which in turn may grant the targeted engineering of even more potent anti-listerial and anti-malaria drugs."

Expression of MET mRNA and protein was determined. Migration and in vitro invasiveness of transfected cells were also analyzed.RESULTS: Breast cancer cells were transfected with the ribozyme-containing plasmids. Stable transfectants manifested an almost complete loss of MET mRNA and protein, as shown by reverse transcription-PCR, Northern blotting, and Western blotting, respectively, whereas the wild-type plasmid had no effects. Met-ribozyme transfected cells exhibited reduced migration and in vitro invasiveness through extracellular matrix (Matrigel), compared with the wild-type cells and cells transfected with empty plasmid.CONCLUSIONS: These data show that targeting c-MET by way of a hammerhead ribozyme encoding antisense to c-MET is an effective approach in reducing the invasiveness of breast cancer cells."

Glycodelin, a hormone-responsive protein, has been detected in tumors of reproductive organs and is found in high levels in the plasma of subjects with gynecological malignancies. Glycodelin is also found in the endothelial cells of the umbilical cord and in the blood vessels of tumors. In this study, we tested whether glycodelin-rich amniotic fluid and a synthetic peptide derived from the sequence of glycodelin peptide (Gp) might promote angiogenic response by examining the migration and tube formation in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Increased migration and tube formation of HUVECs were found in the presence of amniotic fluid and Gp, and this increase was blocked by antibody to Gp and by an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, suggesting that the angiogenic effects of glycodelin might be mediated by VEGF. The results also showed that Gp significantly increased the release of VEGF protein and mRNA expression in HUVECs, RL-95 (human endometrial carcinoma cells), OVCAR-3 (human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells), EM42 (human endometrial epithelial cells), THP-1 (human monocyte), and MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 (human breast adenocarcinoma cells) cell lines. VEGF receptor Fit-1 mRNA expression in HUVECs was also increased in the presence of Gp. These findings, together with the suggestion from the literature that glycodelin may have immunosuppressive properties, suggest that glycodelin might play an important role in neovascularization during embryogenesis and tumor development."

These include polyglutamylation and polyglycylation of both subunits, reversible tyrosination and removal of the penultimate glutamate from alpha-tubulin, and phosphorylation of the beta III isotype. A mass spectrometry-based method has been developed for the analysis of the C-terminal diversity of tubulin from human cell lines. Total cell extracts are resolved by SDS--PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the region of the blot corresponding to tubulin (approximately 50 kDa) was excised and digested with CNBr to release the highly divergent C-terminal tubulin fragments. The masses of the human alpha- and beta-tubulin CNBr-derived C-terminal peptides are all in the 1500--4000 Da mass range and can be analyzed directly by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode without significant interference from other released peptides. In this study, the tubulin isotype diversity in MDA-MB-231, a human breast carcinoma cell line, and A549, a human non-small lung cancer cell line, is reported. The major tubulin isotypes present in both cell lines are k-alpha 1 and beta 1. Importantly, we report a previously unknown alpha isotype present at significant levels in both cell lines. Moreover, the degree of posttranslational modifications to all isotypes was limited. Glu-tubulin, in which the C-terminal tyrosine of alpha-tubulin is removed, was not detected.

MDA and the combination of MDA and acetaldehyde were employed to determine the effect on alpha(2)(I) collagen gene expression as assessed by transient transfection analysis and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immunoblot and subsequent immunoprecipitation analysis examined stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) activity. Cotransfection with a dominant negative mutant for c-jun nuclear kinase (dnJNK1) was also employed with the alpha(2)(I) collagen promoter. MDA increased alpha(2)(I) collagen gene expression nearly 2.5- to 3-fold, however there was no synergistic effect of the combination of acetaldehyde and MDA on alpha(2)(I) collagen gene activation and expression. Acetaldehyde, MDA, or both significantly increased JNK activity when compared to untreated stellate cells. The dnJNK1 expression vector abrogated alpha(2)(I) collagen transgene activity.

The current study investigated the possible contribution of DNA methylation to the regulation of Nm23-H1 expression, based on the observation that two CpG islands are present in its promoter. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), a DNA methylation inhibitor, increased the Nm23-H1 expression of 5 of 11 human breast carcinoma cell lines in vitro, including 3 of 3 metastatically competent lines. Increased Nm23-H1 expression was accompanied by a reduction in motility in vitro, with minimal effect on proliferation. Both increased Nm23-H1 expression and decreased motility were observed using low (75 nM) concentrations of 5-Aza-CdR. Array analysis of MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells treated with 5-Aza-CdR confirmed the elevation of nm23-H1 mRNA, whereas relatively few other genes exhibited altered expression. Bisulfite sequencing of the two CpG islands in a panel of cell lines and in 20 infiltrating ductal carcinomas revealed that one island (-3090 bp to -3922 bp) exhibited infrequent differential methylation. The data indicate that DNA methylation inhibitors can directly or indirectly cause both elevation of Nm23-H1 expression and decreased function in one aspect of metastasis, motility."

While searching for potential inhibitors of the approximately 1.4 MDa apoptosome complex, we observed an approximately 30 kDa Apaf-1 immunoreactive fragment that was associated exclusively with the inactive complex. We subsequently determined that caspase-3 cleaved Apaf-1 within its CED-4 domain (SVTD(271) downward arrowS) in both dATP-activated lysates and apoptotic cells to form a prominent approximately 30 kDa (p30) N-terminal fragment. Purified recombinant Apaf-1 p30 fragment weakly inhibited dATP-dependent activation of caspase-3 in vitro. However, more importantly, prevention of endogenous formation of the p30 fragment did not stimulate latent effector caspase processing activity in the large complex. Similarly, the possibility that XIAP, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), was responsible for the inactivity of the approximately 1.4 MDa complex was excluded as immunodepletion of this caspase inhibitor failed to relieve the inhibition. However, selective proteolytic digestion of the approximately 1.4 MDa and approximately 700 kDa complexes showed that Apaf-1 was present in conformationally distinct forms in these two complexes. Therefore, the inability of the approximately 1.4 MDa apoptosome complex to process effector caspases most likely results from inappropriately folded or oligomerized Apaf-1."

There are several studies documenting molecular alterations leading to cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells; however, no studies, to date, have shown the effect of genistein in isogenic normal and malignant breast epithelial cells. In this study, we investigated whether genistein shows any differential sensitivity to normal (MCF10A and MCF12A) and malignant (MCF10CA1a and MDA-MB-231) breast epithelial cells. We found that genistein causes a greater degree of G(2)-M arrest and induces apoptosis in malignant cell lines compared with normal breast epithelial cells. After genistein treatment, flow cytometric analysis revealed a hyperdiploid population in malignant cells that was not observed in normal cells. Cell cycle regulator p21(WAF1), which is known to be up-regulated by genistein treatment, was greatly induced at RNA and protein levels in normal cells, whereas its level was only slightly induced in malignant MDA-MB-231 cells and not detectable in malignant MCF10CA1a cells. Therefore, we investigated the causal role of p21(WAF1) in the differential sensitivity of genistein among these cell lines. We examined the effects of genistein on p21(WAF1) -/- and p21(WAF1) +/+ HCT116 cells, which were used as controls prior to studies on breast cancer cells. We found that there was a greater degree of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in p21(WAF1) -/- cells compared with p21(WAF1) +/+ HCT116 cells after genistein treatment. Flow cytometric analysis after genistein treatment showed a significant number of p21(WAF1) -/- cells in the hyperdiploid population, which are probably programmed to die through apoptotic processes. To further confirm the causal role of p21(WAF1) in genistein-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, we down-regulated p21(WAF1) by antisense p21(WAF1) cDNA transfection experiments. We found that both normal and malignant p21(WAF1) antisense (AS)-expressing clones became more sensitive to G(2)-M arrest after genistein treatment. Flow cytometric analysis showed an increase in the hyperdiploid population in the AS clones. Further evaluation showed an increase in apoptosis in malignant AS clones but not in normal breast epithelial AS clones. These results suggest that p21(WAF1) may play an important role in determining the sensitivity of normal and malignant breast epithelial cells to genistein."

Here we analyzed the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-beta modulates AhR expression. A 5799-nucleotide 5'-flanking region of human AhR gene was isolated. Transient transfection studies of full-length (hAhRP) and deletion promoter constructs indicate the requirement of a cis-regulatory element encompassing -1980 to -1892 for full constitutive activity. Basal hAhRP activity occurs in a cell-specific manner; human hepatoma HepG2 cells possess a 10-fold higher activity compared with A549 cells. TGF-beta exerts cell-specific effects on hAhRP activity. Treatment of cells with 100 pM TGF-beta leads to a 50% inhibition in A549 and a 3-fold induction in HepG2 cells. Deletion mutagenesis identified a TGF-beta-responsive sequence containing a functional conserved Smad-binding element. Transient overexpression of Smad 2, 3, and 4 indicates that these signal transducers modulate hAhRP activity. The down-regulation of AhR by TGF-beta is modulated by 5'-TG-3'-interacting factor (TGIF). Transient overexpression of TGIF in MDA-MB231 and HepG2 cells led to inhibition of hAhRP activity and a similar decrease of AhR mRNA expression. Our findings indicate that Smad proteins are involved in the cell-specific regulation of AhR expression by TGF-beta."

Promoter I.3 is one of the major promoters that control the expression of aromatase in breast cancer tissue. Using the yeast one-hybrid approach to screen a human breast tissue hybrid cDNA expression library, we found that the zinc-finger transcriptional factor Snail (SnaH) interacted with a regulatory region near promoter I.3 of the human aromatase gene. DNA mobility shift assays and mutation analyses using recombinant SnaH protein expressed in Escherichia coli have revealed that this protein interacts with a segment, 5'-CTGATGAAGT-3', which is between 66 and 76 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site of promoter I.3. Using mammalian cell transfection experiments, SnaH was found to act as a repressor of promoter I.3 activity. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have revealed that the NH2-terminal SNAG domain is important for the repressor activity of SnaH. To demonstrate the inhibitory activity against aromatase expression, a stable SnaH-expressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line was generated, and the aromatase RNA messages in the SnaH-transfected cell line were found to be 30% of those in the vector-transfected cell line. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis on RNAs isolated from 12 cell lines has confirmed that SnaH is expressed at a higher level in normal breast epithelial cell and stromal fibroblast cell lines than in breast cancer cell lines. In addition, SnaH mRNA was detected in only 16 of 55 breast cancer specimens. On the other hand, aromatase mRNA was detected in 54 of the 55 specimens. Our results indicate that SnaH acts as a repressor that down-regulates the expression of aromatase in normal breast tissue by suppressing the function of promoter I.3. A reduction of the expression of SnaH in breast cancer tissue further suggests a cancer-protective role for this protein in normal breast tissue."

To identify the genes involved in this process we recently selected highly invasive and weakly invasive cell clones from a melanoma cell line. Both cell clones showed a stable phenotype over more than 40 passages and previous analyses revealed a fivefold difference in their invasive potential in vitro and in tumorigenesis in vivo. To compare gene expression of the two cell clones a cDNA array system (Clontech human cancer cDNA array) was used. Exact quantification of differentially expressed genes in each cell clone was performed by real-time RT-PCR. An evaluation of the array data revealed a total of 36 genes that were more than 1.5-fold differentially expressed, and 26 (72%) of these showed a differential expression pattern by quantitative RT-PCR. Previously known differences in expression patterns, including loss of p16 and HLA I, or equal expression of p73, and RAR alpha, beta and gamma were confirmed by the array data. In addition, reduced expression levels of several cytoskeletal proteins, such as vimentin, gamma-actin, desmin and cytokeratins, in the highly invasive cell clone were reproducibly identified. Other genes strongly upregulated in the highly invasive cell clone included jagged 2, STAT1, tPA and c-myc, whereas MDA-6 (p21), caspase 2 and semaphorin were found to be downregulated. In conclusion, comparative hybridization of cDNA arrays identified a series of novel invasion-associated changes in gene expression and confirmed previously known expression patterns."

A prominent feature in the A-band portion of titin is the presence of an 11-domain super-repeat of immunoglobulin superfamily and fibronectin-type-III-like domains. Seven overlapping constructs from human cardiac titin, each consisting of two or three domains and together spanning the entire 11-domain super-repeat, have been expressed in Escherichia coli. Fluorescence unfolding experiments and circular dichroism spectroscopy have been used to measure folding stabilities for each of the constructs and to assign unfolding rates for each super-repeat domain. Immunoglobulin superfamily domains were found to fold correctly only in the presence of their C-terminal fibronectin type II domain, suggesting close and possibly rigid association between these units. The domain stabilities, which range from 8.6 to 42 kJ mol(-1) under physiological conditions, correlate with previously reported mechanical forces required to unfold titin domains. Individual domains vary greatly in their rates of unfolding, with a range of unfolding rate constants between 2.6 x 10(-6) and 1.2 s(-1). This variation in folding behavior is likely to be an important determinant in ensuring independent folding of domains in multi-domain proteins such as titin."

We have determined that PA and its halide derivative 4-chlorophenylacetate (4-CPA) showed marked antiproliferative activity on 3 of 6 human breast cancer cell lines tested. Interestingly, the 3 cell lines that were growth inhibited by PA and 4-CPA were estrogen receptor (ER) positive (T47-D, MCF-7 and ZR-75-1) whereas those that were little affected by these compounds were ER-negative (MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231 and SK-Br-3). Dose response studies indicated that 4-CPA inhibited the growth of the sensitive (ER+) cell lines with a potency 3-4 times that of PA. These findings suggest that there is &quot;cross-talk&quot; between the PA and estrogen signaling pathways such that PA can directly inhibit estrogen-dependent events. This hypothesis was directly tested in vitro using ER+ MCF-7 cells that were stably transfected with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the full length (1745 bp) cyclin D1 promoter (MCF-7-D1). Our experiments with MCF-7-D1 cells indicated that PA and 4-CPA inhibited basal and estrogen-induced reporter gene activity by up to 90%, resulting in almost complete elimination of estrogen-dependent cyclin D1 gene activation. Using a reporter gene construct (ERE(V)-tk-Luc) containing a canonical estrogen response element that was transiently transfected into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, we have also demonstrated inhibition of promoter activity by PA and 4-CPA that was directly mediated by blockage of activity through the ERE. Taken together, these findings indicate that PA analogs possess potent antiestrogen properties that may, at least partly, account for their antiproliferative effects on ER+ breast cancer cells. The data suggests a novel mechanism of action that might bypass some of the limitations of conventional antiestrogen therapy."

Two cell lines with wildtype p53 (MCF-7 and MCF10A) demonstrated transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter by full-length BRCA1 (BRCA1L) as well as by two splice variants that lack most of exon 11 (BRCA1S and BRCA1S-9,10). In contrast, two cell lines with mutant p53 (MDA-231 and HCC1937) were inactive. Co-transfection of BRCA1L with BRCA1S or BRCA1S-9,10 exhibited synergistic p21 promoter activation, due to augmented expression of the cytomegalovirus promoter-based BRCA1 expression constructs. We examined the transcriptional activity of two known sequence alterations in BRCA1, one that results in a carboxy-terminal truncation of BRCA1 and is clearly pathogenic, and the other a missense mutation that is suspected of predisposing to cancer. Although both mutations have been shown to be defective in some assays of transactivation, we observed both mutations to be fully active in activation of the p21 promoter when incorporated in the full-length BRCA1L. In contrast, these mutations rendered BRCA1S inactive. These observations indicate that such transcriptional assays cannot serve as the basis for a functional appraisal of BRCA1 sequence alterations encountered in the course of genetic testing."

Analysis of the upstream -568 to -523 region of the promoter in HeLa cells has identified an imperfect palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) that is required for hormone inducibility. Analysis of the CKB gene promoter in MCF-7 breast cancer cells confirmed that pCKB7 (containing the -568 to -523 promoter insert) was estrogen-responsive in transient transfection studies. However, mutation and deletion analysis of this region of the promoter showed that two GC-rich sites and the concensus ERE were functional cis-elements that bound estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)/Sp1 and ERalpha proteins, respectively. The role of these elements was confirmed in gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and transfection studies in MDA-MB-231 and Schneider Drosophila SL-2 cells. These results show that transcriptional activation of CKB by estrogen is dependent, in part, on ERalpha/Sp1 action which is cell context-dependent."

Projectin has been suggested as the elastic component of C-filaments in insect indirect flight muscles, which is consistent with its localization from the Z band to the tip of the A band in these muscles. Here, we describe the completion of the projectin sequence analysis, which defines projectin as a 1 MDa protein, composed of 39 immunoglobulin and 39 fibronectin III domains. This analysis led also to the identification of a domain rich in the amino acids P, E, V and K within the NH(2) terminus of projectin. The length of the projectin PEVK-like region varies from 100 to 624 amino acid residues, following a complex pattern of alternative splicing events. PEVK domains were first identified in vertebrate titin and they have been associated with the elasticity of the protein. The PEVK-like domain of the projectin isoforms in indirect flight muscles may contribute to the elastic function of the C-filaments. The synchronous projectin isoforms contain a PEVK-like region, and the possible non-elastic function(s) of this domain in synchronous muscles are discussed."

Interference with HER-2 mRNA translation by means of antisense oligonucleotides might improve the efficacy of chemotherapy. To test this hypothesis, eight breast cancer cell lines and a normal human fibroblast cell line were examined for their level of HER-2 expression, their sensitivity to phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (AS HER-2 ODN), and to various chemotherapeutic agents, and the combination of the two. No correlation was found between the intrinsic HER-2 level and either the sensitivity to a particular chemotherapeutic agent alone, or the amount of growth inhibition observed with a specific AS HER-2 ODN concentration. Although sequence specificity and extent of AS HER-2 ODN inhibition of HER-2 synthesis were somewhat higher in the HER-2 overexpressing MDA-MB-453 and SK-BR-3 cells, we found that antisense treatment significantly sensitized all of the breast cancer cells, even MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells, with approximately basal levels of HER-2, to various chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, the combination of AS HER-2 ODN and taxol was shown to synergistically induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-435. These results demonstrate that overexpression of HER-2 would not be a prerequisite for the effective use of AS HER-2 ODN as a combination treatment modality for breast cancer and suggest that the use of AS HER-2 ODN, as part of a combination treatment modality, need not be limited to breast tumors that display elevated levels of HER-2."

Furthermore, when short prodrug exposures were given, wtNR was more efficient at killing cells than mtNR.

(2) Pretreatment with Fn or RGD before ozone exposure markedly attenuated the release of 3H, LDH and MDA, and the effects of Fn were reversed by W7, a calmodulin inhibitor.

Since hEST2 selectively catalyzes the sulfonation of ethinyl estradiol as well as that of estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2), but poorly the sulfonation of catecholestrogens, we wanted to assess the ability of hEST1 to metabolize these compounds. We overexpressed hEST1 in Escherichia coli in fusion with GST, then purified the enzyme using a glutathione affinity column, and obtained GST-free enzyme by digestion with thrombin. Using [35S]-phosphosadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS) as cofactor, we showed that hEST1 efficiently metabolizes the transformation of 2-OH-E2 and 2-OH-E1. However, the transformation of 4-OH-E1 and 4-OH-E2 is much less efficient. Our results also show that hEST1 metabolizes more efficiently E2 than E1. Since hEST1 mRNA is produced from the same gene as MPST using different alternative promoters and since it is expressed in most breast cancer cells (MCF-7, ZR-75-1, T47-D, MDA-231, and MDA-418), studies of the expression and activity of hEST1 will be most important to have a better knowledge about its involvement in the control of the genotoxicity of estrogens and catecholestrogens."

This study reports the ligand- and cell context-dependent ER(alpha)/Sp1 and ER(beta)/Sp1 action using an E2-responsive construct (pSp1) containing a GC-rich promoter. Both ER(alpha) and ER(beta) proteins physically interact with Sp1 (coimmunoprecipitation) and preferentially bind to the C-terminal region of this protein in pull-down assays. E2- and antiestrogen-dependent transcriptional activation of ER(alpha)/Sp1 was observed in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and LnCaP cells, but not in HeLa cells. E2 did not affect or significantly decrease ER(beta)/Sp1 action, and antiestrogens had minimal effects in the same 4 cell lines. Exchange of activation function-1 (AF-1) domains of ER subtypes gave chimeric ER(alpha/beta) (AF-1alpha/AF-2beta) and ER(beta/alpha) (AF-1beta/AF-2alpha) proteins that resembled wild-type ER (alpha or beta) in terms of physical association with Sp1 protein. Transcriptional activation studies with chimeric ER(beta/alpha) and ER(alpha/beta) showed that only ER(alpha/beta) can activate transcription from an Sp1 element, not ER(beta/alpha). This indicates that the AF-1 domain from ER(alpha) is responsible for activation at an Sp1 element, independent of ER subtype context. In order to further characterize this observation, deletion constructs in the AF-1 domain of both ER(alpha) and ER(alpha/beta) were made, and transactivation studies indicated that the region between amino acids 79 and 117 of this domain is important for activation at an Sp1 element."

The I-band region of titin underlies the myofibrillar passive tension response to stretch. Here, we show how titins with highly diverse I-band structures and elastic properties are expressed from a single gene. The differentially expressed tandem-Ig, PEVK, and N2B spring elements of titin are coded by 158 exons, which are contained within a 106-kb genomic segment and are all subject to tissue-specific skipping events. In ventricular heart muscle, exons 101 kb apart are joined, leading to the exclusion of 155 exons and the expression of a 2.97-MDa cardiac titin N2B isoform. The atria of mammalian hearts also express larger titins by the exclusion of 90 to 100 exons (cardiac N2BA titin with 3.3 MDa). In the soleus and psoas skeletal muscles, different exon-skipping pathways produce titin transcripts that code for 3.7- and 3.35-MDa titin isoforms, respectively. Mechanical and structural studies indicate that the exon-skipping pathways modulate the fractional extensions of the tandem Ig and PEVK segments, thereby influencing myofibrillar elasticity. Within the mammalian heart, expression of different levels of N2B and N2BA titins likely contributes to the elastic diversity of atrial and ventricular myofibrils."

Frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that is widely conserved among eukaryotes. Genetic inactivation of the yeast frataxin homologue (Yfh1p) results in mitochondrial iron accumulation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Increased iron deposition and evidence of oxidative damage have also been observed in cardiac tissue and cultured fibroblasts from patients with FRDA. These findings indicate that frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from iron-induced formation of free radicals. The functional mechanism of frataxin, however, is still unknown. We have expressed the mature form of Yfh1p (mYfh1p) in Escherichia coli and have analyzed its function in vitro. Isolated mYfh1p is a soluble monomer (13,783 Da) that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency to self-associate. Aerobic addition of ferrous iron to mYfh1p results in assembly of regular spherical multimers with a molecular mass of approximately 1. 1 MDa (megadaltons) and a diameter of 13+/-2 nm. Each multimer consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester &gt;3,000 atoms of iron. Titration of mYfh1p with increasing iron concentrations supports a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly. Sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent results in quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer, indicating that mYfh1p sequesters iron in an available form. In yeast mitochondria, native mYfh1p exists as monomer and a higher-order species with a molecular weight &gt;600,000. After addition of (55)Fe to the medium, immunoprecipitates of this species contain &gt;16 atoms of (55)Fe per molecule of mYfh1p.

Here we describe a distantly related member of the TGF-beta superfamily, designated placental TGF-beta (PTGF-beta), that is up-regulated in response to both p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic signaling events arising from DNA damage in human breast cancer cells. PTGF-beta is normally expressed in placenta and at lower levels in kidney, lung, pancreas, and muscle but could not be detected in any tumor cell line studied. The PTGF-beta promoter is activated by p53 and contains two p53 binding site motifs. Functional studies demonstrated that one of these p53 binding sites is essential for p53-mediated PTGF-beta promoter induction and specifically binds recombinant p53 in gel mobility shift assays. PTGF-beta overexpression from a recombinant adenoviral vector (AdPTGF-beta) led to an 80% reduction in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell viability and a 50-60% reduction in other human breast cancer cell lines studied, including MCF-7 cells, which are resistant to growth inhibition by recombinant wild-type p53. Like p53, PTGF-beta overexpression was seen to induce both G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast tumor cells. These results provide the first evidence for a direct functional link between p53 and the TGF-beta superfamily and implicate PTGF-beta as an important intercellular mediator of p53 function and the cytostatic effects of radiation and chemotherapeutic cancer agents."

These proteins contain a nucleotide-binding (NB) self-oligomerization domain and a caspase recruitment domain (CARD). A novel human protein was identified, NAC, that contains an NB domain and CARD. The CARD of NAC interacts selectively with the CARD domain of Apaf1, a caspase-activating protein that couples mitochondria-released cytochrome c (cyt-c) to activation of cytosolic caspases. Cyt-c-mediated activation of caspases in cytosolic extracts and in cells is enhanced by overexpressing NAC and inhibited by reducing NAC using antisense/DNAzymes. Furthermore, association of NAC with Apaf1 is cyt c-inducible, resulting in a mega-complex (&gt;1 MDa) containing both NAC and Apaf1 and correlating with enhanced recruitment and proteolytic processing of pro-caspase-9. NAC also collaborates with Apaf1 in inducing caspase activation and apoptosis in intact cells, whereas fragments of NAC representing only the CARD or NB domain suppress Apaf1-dependent apoptosis induction. NAC expression in vivo is associated with terminal differentiation of short lived cells in epithelia and some other tissues. The ability of NAC to enhance Apaf1-apoptosome function reveals a novel paradigm for apoptosis regulation."

Using an approach based on PCR, we detected two major splice variants (SVs) of mRNA for human GHRH receptor (GHRH-R) in human cancer cell lines, including LNCaP prostatic, MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic, MDA-MB-468 breast, OV-1063 ovarian, and H-69 small-cell lung carcinomas. In addition, high-affinity, low-capacity binding sites for GHRH antagonists were found on the membranes of cancer cell lines such as MiaPaCa-2 that are negative for the vasoactive intestinal peptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor (VPAC-R) or lines such as LNCaP that are positive for VPAC-R. Sequence analysis of cDNAs revealed that the first three exons in SV(1) and SV(2) are replaced by a fragment of retained intron 3 having a new putative in-frame start codon. The rest of the coding region of SV(1) is identical to that of human pituitary GHRH-R, whereas in SV(2) exon 7 is spliced out, resulting in a 1-nt upstream frameshift, which leads to a premature stop codon in exon 8. The intronic sequence may encode a distinct 25-aa fragment of the N-terminal extracellular domain, which could serve as a proposed signal peptide. The continuation of the deduced protein sequence coded by exons 4-13 in SV(1) is identical to that of pituitary GHRH-R. SV(2) may encode a GHRH-R isoform truncated after the second transmembrane domain. Thus SVs of GHRH-Rs have now been identified in human extrapituitary cells. The findings support the view that distinct receptors are expressed on human cancer cells, which may mediate the antiproliferative effect of GHRH antagonists."

The mechanism of transcriptional regulation by the Ccr4-Not complex is unknown and the role of its different components is unclear. Only Not1p is essential for yeast viability.Here, we show that most strains carrying combinations of two null alleles of the non-essential CCR4-NOT genes are non-viable. This would suggest that the Ccr4-Not complex is essential. We find that Not1p consists of at least two domains, a C-terminal domain that is essential for yeast viability, and a N-terminal domain that is dispensable but required for yeast wild-type growth. The essential C-terminal domain of Not1p can associate with Not5p, and both proteins are present in 1.2 and 2 MDa complexes in the absence of the N-terminal Not1p domain. In contrast, in the absence of the N-terminal domain of Not1p, Ccr4p does not efficiently associate in large complexes nor with the C-terminal domain of Not1p. Healthy growth is observed when both domains of Not1p are expressed in trans, and is correlated with their physical association, together with Ccr4p, in large complexes. These results are consistent with the essential function of Not1p lying within the Ccr4-Not complex."

Search of the causes affecting RARbeta gene activity has been oriented at identifying possible differences either at the level of one of the RARbeta promoters, RARbeta2, or at regulatory factors. We hypothesized that loss of RARbeta2 activity occurs as a result of multiple factors, including epigenetic modifications, which can pattern RARbeta2 chromatin state. Using methylation-specific PCR, we found hypermethylation at RARbeta2 in a significant proportion of both breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors. Treatment of cells with a methylated RARbeta2 promoter, by means of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), led to demethylation within RARbeta2 and expression of RARbeta indicating that DNA methylation is at least one factor, contributing to RARbeta inactivity. However, identically methylated promoters can differentially respond to RA, suggesting that RARbeta2 activity may be associated to different repressive chromatin states. This supposition is supported by the finding that the more stable repressive RARbeta2 state in the RA-resistant MDA-MB-231 cell line can be alleviated by the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), with restoration of RA-induced RARbeta transcription. Thus, chromatin-remodeling drugs might provide a strategy to restore RARbeta activity, and help to overcome the hurdle of RA-resistance in breast cancer."

The heavy and light chains are linked by a disulfide bond, and P25 associates with disulfide-linked heavy and light chains by noncovalent interactions. Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that molar ratios of the heavy chain, light chain, and P25 were 6:6:1, both in cocoons and in fibroin secreted into the lumen of posterior silk gland. Trace amounts of fibroin produced by three &quot;naked pupa&quot; mutants of B. mori lacked the light chain, but the molar ratio of heavy chain and P25 was also 6:1. Gel filtration chromatography and sedimentation equilibrium analysis demonstrated that a large protein complex of approximately 2.3 MDa, designated an elementary unit of fibroin having 6:6:1 molar ratios of the heavy chain, light chain, and P25, existed in posterior silk gland cells. Inaccessibility of biotinylated concanavalin A to the native elementary unit and partial dissociation of the elementary unit after incubation with excess N-glycosidase F or endoglycosidase H suggest that a single molecule of P25 is located internally and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the complex."

We report here the identification of two new factors that associate with the CCR4-NOT proteins as follows: CAF4, a WD40-containing protein, and CAF16, a putative ABC ATPase. Whereas neither CAF4 nor CAF16 was part of the core CCR4-NOT complex, both CAF16 and CAF4 appeared to be present in the 1.9-MDa complex. CAF4 also displayed physical interactions with multiple CCR4-NOT components and with DBF2, a likely component of the 1.9-MDa complex. In addition, both CAF4 and CAF16 were found to interact in a CCR4-dependent manner with SRB9, a component of the SRB complex that is part of the yeast RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. The three related SRB proteins, SRB9, SRB10, and SRB11, were found to interact with and to coimmunoprecipitate DBF2, CAF4, CCR4, NOT2, and NOT1. Defects in SRB9 and SRB10 also affected processes at the ADH2 locus known to be controlled by components of the CCR4-NOT complex; an srb9 mutation was shown to reduce ADH2 derepression and either an srb9 or srb10 allele suppressed spt10-enhanced expression of ADH2. In addition, srb9 and srb10 alleles increased ADR1(c)-dependent ADH2 expression; not4 and not5 deletions are the only other known defects that elicit this phenotype.

The dumpy gene of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an example of the latter class, with mutant phenotypes affecting size and shape of the limbs, thoracic cuticle, trachea and mouthparts.RESULTS: The genetically complex dumpy locus was found to span over 100 kb and encode a gigantic 2.5 MDa extracellular matrix protein. Dumpy represents an extreme form of modular protein evolution, containing 308 epidermal growth factor (EGF) modules, interspersed with a new module class, DPY, and terminating in a crosslinking zona pellucida domain and membrane anchor sequence. We determined the three-dimensional structure of the DPY module by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and found that it forms a disulphide-stabilised beta sheet motif, capable of linking end-to-end with EGF modules to form a fibre. Consistent with its cuticle phenotypes, dumpy is expressed at several sites of cuticle-epidermal cell attachment, including the trachea and the muscle tendon cells, which mediate anchorage of the muscles to the cuticle.CONCLUSIONS: The dumpy gene encodes a gigantic extracellular molecule that we predict to be a membrane-anchored fibre of almost a micrometer in length. Insertion and crosslinking of this fibre within the cuticle may provide a strong anchor for the underlying tissue, allowing it to maintain mechanical tension at sites under stress. This would explain its contribution to tissue morphogenesis through its regulation of mechanical properties."

In the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-435, c-erbB-2 over-expression results in increased chemoinvasion and higher metastatic properties in nude mice. However, the mechanisms by which c-erbB-2 increases the malignant potential of cells remains unclear. We have determined that over-expression of c-erbB-2 in MDA-MB-435 cells, and in some additional breast cancer cell lines, is associated with graphic increases in mRNA and protein levels of the actin bundling protein fascin. Heightened fascin expression has been observed in other systems to result in greatly increased cell motility, and indeed, our work employing semi-automated time-lapse microscopy demonstrates that MDA-MB-435 cells over-expressing c-erbB-2 exhibit significantly heightened cellular dynamics and locomotion, while visualization of bundled microfilaments within fixed cells revealed enhanced formation of dendritic-like processes, microspikes and other dynamic actin based structures. To address the means by which c-erbB-2 over-expression might result in elevated fascin levels, we identified multiple perfect match TCF and NF-kappaB consensus sites in fascin's promoter and first intron, which appeared consistent with the greater endogenous transcriptional activities of TCF and NF-kappaB in c-erbB-2 over-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells. While such transcriptional modulation may occur in the context of the intact gene/chromatin, subsequent tests using reporter constructs did not support involvement of these signaling pathways. In conclusion, highly increased fascin levels were observed in MDA-MB-435 over-expressing c-erbB-2, likely contributing to these cells' altered actin dynamics, and increased cell motility and malignancy. Studies in progress aim to discern the means by which c-erbB-2 over-expression leads to transcriptional activation of the fascin gene."

The tumor-associated carbohydrate Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T antigen) and beta-galactoside binding lectins (galectins) have been implicated in tumor cell adhesion and tissue invasion. In this study, we demonstrate the involvement of T antigen in both homotypic aggregation of MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells and their adhesion to the endothelium. The T antigen-specific peptide P-30 (HGRFILPWWYAFSPS) selected from a bacteriophage display library was able to inhibit spontaneous homotypic aggregation of MDA-MB-435 cells up to 74% in a dose-dependent manner. Because T antigen has beta-galactose as a terminal sugar, the expression profile of beta-galactoside-binding lectins (galectins) in MDA-MB-435 cells was studied. Our data indicated the abundant expression of [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled galectin-1 and galectin-3 in this cell line, which suggested possible interactions between galectins and T antigen. As revealed by laser confocal microscopy, both galectin-1 and galectin-3 also participate in the adhesion of the MDA-MB-435 cells to the endothelium. We observed the clustering of galectin-3 on endothelial cells at the sites of the contact with tumor cells, consistent with its possible interaction with T antigen on cancer cells The galectin-1 signal, however, strongly accumulated at the sites of cell-cell contacts predominantly on tumor cells. The T antigen-specific P-30 significantly (50%) inhibited this adhesion, which indicated that T antigen participates in the adhesion of MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells to the endothelium. The ability of synthetic P-30 to inhibit both the spontaneous homotypic aggregation of MDA-MB-435 cells and their adhesion to the endothelium (&gt;70 and 50%, respectively) suggests its potential functional significance for antiadhesive therapy of cancer metastasis."

Similar antisera raised against the MUC2 and MUC5B mucins were not reactive. The MUC5AC reduced-mucin subunits exhibited a homogeneous charge distribution on anion-exchange chromatography, but appeared as two bands, one major and one more minor, after agarose gel electrophoresis. The unreduced mucins had an average M(r) in excess of 40 MDa and were visualized in the electron microscope as large, fine filamentous threads (many microns in length) that after reduction were greatly reduced in size (number average length 570 nm). Agarose gel electrophoresis of unreduced MUC5AC mucins identified a major band just entering the gel with evidence of a 'ladder' of faster-migrating minor bands. Partial reduction of the mucins increased the proportion of the faster bands and at least 16 could be discriminated. M(r) measurements showed that these bands differed by single monomer units. The mucins behaved as very stiff extended structures in solution and this characteristic might explain the poor separation of different-sized oligomers in sedimentation-rate experiments. The cell-culture mucin preparation had similar characteristics of charge and buoyant density to MUC5AC mucins from respiratory secretions in vivo. In addition the MUC5AC mucin from respiratory tract secretions exhibited similar behaviour, reduced and unreduced on agarose gel electrophoresis, indicating that the mucin has a similar molecular phenotype in vivo and in vitro."

We have used the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 that expresses endogenous mutant p53(His273) as our source of p53 protein. First, we demonstrated that this mutant p53 participates in activating transcription from the HIV-LTR by showing that HIV-LTR-directed transcription in MDA-MB-468 cells is inhibited in a dominant-negative manner by p53(Val135). Using HIV-LTR DNA affinity chromatography, we detected coelution of p53(His273) and Sp1. We also demonstrated that this mutant p53 binds sequence specifically to the super consensus sequence (SCS) and that Sp1 coeluted with p53(His273) from a column containing this site.

ERalpha expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells reduced their invasiveness by 3-fold in the absence of hormone and by 7-fold in its presence. Integrity of hormone and DNA-binding domains and activating function 2 were required for estradiol-induced inhibition, suggesting that transcriptional activation of estrogen target genes was involved. In contrast, these domains were dispensable for hormone-independent inhibition. Analysis of deletion mutants of ERalpha indicated that amino acids 179-215, containing the N-terminal zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain, were required for ligand-independent receptor action. Among different members of the nuclear receptor family, only unliganded ERalpha and ERbeta reduced invasion. Calreticulin, a Ca2+-binding protein that could interact with amino acids 206-211 of ERalpha, reversed hormone-independent ERalpha inhibition of invasion. However, since calreticulin alone also inhibited invasion, we propose that this protein probably prevents ERalpha interaction with another unidentified invasion-regulating factor. The inhibitor role of the unliganded ER was also suggested in three ERalpha-positive cell lines, where ERalpha content was inversely correlated with cell migration. We conclude that ERalpha protects against cancer invasion in its unliganded form, probably by protein-protein interactions with the N-terminal zinc finger region, and after hormone binding by activation of specific gene transcription."

Targeted production of proteolytic enzymes like serine proteases and metalloproteinases is an important part of the invasive process of cancer cells. Treatment with 1 alpha25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha,25(OH)2D3] decreases the invasive properties of breast carcinoma cells. Here we have analyzed the effects of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and its synthetic analogues on the secretion and cell surface association of the components of the plasminogen activator (PA) system and on the secretion of certain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors in MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. Deltanoids were able to decrease the secretion of urokinase PA and tissue-type PA activity in a dose-dependent manner and to increase PA inhibitor 1 secretion, leading to reduced total PA activity. CB1093 was the most potent analogue, effective at concentrations several logarithms lower than 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. Transient transfection of different urokinase PA promoter reporter constructs to HT-1080 fibrosarcoma indicator cells indicated that vitamin D-responsive sequences were located between nucleotides -2350 and -1870 in the 5' region of the promoter. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 or other deltanoids also resulted in decreased MMP-9 levels in association with increased tissue inhibitor of MMP 1 activity. Membrane-type 1-MMP expression or proteolytic processing were not appreciably affected by deltanoids. Vitamin D and its analogues caused a decrease in Matrigel invasion assays of MDA-MB-231 cells. Cancer cell invasion is associated with coordinated secretion of proteolytic enzymes and their inhibitors. Vitamin D and its derivatives can evidently influence invasive processes by two means: (a) decreasing the expression and activity of cell invasion-associated serine proteases and metalloproteinases; and (b) inducing their inhibitors."

By elucidating the molecular mechanisms mediating the sensitivity of these cells, we can identify critical target genes regulated directly or indirectly by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and pathways potentially disrupted during transformation. In this study, we demonstrated the induction of expression of BRCA1 mRNA and protein as well as transcriptional activation from the BRCA1-promoter by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 in the sensitive breast cancer cell line MCF-7. This was not observed in the 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-resistant breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-436. The induction of BRCA1 mRNA was blocked by cyclohexamide. This indicated that transcriptional activation was mediated indirectly by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Inhibition of VDR protein levels by stable transformation of the anti-sense VDR in MCF-7 reduced the sensitivity of MCF-7 to 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 by 50-fold. In addition, the induction of BRCA1 protein and transcriptional activation of a BRCA1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct was abrogated in the stable transformant with the greatest reduction of VDR levels. Examination of other breast and prostate cancer cell lines revealed that sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effects of 1alpha, 25(OH)2D3 was strongly associated with an ability to modulate BRCA1 protein. Furthermore, the expression of the estrogen receptor in these cell lines strongly correlated with their sensitivity to 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and their ability to modulate BRCA1 expression. Taken together, our data support a model whereby the anti-proliferative effects of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 are mediated, in part, by the induction of BRCA1 gene expression via transcriptional activation by factors induced by the VDR and that this pathway is disrupted during the development of prostate and breast cancers."

Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we identified STAT1 activation after IFN-gamma treatment in breast cancer cell lines. Accordingly, IFN-gamma inhibited proliferation of monolayer cultured MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Interestingly, IFN-gamma inhibited anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 cells but had no effect on MDA-MB-231 colony formation. Because p21 has been shown to play a role in anchorage-independent growth and is a transcriptional target of STAT1, we examined the effect of IFN-gamma on p21 mRNA. We found that IFN-gamma induced p21 mRNA in MCF-7 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, IFN-gamma induced activation of a p21 promoter-luciferase reporter construct that contained the STAT1-inducible element in MCF-7 cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. IFN-gamma treatment resulted in increased p21 protein in MCF-7 cells, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells did not appear to express detectable p21, even after IFN-gamma treatment. However, in MDA-MB-231 cells, p21 protein was detected only after proteosome inhibition, suggesting that degradation may be responsible for the undetectable level of p21 in these cells, despite the abundant mRNA levels. Finally, focus formation of MDA-MB-231 cells was inhibited by overexpression of p21. In conclusion, STAT1 activation does not appear to be sufficient for IFN-gamma-mediated growth inhibition. Furthermore, the role of p21 appears to be complex because monolayer growth inhibition occurs in the absence of p21, but anchorage-independent growth inhibition may require p21. Breast cancer cells may provide a unique model for further study of IFN-gamma signaling."

Titin is thought to direct the assembly of sarcomeres and to maintain sarcomeric integrity by interacting with numerous sarcomeric proteins and providing a mechanical linkage. Since severe defects of such an important molecule are likely to result in embryonic lethality, a cell culture model should offer the best practicable tool to probe the cellular functions of titin. The myofibroblast cell line BHK-21/C13 was described to assemble myofibrils in culture. We have now characterized the sub-line BHK-21-Bi, which bears a small deletion within the titin gene. RNA analysis revealed that in this mutant cell line only a small internal portion of the titin mRNA is deleted. However, western blots, immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that only the N-terminal, approx. 100 kDa central Z-disc portion of the 3 MDa titin protein is expressed, due to the homozygous deletion in the gene. Most importantly, in BHK-21-Bi cells the formation of thick myosin filaments and the assembly of myofibrils are impaired, although sarcomeric proteins are expressed. Lack of thick filament formation and of ordered actin-myosin arrays was confirmed by electron microscopy. Myogenisation induced by transfection with MyoD yielded myofibrils only in myotubes formed from wild type and not from mutant cells, ruling out that a principal failure in myogenic commitment of the BHK-21-Bi cells might cause the observed effects. These experiments provide the first direct evidence for the crucial role of titin in both thick filament formation as a molecular ruler and in the coordination of myofibrillogenesis."

It is a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor with high potency for inducing cell differentiation of cultured murine erythroleukemia cells. Studies with SAHA have primarily been performed with hematopoietic tumor cells. Here we extent these studies with SAHA to human breast cancer cell lines in an attempt to find better therapeutic agents for breast cancer treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435, as well as normal cells, including the normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A, and fibroblasts, were treated with SAHA. Cells assayed for cell survival by using trypan blue exclusion assay, colony formation assay, and cell cycle and apoptosis analysis. The effects of SAHA on cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins were examined by Western blots analysis. The identification of additional target genes was carried out by differential display (DD) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).RESULTS: SAHA inhibited clonogenic growth of MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. These cells were more sensitive to SAHA-mediated cytotoxic effects than normal breast epithelial cells and fibroblasts. The cytotoxic effects of SAHA on breast cancer cells were manifested by G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest and eventual apoptosis. The pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD.fmk, blocked SAHA-induced cell death, DNA laddering, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, indicating the involvement of caspases in SAHA-mediated apoptosis. In addition, SAHA modulated cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins. For example, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 were induced, and retinoblastoma protein pRb was hypophosphorylated. Moreover, SAHA induced several genes associated with differentiation and/ or growth inhibition. These genes encode gelsolin, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase (IDI1), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 up-regulated protein 1 (VDUP1), the last two of which were identified by DD. Induction of these genes may contribute to SAHA-mediated pro-differentiating and antiproliferative effects.CONCLUSIONS: SAHA induced growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and eventual apoptosis in human breast cancer cells, possibly by modulating cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins, such as CDK inhibitors p21 and p27, pRb, and other differentiation and/or growth inhibition-associated genes, including gelsolin, IDI1 and VDUP1. This, together with the low toxicity in normal cells, suggests that SAHA might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of human breast cancers."

In previous work, the effectiveness of mixed replaceable solutions of linear polyacrylamide (LPA) was demonstrated, and 1000 bases were routinely obtained in less than 1 h. Substantially longer read lengths have now been achieved by a combination of improved formulation of LPA mixtures, optimization of temperature and electric field, adjustment of the sequencing reaction, and refinement of the base-caller. The average molar masses of LPA used as DNA separation matrixes were measured by gel permeation chromatography and multiangle laser light scattering. Newly formulated matrixes comprising 0.5% (w/w) 270 kDa and 2% (w/w) 10 or 17 MDa LPA raised the optimum column temperature from 60 to 70 degrees C, increasing the selectivity for large DNA fragments, while maintaining high selectivity for small fragments as well. This improved resolution was further enhanced by reducing the electric field strength from 200 to 125 V/cm. In addition, because sequencing accuracy beyond 1000 bases was diminished by the low signal from G-terminated fragments when the standard reaction protocol for a commercial dye primer kit was used, the amount of these fragments was doubled. Augmenting the base-calling expert system with rules specific for low peak resolution also had a significant effect, contributing slightly less than half of the total increase in read length. With full optimization, this read length reached up to 1300 bases (average 1250) with 98.5% accuracy in 2 h for a single-stranded M13 template."

In the Z-disk, it interacts with alpha-actinin homodimers that are a principal component of the Z-filaments linking actin filaments. The interaction between titin and alpha-actinin involves repeating approximately 45 amino acid sequences (Z-repeats) near the N-terminus of titin and the C-lobe of the C-terminal calmodulin-like domain of alpha-actinin. The conformation of Z-repeat 7 (ZR7) of titin when complexed with the 73-amino acid C-terminal portion of alpha-actinin (EF34) was studied by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy using (15)N-labeling of ZR7 and found to be helical over a stretch of 18 residues. Complex formation resulted in the protection of one site of preferential cleavage of EF34 at Phe14-Leu17, as determined by limited proteolysis experiments coupled to mass spectrometry measurements. Intermolecular NOEs show Val16 of ZR7 to be positioned close in space to the backbone of EF34 around Phe14. These observations suggest that the mode of binding of ZR7 to EF34 is similar to that of troponin I to troponin C and of peptide C20W to calmodulin. These complexes would appear to represent a general alternative binding mode of calmodulin-like domains to target peptides."

Using homology to the rat MTA1 gene we cloned the human MTA1 gene and found it to be overexpressed in a variety of human cell lines. We found a close similarity between the human MTA1 and rat MTA1 genes, as shown by 88% and 96% identities of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences, respectively. Both genes encode novel proteins that contain a proline-rich region (SH3 binding motif), a putative zinc finger motif, a leucine zipper motif, and five copies of the SPXX motif often found in gene regulatory proteins. Using Southern blot analysis, the MTA1 gene was found to be highly conserved among all species examined; and using Northern blot analysis, MTA1 transcripts were found in virtually all cell lines of human origin that were analyzed, including melanoma and breast, cervix and ovarian carcinoma cells and normal breast epithelial cells. However, the expression level of the MTA1 gene in a normal breast epithelial cell was approximately 50% of that found in rapidly growing breast adenocarcinoma cell lines and an atypical mammary cell line. Experimental inhibition of MTA1 protein expression using antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides resulted in growth inhibition of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with relatively high expression of the MTA1 gene. Furthermore, the MTA1 protein was localized in the nuclei of cells transfected using a mammalian expression vector containing the full-length MTA1 gene. The results suggest that the MTA1 protein may function in cellular signaling processes important in the progression and growth of cancer cells, possibly as a nuclear regulatory factor."

Transfection experiments indicated that MCF-7 cells transactivate an exogenous beta2 promoter (-1470/+156) to the same extent as MTSV1.7 breast epithelial cells, which express endogenous RARbeta2. This was true even in the context of replicated chromatin, suggesting a cis-acting rather than a trans-acting defect. Cytosine methylation, a cis-acting DNA modification, has been implicated in RARbeta2 silencing in cancer cells. Upon bisulfite genomic sequencing, we found that 3 CpG sites in the beta2 RARE region were variably methylated in MCF-7 cells but were not methylated in MTSV1.7 cells or in 2 MDA-MB-231 subclones that differed in RARbeta2 expression (high in clone A2, low in clone A4). However, the 5'-UTR region was hypermethylated in clone A4 relative to clone A2 cells. Following 5-azacytidine treatment, RA and trichostatin A markedly induced RARbeta2 expression in MCF-7 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 clone A4 cells. A beta2 RARE reporter construct in which the methylation-susceptible cytosines in the sense strand were replaced by thymine displayed marked loss of activity in a replicated chromatin-dependent manner. We conclude that cytosine methylation contributes to RARbeta2 gene silencing in MCF-7 cells and that methylation of the RARE region may be particularly important. Oncogene (2000) 19, 4066 - 4070."

We investigated the effects of DIM on estrogen-regulated events in human breast cancer cells and found that DIM was a promoter-specific activator of estrogen receptor (ER) function in the absence of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)). DIM weakly inhibited the E(2)-induced proliferation of ER-containing MCF-7 cells and induced proliferation of these cells in the absence of steroid, by approximately 60% of the E(2) response. DIM had little effect on proliferation of ER-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that it is not generally toxic at these concentrations. Although DIM did not bind to the ER in this concentration range, as shown by a competitive ER binding assay, it activated the ER to a DNA-binding species. DIM increased the level of transcripts for the endogenous pS2 gene and activated the estrogen-responsive pERE-vit-CAT and pS2-tk-CAT reporter plasmids in transiently transfected MCF-7 cells. In contrast, DIM failed to activate transcription of the simple E(2)- and diethylstilbesterol-responsive reporter construct pATC2. The estrogen antagonist ICI 182780 (7alpha-[9-[(4,4,5,5, 5-pentafluoropentyl)sulfonyl]nonyl]-estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3, 17beta-diol) was effective against DIM-induced transcriptional activity of the pERE-vit-CAT reporter, which further supports the hypothesis that DIM is acting through the ER. We demonstrated that ligand-independent activation of the ER in MCF-7 cells could be produced following treatment with the D1 dopamine receptor agonist SKF-82958 [(+/-)6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepinehydrobromide].

Experiments were conducted to define the mechanism involved in the regulation of mda-7 expression in differentiating human melanoma cells. The mda-7 gene is actively transcribed in uninduced HO-1 human melanoma cells and the rate of transcription of mda-7 is not significantly enhanced by treatment with IFN-beta, MEZ or IFN-beta+MEZ. The high basal activity of the mda-7 promoter in uninduced melanoma cells and the absence of enhancing effect upon treatment with differentiation inducers is corroborated by transfection studies using the promoter region of mda-7 linked to a luciferase reporter gene containing the SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence. RT - PCR analysis detects the presence of low levels of mda-7 transcripts in uninduced and concomitant increases in differentiation inducer treated HO-1 cells. However, steady-state mda-7 mRNA is detected only in IFN-beta+MEZ and to a lesser degree in MEZ treated cells. We show that induction of terminal differentiation of HO-1 cells with IFN-beta+MEZ dramatically increases the half-life of mda-7 mRNA while treatment with cycloheximide results in detectable mda-7 mRNA in control and inducer treated cells. These observations confirm constitutive activity of the mda-7 promoter in HO-1 cells irrespective of differentiation status suggesting posttranscriptional processes as important determinants of mda-7 expression during terminal differentiation. The 3' UTR region of mda-7 contains AU-rich elements (ARE) that contribute to rapid mda-7 mRNA turnover during proliferation and reversible differentiation, a process controlled by a labile protein factor(s). Substitution of the SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence in the luciferase reporter plasmid with the mda-7-ARE-3'-UTR renders the Luciferase message unstable when expressed in proliferating and reversibly differentiated melanoma cells. In contrast, the luciferase message is stabilized when the mda-7-ARE-3'-UTR construct is expressed in terminally differentiated HO-1 cells. These results provide compelling evidence that mda-7 expression during terminal differentiation in human melanoma cells is regulated predominantly at a posttranscriptional level."

Elevated rates of E(2) hydroxylation at the C-2, -4, -6alpha and -15alpha positions were observed concomitant with the induction of cytochromes P450 1A1 and 1B1. In each cell line, 2- and 4-hydroxyestradiol (2- and 4-OHE(2)) were converted to 2- and 4-methoxyestradiol (2- and 4-MeOE(2)) by the action of catechol O:-methyltransferase. In this study, conjugation of these estrogen metabolites was investigated. A comparison of the levels of metabolites determined with and without prior treatment of the media with a crude beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase preparation showed that most of the 2-MeOE(2) present was in conjugated form, whereas 4-MeOE(2), 6alpha-OHE(2) and 15alpha-OHE(2) were minimally conjugated. Inhibitor studies suggested that it was the sulfatase activity of the preparation that hydrolyzed the 2-MeOE(2) conjugates in MCF-7 cell media; the presence of 2-MeOE(2)-3-sulfate in MCF-7 culture media was confirmed by electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometry. To identify the enzyme catalyzing this conjugation, the expression of mRNAs encoding five sulfotransferases (SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT1A3, SULT1E1 and SULT2A1) was evaluated in the nine cell lines by use of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Only expression of SULT1A1 mRNA correlated with the observed conjugation of nanomolar levels of 2-MeOE(2) in these cell lines. Cloning and sequencing of SULT1A1 cDNA from MCF-7 cells revealed that mRNAs encoding two previously identified allelic variants, SULT1A1*1 ((213)Arg) and SULT1A1*2 ((213)His), were expressed in these cells. Heterologous cDNA-directed expression of either variant in MDA-MB-231 cells, which do not normally express SULT1A1, conferred 2-MeOE(2) sulfonation activity. The SULT1A1 allelic variants were also expressed in SF:9 insect cells, from which post-microsomal supernatants were used to determine K:(m) values of 0.90 +/- 0.12 and 0.81 +/- 0.06 microM for SULT1A1*1 and SULT1A1*2, respectively, with 2-MeOE(2) as substrate. These results show that SULT1A1 is an efficient and selective catalyst of 2-MeOE(2) sulfonation and, as such, may be important in modulating the anticarcinogenic effects of 2-MeOE(2) that have been described recently."

In contrast, only antiestrogens enhanced direct interaction between ER and COUP-TF as assessed by GST pull-down assays. Identical results were obtained using either purified bovine or recombinant human ERalpha. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that ER and COUP-TF interact in extracts from MCF-7 and ERalpha-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells. Here we document that ER ligand impacts COUP-TF-ER interaction. COUP-TF interaction is mediated by the DNA binding and ligand-binding domains of ER. We suggest that changes in ER conformation induced by DNA binding reduce ER-COUP-TF interaction. Transient transfection of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells with a COUP-TFI expression vector repressed E2-induced luciferase reporter gene expression from single or multiple tandem copies of a consensus ERE. COUP-TFI stimulated 4-OHT-induced luciferase activity from a minimal ERE. Alone, COUP-TFI increased transcription from ERE half-sites or a single ERE in a sequence-dependent manner. These data provide evidence that the ERE sequence and its immediate flanking regions influence whether COUP-TF enhances, inhibits, or has no effect on ER ligand-induced ERE reporter gene expression and that COUP-TFI activates gene transcription from ERE half-sites. We suggest that COUP-TFI plays a role in mitigating estrogen-responsive gene expression."

To better define the involvement of these genes in sporadic cancers, we characterized expression levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcripts in cancer cell lines derived from neoplasms of the ovary, prostate, and breast and compared them with those expressed in primary cultures of normal epithelial cells established from these organs. We observed upregulation of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 expression in six of seven ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCA420, OVCA429, OVCA432, ALST, DOV13, and SKOV3) when compared with levels found in normal ovary surface epithelial cells. Furthermore, five cancerous or immortalized prostatic epithelial cell lines (BPH-1, TSU-Pr1, LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145) also expressed higher levels of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mRNA than did primary cultures of normal prostatic epithelial cells. In contrast, only the estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cell line overexpressed these messages, whereas the estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines Hs578T, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 showed no change in expression levels when compared with normal breast epithelial cells. In addition, expanding on our recent identification of a novel BRCA2 transcript variant carrying an in-frame exon 12 deletion (BRCA2 delta 12), we report increased expression of this variant in several ovarian, prostate, and mammary cancer cell lines (OVCA420, OVCA433, ALST, DOV13, SKOV3, TSU-Pr1, DU145, and MDA-MB-468). Most notably, high levels of BRCA2 delta 12 mRNA were detected in an estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, and in an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, DU-145. Interestingly, the wild-type BRCA2 transcript was barely detectable in DU145, which could be used as a model system for future investigations on BRCA2 delta 12 function. Taken together, our data suggest disruption of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene expression in certain epithelial cancer cell lines of the ovary, prostate, and breast. Because wild-type BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene products increase during cell-cycle progression and are believed to exert growth-inhibitory action, enhanced expression of these genes in cancer cells may represent a negative feedback mechanism for curbing proliferation in fast-growing cells. At present, the functionality of BRCA2 delta 12 remains elusive."

Temporal subtraction hybridization combined with random clone selection, reverse Northern hybridization, high throughput microchip cDNA array screening, and serial cDNA library arrays permit the identification and cloning of genes that are differentially expressed during proliferative arrest and terminal differentiation in human melanoma cells. A specific melanoma differentiation associated (mda) gene, mda-7, exhibits reduced expression as a function of melanoma progression from melanocyte to metastatic melanoma. In contrast, treatment of metastatic melanoma cells with IFN-beta + MEZ results in expression of mda-7 mRNA and protein. To evaluate the mechanism underlying the differential expression of mda-7 as a function of melanoma progression and induction of growth arrest and differentiation in human melanoma cells the promoter region of this gene has been isolated from a human placental genomic library and characterized. Sequence analysis by GCG identifies multiple recognition sites for the AP-1 and C/EBP transcription factors. Employing a heterologous mda-7 luciferase gene reporter system, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of either AP-1/cJun or C/EBP can significantly enhance expression of the mda-7 promoter in melanoma cells. In contrast, a dominant negative mutant of cJun, TAM67, is devoid of promoter-enhancing ability. Western blot analyses reveals that cJun and the C/EBP family member C/EBP-beta are physiologically relevant transcription factors whose expression corresponds with mda-7 mRNA expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) performed using nuclear protein extracts from terminally differentiated human melanoma cells document binding to regions of the mda-7 promoter that correspond to consensus binding sites for AP-1 and C/EBP. These results provide further mechanistic insights into the regulation of the mda-7 gene during induction of terminal cell differentiation in human melanoma cells."

We examined the expression and structure of these receptors on primary and cultured breast carcinoma cell lines and normal breast epithelial cells. We also tested the antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo of a fusion protein comprised of circular permuted IL-4 and truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin, termed IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight different primary cell cultures and cell lines of human breast carcinomas were examined for the expression of IL-4R by radiolabeled binding, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern analyses, and subunit structure by crosslinking studies. The antitumor activity of IL-4 toxin was tested in vitro by cytotoxicity assays and in vivo in a xenograft model in immunodeficient animals.RESULTS: 125I-IL-4 specifically bound to primary cell cultures and cell lines with a Kd ranging between 0.2 and 1 nM. Breast tumor cells were found to express IL-4R beta and IL-13R alpha' chains, but not IL-2R gamma c chain. These cells were highly sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL. The IC50 (concentration inhibiting protein synthesis by 50%) ranged between approximately 0.005-1.5 nM. A normal breast epithelial cell culture was not sensitive to the cytotoxic activity of IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL. MDA-MB231 human breast carcinoma cell line formed a rapidly growing tumor in nude mice. Intratumor and intraperitoneal administration of IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL caused a dose dependent regression of established tumors. A control toxin, anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38KDEL, targeted to the IL-2 receptor alpha chain did not cause regression of these tumors.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL may be a useful agent for targeting of IL-4 receptor positive human breast carcinomas and further studies should be performed to explore fully its potential."

Several fatty acids from four classes of dietary fats were tested for their ability to mediate the transcriptional activity of PPARgamma in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells using growth media with minimal serum. Whereas omega-3 fatty acids inhibit transactivation of PPARgamma to levels below control, omega-6, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids stimulate the activity of the transcriptional reporter. These studies indicate that individual fatty acids differentially regulate the transcriptional activity of PPARgamma by selectively acting as agonists or antagonists. Furthermore, the transcriptional activation of PPARgamma correlates with cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells. Understanding the effects of individual fats on breast cancer cells and PPARgamma transactivation could provide important new insights into the epidemiology of breast cancer and the role of dietary fat."

In an attempt to limit the toxic effects on normal tissues, we constructed a recombinant adenoviral vector, Adgfa2TK, in which the HSV-TK gene is driven by the promoter for the gene encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein, an intermediate filament protein expressed primarily in astrocytes. Infection by Adgfa2TK of a glial cell line (C6) and a non-glial cell line (MDA-MB-231) revealed markedly increased expression of HSV-TK in glial cells as determined by Western blot. In comparison, high HSV-TK protein levels were produced in both cell lines after infection with a control virus, AdCMVTK, in which the constitutive cytomegalovirus viral promoter was used to direct HSV-TK expression. Infection of two glial cell lines (C6, U251) and two non-glial cell lines (HepG2, MDA-MB-231) with Adgfa2TK followed by GCV treatment revealed high toxicity in glial cell lines (50% growth inhibitory concentration: &lt;2 microg/mL of GCV) with little or no toxicity (50% growth inhibitory concentration: &gt;75 microg/mL) in the non-glial cell lines.

The HDQ-P1 cells have been grown in culture for over 115 passages and have a doubling time of 60 hours. Characterization of the cell line was performed. This included morphology by light and transmission electron microscopy, karyotype, growth rate, telomerase expression, tumor antigen expression, xenograft implantation into nude mice, colony formation in soft agar, TP53 sequencing, and gene copy number of C-MYC, C-ERBB-2, and C-H-RAS oncogenes. The epithelial nature of this cell line was confirmed by ultrastructural analysis, expression of cytokeratins, and epithelial membrane antigen. The HDQ-P1 cells possess an extensively rearranged and polyploid karyotype, with an average of 20 recurrent marker chromosomes. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that both primary tumor and HDQ-P1 cells were estrogen- and progesterone-receptor negative. The HDQ-P1 cells had the same expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase as other established breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3, and MCF-7. Direct DNA sequencing showed a point mutation which yielded to a stop codon at the amino acid 213 in exon 6 of the TP53 gene. A five-fold amplification of C-MYC was observed in HDQ-P1 cells. No amplification of C-ERBB-2 and C-H-RAS genes were observed. This cell line presents unique characteristics and may prove to be a good experimental model for investigating breast cancer biology."

We have previously observed that QR is up-regulated by the antiestrogen trans-hydroxytamoxifen in breast cancer cells. QR gene regulation by the antiestrogen-occupied estrogen receptor (ER) is mediated by the EpRE-containing region of the human QR gene, and the ER is one of the complex of proteins that binds to the EpRE. In an effort to further understand the mechanism for ER regulation of QR gene we identified other protein factors that regulate QR gene transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells. One of these protein factors, hPMC2 (human homolog of Xenopus gene which prevents mitotic catastrophe), directly binds to the EpRE and interacts with the ER in yeast genetic screening and in vitro assays. Interestingly hPMC2 interacts more strongly to ER beta when compared with ER alpha. In transient transfection assays using reporter constructs containing the EpRE, hPMC2 alone can slightly activate reporter in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The activation of QR gene activity by hPMC2 is enhanced in the presence of ER beta."

Treatment of MCF7 cells with oligonucleotide 4259 at a concentration of 600 nM for 20 hr decreased bcl-xL mRNA and protein levels by more than 80% and 50%, respectively. This resulted in the induction of apoptosis characterized by mitochondrial cytochrome c release, decrease of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and the appearance of condensed nuclei in approximately 40% of cells.

Each of these cell lines, MDA-MB-453, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, displays different phenotypic characteristics ranging from poorly to highly tumorigenic and metastatic. The differences in gene expression profiles of these cell lines generated by differential display technique should allow one to identify candidates as putative oncogenes or tumor/metastasis suppressor genes. A novel cDNA expressed in the highly tumorigenic and metastatic cell line, MDA-MB-435, was identified and isolated by this approach. The function for this gene, designated ALP56 (aspartic-like protease 56 kDa), in tumor progression is suggested by the homology of the encoded protein to aspartic proteases, such as cathepsin D. The amino acid residues in two catalytic domains of this family are highly conserved in those domains of ALP56. Northern hybridization indicated that the expression of ALP56 is associated with growth and metastasis of MDA-MB-435 tumors in immunodeficient mice. In situ hybridization of biopsies from breast cancer and colon cancer patients indicated that ALP56 is upregulated in human primary tumors and liver metastasis.

In this study, we investigated the alteration of Mdm2 and p53 in three human cancer cell lines containing either a wild-type or mutant p53 gene after treatment with Adriamycin (doxorubicin, ADR), a DNA damaging agent. We found that human breast cancer MCF-7 cells containing wild-type p53 were much more susceptible to ADR compared to human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and human prostate cancer Du-145 cells which contain mutant p53. ADR resulted in a significant dose-dependent accumulation of p53 protein in MCF-7 cells, whereas little or no influence was observed on p53 protein of the two mutant p53 cell lines. However, a significant down-regulation of Mdm2 at protein and mRNA levels was observed in these three cell lines following ADR treatment. Moreover, the decrease of Mdm2 was in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. It is interestingly noted that 5 microM is a critical dose for significant down-regulation of the Mdm2 protein. Selected proteasome inhibitors did not rescue the ADR-caused decline in the expression of Mdm2 protein. Therefore, our present results reveal that ADR can induce a down-regulation of Mdm2 via a p53-independent pathway in human cancer cells and the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation mechanism may not be involved in the decreased expression of Mdm2 protein."

The EWS-FLI1 transcript could not be identified with reverse transcription-PCR in any of the 13 E1A-transfected cell lines analyzed. Furthermore, the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein could not be detected by Western blot analysis in E1A-transfected cell lines.

This sequence, lying between nucleotides -3258 to -3157, seems to be critical for inhibition of ER gene transcription. In fact, the selected sequence in the form of double-stranded DNA has been introduced into ER-negative breast cancer cells as 'decoy' cis elements showing the ability to remove the putative negative transcription factor(s) and to induce the reactivation of ER gene transcription. In addition, in transient transfection assays the selected sequence decreased the SV-40 promoted luciferase activity. Gel shift assays identified multiple DNA-protein interactions which specifically form in this region, and data from Southwestern experiments strongly suggested the presence of a specific protein expressed in MDA-MB-231 ER-negative, but not in MCF7 ER-positive cells."

Although reporter proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) and beta-galactosidase have improved the tracking of tumor cells in vivo, their measurement has often been limited to visual observation and manual counting. In this study, we exploited the highly sensitive and objective quantitation provided by flow cytometry to characterize, in detail, the sequence of events associated with orthotopic metastasis in a highly aggressive mouse model. Following stable transfection of the MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cell line with GFP, we utilized an in vivo selection process to isolate a variant exhibiting increased primary tumor growth and metastasis. As few as one fluorescent tumor cell per 200,000 host cells could be accurately detected in dissociated tissues by flow cytometry, allowing us to demonstrate that metastatic cells migrate to the lungs of SCID mice very early after orthotopic implantation. Tumor burden in lungs increased in a smooth continuous manner, until death approximately eight weeks later. Levels of circulating tumor cells in blood were also detectable at an early timepoint, but remained relatively low throughout the course of secondary tumor development in the lungs. Surgical removal of the primary tumor at various times after inoculation significantly affected lung tumor burden, supporting the concept that circulating tumor cells in blood inefficiently initiate distal metastases. Furthermore, the continuing contribution to metastasis by the primary tumor was independent of tumor mass. The combined characteristics of enhanced orthotopic metastasis and quantitative detection in blood and tissues will make this a useful new model for the characterization of the multi-stage progression of cancer, and the preclinical evaluation of anti-neoplastic therapies."

Infection was combined with low-dose (1.4 - 3.7 Gy) irradiation to see if this would improve transduction efficiency and enhance numbers of cells killed. Transduction with either vector resulted in expression of p21WAF1/cip1 and growth inhibition, although Ad5CMV-p53 transduction produced greater growth inhibition than did Ad5CMV-p21. The cell lines differed in sensitivity to the vectors. The Ad5CMV-p53 vector in a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 125 resulted in 50% to 80% inhibition of MDA-MB-231, while MOI 250 of the same vector resulted in 27% inhibition of MDA-MB-435. Infection with Ad5CMV-p21 produced modest growth inhibition in both cell lines (&lt; or = 40% at MOI 200), although protein expression was detected at lower viral doses. Low dose gamma-irradiation (1.4 to 3.7 Gy) was used to try and improve the rate of gene transfer. Modest increases in transduction efficiency and duration of expression of a vector containing beta-galactosidase occurred in irradiated breast cancer cells. Radiation 24 hr before transduction with Ad5CMV-p53 increased the proportions of apoptotic MDA-MB-231 cells. The cells transduced with Ad5CMV-p21 were arrested in G1, yet when they were irradiated before adenoviral transduction, the overexpression of p21 protected the cells from the cytotoxic effects of the radiation. Clonogenic assays showed that Ad5CMV-p21 reduced the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 to VP-16 and paclitaxel.

In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was used for mapping of the cleavage site to AQVD274 downward arrow G, which does not correspond to a conventional caspase cleavage site. The absence of HsRad51 cleavage in staurosporine-treated apoptotic MCF-7 cells, which lack caspase-3, indicates that caspase-3 is essential for HsRad51 cleavage in vivo. Cleavage into the 33-kDa fragment was generated by recombinant caspase-3 and -7 in in vitro translated wild type HsRad51, but not in the HsRad51 AQVE274 downward arrow G mutant. Similarly, HsRad51 of Jurkat cell extracts was cleaved into the 33-kDa product by recombinant caspase-3, whereas caspase-7 failed to cleave endogenous HsRad51. The cleavage of in vitro translated wild type and AQVE274 downward arrow G mutant HsRad51 as well as of endogenous HsRad51 also gave rise to a smaller fragment, which corresponds in size to a recently reported DVLD187 downward arrow N HsRad51 cleavage product. In Jurkat cell extracts, the AQVD274 downward arrow G and DVLD187 downward arrow N cleavage products of HsRad51 appeared at equal concentrations of caspase-3.

Our previous studies have shown that genistein exerts multiple suppressive effects on both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) as well as estrogen receptor negative (ER-) human breast carcinoma lines suggesting that the mechanisms of these effects may be independent of ER pathways. In the present study however we provide evidence that in the ER+ MCF-7, T47D and 549 lines but not in the ER-MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 lines both presumed &quot;ER-dependent&quot; and &quot;ER-independent&quot; actions of genistein are mediated through ER pathways. Genistein's antiproliferative effects are estrogen dependent in these ER+ lines, being more pronounced in estrogen-containing media and in the presence of exogenous 17-beta estradiol. Genistein also inhibits the expression of ER-downstream genes including pS2 and TGF-beta in these ER+ lines and this inhibition is also dependent on the presence of estrogen. Genistein inhibits estrogen-induced protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. Genistein is only a weak transcriptional activator and actually decreases ERE-CAT levels induced by 17-beta estradiol in the ER+ lines. Genistein also decreases steady state ER mRNA only in the presence of estrogen in the ER+ lines thereby manifesting another suppression of and through the ER pathway. Our observations resurrect the hypothesis that genistein functions as a &quot;good estrogen&quot; in ER+ breast carcinomas. Since chemopreventive effects of genistein would be targeted to normal ER-positive ductal-lobular cells of the breast, this &quot;good estrogen&quot; action of genistein is most relevant to our understanding of chemoprevention."

MDGI and an 11 amino acid MDGI-derived conserved C-terminal peptide (P108) inhibits growth of normal mammary epithelial cells in tissue and organ culture, but fails to inhibit proliferation of many breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Here, the effects of peptide P108 on tumor growth of MCF-7, MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cell lines in nude mice were tested. To deliver P108 into tumors, a novel peptide production system was applied for expression and secretion of small bioactive peptides in mammalian cells. Functional differentiation was observed in MCF-7 and MDA-MB468 cells upon P108 expression. In addition, EGF-dependent colony formation in soft agar by MDA-MB468 cells was inhibited by secreted P108. Tumor growth in athymic nude mice was suppressed in all three cell lines tested. Furthermore, P108 expressed by MCF-7/P108 cells caused paracrine tumor growth inhibition of MDA-MB231 cells. These results indicate that breast cancer inhibition by P108 is independent of binding to hydrophobic ligands and is perhaps mediated by interference with EGF-dependent signaling pathways."

We therefore hypothesized that molecular pathways in our model system reflect common alterations responsible for the progression of a subset of human prostate cancer. Progression to androgen independence has been hypothesized to be largely associated with impairment of the regulation of cell growth or apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Therefore, in this study, we examined molecular markers known or suspected to be important in prostate cancer progression and key regulators of cell growth and apoptosis: p53, p21WAF1/CIP1, Bcl-2, Bax, retinoblastoma (Rb), and p16INK4A/MITS1. We analyzed the expression of these markers in the cell lines, their tumor of origin, and tumors derived from the cell lines by s.c. inoculation into nude mice. DNA sequencing of the entire open reading frames of the p53 and p21 genes revealed no mutations. Additionally, accumulation of the p53 protein was not found by Western blot analysis, nor was overexpression of the Bcl-2 oncoprotein detected. Bax expression was detected in MDA PCa 2a cells, whereas it was absent in MDA PCa 2b. Rb and p16 protein expression was normal as measured by both Western blot and immunochemical analyses. Immunohistochemical studies of p53, p21, Bcl-2, and Rb in both samples from the original human cancer from which the lines were derived and mouse xenografts derived from the lines revealed similar levels of protein. These results are consistent with reports indicating that 40-50% of bone metastases of prostate cancer have wild-type p53, 50-70% do not overexpress the Bcl-2 protein, and mutations in the p21 gene are rare. Therefore, we conclude that MDA PCa 2a and MDA PCa 2b reflect molecular pathways in a common subset of human androgen-independent prostate cancer and that important molecular players in apoptosis (namely, p53 and Bcl-2) seem to be intact in this subset of androgen-independent prostate cancer. Understanding the signal-transduction pathways operating in these cell lines may help to identify therapeutic targets for prostate cancer."

Up to 968 bp upstream of the putative c-specific translation initiation start codon and several serial deletion mutants were subcloned into a reporter vector and transfected into endothelial (BAEC, EA.hy926, ECV304) and epithelial (MDA MB435S, MCF7) cells, showing very strong promoter activity in comparison to the SV40 promoter and to the previously described ECE-1a and 1b promoters.

The real-time quantification of the polymerase chain reaction products is based on the TaqMan 5' nuclease assay. The optimal experimental conditions we determined were as follows: 6 mM MgCl2, 200 nM of fluorogenic probe, 200 nM of each primer, and 12.5 units MuLV reverse transcriptase. The GAPDH housekeeping gene was used for normalization of c-erbB-2 expression. In human breast cancer cell lines, the normalized expression of c-erbB-2 ranged from 8 x 10(-6) to 2,600 x 10(-6), the two highest values corresponding to the c-erbB-2 overexpressing cells MDA-MB-453 and SK-BR-3. In a series of 100 breast cancer samples, c-erbB-2 normalized expression was found to range from 0.4 x 10(-6) to 350 x 10(-6).

Whereas the inactive centromeres in L929 cells replicate their pericentric heterochromatin earlier than that associated with the active centromeres, those in MDA 435 cells exhibited no strong correlation between early separation and replication. A comparison between the intragenomic patterns of separation with replication of only active centromeres showed that the former is not dependent upon the latter in either L929 cells or MDA 435 cells. These studies indicate that, whereas inactive centromeres in neoplastic cells separate prematurely in different species, there is no uniformity in the control for replication nor does the timing of separation depend upon the timing of replication of the centric region."

Here we describe the isolation of a cell-free system from meiotic yeast cells that catalyses joint-molecule formation in vitro. The active components in the system required ATP and homologous DNA and operated in both 0.5 and 13 mM MgCl(2). When the cell-free system was prepared from rad51/rad51 and rad52/rad52 mutants and joint-molecule formation was assayed at 0.5 mM MgCl(2), the specific activity decreased to 6% and 13.8% respectively of the wild-type level. However, when the same mutant extracts were premixed, joint-molecule formation increased 4-8-fold, i.e. the mutant extracts exhibited complementation in vitro. These results demonstrated that Rad51p and Rad52p were required for optimal joint-molecule formation at 0.5 mM MgCl(2). Intriguingly, however, Rad51p and Rad52p seemed to be more dispensable at higher concentrations of MgCl(2) (13 mM). Further purification of the responsible activity has proven problematical, but it did flow through a sizing column as a single peak (molecular mass 1.2 MDa) that was co-eluted with Rad51p and RFA, the eukaryotic single-stranded DNA-binding protein. All of these characteristics are consistent with the known properties of the reaction in vivo and suggest that the new cell-free system will be suitable for purifying enzymes involved in homologous recombination."

Genetic alterations in hepatocarcinomas and a few breast cancers suggest that this receptor behaves as a tumor suppressor. Moreover, hypersecretion and Man-6-P-independent targeting of cathepsins in breast and ovarian carcinomas also suggest alterations in this receptor. We studied the Man-6-P/IGFII receptor gene in 8 ovarian carcinomas, and 4 breast- and ovarian-cancer cell lines. The results confirmed a frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the 6q27-qter region in 5 out of 8 ovarian carcinomas. We used 23 overlapping RT-PCR fragments to sequence the whole coding region of the Man-6-P/IGFII receptor. The 2491 amino-acid sequence of this receptor was perfectly conserved in 9 out of 10 of our samples, including MCF7 and MDA-MB231 cells and 5 ovarian carcinomas with LOH. This allowed us to rectify the 2 previously published sequences which differed in several bases, and to propose a consensus amino-acid sequence. The only amino-acid change (Thr --&gt; Ala) was in BG1 ovarian-cancer cells, and was due to an A-to-G substitution on one allele at nucleotide 2561. We found no bi-allelic alterations in the 9 ovarian carcinomas, but 3 silent nucleotide substitutions leading to a lower cordon usage in 2 ovarian carcinomas with LOH. No mutation of the Man-6-P/IGFII receptor coding sequence was found in breast-cancer cell lines to explain the cathepsin-D hypersecretion and Man-6-P-independent trafficking described. We propose that, in breast and ovarian cancers, the frequent loss of one allele, associated with over-expression of some of its ligands, might be sufficient to saturate the receptor protein, displace the ligands to other sites, and consequently facilitate tumor progression."

Recently, the Ccr4 and Caf1 proteins, required for non-fermentative gene expression, were found to be associated with the five Not proteins in 1.2 and 2 MDa Ccr4-Not complexes. These Ccr4-Not complexes, as many other global regulators of transcription, appear to regulate transcription both positively and negatively in vivo. To further characterize the activity of Not1p, the only essential known protein of the Ccr4-Not complex, and determine whether it can act directly as a transcriptional repressor, we established an in vitro transcription system in which the HIS3 TATA-less promoter can be efficiently transcribed. We demonstrate that transcription from the HIS3 TATA-less promoter can be specifically increased in vitro by preparing nuclear extracts from a conditional mutant of the NOT1 gene and analyzing transcription after shifting the nuclear extracts to the restrictive temperature. This result is the first demonstration that one of the Not proteins directly represses transcription. Moreover, it now defines an experimental system in which TATA-less transcription initiation and repression by the Ccr4-Not complex can be studied further."

PCOs contain two oligonucleotide segments attached through their 3'-3'- or 5'-5'-ends. One of the segments of the PCO is an antisense oligo complementary to a target mRNA, and the other is a short protective oligo that is 5-8 nucleotides long and complementary to the 3'- or 5'-end of the antisense oligo. As a result of complementarity between the antisense and protective oligo segments, PCOs form intramolecular pseudo-cyclic structures in the absence of the target RNA. The antisense oligo segment of PCOs used for the studies described here is complementary to an 18-nucleotide-long site on the mRNA of the protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIalpha (PKA-RIalpha). Thermal melting studies of PCOs in the absence and presence of the complementary RNA suggest that the pseudo-cyclic structures formed in the absence of the target RNA dissociate, bind to the target RNA, and form heteroduplexes. The results of RNase H cleavage assays suggest that PCOs bind to complementary RNA and activate RNase H in a manner similar to that of an 18-mer conventional antisense PS-oligo. In snake venom (a 3'-exonuclease) or spleen (a 5'-exonuclease) phosphodiesterase digestion studies, PCOs are more stable than conventional antisense oligos because of the presence of 3'-3'- or 5'-5'-linkages and the formation of intramolecular pseudo-cyclic structures. PCOs with a phosphorothioate antisense oligo segment inhibited cell growth of MDA-MB-468 and GEO cancer cell lines similar to that of the conventional antisense PS-oligo, suggesting efficient cellular uptake and target binding. The nuclease stability studies in mice suggest that PCOs have higher in vivo stability than antisense PS-oligos. The studies in mice showed similar pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution profiles for PCOs to those of antisense PS-oligos in general, but rapid elimination from selected tissues."

To evaluate the effect of PDT and PDT combined with ADM the intensity of lipid peroxidation in tumor tissue and in blood serum was determined using the thiobarbituric acid assay. PDT induces an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in tumor tissue as well as in blood serum. When PDT is combined with ADM, the MDA level in tumor tissue is similar to the level of this product as in the PDT alone. No enhancement of the efficiency of the combined treatment was observed at these experimental conditions. This is also confirmed by the tumor growth dynamics, survival time of animals and flow cytometric DNA analysis of tumor cells. For the successful combination of PDT with chemotherapy it is suggested to apply the drugs at the regimen which will allow to avoid the interaction between two agents since the ground state interaction between PH and ADM is stated spectroscopically. It should lead to the conclusion that the sequence of the combination of two treatment modalities is an important factor for synergistic effect."

Patients with ER-positive breast tumors are likely to respond to hormonal therapies, while ER-negative breast cancers are resistant to endocrine therapies. Most ER-negative tumors do not express detectable levels of ER transcript, highlighting the importance of transcriptional regulation. A novel regulatory element which resembles a steroid hormone response element has been identified in the 5'-flanking region of the human ER gene. We observed 3- to 5-fold higher specific binding to this element in nuclear extracts from ER-expressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells compared to ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells. We termed the factor(s) which bind to this cis-element estrogen receptor upstream binding factor-1 (ERUBF-1). In transient transfection assays in MCF-7 cells, the ERUBF-1 binding site elicited a 20-fold increase in luciferase activity over the ER P1, promoter.

The sensitivity of TbetaR-II transfectants to exogenous as well as endogenous TGF-beta1 was increased distinctly compared with control transfectant.

An increasing number of evidence links defects in chromatin remodeling machinery and cancer. Our aim is to elucidate the role of chromatin structure in the control of the expression of hormone-induced genes in breast cell lines estrogen-dependent or -independent for growth. Mammary tumor growth is controlled by steroid hormones via their nuclear receptor and by growth factors via tyrosine kinase receptors. 50 % of these tumors elude to hormonal control. This limits the anti-estrogen therapy. As a model, we have analyzed in several cell lines the chromatin organization of the regulatory regions of two genes, pS2 that is associated with a good prognostic, and cathepsin D (catD) that is a bad prognostic marker. The expression of the two genes is estrogen-regulated in estrogen-dependent cell line MCF7. In contrast in the hormone-independent cell line MDA MB 231, pS2 is not expressed and catD is constitutively expressed. Within the regulatory regions of pS2 gene, we have localized two regions that undergo a hormone-dependent change in chromatin structure in MCF7 cells but not in MDA MB 231. The lack of chromatin remodeling in MDA MB 231 cells is not due to the absence of expression of the estrogen receptor in the cell line. The expression of pS2 gene can be correlated with chromatin remodeling over the regulatory regions of pS2 gene. In contrast catD regulatory regions did not display hormone-dependent changes in chromatin structure, suggesting that hormone regulation takes place within regions with a constitutively open chromatin structure."
