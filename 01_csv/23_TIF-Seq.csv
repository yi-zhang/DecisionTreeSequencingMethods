To study this transcriptional heterogeneity, we developed transcript isoform sequencing (TIF-seq), a method that allows the genome-wide profiling of full-length transcript isoforms defined by their exact 5' and 3' boundaries. TIF-seq entails the generation of full-length cDNA libraries, followed by their circularization and the sequencing of the junction fragments spanning the 5' and 3' transcript ends. By determining the respective co-occurrence of start and end sites of individual transcript molecules, TIF-seq can distinguish variations that conventional approaches for mapping single ends cannot, such as short abortive transcripts, bicistronic messages and overlapping transcripts that differ in lengths. The TIF-seq protocol we describe here can be applied to any eukaryotic organism (e.g., yeast, human), and it requires 6-10 d for generating TIF-seq libraries, 10 d for sequencing and 2-3 d for analysis."
"24256270";"TIF-Seq";"TIF-Seq";"Biochemical Society transactions";0;2013;"Understanding non-coding DNA regions in yeast.";"Non-coding transcripts play an important role in gene expression regulation in all species, including budding and fission yeast. Such regulatory transcripts include intergenic ncRNA (non-coding RNA), 5' and 3' UTRs, introns and antisense transcripts. In the present review, we discuss advantages and limitations of recently developed sequencing techniques, such as ESTs, DNA microarrays, RNA-Seq (RNA sequencing), DRS (direct RNA sequencing) and TIF-Seq (transcript isoform sequencing). We provide an overview of methods applied in yeast and how each of them has contributed to our knowledge of gene expression regulation and transcription."
