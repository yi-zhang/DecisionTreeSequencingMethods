The miR-302-367 promoter is functional during embryonic development but is turned off in later stages. Motivated by the cancer stem cell hypothesis, we explored the potential expression of miR-302 in brain tumor cell lines.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present experimental study, we have tried to expand our knowledge on the expression pattern and functionality of miR302 cluster by quantifying its expression in a series of glioma (A-172, 1321N1, U87MG) and medulloblastoma (DAOY) cell lines. To further assess the functionality of miR-302 in these cell lines, we cloned its promoter core region upstream of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or luciferase encoding genes.RESULTS: Our data demonstrated a very low expression of miR-302 in glioma cell lines, compared with that of embryonal carcinoma cell line NT2 being used as a positive control. The expression of miR-302 promoter-EGFP construct in the aforementioned cell lines demonstrated GFP expression in a rare subpopulation of the cells. Serum deprivation led to the generation of tumorospheres, enrichment of miR-302 positive cells and upregulation of a number of pluripotency genes.CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggest that miR-302 could potentially be used as a novel putative cancer stem cell marker to identify and target cancer stem cells within tumor tissues."

Airborne fungi have been suggested as an etiologic factor of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between airborne fungi and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in nasal fibroblasts.METHODS: Primary nasal polyp fibroblasts were cultured with Alternaria and Aspergillus for 48h. To determine the production of chemical mediators interleukine-6 (IL-6), IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), eotaxin, and regulated on activation normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) were measured with enzyme immunoassay methods. PRRs for toll-like receptors (TLRs) and protease-activated receptors (PARs) mRNA were determined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To determine the role of PRRs, fibroblasts were treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA).RESULTS: IL-6 and IL-8 productions were significantly increased by 50 and 100μg/ml of Alternaria. However, GM-CSF, eotaxin, and RANTES productions did not change. Aspergillus did not influence the production of chemical mediators from nasal polyp fibroblasts. TLR2 and TLR5 mRNA expressions were significantly increased by fungi and these two TLRs were associated with the production of IL-6 and IL-8.CONCLUSION: Alternaria interacts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern with the PRRs, such as TLR2 and TLR5, which induce the production of inflammatory chemical mediators from nasal polyp fibroblasts. Airborne fungi enhance the innate immune defense mechanism and may be associated with the pathogenesis of nasal inflammatory diseases."

A 73-year-old male patient with typical Fuchs' Uveitis Syndrome (FUS) first experienced heterochromia of the left eye at the age fourteen, when rubella was endemic in the US.OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this report are to describe the patient's FUS clinical presentations and to characterize the virus detected in the vitreous fluid.STUDY DESIGN: The patient underwent a therapeutic pars plana vitrectomy in May 2013. A real-time RT-PCR assay for rubella virus was performed on the vitreous fluid by Focus Diagnostics. Additional real-time RT-PCR assays for rubella virus detection and RT-PCR assays for generation of templates for sequencing were performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).RESULTS: The results from Focus Diagnostics were positive for rubella virus RNA. Real-time RT-PCR assays at CDC were also positive for rubella virus. A rubella virus sequence of 739 nucleotides was determined and phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus was the sole member of a new phylogenetic group when compared to reference virus sequences.CONCLUSIONS: While FUS remains a clinical diagnosis, findings in this case support the association between rubella virus and the disease. Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence that this rubella virus was likely a previously undetected genotype which is no longer circulating. Since the patient had rubella prior to 1955, this sequence is from the earliest rubella virus yet characterized."

We aimed to determine the extent to which elevated peripheral cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) expression: (1) characterizes a subgroup of people with schizophrenia and (2) shows a relationship to cognition, brain volume and/or symptoms. Forty-three outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and matched healthy controls were assessed for peripheral cytokine mRNAs (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-18), intelligence quotient, memory and verbal fluency, symptom severity and cortical brain volumes integral to language (that is, Broca's and Wernicke's areas). IL-1β mRNA levels were 28% increased in schizophrenia compared with controls (t(82)=2.64, P&lt;0.01). Using a two-step clustering procedure, we identified a subgroup of people displaying relatively elevated cytokine mRNA levels (17/43 people with schizophrenia and 9/42 controls). Individuals with schizophrenia in the elevated cytokine subgroup performed significantly worse than the low-cytokine subgroup on verbal fluency (F(1,40)=15.7, P&lt;0.001). There was a 17% volume reduction of the left pars opercularis (POp) (Broca's area) in patients with elevated cytokines compared with patients with lower cytokines (F(1,29)=9.41, P=0.005). Negative linear relationships between IL-1β mRNA levels and both verbal fluency and left POp volume were found in schizophrenia. This study is among the first to link blood biomarkers of inflammation with both cognitive deficits and brain volume reductions in people with schizophrenia, supporting that those with elevated cytokines represent a neurobiologically meaningful subgroup. These findings raise the possibility that targeted anti-inflammatory treatments may ameliorate cognitive and brain morphological abnormalities in some people with schizophrenia.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 21 July 2015; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.90."

However, most secondary structure prediction tools that incorporate probing data are designed and optimized for particular types of experiments. For example, RNAstructure-Fold is optimized for SHAPE data, while SeqFold is optimized for PARS data. Here, we report a new RNA secondary structure prediction method, restrained MaxExpect (RME), which can incorporate multiple types of experimental probing data and is based on a free energy model and an MEA (maximizing expected accuracy) algorithm. We first demonstrated that RME substantially improved secondary structure prediction with perfect restraints (base pair information of known structures). Next, we collected structure-probing data from diverse experiments (e.g. SHAPE, PARS and DMS-seq) and transformed them into a unified set of pairing probabilities with a posterior probabilistic model. By using the probability scores as restraints in RME, we compared its secondary structure prediction performance with two other well-known tools, RNAstructure-Fold (based on a free energy minimization algorithm) and SeqFold (based on a sampling algorithm). For SHAPE data, RME and RNAstructure-Fold performed better than SeqFold, because they markedly altered the energy model with the experimental restraints. For high-throughput data (e.g. PARS and DMS-seq) with lower probing efficiency, the secondary structure prediction performances of the tested tools were comparable, with performance improvements for only a portion of the tested RNAs. However, when the effects of tertiary structure and protein interactions were removed, RME showed the highest prediction accuracy in the DMS-accessible regions by incorporating in vivo DMS-seq data."

First, we investigated whether a prolonged l-DOPA treatment differentially affected ERK signaling in medium spiny neurons of the direct pathway (dMSNs) and in cholinergic aspiny interneurons (ChIs) and assessed the role of Ras-GRF1 in both subpopulations. Second, using viral-assisted technology, we probed Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 as potential targets in this pathway. We investigated how selective blockade of striatal Ras-GRF1 or Ras-GRF2 expression impacted on LID (induction, maintenance, and reversion) and its neurochemical correlates.METHODS: We used both Ras-GRF1 knockout mice and lentiviral vectors (LVs) delivering short-hairpin RNA sequences (shRNAs) to obtain striatum-specific gene knockdown of Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2. The consequences of these genetic manipulations were evaluated in the 6-hydroxydopamine mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Escalating doses of l-DOPA were administered and then behavioral analysis with immunohistochemical assays and in vivo microdialysis were performed.RESULTS: Ras-GRF1 was found essential in controlling ERK signaling in dMSNs, but its ablation did not prevent ERK activation in ChIs. Moreover, striatal injection of LV-shRNA/Ras-GRF1 attenuated dyskinesia development and ERK-dependent signaling, whereas LV-shRNA/Ras-GRF2 was without effect, ruling out the involvement of Ras-GRF2 in LID expression. Accordingly, Ras-GRF1 but not Ras-GRF2 striatal gene-knockdown reduced l-DOPA-induced GABA and glutamate release in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, a neurochemical correlate of dyskinesia. Finally, inactivation of Ras-GRF1 provided a prolonged anti-dyskinetic effect for up to 7 weeks and significantly attenuated symptoms in animals with established LID.INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that Ras-GRF1 is a promising target for LID therapy based on Ras-ERK signaling inhibition in the striatum."

Subsequently, stable associations form through homologous chromosome synapsis. In male mouse meiosis, the largely heterologous X and Y chromosomes synapse only in their short pseudoautosomal regions (PARs), and DSBs persist along the unsynapsed non-homologous arms of these sex chromosomes. Asynapsis of these arms and the persistent DSBs then trigger transcriptional silencing through meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), resulting in formation of the XY body. This inactive state is partially maintained in post-meiotic haploid spermatids (postmeiotic sex chromatin repression, PSCR). For the human, establishment of MSCI and PSCR have also been reported, but X-linked gene silencing appears to be more variable compared to mouse. To gain more insight into the regulation and significance of MSCI and PSCR among different eutherian species, we have performed a global analysis of XY pairing dynamics, DSB repair, MSCI and PSCR in the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), for which the complete genome sequence has recently become available, allowing a thorough comparative analyses.RESULTS: In addition to PAR synapsis between X and Y, we observed extensive self-synapsis of part of the dog X chromosome, and rapid loss of known markers of DSB repair from that part of the X. Sequencing of RNA from purified spermatocytes and spermatids revealed establishment of MSCI. However, the self-synapsing region of the X displayed higher X-linked gene expression compared to the unsynapsed area in spermatocytes, and was post-meiotically reactivated in spermatids. In contrast, genes in the PAR, which are expected to escape MSCI, were expressed at very low levels in both spermatocytes and spermatids. Our comparative analysis was then used to identify two X-linked genes that may escape MSCI in spermatocytes, and 21 that are specifically re-activated in spermatids of human, mouse and dog.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that MSCI is incomplete in the dog. This may be partially explained by extensive, but transient, self-synapsis of the X chromosome, in association with rapid completion of meiotic DSB repair. In addition, our comparative analysis identifies novel candidate male fertility genes."

The development of midbrain dopamine neurons has been extensively studied, and these studies indicate that complex cross-regulatory interactions between extrinsic and intrinsic molecules regulate a precise temporal and spatial programme of neurogenesis in midbrain dopamine progenitors. To elucidate direct molecular interactions between multiple regulatory factors during neuronal differentiation in mice, we characterised genome-wide binding sites of the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor Foxa1, which functions redundantly with Foxa2 to regulate the differentiation of mDA neurons. Interestingly, our studies identified a rostral brain floor plate Neurog2 enhancer that requires direct input from Otx2, Foxa1, Foxa2 and an E-box transcription factor for its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the chromatin remodelling factor Smarca1 was shown to function downstream of Foxa1 and Foxa2 to regulate differentiation from immature to mature midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Our genome-wide Foxa1-bound cis-regulatory sequences from ChIP-Seq and Foxa1/2 candidate target genes from RNA-Seq analyses of embryonic midbrain dopamine cells also provide an excellent resource for probing mechanistic insights into gene regulatory networks involved in the differentiation of midbrain dopamine neurons."

Crucial to interpreting RNA structures as they pertain to individual phenotypes is the ability to detect RNAs with large structural disparities caused by a single nucleotide variant (SNV) or riboSNitches. A recently published human genome-wide parallel analysis of RNA structure (PARS) study identified a large number of riboSNitches as well as non-riboSNitches, providing an unprecedented set of RNA sequences against which to benchmark structure prediction algorithms. Here we evaluate 11 different RNA folding algorithms' riboSNitch prediction performance on these data. We find that recent algorithms designed specifically to predict the effects of SNVs on RNA structure, in particular remuRNA, RNAsnp and SNPfold, perform best on the most rigorously validated subsets of the benchmark data. In addition, our benchmark indicates that general structure prediction algorithms (e.g. RNAfold and RNAstructure) have overall better performance if base pairing probabilities are considered rather than minimum free energy calculations. Although overall aggregate algorithmic performance on the full set of riboSNitches is relatively low, significant improvement is possible if the highest confidence predictions are evaluated independently."

Previous studies from our laboratory indicated that C/EBPβ is implicated in inflammatory process and brain injury, since mice lacking this gene were less susceptible to kainic acid-induced injury.METHODS: We first performed cDNA microarrays analysis using hippocampal RNA isolated from C/EBPβ (+/+) and C/EBPβ (-/-) mice. Immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical studies were done to evaluate C/EBPβ and C3 levels. Transient transfection experiments were made to analyze transcriptional regulation of C3 by C/EBPβ. To knockdown C/EBPβ and C3 expression, mouse astrocytes were infected with lentiviral particles expressing an shRNA specific for C/EBPβ or an siRNA specific for C3.RESULTS: Among the genes displaying significant changes in expression was complement component 3 (C3), which showed a dramatic decrease in mRNA content in the hippocampus of C/EBPβ (-/-) mice. C3 is the central component of the complement and is implicated in different brain disorders. In this work we have found that C/EBPβ regulates C3 levels in rodents glial in vitro and in the rat Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in vivo following an inflammatory insult. Analysis of the mouse C3 promoter showed that it is directly regulated by C/EBPβ through a C/EBPβ consensus site located at position -616/-599 of the gene. In addition, we show that depletion of C/EBPβ by a specific shRNA results in a significant decrease in the levels of C3 together with a reduction in the increased levels of pro-inflammatory agents elicited by lipopolysaccharide treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results indicate that C3 is a downstream target of C/EBPβ, and it could be a mediator of the pro-inflammatory effects of this transcription factor in neural cells."

The FVMs were classified into three active FVMs or three inactive FVMs according to the presence or absence of neovascularization (NV) in the membranes. Total RNA was isolated from the six FVMs and also from three normal human retinas. The DNA microarray analysis was performed to compare the genes expressed in the FVMs to those in normal human retinas, and also between active and inactive FVMs. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was used to determine the key biological networks related to the genes that were significantly altered. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to validate the microarray analyses.RESULTS: There were 87 genes expressed at significantly higher levels in FVMs than in normal human retinas. Functional classification of these genes showed that the most clustered genes were those related to extracellular matrix formation. The top biological network generated by the IPA was cellular assembly and organization involving nodes of genes related to extracellular matrix formation. These networks included the collagen family and matricellular proteins, THBS2, POSTN, and TNC. There were 91 genes significantly upregulated in active FVMs, and the most clustered functional category was angiogenesis. In contrast, 89 genes were significantly upregulated in inactive FVMs, and the most clustered functional category was metabolism. The IPA revealed that the top biological network related to the genes that were significantly altered in this comparison was cell-to-cell signaling, and interactions involving the PDGF and TGFβ families. The results of quantitative RT-PCR analyses and immunohistochemistry for several selected molecules were in good agreement with the microarray data.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that extracellular matrix-related molecules such as POSTN, TNC, TGFβ, and angiogenic factors have important roles in promoting the development of FVMs associated with PDR."

At the root of this knowledge gap is the absence of a method that enables whole-organ imaging. Herein, we present techniques for tissue clearing in which whole organs and bodies are rendered macromolecule-permeable and optically transparent, thereby exposing their cellular structure with intact connectivity. We describe PACT (passive clarity technique), a protocol for passive tissue clearing and immunostaining of intact organs; RIMS (refractive index matching solution), a mounting media for imaging thick tissue; and PARS (perfusion-assisted agent release in situ), a method for whole-body clearing and immunolabeling. We show that in rodents PACT, RIMS, and PARS are compatible with endogenous-fluorescence, immunohistochemistry, RNA single-molecule FISH, long-term storage, and microscopy with cellular and subcellular resolution. These methods are applicable for high-resolution, high-content mapping and phenotyping of normal and pathological elements within intact organs and bodies."

Expression of 25 mRNAs was assessed with TaqMan-PCR including members of the complement system, colony stimulating factors, Toll family, cytokines IL-8, IL-6, IL-6ST, IL-1B, TNF-α family, IL-10, TGFβ family, cathepsins and integrin family, in the substantia nigra pars compacta, putamen, frontal cortex area 8 and angular gyrus area 39, in a total of 43 controls and 56 cases with PD-related pathology covering stages 1-6 of Braak. Up-regulation of IL-6ST was the only change in the substantia nigra at stages 1-2. Down-regulation of the majority of members examined occurred in the substantia nigra from stage 4 onwards. However, region-dependent down- and up-regulation of selected mRNAs occurred in the putamen and frontal cortex, whereas only mRNA up-regulated mRNAs were identified in the angular cortex from stage 3 onwards in PD cases. Protein studies in frontal cortex revealed increased IL6 expression and reduced IL-10 with ELISA, and increased IL-6 with western blotting in PD. Immunohistochemistry revealed localization of IL-5, IL-6 and IL-17 receptors in glial cells, mainly microglia; IL-5, IL-10 and M-CSF in neurons; TNF-α in neurons and microglia; and active NF-κB in the nucleus of subpopulations of neurons and glial cells in PD. Distinct inflammatory responses, involving pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and variegated mediators of the immune response occur in different brain regions at the same time in particular individuals. Available information shows that altered α-synuclein solubility and aggregation, Lewy body formation, oxidative damage and neuroinflammation converge in the pathogenesis of PD."

Although the sequence and spatial expression of SIFa are evolutionarily conserved among insect species, the physiological function of SIFa/SIFR signaling remains elusive. Here, we provide genetic evidence that SIFa and SIFR promote sleep in Drosophila. Either genetic ablation of SIFa-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis (PI) or pan-neuronal depletion of SIFa expression shortened baseline sleep and reduced sleep-bout length, suggesting that it caused sleep fragmentation. Consistently, RNA interference- mediated knockdown of SIFR expression caused short sleep phenotypes as observed in SIFa-ablated or depleted flies. Using a panel of neuron-specific Gal4 drivers, we further mapped SIFR effects to subsets of PI neurons. Taken together, these results reveal a novel physiological role of the neuropeptide SIFa/SIFR pathway to regulate sleep through sleep-promoting neural circuits in the PI of adult fly brains."

In cell culture, Hh-sensitive cells display a striking dependence on cell density with active Hh signaling requiring cell-to-cell contact. As the Hippo/YAP system is tightly linked to cell density control and contact inhibition, we investigated the cross-talk between the two pathways. Our data reveal that the suppression of Hh signaling in the absence of cellular contacts is independent of primary cilia and is mediated by the YAP oncogene. Overexpression of YAP blocks Hh signaling whereas RNA interference-mediated knockdown of YAP enhances Hh/GLI activity. Despite this negative regulation, Hh signaling promotes YAP activity through post-transcriptional mechanisms, resulting in a negative feedback loop. In vivo, we found strong nuclear YAP immunoreactivity restricted to compartments with low Hh pathway activity in human and mouse pancreatic cancer. Finally, we identified protease-activated receptors (PARs) as molecules being able to override the inverse Hippo/Hh regulation, potentially giving tumors a mechanism to utilize both oncogenic pathways in parallel.Oncogenesis (2014) 3, e112; doi:10.1038/oncsis.2014.27; published online 11 August 2014."

The aim of this study was to explore if aPA stimulates proinflammatory cytokine in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells via the protease-activated receptors (PARs) pathway.METHODS: Acanthamoeba castellanii trophozoites were grown in peptone-yeast extract glucose for 7 days, and the supernatants were collected and centrifuged. The aPA was purified using the fast protein liquid chromatography system, and aPA activity was determined by zymography assays. Human corneal epithelial cells were incubated with or without aPA (100 μg/mL), PAR1 agonists (thrombin, 10 μM; TRAP-6, 10 μM), and PAR2 agonists (SLIGRL-NH2, 100 μM; AC 55541, 10 μM) for 24 and 48 hours. Inhibition of PAR1 and PAR2 involved preincubating the HCE cells for 1 hour with the antagonist of PAR1 (SCH 79797, 60 μM) and PAR2 (FSLLRY-NH2, 100 μM) with or without aPA. Human corneal epithelial cells also were preincubated with PAR1 and PAR2 antagonists and then incubated with or without PAR1 agonists (thrombin and TRAP-6) and PAR2 agonists (SLIGRL-NH2 and AC 55541). Expression of PAR1 and PAR2 was examined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry. Interleukin-8 expression was quantified by qRT-PCR and ELISA.RESULTS: Human corneal epithelial cells constitutively expressed PAR1 and PAR2 mRNA. Acanthamoeba plasminogen activator and PAR2 agonists significantly upregulated PAR2 mRNA expression (1- and 2-fold, respectively) (P &lt; 0.05). Protease-activated receptor 2 antagonist significantly inhibited aPA, and PAR2 agonists induced PAR2 mRNA expression in HCE cells (P &lt; 0.05). Protease-activated receptor 1 agonists, but not aPA, significantly upregulated PAR1 mRNA expression, which was significantly inhibited by PAR1 antagonist in HCE cells. Acanthamoeba plasminogen activator and PAR2 agonists stimulated IL-8 mRNA expression and protein production, which is significantly diminished by PAR2 antagonist (P &lt; 0.05). Protease-activated receptor 1 antagonist did not alter aPA-stimulated IL-8 mRNA expression and protein production in HCE cells. Flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry showed that aPA and SLIGRL-NH2 (PAR2 agonist) upregulated PAR2 surface protein as compared to that in unstimulated HCE cells. Thrombin, but not aPA, stimulated PAR1 surface protein in HCE cells.CONCLUSIONS: Acanthamoeba plasminogen activator specifically induces expression and production of IL-8 in HCE cells via PAR2 pathway, and PAR2 antagonists may be used as a therapeutic target in AK."
"24848448";"PARS";"PARS AND RNA";"Journal of neurochemistry";1;2014;"Destabilization of survival factor MEF2D mRNA by neurotoxin in models of Parkinson's disease.";"Progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantial nigra pars compacta (SNc) is an important pathological feature in Parkinson's disease (PD). Loss of transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), a key neuronal survival factor, has been shown to underlie the loss of DA neurons in SNc and the pathogenic process of PD. It is known that PD-associated neurotoxins reduce the level of MEF2D protein to trigger neuronal death. Although neurotoxins clearly destabilize MEF2D by post-translational mechanisms, it is not known whether regulation of MEF2D mRNA contributes to neurotoxin-induced decrease in MEF2D protein. In this work, we showed that MPP(+), the toxic metabolite of MPTP, caused a significant decrease in the half-life and total level of MEF2D mRNA in a DA neuronal cell line, SN4741 cells. Quantitative PCR analysis of the SNc DA neurons captured by immune-laser capture microdissection showed that exposure to MPTP led to a marked reduction in the level of MEF2D mRNA in SNc DA neurons compared to controls. Down-regulation of MEF2D mRNA alone reduced the viability of SN4741 cells and sensitized the cells to MPP(+)-induced toxicity. These results suggest that destabilization and reduction in MEF2D mRNA is in part responsible for neurotoxin-induced decrease in MEF2D protein and neuronal viability. Myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) plays an important role in neuronal survival. How MEF2D mRNA is deregulated under toxic stress is unclear. We found that PD-associated neurotoxins destabilize MEF2D mRNA and reduce its level in vitro and in vivo. Reduction in MEF2D mRNA is sufficient to sensitize model cells to neurotoxin-induced toxicity, suggesting that destabilization of MEF2D mRNA is part of the mechanism by which neurotoxins trigger deregulation of neuronal survival."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs which play a major role in several cellular processes in health and disease by regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. Aberrant miRNA expression has been detected in post-mortem human PD brain samples, in vitro and in vivo PD models. However, none of the studies have focused on the role of the brain-abundant miR-124 in PD. In this study, we have evaluated the expression changes of miR-124 in the SN of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. MiRNA expression analysis by qPCR revealed a decrease in the expression of brain-enriched miR-124 in the SN of MPTP-treated mice as compared to controls. Further, in vitro study revealed a decrease in the expression of miR-124 in MN9D dopaminergic neurons treated with methyl phenyl pyridinium (MPP) iodide. The expression of calpains 1 and 2 which is modulated by miR-124 was increased in the SNc of MPTP-treated mice as observed at different time points after treatment and in the MN9D dopaminergic neurons treated with MPP iodide leading to increased expression of the p35 cleavage product, p25 and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5). Calpain-p25-mediated increase in cdk5 expression leading to dopaminergic neuronal death has been demonstrated in human PD and MPTP-PD models. Increased expression of calpain 1/cdk5 pathway proteins was observed in anti-miR-124-transfected MN9D cells in our studies. Knockdown of miR-124 led to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) both known to increase oxidative stress. Further, experiments with miR-124 target protector sequences specific to calpain 1 revealed an interaction of miR-124 with calpain 1. Overexpression of miR-124 after MPP iodide treatment on MN9D cells was found to attenuate the expression of the calpain 1/p25/cdk5 proteins while improving cell survival. These results suggest that miR-124 acts to modulate the expression of calpain/cdk5 pathway proteins in the dopaminergic neurons. A better understanding of the mechanisms controlling the expression of miR-124 will aid in targeting miR-124 for better treatment strategies for PD."

Currently, there is no cure, but only the capability to relieve the symptoms of PD. The conserved dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) protects and rescues dopamine neurons in vivo. However, the molecular function of CDNF in PD remains unclear. In present study, we investigated the role and intrinsic mechanism of CDNF in preventing and reversing rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells from apoptosis induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). We demonstrate that 6-OHDA induces cell death in PC12 cells, but that CDNF attenuates this effect in a dose-dependent manner. Further study shows that upregulation of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and downregulation of caspase-3 activity are observed in a dose-dependent manner upon pre-treatment or post-treatment with CDNF, suggesting a pathway of regulation of apoptosis by CDNF. These data demonstrate that CDNF prevents the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by 6-OHDA by modulating Bcl-2/Bax and caspase-3 activation."

Since the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) has been linked to cellular inflammatory process in many diseases, it is likely that KLK1 expression may mediate the inflammatory process during the development of diabetic nephropathy. In this study, we explored the role of KLK1 in tubular pro-inflammatory responses under the diabetic milieu. Recombinant KLK1 stimulated the production of inflammatory cytokines in PTEC via the activation of p42/44 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Molecular knockdown of endogenous KLK1 expression by siRNA transfection in PTEC attenuated advanced glycation end-products (AGE)-induced IL-8 and ICAM-1 productions in vitro. Interestingly, exposure of PTEC to KLK1 induced the expression of protease-activated receptors (PARs). There was a 2.9-fold increase in PAR-4, 1.4-fold increase in PAR-1 and 1.2-fold increase in PAR-2 mRNA levels. Activation of PAR-4 by a selective agonist was found to elicit the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic phenotypes in PTEC while blockade of the receptor by specific antagonist attenuated high glucose-induced IL-6, CCL-2, CTGF and collagen IV expression. Calcium mobilization by the PAR-4 agonist in PTEC was desensitized by pretreatment with KLK1. Consistent with these in vitro findings, there was a markedly up-regulation of tubular PAR-4 expression in human diabetic renal cortical tissues. Together, these results suggest that up-regulation of KLK1 in tubular epithelial cells may mediate pro-inflammatory pathway and PAR activation during diabetic nephropathy and provide a new therapeutic target for further investigation."

Despite the importance for host-microbe interactions and bacterial colonization, dietary responses of the mucosa-associated bacterial communities are less well investigated. In the present study, we characterized the mucosa-associated bacterial communities at the Pars non-glandularis of the stomach, ileum and colon, and identified shifts in these communities in response to different dietary calcium-phosphorus (Ca-P) contents (100% versus 190% of the Ca and P requirements) in combination with two basal diets (wheat-barley- or corn-based) in weaned pigs. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from 93 mucosal samples yielded 447,849 sequences, clustering into 997 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity level. OTUs were assigned to 198 genera belonging to 14 different phyla. Correlation-based networks revealed strong interactions among OTUs at the various gastrointestinal sites. Our data describe a previously not reported high diversity and species richness at the Pars non-glandularis of the stomach in weaned pigs. Moreover, high versus adequate Ca-P content significantly promoted Lactobacillus by 14.9% units (1.4 fold change) at the gastric Pars non-glandularis (P = 0.035). Discriminant analysis revealed dynamic changes in OTU composition in response to dietary cereals and Ca-P contents at all gastrointestinal sites which were less distinguishable at higher taxonomic levels. Overall, this study revealed a distinct mucosa-associated bacterial community at the different gut sites, and a strong effect of high Ca-P diets on the gastric community, thereby markedly expanding our comprehension on mucosa-associated microbiota and their diet-related dynamics in weaned pigs."

The results indicate that the crh transcripts increased in the hypothalamus and rostral pars distalis of the pituitary after the transfer of fish to SW. Similarly, the pRrp transcripts were more abundant in SW acclimated tilapia forebrain and hypothalamus. The crh-r, gr2 and mr transcripts were more expressed in rostral pars distalis and pars intermedia of pituitary at SW than FW tilapia. The data indicate that the SW acclimation stimulates these transcripts in the specific regions of the brain and pituitary which may be related to the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI)-axis. The results of dual in situ hybridization reveal that the transcripts of crh-r, gr2 and mr with pomc are highly co-localized in corticotrophs of pituitary. Furthermore, we demonstrate high expression of pRrp in the brain and low expression of pRrp and prl transcripts in the pituitary of SW fish. No crh-r and corticosteroid receptors were co-localized with prl transcripts in the pituitary. The gh-r and igf-1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in SW acclimated tilapia pituitary whereas there was no difference in the gh mRNA levels. The data suggest that the locally produced pRrp and d2-r may control and regulate the expression of prl mRNA in pituitary. Therefore, the dual roles of pRrp are involved in the stress (via brain-pituitary) and osmoregulatory (via pituitary) pathways in tilapia exposed to acute salinity changes."

Although manipulation of the Mpdz gene by homologous recombination and bacterial artificial chromosome transgenesis has suggested that its expression affects alcohol withdrawal risk, the potential confounding effects of linked genes and developmental compensation currently limit interpretation. Here, using RNA interference (RNAi), we directly test the impact of Mpdz expression on alcohol withdrawal severity and provide brain regional mechanistic information. Lentiviral-mediated delivery of Mpdz short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to the caudolateral substantia nigra pars reticulata (clSNr) significantly reduces Mpdz expression and exacerbates alcohol withdrawal convulsions compared with control mice that delivered a scrambled shRNA. Neither baseline nor pentylenetetrazol-enhanced convulsions differed between Mpdz shRNA and control animals, indicating Mpdz expression in the clSNr does not generally affect seizure susceptibility. To our knowledge, these represent the first in vivo Mpdz RNAi analyses, and provide the first direct evidence that Mpdz expression impacts behavior. Our results confirm that Mpdz is a quantitative trait gene for alcohol withdrawal and demonstrate that its expression in the clSNr is crucially involved in risk for alcohol withdrawal."

To evaluate whether targeting the endocannabinoid system could provide potential benefits in the treatment of the disease, the effect of a monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor that prevents degradation of 2-arachidonyl-glycerol was tested in mice treated chronically with probenecid and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTPp). Chronic administration of the compound, JZL184 (8 mg/kg), prevented MPTPp-induced motor impairment and preserved the nigrostriatal pathway. Furthermore, none of the hypokinetic effects associated with cannabinoid receptor agonism were observed. In the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta, MPTPp animals treated with JZL184 exhibited astroglial and microglial phenotypic changes that were accompanied by increases in TGFβ messenger RNA expression and in glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA and protein levels. JZL184 induced an increase in β-catenin translocation to the nucleus, implicating the Wnt/catenin pathway. Together, these results demonstrate a potent neuroprotective effect of JZL184 on the nigrostriatal pathway of parkinsonian animals, likely involving restorative astroglia and microglia activation and the release of neuroprotective and antiinflammatory molecules."

However, the mechanisms underlying thrombin-regulated COX-2 expression in human cardiomyocytes remain unclear.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Human cardiomyocytes were used in the study. Thrombin-induced COX-2 protein and mRNA expression, and signalling pathways were determined by Western blot, real-time PCR and COX-2 promoter luciferase reporter assays, and pharmacological inhibitors or siRNAs. PGE2 generation and cell proliferation were also determined.KEY RESULTS: Thrombin-induced COX-2 protein and mRNA expression, promoter activity and PGE2 release was attenuated by the PAR1 antagonist (SCH79797) or the inhibitors of proteinase activity (PPACK), MEK1/2 (U0126), p38 MAPK (SB202190) or JNK1/2 (SP600125), and transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) of PAR1, p38, p42 or JNK2. These results suggested that PAR1-dependent MAPKs participate in thrombin-induced COX-2 expression in human cardiomyocytes. Moreover, thrombin stimulated phosphorylation of MAPKs, which was attenuated by PPACK and SCH79797. Furthermore, thrombin-induced COX-2 expression was blocked by the inhibitors of AP-1 (tanshinone IIA) and NF-κB (helenalin). Moreover, thrombin-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun/AP-1 and p65/NF-κB was attenuated by tanshinone IIA and helenalin, respectively, suggesting that thrombin induces COX-2 expression via PAR1/MAPKs/AP-1 or the NF-κB pathway. Functionally, thrombin increased human cardiomyocyte proliferation through the COX-2/PGE2 system linking to EP2 receptors, as determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin D1 expression.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings demonstrate that MAPKs-mediated activation of AP-1/NF-κB pathways is, at least in part, required for COX-2/PGE2 /EP2 -triggered cell proliferation in human cardiomyocytes."

However, protein products of these genes are not yet shown in the hypothalamus of a photoperiodic species. Therefore, using the 'first long day paradigm', EYA3 and TSH-β along with c-FOS and GnRH peptides were immunohistochemically localized and measured in the hypothalamus of photoperiodic redheaded buntings that were maintained on short days (SD, LD 8/16) and subjected to one full long day (LD, LD 16/8). Following morning light remained turned off, and birds were sacrificed in the first hour of the day. Brains were collected and processed for immunohistochemistry of peptides. FOS-lir and GnRH-lir cells were significantly higher in the preoptic area (POA) in LD than in SD, which indicated photoperiod induced neuronal activation and downstream effects, respectively, under LD. In LD, EYA3-lir cells were significantly increased in septal lateralis (SL) with fibres extending to sub-septal organ (SSO); EYA3 fibres were very dense in median eminence. Similarly, there were significantly increased TSH-β-lir cells in the ventricular region with much abundance in the PT and TSH-β-lir fibres in the SSO (extending up to SL), inferior hypothalamic nucleus (IH) and infundibular nucleus (IN) in LD birds. Elevated EYA3, TSH-α and TSH-β mRNA levels further confirmed photoperiodic induction at the transcriptional level in buntings on the first long day. These are the first results showing localization of photoperiodically induced peptides in the hypothalamus of a songbird species, the redheaded bunting."

Little is known about pituitary hormones in the order Squamata, to which the green iguana (gi) belongs. In this work, we characterized the hypophysis of Iguana iguana morphologically. The somatotrophs (round cells of 7.6-10 μm containing 250- to 300-nm secretory granules where the giGH is stored) were found, by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, exclusively in the caudal lobe of the pars distalis, whereas the lactotrophs were distributed only in the rostral lobe. A pituitary giGH-like protein was obtained by immuno-affinity chromatography employing a heterologous antibody against chicken GH. giGH showed molecular heterogeneity (22, 44, and 88 kDa by SDS-PAGE/Western blot under non-reducing conditions and at least four charge variants (pIs 6.2, 6.5, 6.9, 7.4) by isoelectric focusing. The pituitary giGH cDNA (1016 bp), amplified by PCR and RACE, encodes a pre-hormone of 218 aa, of which 190 aa correspond to the mature protein and 28 aa to the signal peptide.

Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) which is activated by a unique proteolytic mechanism. PARs have crucial roles in hemostasis and thrombosis as well as tumor progression. RNA interference (RNAi) is a fundamental cellular mechanism for gene silencing that is able to be harnessed for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs. In the present study, PAR1 was successfully inhibited by using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent to deliver siRNA. Inhibition occurred at the mRNA and protein level as determined by polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Furthermore, the growth and invasion of tumor cells were significantly decreased. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the progression of A549 cells is able to be inhibited by knockdown of PAR1 expression. Efficient delivery of the specific siRNA targeting PAR1 may be used for further study in clinical cancer therapy."

Potential sources of this inflammation may include fungal proteases. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are components of the innate immune response that are modulated by proteolytic activity and are involved in potentiating T helper 2 (Th2) responses. The objective of the study was to determine whether there is differential expression of PARs in patients with AFRS compared to controls.METHODS: The study was designed as a comparison of gene expression profiles in patients with AFRS vs diseased and nondiseased controls. Twenty-five patients were enrolled. Patients with AFRS (n = 15) were compared to nondiseased controls (n = 5) undergoing minimally invasive pituitary surgery (MIPS) and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP, n = 5) undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). Ethmoid mucosa RNA was hybridized to 4 × 44 K microarray chips. Four gene probes (PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4) were used to assess for differential expression. A linear-mixed model was used to account for some patients having multiple samples. Significance level was determined at p &lt; 0.05.RESULTS: Of the 4 probes, only PAR3 showed statistically significant differential expression between AFRS and nondiseased control samples (p = 0.03) as well as a 2.21-fold change. No additional statistical difference in PAR expression among the comparison groups was noted.CONCLUSION: PARs have been shown to enhance production of inflammatory cytokines and potentiate Th2 responses. In this initial report, patients with AFRS have a significantly increased expression of PAR3 compared to nondiseased controls."

Specimens were collected from nine patients with invasive cholesteatoma, nine patients with attic-type cholesteatoma (pars flaccida was perforated in five patients and intact in four) and four healthy skins. Expression and localization of LL-37 and interferon-alpha were detected by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis. Cultures of human cholesteatomatous keratinocytes were exposed to CpG DNA, LL-37 or CpG DNA complexed to LL-37 for 24 h. Expression of interferon-alpha was detected by RT-PCR. We detected abundant cytosolic DNA, increased LL-37 and interferon-alpha in keratinocytes in invasive cholesteatoma and attic-type cholesteatoma with pars flaccida perforation, but not in attic-type cholesteatoma with pars flaccida intact and normal skin. In cultured keratinocytes, LL-37-DNA complexes induced IFN-α expression. These data suggest that cytosolic DNA is an important disease-associated molecular pattern that triggers the inflammation response in cholesteatoma. Furthermore, LL-37 played an important role in DNA-triggered inflammation. Thus, we have identified a link between cytosolic DNA, LL-37 and autoinflammation in cholesteatoma, providing new potential targets for the treatment of this disease."

Mitochondrial oxidant stress is widely viewed a major factor in PD pathogenesis. Previous work has shown that activity-dependent calcium entry through L-type channels elevates perinuclear mitochondrial oxidant stress in SNc dopaminergic neurons, providing a potential basis for their selective vulnerability. What is less clear is whether this physiological stress is present in dendrites and if Lewy bodies, the major neuropathological lesion found in PD brains, exacerbate it. To pursue these questions, mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons derived from C57BL/6 transgenic mice were studied in primary cultures, allowing for visualization of soma and dendrites simultaneously. Many of the key features of in vivo adult dopaminergic neurons were recapitulated in vitro. Activity-dependent calcium entry through L-type channels increased mitochondrial oxidant stress in dendrites. This stress progressively increased with distance from the soma. Examination of SNc dopaminergic neurons ex vivo in brain slices verified this pattern. Moreover, the formation of intracellular α-synuclein Lewy-body-like aggregates increased mitochondrial oxidant stress in perinuclear and dendritic compartments. This stress appeared to be extramitochondrial in origin, because scavengers of cytosolic reactive oxygen species or inhibition of NADPH oxidase attenuated it. These results show that physiological and proteostatic stress can be additive in the soma and dendrites of vulnerable dopaminergic neurons, providing new insight into the factors underlying PD pathogenesis."

In this study, we analyzed the role of PAR-1 in coxsackievirus B3-induced (CVB3-induced) myocarditis and influenza A infection. CVB3-infected Par1(-/-) mice expressed reduced levels of IFN-β and CXCL10 during the early phase of infection compared with Par1(+/+) mice that resulted in higher viral loads and cardiac injury at day 8 after infection. Inhibition of either tissue factor or thrombin in WT mice also significantly increased CVB3 levels in the heart and cardiac injury compared with controls. BM transplantation experiments demonstrated that PAR-1 in nonhematopoietic cells protected mice from CVB3 infection. Transgenic mice overexpressing PAR-1 in cardiomyocytes had reduced CVB3-induced myocarditis. We found that cooperative signaling between PAR-1 and TLR3 in mouse cardiac fibroblasts enhanced activation of p38 and induction of IFN-β and CXCL10 expression. Par1(-/-) mice also had decreased CXCL10 expression and increased viral levels in the lung after influenza A infection compared with Par1(+/+) mice.

In the CNS, APC and its analogs with reduced anticoagulant activity but preserved cell signaling activities, such as 3K3A-APC, exert neuroprotective, vasculoprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects. Murine APC promotes subependymal neurogenesis in rodents in vivo after ischemic and traumatic brain injury. Whether human APC can influence neuronal production from resident progenitor cells in humans is unknown. Here we show that 3K3A-APC, but not S360A-APC (an enzymatically inactive analog of APC), stimulates neuronal mitogenesis and differentiation from fetal human neural stem and progenitor cells (NPCs). The effects of 3K3A-APC on proliferation and differentiation were comparable to those obtained with fibroblast growth factor and brain-derived growth factor, respectively. Its promoting effect on neuronal differentiation was accompanied by inhibition of astroglial differentiation. In addition, 3K3A-APC exerted modest anti-apoptotic effects during neuronal production. These effects appeared to be mediated through specific protease activated receptors (PARs) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs), in that siRNA-mediated inhibition of PARs 1-4 and S1PRs 1-5 revealed that PAR1, PAR3, and S1PR1 are required for the neurogenic effects of 3K3A-APC. 3K3A-APC activated Akt, a downstream target of S1PR1, which was inhibited by S1PR1, PAR1, and PAR3 silencing. Adenoviral transduction of NPCs with a kinase-defective Akt mutant abolished the effects of 3K3A-APC on NPCs, confirming a key role of Akt activation in 3K3A-APC-mediated neurogenesis. Therefore, APC and its pharmacological analogs, by influencing PAR and S1PR signals in resident neural progenitor cells, may be potent modulators of both development and repair in the human CNS."

In all three species, natalisin expression was observed in 3-4 pairs of the brain neurons: the anterior dorso-lateral interneurons, inferior contralateral interneurons, and small pars intercerebralis neurons. In B. mori, natalisin also was expressed in two additional pairs of contralateral interneurons in the subesophageal ganglion. Natalisin-RNAi and the activation or silencing of the neural activities in the natalisin-specific cells in D. melanogaster induced significant defects in the mating behaviors of both males and females. Knockdown of natalisin expression in T. castaneum resulted in significant reduction in the fecundity. The similarity of the natalisin C-terminal motifs to those of vertebrate tachykinins and of tachykinin-related peptides in arthropods led us to identify the natalisin receptor. A G protein-coupled receptor, previously known as tachykinin receptor 86C (also known as the neurokinin K receptor of D. melanogaster), now has been recognized as a bona fide natalisin receptor. Taken together, the taxonomic distribution pattern of the natalisin gene and the phylogeny of the receptor suggest that natalisin is an ancestral sibling of tachykinin that evolved only in the arthropod lineage."

Elevated levels of KLK6 occur in actively demyelinating multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and in cases of spinal cord injury (SCI), stroke, and glioblastoma. Taken with recent evidence establishing KLK6 as a CNS-endogenous activator of protease-activated receptors (PARs), we hypothesized that KLK6 activates a subset of PARs to regulate oligodendrocyte physiology and potentially pathophysiology. Here, primary oligodendrocyte cultures derived from wild type or PAR1-deficient mice and the murine oligodendrocyte cell line, Oli-neu, were used to demonstrate that Klk6 (rodent form) mediates loss of oligodendrocyte processes and impedes morphological differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in a PAR1-dependent fashion. Comparable gliopathy was also elicited by the canonical PAR1 agonist, thrombin, as well as PAR1-activating peptides (PAR1-APs). Klk6 also exacerbated ATP-mediated oligodendrogliopathy in vitro, pointing to a potential role in augmenting excitotoxicity. In addition, Klk6 suppressed the expression of proteolipid protein (PLP) RNA in cultured oligodendrocytes by a mechanism involving PAR1-mediated Erk1/2 signaling. Microinjection of PAR1 agonists, including Klk6 or PAR1-APs, into the dorsal column white matter of PAR1(+/+) but not PAR1(-/-) mice promoted vacuolating myelopathy and a loss of immunoreactivity for myelin basic protein (MBP) and CC-1(+) oligodendrocytes. These results demonstrate a functional role for Klk6-PAR1 signaling in oligodendroglial pathophysiology and suggest that antagonists of PAR1 or its protease agonists may represent new modalities to moderate demyelination and to promote myelin regeneration in cases of CNS white matter injury or disease."

Here we show that T3.0 encodes a small peptide of 48 amino acids (designated viral small peptide 1 [vSP-1]). vSP-1 interacts with RTA at the protein abundance regulatory signal (PARS) motifs, and the association prevents RTA from being subjected to degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. As a consequence, vSP-1 facilitates KSHV gene expression and lytic replication. This finding reveals a novel mechanism of gene regulation in the viral life cycle."

These neurons are intermingled with GABAergic neurons. Recent evidence shows that the VTA contains glutamatergic neurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 (VGluT2); some of them co-express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Here, we used a combination of radioactive in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry to explore whether any of the vesicular glutamate transporters [vesicular glutamate transporter type 1 (VGluT1), VGluT2, or vesicular glutamate transporter type 3 (VGluT3)] were encoded by neurons in the SNC or RRF. We found expression of VGluT2 mRNA, but not of VGluT1 or VGluT3, in the SNC and RRF. These VGluT2 neurons rarely showed TH immunoreactivity. Within the SNC, the VGluT2 neurons were infrequently found at the rostral level, but were often seen at the medial and caudal levels intercalated in the mediolateral portion of the dorsal tier, at a ratio of one VGluT2 neuron per 4.4 TH neurons. At this level, VGluT2 neurons were also found in the adjacent substantia nigra reticulata and substantia nigra pars lateralis. Within the RRF, the VGluT2 neurons showed an increasing rostrocaudal gradient of distribution. The RRF proportion of VGluT2 neurons in relation to TH neurons was constant throughout the rostrocaudal levels, showing an average ratio of one VGluT2 neuron per 1.7 TH neurons. In summary, we provide evidence indicating that the SNC and RRF, which are traditionally considered to be dopaminergic areas, have neurons with the ability to participate in glutamate signaling."

In mammals, dopamine differentially modulates the excitability of the direct and indirect striatal projection neurons, and these populations selectively express dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, respectively. Although the detailed organization of the basal ganglia is conserved throughout the vertebrate phylum, it was unknown whether the differential dopamine modulation of the direct and indirect pathways is present in non-mammalian species. We aim here to determine whether the receptor expression and opposing dopaminergic modulation of the direct and indirect pathways is present in one of the phylogenetically oldest vertebrates, the river lamprey. Using in situ hybridization and patch-clamp recordings, we show that D1 receptors are almost exclusively expressed in the striatal neurons projecting directly to the homolog of the substantia nigra pars reticulata. In addition, the majority of striatal neurons projecting to the homolog of the globus pallidus interna/globus pallidus externa express D1 or D2 receptors. As in mammals, application of dopamine receptor agonists differentially modulates the excitability of these neurons, increasing the excitability of the D1-expressing neurons and decreasing the excitability of D2-expressing neurons. Our results suggest that the segregated expression of the D1 and D2 receptors in the direct and indirect striatal projection neurons has been conserved across the vertebrate phylum. Because dopamine receptor agonists differentially modulate these pathways, increasing the excitability of the direct pathway and decreasing the excitability of the indirect pathway, this organization may be conserved as a mechanism that biases the networks toward action selection."

Dicer expression is essential for mouse midbrain development and dopaminergic (DAergic) neuron maintenance and survival during the early post-natal period. However, the role of Dicer in adult mouse DAergic neuron maintenance and survival is unknown. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we selectively knocked-down Dicer expression in individual DAergic midbrain areas, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) via viral-mediated expression of Cre in adult floxed Dicer knock-in mice (Dicer(flox/flox)). Bilateral Dicer loss in the VTA resulted in progressive hyperactivity that was significantly reduced by the dopamine agonist, amphetamine. In contrast, decreased Dicer expression in the SNpc did not affect locomotor activity but did induce motor-learning impairment on an accelerating rotarod. Knock-down of Dicer in both midbrain regions of adult Dicer(flox/flox) mice resulted in preferential, progressive loss of DAergic neurons likely explaining motor behavior phenotypes. In addition, knock-down of Dicer in midbrain areas triggered neuronal death via apoptosis. Together, these data indicate that Dicer expression and, as a consequence, miRNA function, are essential for DAergic neuronal maintenance and survival in adult midbrain DAergic neuron brain areas."

To facilitate the understanding of the underling mechanism of PD, several zebrafish PD models have been generated to recapitulate the characteristics of dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss. In zebrafish studies, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) has been frequently used as a molecular marker of DA neurons. However, th1 also labels norepinephrine and epinephrine neurons. Recently, a homologue of th1, named tyrosine hydroxylase 2 (th2), was identified based on the sequence homology and subsequently used as a novel marker of DA neurons. In this study, we present evidence that th2 co-localizes with serotonin in the ventral diencephalon and caudal hypothalamus in zebrafish embryos. In addition, knockdown of th2 reduces the level of serotonin in the corresponding th2-positive neurons. This phenotype can be rescued by both zebrafish th2 and mouse tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) mRNA as well as by 5-hydroxytryptophan, the product of tryptophan hydroxylase. Moreover, the purified Th2 protein has tryptophan hydroxylase activity comparable with that of the mouse TPH1 protein in vitro. Based on these in vivo and in vitro results, we conclude that th2 is a gene encoding for tryptophan hydroxylase and should be used as a marker gene of serotonergic neurons."

In most cases the disease is sporadic but genetically inherited cases also exist. One of the major pathological features of PD is the presence of aggregates that localize in neuronal cytoplasm as Lewy bodies, mainly composed of α-synuclein (α-syn) and ubiquitin. The selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons suggests that dopamine itself may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in PD. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress constitute key pathogenic events of this disorder. Thus, in this review we give an actual perspective to classical pathways involving these two mechanisms of neurodegeneration, including the role of dopamine in sporadic and familial PD, as well as in the case of abuse of amphetamine-type drugs. Mutations in genes related to familial PD causing autosomal dominant or recessive forms may also have crucial effects on mitochondrial morphology, function, and oxidative stress. Environmental factors, such as MPTP and rotenone, have been reported to induce selective degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathways leading to α-syn-positive inclusions, possibly by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I of the respiratory chain and subsequently increasing oxidative stress. Recently, increased risk for PD was found in amphetamine users. Amphetamine drugs have effects similar to those of other environmental factors for PD, because long-term exposure to these drugs leads to dopamine depletion. Moreover, amphetamine neurotoxicity involves α-syn aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Therefore, dopamine and related oxidative stress, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction, seem to be common links between PD and amphetamine neurotoxicity."

In yeast, the Atg8 protein is indispensable for autophagosome formation. In mammals, this is complicated by the presence of six Atg8 homologues grouped into the GABARAP and MAP1LC3 subfamilies. Although these proteins share a high similarity, their transcript expression, regulation and protein interactions differ, suggesting they may display individual properties and specific functions. GABARAPL1/GEC1 is a member of the GABARAP subfamily and its mRNA is the most highly expressed Atg8 homologue in the central nervous system. Consequently, we performed an in depth study of GABARAPL1 distribution in the developing and adult murine brain. Our results show that GABARAPL1 brain expression is visible as early as embryonic day 11 and progressively increases to a maximum level in the adult. Immunohistochemical staining was detected in both fibers and immature neurons in embryos but was restrained to neurons in adult tissue. By E17, intense punctate-like structures were visible and these accumulated in cortical primary neurons treated with the autophagosome/lysosome fusion inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), suggesting that they represent autophagosomes. Finally, GABARAPL1 expression was particularly intense in motoneurons in the embryo and in neurons involved in somatomotor and neuroendocrine functions in the adult, particularly in the substantia nigra pars compacta, a region affected in Parkinson's disease. Our study of cerebral GABARAPL1 protein expression provides insight into its role in the development and homeostasis of the mouse brain."

Previous studies have demonstrated that neutrophil elastase (NE) stimulates the secretion of MUC5AC from airway epithelial cells, however, the mechanism is poorly understood. NE is a known ligand for protein active receptors (PARs), which have been confirmed to participate in releasing MUC5AC in the airways. However, the role of PARs in NE-induced MUC5AC secretion remains unclear. We demonstrated that airway goblet-like Calu-3 cells express PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3 with a predominant level of PAR2. NE can increase PAR2 expression and MUC5AC release. In our study, we showed that NE binding to PAR2 can increase the cytosolic calcium concentration and subsequently activate PKC, leading to MUC5AC secretion. In order to investigate the mechanism of increased cytosolic calcium in Calu-3 cells, thapsigargin was used to exhaust the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium pools, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate was used to inhibit the function of the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channels in the plasma membrane. We found that the NE-induced increase in intracellular calcium concentration is derived from release of the ER calcium pool and its subsequent calcium internal flux from the extracellular space via SOCE channels, which is dependent on sufficient levels of extracellular calcium."

Specific antibodies could be raised against the preprokiss2, but not the preoprokiss1. The data indicate that kiss2 neurons are mainly located in the hypothalamus and project widely to the subpallium and pallium, the preoptic region, the thalamus, the pretectal area, the optic tectum, the torus semicircularis, the mediobasal medial and caudal hypothalamus, and the neurohypophysis. These results were compared to the expression of kiss-R1 and kiss-R2 messengers, indicating a very good correlation between the wide distribution of Kiss2-positive fibers and that of kiss-R2 expressing cells. The expression of kiss-R1 messengers was more limited to the habenula, the ventral telencephalon and the proximal pars distalis of the pituitary. Attempts to characterize the phenotype of the numerous cells expressing kiss-R2 showed that neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase, neuropeptide Y and neuronal nitric oxide synthase are targets for kisspeptins, while GnRH1 neurons did not appear to express kiss-R1 or kiss-R2 messengers. In addition, a striking result was that all somatostatin-positive neurons expressed-kissR2. These data show that kisspeptins are likely to regulate a wide range of neuronal systems in the brain of teleosts."

Although PAR4 is preferentially expressed in human lung tissues, its possible significance in lung cancer has not been defined. The studies reported herein used a combination of clinical observations and molecular methods. Surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas and associated adjacent normal lung tissues were collected and BEAS-2B and NCI-H157 cell lines were grown in tissue culture. PAR4 expression was evaluated by RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis. The results showed that PAR4 mRNA expression was generally decreased in lung adenocarcinoma tissues as compared with matched noncancerous tissues (67.7%) and was associated with poor differentiation (p=0.017) and metastasis (p=0.04). Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis also showed that PAR4 protein levels were mostly decreased in lung adenocarcinoma tissues (61.3%), and were also associated with poor differentiation (p=0.035) and clinical stage (p=0.027). Moreover, PAR4 expression was decreased in NCI-H157 cells as compared with BEAS-2B cells. In conclusion, PAR4 expression is significantly decreased in lung adenocarcinoma, and down-regulation of PAR4 is associated with a more clinically aggressive phenotype. PAR4 may acts as a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma."

However, the mechanisms by which serine proteases induce mucin5AC hypersecretion have not been fully explored. In this study, we characterized human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), a serine protease that is found in the mucoid sputum of patients with chronic airway diseases and is an agonist of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2)-induced cellular responses in human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). We also investigated the potential involvement of PAR2 in this process. We found that both HAT and PAR2-AP enhance the exocytosis of mucin5AC protein, whereas HAT, but not PAR2-AP, enhances the expression of mucin5AC mRNA. PAR2 is expressed at a much higher level in the cells than the other three PARs. Transfection with an siRNA against the PAR2 receptor or Gαq/11 protein or pretreatment with the Gαq/11 protein inhibitor YM-254890, the PLC inhibitor U73122 or the intracellular Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM all effectively attenuated the HAT-induced cellular responses. Taken together, these results indicate that HAT can stimulate mucin5AC hypersecretion through a PAR2-mediated signaling pathway in 16HBE cells. Thus, PAR2 could represent a novel therapeutic target for chronic airway diseases with mucus hypersecretion."

These neurons robustly express several nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes. Smoking appears to be neuroprotective for Parkinson's disease but the mechanism is unknown. To determine whether chronic nicotine-induced changes in gene expression contribute to the neuroprotective effects of smoking, we develop methods to measure the effect of prolonged nicotine exposure on the SNc neuronal transcriptome in an unbiased manner. Twenty neurons were collected using laser-capture microscopy and transcriptional changes were assessed using RNA deep sequencing. These results are the first whole-transcriptome analyses of chronic nicotine treatment in SNc neurons. Overall, 129 genes were significantly regulated: 67 upregulated, 62 downregulated. Nicotine-induced relief of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been postulated as a potential mechanism for the neuroprotective effects of smoking. Chronic nicotine did not significantly affect the expression of ER stress-related genes, nor of dopamine-related or nAChR genes, but it did modulate expression of 129 genes that could be relevant to the neuroprotective effects of smoking, including genes involved in (1) the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, (2) cell cycle regulation, (3) chromatin modification, and (4) DNA binding and RNA regulation. We also report preliminary transcriptome data for single-cell dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons isolated from midbrain cultures. These novel techniques will facilitate advances in understanding the mechanisms taking place at the cellular level and may have applications elsewhere in the fields of neuroscience and molecular biology. The results give an emerging picture of the role of nicotine on the SNc and on dopaminergic neurons."

The role of PAR-3 has been less investigated. We examined the role of PARs in a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma PANC-1 cell line phenotype in vitro.METHODS: We knocked down PAR-1, PAR-2, or PAR-3, whereas empty vector-infected cells served as controls. Specific peptide agonists of PARs were used to stimulate the receptors. In vitro assays of colony formation, migration, and invasion were used to characterize the phenotypes, and Western analysis was used to follow cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42) expression.RESULTS: PAR-1 and PAR-2 knockdowns (KDs) were markedly less, whereas PAR-3 KDs were robustly more migratory and invasive than the controls. Stimulation of PAR-1 or PAR-2 by their peptide agonists increased, whereas PAR-3 agonist reduced the invasion of the control cells. Knockdowns of all three PARs exhibited changes in the expression of CDC42, which correlated with the changes in their invasion. Conversely, stimulation of vector-control cells with PAR-1 or PAR-2 agonists enhanced, whereas PAR-3 agonist reduced the expression of CDC42. In the respective KD cells, the effects of the agonists were abrogated.CONCLUSION: The expression and/or activation of PARs is linked to the invasiveness of PANC-1 cells in vitro, probably via modulation of the expression of CDC42."

The characteristics of PT differ from those of the pars distalis (PD), such as cell composition and gene expression, suggesting that the PT has a unique physiological function compared to the PD. Because the PT highly expresses melatonin receptor type 1, it is considered a mediator of seasonal and/or circadian signals of melatonin. Expression of neuromedin U (NMU) that is known to regulate energy balance has been previously reported in the rat PT; however, the regulatory mechanism of NMU mRNA expression and secretion in the PT are still obscure. In this study, we examined both the diurnal change of NMU mRNA expression in the rat PT and the effects of melatonin on NMU in vivo. In situ hybridization and quantitative PCR analysis of laser microdissected PT samples revealed that NMU mRNA expression in the PT has diurnal variation that is high during the light phase and low during the dark phase. Furthermore, melatonin administration significantly suppressed NMU mRNA expression in the PT in vivo. On the other hand, 48 h fasting did not have an effect on PT-NMU mRNA expression, and the diurnal change of NMU mRNA expression was maintained. We also found the highest expression of neuromedin U receptor type 2 (NMUR2) mRNA in the third ventricle ependymal cell layer, followed by the arcuate nucleus and the spinal cord. These results suggest that NMU mRNA expression in the PT is downregulated by melatonin during the dark phase and shows diurnal change. Considering that NMU mRNA in the PT showed the highest expression level in the brain, PT-NMU may act on NMUR2 in the brain, especially in the third ventricle ependymal cell layer, with a circadian rhythm."

Coagulation proteases may exert profibrotic cellular effects via protease-activated receptors (PARs)-1 and -2. Here, we investigated the potential role of two other members of the PAR family, namely PAR-3 and PAR-4, in the pathobiology of lung fibrosis. Elevated expression of PAR-3, but not PAR-4, was detected in the lungs of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients and in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Increased PAR-3 expression in fibrotic lungs was mainly attributable to alveolar type II (ATII) cells. Stimulation of primary mouse ATII, MLE15 and A549 cells with thrombin (FIIa) - that may activate PAR-1, PAR-3 and PAR-4 - induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that has been suggested to be a possible mechanism underlying the expanded (myo)fibroblast pool in lung fibrosis. EMT was evidenced by morphological alterations, expression changes of epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype markers, and functional changes. Single knockdown of FIIa receptors, PAR-1, PAR-3, or PAR-4, had no major impact on FIIa-induced EMT. Simultaneous depletion of PAR-1 and PAR-3, however, almost completely inhibited this process, whereas only a partial effect on FIIa-mediated EMT was observed when PAR-1 and PAR-4, or PAR-3 and PAR-4 were knocked down. PAR-1 and PAR-3 co-localise within ATII cells with both being predominantely plasma membrane associated. In conclusion, our study indicates that PARs synergise to mediate FIIa-induced EMT and provides first evidence that PAR-3 via its ability to potentiate FIIa-triggered EMT could potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis."

Sensitivity to the sedative effects of ethanol is inversely correlated with risk for alcoholism. However, the genes regulating ethanol sensitivity are largely unknown. Based on a previous genetic screen in Drosophila for ethanol sedation mutants, we identified a novel gene, tank (CG15626), the homolog of the mammalian tumor suppressor EI24/PIG8, which has a strong role in regulating ethanol sedation sensitivity. Genetic and behavioral analyses revealed that tank acts in the adult nervous system to promote ethanol sensitivity. We localized the function of tank in regulating ethanol sensitivity to neurons within the pars intercerebralis that have not been implicated previously in ethanol responses. We show that acutely manipulating the activity of all tank-expressing neurons, or of pars intercerebralis neurons in particular, alters ethanol sensitivity in a sexually dimorphic manner, since neuronal activation enhanced ethanol sedation in males, but not females. Finally, we provide anatomical evidence that tank-expressing neurons form likely synaptic connections with neurons expressing the neural sex determination factor fruitless (fru), which have been implicated recently in the regulation of ethanol sensitivity. We suggest that a functional interaction with fru neurons, many of which are sexually dimorphic, may account for the sex-specific effect induced by activating tank neurons. Overall, we have characterized a novel gene and corresponding set of neurons that regulate ethanol sensitivity in Drosophila."

Coagulation proteases, such as FVIIa, the binary TF-FVIIa complex, free FXa, the ternary TF-FVIIa-FXa complex and thrombin, are able to stimulate PARs. Whereas the role of PARs on platelets is well known, their function in naïve monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is largely unknown. This is of interest because PAR-mediated interactions of coagulation proteases with monocytes and PBMCs in diseases with an increased activation of coagulation may promote inflammation. To evaluate PAR-mediated inflammatory reactions in naïve monocytes and PBMCs stimulated with coagulation proteases. For this, PAR expression at protein and RNA level on naïve monocytes and PBMCs was evaluated with flow cytometry and RT-PCR. In addition, cytokine release (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α) in stimulated naïve and PBMC cell cultures was determined. In this study, it is demonstrated that naïve monocytes express all four PARs at the mRNA level, and PAR-1, -3 and -4 at the protein level. Stimulation of naïve monocytes with coagulation proteases did not result in alterations in PAR expression or in the induction of inflammation involved cytokines like interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8, interleukin-10 or tumour necrosis factor-α. In contrast, stimulation of PBMCs with coagulation proteases resulted in thrombin-mediated induction of IL-1β and IL-6 cytokine production and PBMC cell proliferation in a PAR-1-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that naïve monocytes are not triggered by coagulation proteases, whereas thrombin is able to elicit pro-inflammatory events in a PAR-1-dependent manner in PBMCs."

We first cloned the 275-bp NPY gene in buntings, with ≥95% homology with known sequences from other birds. The deduced peptide sequence contained all conserved 36 amino acids chain of the mature NPY peptide, but lacked 6 amino acids that form the NPY signal peptide. Using digosigenin-labeled riboprobe prepared from the cloned sequence, the brain cells that synthesize NPY were identified by in-situ hybridization. The NPY peptide containing cell bodies and terminals (fibers) were localized by immunocytochemistry. NPY mRNA and peptide were widespread throughout the bunting brain.

In this study, we included genera with both annual and perennial species, such as Dasypyrum, Hordeum, and Secale. BLAST pointed to Pseudoroegneria (carrier of the St genome) and possibly Thinopyrum (carrier of the J genome) as the potential next of kin. However, Thinopyrum and Pseudoroegneria have never fallen together on the individual trees with the former generally associated with Crithopsis, Aegilops, Triticum, and Dasypyrum, while the latter is usually associated with the rest of the genera within Triticeae.

A small ORF (orf4, later named parC) downstream of parAB encodes a protein with 23.7% sequence identity with ParB. ParB is also implicated in the repression of parC transcription. Nonetheless, this ParC protein does not bind to centromere-binding sites and is not essential for plasmid stability. Introduction of a frameshift mutation within ParC implicated the protein in regulation of both parAB and parC. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay confirmed a previously unreported ParC-ParB-parS partition complex. ParC also interacts directly with ParB without the mediation of the centromere sites. Deletion of the par components resulted in different plasmid copy numbers.CONCLUSIONS: A previously unreported ParC-ParB-parS partition complex is formed in pCGR2, where interaction of ParC with ParB-parS may affect the level of repression by ParB. Modifying the par components and antisense RNA enables manipulation of plasmid copy number to varying degrees.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Genetically manipulating the par components, in combination with deactivation of antisense RNA, is a novel approach to artificially elevate plasmid copy number. This approach can be applied for development of new genetic engineering tools."

Core components of the Hippo pathway include the MST1/2 and Lats1/2 kinases. Acting downstream from the Hippo pathway are the YAP/TAZ transcription coactivators, which are inhibited through phosphorylation by Lats. However, upstream signals that regulate the Hippo pathway have not been well delineated. Here we report that stimulation of protease-activated receptors (PARs) activates YAP/TAZ by decreasing phosphorylation and increasing nuclear localization. PAR1 acts through G(12/13) and Rho GTPase to inhibit the Lats1/2 kinase. Our observations establish thrombin as a physiological signal for the Hippo pathway and implicate Hippo-YAP as a key downstream signaling branch of PAR activation."

SeqFold transforms experimental RNA structure information into a structure preference profile (SPP) and uses it to select stable RNA structure candidates representing the structure ensemble. Under a high-dimensional classification framework, SeqFold efficiently matches a given SPP to the most likely cluster of structures sampled from the Boltzmann-weighted ensemble. SeqFold is able to incorporate diverse types of RNA structure profiling data, including parallel analysis of RNA structure (PARS), selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq), fragmentation sequencing (FragSeq) data generated by deep sequencing, and conventional SHAPE data. Using the known structures of a wide range of mRNAs and noncoding RNAs as benchmarks, we demonstrate that SeqFold outperforms or matches existing approaches in accuracy and is more robust to noise in experimental data. Application of SeqFold to reconstruct the secondary structures of the yeast transcriptome reveals the diverse impact of RNA secondary structure on gene regulation, including translation efficiency, transcription initiation, and protein-RNA interactions. SeqFold can be easily adapted to incorporate any new types of high-throughput RNA structure profiling data and is widely applicable to analyze RNA structures in any transcriptome."

Recent reports including our own indicated that ectopic Pink1 expression is protective against toxic insult in vitro, suggesting a potential role for endogenous Pink1 in mediating survival. However, the role of endogenous Pink1 in survival, particularly in vivo, is unclear. To address this critical question, we examined whether down-regulation of Pink1 affects dopaminergic neuron loss following 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in the adult mouse. Two model systems were utilized: virally delivered shRNA-mediated knockdown of Pink1 and germ line-deficient mice. In both instances, loss of Pink1 generated significant sensitivity to damage induced by systemic MPTP treatment. This sensitivity was associated with greater loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta and terminal dopamine fiber density in the striatum region. Importantly, we also show that viral mediated expression of two other recessive PD-linked familial genes, DJ-1 and Parkin, can protect dopaminergic neurons even in the absence of Pink1. This evidence not only provides strong evidence for the role of endogenous Pink1 in neuronal survival, but also supports a role of DJ-1 and Parkin acting parallel or downstream of endogenous Pink1 to mediate survival in a mammalian in vivo context."

The unexpected action of SRY in the control of voluntary movement in male rodents suggests a role in the regulation of dopamine transmission and dopamine-related disorders with gender bias, such as Parkinson's disease. We investigated SRY expression in the human brain and function in vitro. SRY immunoreactivity was detected in the human male, but not female substantia nigra pars compacta, within a sub-population of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons. SRY protein also co-localized with TH positive neurons in the ventral tegmental area, and with GAD-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Retinoic acid-induced differentiation of human precursor NT2 cells into dopaminergic cells increased expression of TH, NURR1, D2 R and SRY. In the human neuroblastoma cell line, M17, SRY knockdown resulted in a reduction in TH, DDC, DBH and MAO-A expression; enzymes which control dopamine synthesis and metabolism. Conversely, SRY over-expression increased TH, DDC, DBH, D2 R and MAO-A levels, accompanied by increased extracellular dopamine levels. A luciferase assay demonstrated that SRY activated a 4.6 kb 5' upstream regulatory region of the human TH promoter/nigral enhancer. Combined, these results suggest that SRY plays a role as a positive regulator of catecholamine synthesis and metabolism in the human male midbrain. This ancillary genetic mechanism might contribute to gender bias in fight-flight behaviours in men or their increased susceptibility to dopamine disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia."

However, head involution in Drosophila has impeded a systematic identification of genes required for insect head formation. Therefore, we use the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum in order to comprehensively test the function of orthologs of vertebrate neural plate patterning genes for a function in insect head development. RNAi analysis reveals that most of these genes are indeed required for insect head capsule patterning, and we also identified several genes that had not been implicated in this process before. Furthermore, we show that Tc-six3/optix acts upstream of Tc-wingless, Tc-orthodenticle1, and Tc-eyeless to control anterior median development. Finally, we demonstrate that Tc-six3/optix is the first gene known to be required for the embryonic formation of the central complex, a midline-spanning brain part connected to the neuroendocrine pars intercerebralis. These functions are very likely conserved among bilaterians since vertebrate six3 is required for neuroendocrine and median brain development with certain mutations leading to holoprosencephaly."

Structurally, proximal tubules can be divided into three segments. The first segment, segment 1 (S1) is mainly confined to the pars convoluta, the second segment, segment 2 (S2) comprises the end of pars convoluta, and the third segment, segment 3 (S3) includes the major part of the pars recta. There are some reports describing angiotensinogen localization in kidneys; however, it remains uncertain which proximal tubule segments express angiotensinogen. To determine the detailed localization of angiotensinogen in the three proximal tubule segments, we established multistaining methods using segment-specific protein markers.METHODS: Using kidneys from Wistar-Kyoto rats, we performed immunohistochemistry and double or triple staining by fluorescence in-situ hybridization and/or immunofluorescence.RESULTS: Our results show that angiotensinogen mRNA and protein are expressed in the cortex and outer medulla of the normal rat kidney. Angiotensinogen mRNA was hardly detected in S1, detected weakly in S2 and strongly in S3 segments. In contrast, angiotensinogen protein was detected in S1 at high levels and less in S2 and S3 segments.CONCLUSION: These data indicate divergence of angiotensinogen mRNA transcription and angiotensinogen protein synthesis and metabolism in different segments of the normal rat proximal tubules."

TF also participates in protease-activated receptor (PAR)1 and PAR2 activation. Human epithelial basal cells were previously purified on the basis of TF expression. The purpose of this study was to determine if tracheobronchial epithelial basal cell-associated TF drives coagulation and/or activates PARs to promote basal cell functions. We used human tracheobronchial tissues to isolate human airway epithelial cells using specific cell surface markers by flow cytometry and studied TF expression by immunostaining. TF-dependent fibrin network formation was observed by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. TF knockdown was done using short hairpin RNA, and TF mRNA was measured using quantitative RT-PCR. We found that 97 ± 5% of first-passage human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were basal cells, and 100% of these basal cells expressed TF. Basal cell-associated TF was active, but TF activity was dependent on added extrinsic coagulation cascade factors. TF inhibition caused basal cell apoptosis and necrosis. This was due to two parallel but interdependent TF-regulated processes: failure to generate a basal cell-associated fibrin network and suboptimal PAR1 and PAR2 activity. The data indicate that membrane surface TF mediates airway epithelial basal cell attachment, which maintains cell survival and mitotic potential. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of basal cell-associated TF activity in normal and injured tissues and of the potential for repair of airway epithelium in lung disease."

FGL2 downregulation was performed by targeting microRNA in a HCCLM6 cell line in which FGL2 was highly expressed in xenografts of nude mice. The effects of FGL2 knockdown on tumour growth and angiogenesis were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Cytometric bead arrays were employed to identify FGL2-regulated signalling pathways.RESULTS: FGL2 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and colocalized with fibrin deposition. Knockdown of FGL2 expression in HCCLM6 cells (hFGL2(low) HCCLM6) resulted in delayed xenografts tumour growth within an observation period of 42 days and decreased vascularization, which was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In vitro hFGL2(low) HCCLM6 cells exhibited decreased proliferation without significant induction of apoptosis. Overexpression of FGL2 in HCCLM6 cells or addition of recombinant hFGL2 protein induced phosphorylation of p38-MAPK and ERK1/2 involving protease-activated receptors (PARs).activation.CONCLUSIONS: FGL2 contributes to HCC tumour growth and angiogenesis in a thrombin-dependent manner, and downregulation of its expression might be of therapeutic significance in HCC."

The weakly electric fish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus (Apt), has been well studied for its brain structure, behavior, sensory processing, and learning and memory. It therefore offers an attractive model for comparative studies of CB1R functions. We sequenced partial AptCB1R mRNAs and performed in situ hybridization to localize its expression. Partial AptCB1R protein sequence was highly conserved to zebrafish (90.7%) and mouse (81.9%) orthologs. AptCB1R mRNA was highly expressed in the telencephalon. Subpallial neurons (dorsal, central, intermediate regions and part of the ventral region, Vd/Vc/Vi, and Vv) expressed high levels of AptCB1R transcript. The central region of dorsocentral telencephalon (DC(core) ) strongly expressed CB1R mRNA; cells in DC(core) project to midbrain regions involved in electrosensory/visual function. The lateral and rostral regions of DC surrounding DC(core) (DC(shell) ) lack AptCB1R mRNA. The rostral division of the dorsomedial telencephalon (DM1) highly expresses AptCB1R mRNA. In dorsolateral division (DL) AptCB1R mRNA was expressed in a gradient that declined in a rostrocaudal manner. In diencephalon, AptCB1R RNA probe weakly stained the central-posterior (CP) and prepacemaker (PPn) nuclei. In mesencephalon, AptCB1R mRNA is expressed in deep layers of the dorsal (electrosensory) torus semicircularis (TSd). In hindbrain, AptCB1R RNA probe weakly labeled inhibitory interneurons in the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). Unlike mammals, only few cerebellar granule cells expressed AptCB1R transcripts and these were located in the center of eminentia granularis pars posterior (EGp), a cerebellar region involved in feedback to ELL."

The mRNA expression of TSHβ and αGSU in PT has a circadian rhythm and is inhibited by melatonin via melatonin receptor type 1; however, the detailed regulatory mechanism for TSHβ expression in the PT remains unclear. To identify the factors that affect PT, a microarray analysis was performed on laser-captured PT tissue to screen for genes coding for receptors that are abundantly expressed in the PT. In the PT, we found high expression of the KA2, which is an ionotropic glutamic acid receptor (iGluR). In addition, the amino acid transporter A2 (ATA2), also known as the glutamine transporter, and glutaminase (GLS), as well as GLS2, were highly expressed in the PT compared to the PD. We examined the effects of glutamine and glutamic acid on TSHβ expression and αGSU expression in PT slice cultures. l-Glutamine and l-glutamic acid significantly stimulated TSHβ expression in PT slices after 2- and 4-h treatments, and the effect of l-glutamic acid was stronger than that of l-glutamine. In contrast, treatment with glutamine and glutamic acid did not affect αGSU expression in the PT or the expression of TSHβ or αGSU in the PD. These results strongly suggest that glutamine is taken up by PT cells through ATA2 and that glutamic acid locally converted from glutamine by Gls induces TSHβ expression via the KA2 in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner in the PT."

The formation of mRNA secondary and tertiary structures is one such regulatory process that until recently it has not been analysed in depth. Formation of these mRNA structures has the potential to enhance and inhibit alternative splicing of transcripts, and regulate rates and amount of translation. As this regulatory mechanism potentially impacts at both the transcriptional and translational level, while also potentially utilising the vast array of non-coding RNAs, it warrants further investigation. Currently, a variety of high-throughput sequencing techniques including parallel analysis of RNA structure (PARS), fragmentation sequencing (FragSeq) and selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) lead the way in the genome-wide identification and analysis of mRNA structure formation. These new sequencing techniques highlight the diversity and complexity of the transcriptome, and demonstrate another regulatory mechanism that could become a target for new therapeutic approaches."

Endothelial protease-activated receptors (PARs) are potential serine protease targets in glomerulonephritis. We investigated whether PAR1/2 are required for alterations in GEC phenotype that are mediated by PR3 or elastase during active glomerulonephritis. Endothelial PARs were assessed by flow cytometry. Thrombin, trypsin and agonist peptides for PAR1 and PAR2, TFLLR-NH(2) and SLIGKV-NH(2,) respectively, were used to assess alterations in PAR activation induced by PR3 or elastase. Endothelial von Willebrand Factor (vWF)release and calcium signaling were used as PAR activation markers. Both PR3 and elastase induced endothelial vWF release, with elastase inducing the highest response. PAR1 peptide induced GEC vWF release to the same extent as PR3. However, knockdown of PARs by small interfering RNA showed that neither PAR1 nor PAR2 activation caused PR3 or elastase-mediated vWF release. Both proteases interacted with and disarmed surface GEC PAR1, but there was no detectable interaction with cellular PAR2. Neither protease induced a calcium response in GEC. Therefore, PAR signaling and serine protease-induced alterations in endothelial function modulate glomerular inflammation via parallel but independent pathways."

All of the elements required for their replication and stable maintenance are encoded within a single transcription unit: the repABC operon. The repC gene encodes an initiator protein, while RepA, RepB and centromere-like sequence (parS) direct plasmid segregation. Strains containing two or more repABC plasmids are a common feature in some alpha proteobacteria groups, indicating that the repABC plasmid family embraces several incompatibility groups. Genes encoded within repABC operons are highly dynamic: each one possess its own distinctive phylogeny and homologous recombination events are common within these operons. Additionally, alpha-proteobacterial genomes contain repAB genes not associated with the ctRNA or with repC as well as plasmids whose replication depends on a ctRNA-repC module without the participation of repAB genes. Some alphaproteobacteria have repC genes clustered with other genes that are not involved in replication/partitioning functions. These atypical associations of genes could have an important role in the origin and diversification of new plasmids. Here we evaluated the functionality and possible evolutionary consequences of one of these atypical gene associations: the repAC genes present in the Rhizobium leguminosarum plasmid pRL7. The repAC genes are organized in an operon and they are capable of sustaining replication but in an unstable manner. RepC was essential for replication, and the origin of replication resides within its coding region. In contrast, RepA plays a minor role in the negative regulation of its own transcription."

Forkhead box-O (FoxO) transcription factors regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, but a possible functional interaction between thrombin and FoxO factors has not been identified to date. In human cultured vascular SMC, thrombin induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of FoxO1 and FoxO3 but not FoxO4. This effect was mimicked by an activating-peptide (AP) for protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1, and abolished by a PAR-1 antagonist (SCH79797). APs for other PARs were without effect. FoxO1 and FoxO3 phosphorylation were prevented by the PI3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 while inhibitors of ERK1/2 (PD98059) or p38MAPK (SB203580) were ineffective. LY294002 moreover prevented thrombin-stimulated SMC mitogenesis and proliferation. FoxO1 and FoxO3 siRNA augmented basal DNA synthesis and proliferation of SMC. Nuclear content of FoxO proteins decreased time-dependently in response to thrombin, coincided with suppressed expression of the cell cycle regulating genes p21CIP1 and p27kip1 by thrombin. FoxO1 siRNA reduced basal p21CIP1 while FoxO3 siRNA attenuated p27kip1 expression; thrombin did not show additive effects. LY294002 restored p21CIP1 and p27kip1 protein expression. Immunohistochemistry revealed that human native and failed saphenous vein grafts were characterised by the cytosolic presence of p-FoxO factors in co-localisation of p21CIP1 and p27kip1 with SMC. In conclusion, thrombin and FoxO factors functionally interact through PI3K/Akt-dependent FoxO phosphorylation leading to expression of cell cycle regulating genes and ultimately SMC proliferation. This may contribute to remodelling and failure of saphenous vein bypass grafts."

In the present study, we examined potential influence of IL-29 on PAR expression and cytokine production in P815 and bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) by using flow cytometry analysis, quantitative real time PCR, and ELISA techniques. The results showed that IL-29 downregulated the expression of PAR-1 by up to 56.2%, but had little influence on the expression of PAR-2, PAR-3 and PAR-4. IL-29 also induced downregulation of expression of PAR-1 mRNA. However, when mast cells were pre-incubated with IL-29, thrombin-, trypsin- and tryptase-induced expression of PAR-2, PAR-3 and PAR-4 was upregulated, respectively. IL-29 provoked approximately up to 1.9-fold increase in IL-4 release when mast cells was challenged with IL-29. Administration of IL-29 blocking antibody, AG490 or LY294002 abolished IL-29-induced IL-4 release from P815 cells. It was found that IL-29 diminished trypsin- and tryptase-induced IL-4 release from P815 cells following 16 h incubation.

Demographic data, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes were analyzed.RESULTS: Thirteen eyes of 13 patients with mean age of 61.1 years, consisting of 7 men and 6 women were included. Twelve of 13 eyes (92%) underwent uncomplicated clear cornea phacoemulsification with posterior lens implant. Mean interval from surgery to onset of symptoms was 6.3 weeks, and time to referral ranged from 2 days to 9 months. Ten eyes (77%) presented with stromal wound abscess, whereas 3 (23%) appeared as iridocyclitis with posterior capsule plaques. Five eyes were clustered while the rest were isolated cases. All cases were culture positive for NTM. Two cases were treated medically, 3 had removal of lens implant and capsule, and 8 had penetrating keratoplasty with or without removal of lens implant, iridectomy, and/or pars plana vitrectomy. After a mean follow-up of almost 22 months, best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better was achieved in half of the cases (54%).

PDE2A is expressed at high levels in the mammalian brain. To advance our understanding of the role of this enzyme in regulation of neuronal signaling, we here describe the distribution of PDE2A in the rat brain. PDE2A mRNA was prominently expressed in glutamatergic pyramidal cells in cortex, and in pyramidal and dentate granule cells in the hippocampus. Protein concentrated in the axons and nerve terminals of these neurons; staining was markedly weaker in the cell bodies and proximal dendrites. In addition, in both hippocampus and cortex, small populations of non-pyramidal cells, presumed to be interneurons, were strongly immunoreactive. PDE2A mRNA was expressed in medium spiny neurons in neostriatum. Little immunoreactivity was observed in cell bodies, whereas dense immunoreactivity was found in the axon tracts of these neurons and their terminal regions in globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Immunostaining was dense in the medial habenula, but weak in other diencephalic regions. In midbrain and hindbrain, immunostaining was restricted to discrete regions of the neuropil or clusters of cell bodies. These results suggest that PDE2A may modulate cortical, hippocampal and striatal networks at several levels. Preferential distribution of PDE2A into axons and terminals of the principal neurons suggests roles in regulation of axonal excitability or transmitter release. The enzyme is also in forebrain interneurons, and in mid- and hindbrain neurons that may modulate forebrain networks and circuits."

Secretogranin III (SCG3), a member of the multifunctional granin family, plays a key role in neurotransmitter storage and transport and in secretory granule biogenesis, which involves the uptake of exogenous toxins and endogenous &quot;toxins&quot; in neuroendocrine cells. However, the molecular mechanisms of neurotoxin-induced apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons and the role of SCG3-associated signaling pathways in neuroendocrine regulation are unclear. To address this, we used PQ- and DA-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y human dopaminergic cells as an in vitro model to investigate the association between SCG3 expression level and apoptosis. SCG3 was highly expressed in SH-SY5Y cells, and SCG3 mRNA and protein levels were dramatically decreased after PQ treatment. Apoptosis induced by PQ is associated with caspase activation and decreased SCG3 expression, and restoration of SCG3 expression is observed after treatment with caspase inhibitors. Overexpressed SCG3 in nonneuronal cells and endogenous SCG3 in SH-SY5Y cells are cleaved into specific fragments by recombinant caspase-3 and -7, but the fragments were not detected in PQ-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Therefore, SCG3 may be involved in apoptosis signal transduction as a caspase substrate, leading to loss of its original biological functions. In addition, SCG3 may be a pivotal component of the neuroendocrine pathway and play an important role in neuronal communication and neurotransmitter release, possibly representing a new potential target in the course of PD pathogenesis."

In this study, we investigate molecular events triggered by cell exposure to the mitochondrial toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+) using whole genome-expression microarray, Western Blot and metabolic studies. The data show that MPP+ (500 μM) obstructs mitochondrial respiration/oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells, juxtaposing accelerated glucose consumption and production of lactic acid. While additional glucose concentrations restored viability in the presence of MPP+ (500 μM), the loss of OXPHOS was sustained, suggesting that compensatory anaerobic metabolic systems were fulfilling required energy needs. Under these conditions, MPP+ initiated significant changes to the transcription of 439 genes of which 287 DAVID IDs were identified and subsequent functional annotation clusters identified. Prominent changes were as follows; MPP+ initiated loss of mRNA for mitochondrial encoded 3-hydroxybutyratedehydrogenase, type 2(Bdh2), tv1, NADH dehydrogenase 4,5 genes, cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein 3, concomitant to rise in a mitochondrial fission gene; ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated-protein 1 (GDAP1). The negative changes to OXPHOS components were accompanied by protective forces within the mitochondria espousing elevated ratio of anti/pro-apoptotic processes. These included a loss of apoptotic Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa-interacting protein (BNIP3) and family with sequence similarity 162, member A (FAM162a) and rise of heat shock protein 1 and Lon peptidase 1. There were no changes indicative of free radical damage (e.g. SOD, GSH-Px), rather MPP+ initiated significant elevation in G protein signaling components (which trigger catabolic processes) and anaerobic metabolic systems involving carboxylic acid/transamination reactions (e.g. glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1), glutamic pyruvate-alanine transaminase 2 (GPT2), cystathionase and redox proteins such as cytochrome b5 reductase 1 and ferredoxin reductase. Counter-intuitively, the data show reduction of mRNA in glycolytic processes [DAVID enrichment score 9.96 p value 1.90E-19], some corroborated by Western Blot, bringing in to question the sources of lactate observed in the presence of MPP+. Examining this aspect, the data show that diverse carboxylic acids (succinate, oxaloacetate and a-ketoglutarate) are capable of contributing to the lactate pool in addition to phosph(enolpyruvate) or pyruvate in the absence of glucose by this cell line. In conclusion, these findings show that MPP+ negatively affects the transcriptome involved with complex I, but initiated an elevation of G protein signaling and anaerobic metabolic systems involved with nitrogen/carboxylic acid metabolism. Future research will be required to elucidate the survival pathways that drive anaerobic substrate level phosphorylation, and define functional ramification to the loss of mitochondrial FAM162a and BNIP3 proteins."

No conclusive evidence, however, has been provided to demonstrate the existence of A(2A)Rs in the output nuclei of the basal ganglia: the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques we have confirmed the presence of A(2A)Rs in both the striatum (medium spiny and cholinergic neurons) and the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), in the monkey. The antibody routinely used to label A(2A)Rs failed to detect A(2A)R-positive neurons in the GPi and SNr, however, in situ hybridization showed that A(2A)R mRNA transcripts were indeed present in both these nuclei. Surprisingly, by labeling pallidothalamic and nigrothalamic projection neurons originating in the GPi and SNr with the neuronal retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB), the receptor protein was unmasked and detectable using the antibody. This unmasking of the protein was specific to CTB and not an artifact of the tracer. We have shown unequivocally that the A(2A)R is present in the output nuclei of the primate basal ganglia, however, to be able to detect the receptor immunohistochemically, unmasking the protein with CTB was necessary. The presence of A(2A)Rs in the GPi and SNr suggests that these output nuclei could be targeted therapeutically in Parkinson disease to restore abnormal activity in the basal ganglia."

Hyposmotically-induced PRL release is mediated by the inward movement of extracellular Ca(2+) through a stretch-activated Ca(2+) channel, which has been recently identified as the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4). In the present study, changes in plasma PRL, as well as PRL and TRPV4 mRNA expression from the rostral pars distalis (RPD), were measured in fish transferred from seawater (SW) to fresh water (FW) and in fish transferred from FW to SW. The in vitro effects of osmolality on PRL release and on PRL and TRPV4 mRNA expression in dispersed PRL cells were compared between fish adapted to SW and FW. Both the release and expression of PRL fell when fish were transferred to SW and rose when fish were transferred to FW. By contrast, TRPV4 expression increased by 48h after fish were transferred from FW to SW and declined as early as 6h after transfer from SW to FW. A similar pattern was observed in vitro where TRPV4 expression responded positively to an increase in medium osmolality while PRL expression declined. Incubation with the Ca(2+) ionophore, A23187, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, stimulated PRL release. While both IBMX and A23187 inhibited TRPV4 expression, only A23187 reduced PRL expression. Together, these findings indicate that the expression of TRPV4 mRNA is osmosensitive, increasing as extracellular osmolality rises. Furthermore, these data suggest that TRPV4 expression may be regulated through the same second messenger pathways involved in hyposmotically-induced PRL release."

In particular, epidemiological studies have found that pesticide exposure and infections may be linked with the incidence of PD. The present study sought to determine whether exposure to a viral mimic prior to exposure to pesticides would exacerbate PD-like pathology.METHODS: Mice received a supra-nigral infusion of 5 μg of the double-stranded RNA viral analog, polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), followed 2, 7 or 14 days later by administration of the pesticide, paraquat (nine 10 mg/kg injections over three weeks).RESULTS: As hypothesized, poly(I:C) pre-treatment enhanced dopamine (DA) neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta elicited by subsequent paraquat treatment. The augmented neuronal loss was accompanied by robust signs of microglial activation, and by increased expression of the catalytic subunit (gp91) of the NADPH oxidase oxidative stress enzyme. However, the paraquat and poly(I:C) treatments did not appreciably affect home-cage activity, striatal DA terminals, or subventricular neurogenesis.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that viral agents can sensitize microglial-dependent inflammatory responses, thereby rendering nigral DA neurons vulnerable to further environmental toxin exposure."

Pathological conditions cause altered expression of PARs in brain cells and therefore altered responsiveness to PAR activation. The exact mechanisms of regulation of PAR expression are not well studied. Here, we evaluated in rat astrocytes the influence of LPS, pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1β and continuous PAR activation by PAR agonists on the expression levels of PARs. These stimuli are important in inflammatory and neurological disorders, where their levels are increased. We report that LPS as well as cytokines TNFα and IL-1β affected only the PAR-2 level, but their effects were opposite. LPS and TNFα increased the functional expression of PAR-2, whereas IL-1β down-regulated the functional response of PAR-2. Agonists of PAR-1 specifically increased mRNA level of PAR-2, but not protein level. Transcript levels of other PARs were not changed after PAR-1 activation. Stimulation of the cells with PAR-2 or PAR-4 agonists did not alter PAR levels. We found that up-regulation of PAR-2 is dependent on PKC activity, mostly via its Ca²⁺-sensitive isoforms. Two transcription factors, NFκB and AP-1, are involved in up-regulation of PAR-2. These findings provide new information about the regulation of expression of PAR subtypes in brain cells. This is of importance for targeting PARs, especially PAR-2, for the treatment of CNS disorders."

The characteristics of PT, including cell shape and cell composition, differ from those of the pars distalis (PD), suggesting that PT has unique physiological functions and different morphogenesis compared to PD. In this study, we used chicken embryos and showed for the first time that most hormone-producing cells in PT at embryonic day (E) 20.0 were only glycoprotein α subunit (αGSU)-positive staining cells. Then, using serial frontal and sagittal sections, we examined the detailed distribution of the αGSU mRNA-expressing region, as a marker of PT in the chicken embryonic pituitary gland during the E3.0-20.0 period. This three-dimensional expression pattern analysis clarified that αGSU mRNA expression initially appeared only in the bilateral regions of the Rathke's recess (RR) at E3.5, and this region expanded and showed a ring-like structure on RR. Subsequently, this αGSU mRNA-expressing region gradually expanded upward and reached the diencephalon at E8.0. This region became thinner as it surrounded the base of the diencephalon from E12.0 to E20.0. In this study, we demonstrated the detailed morphological changes of the chicken PT primordium by detecting αGSU mRNA, and we also showed that PT is a unique region in the early developmental stage."

The common bile duct is exposed to many proteinases that can activate PARs, especially during infection and stone obstruction. We investigated PAR effects on common bile duct motility in vitro. Contraction and relaxation of isolated guinea pig common bile duct strips caused by PAR(1), PAR(2) and PAR(4) agonists were measured using isometric transducers. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine the expression of PAR(1) and PAR(2). Thrombin and two PAR(1) peptide agonists, TFLLR-NH(2) and SFLLRN-NH(2), evoked moderate relaxation of the carbachol-contracted common bile duct in a concentration-dependent manner. Trypsin and three PAR(2) peptide agonists, 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH(2), SLIGKV-NH(2) and SLIGRL-NH(2), generated moderate to marked relaxation as well. The existence of PAR(1) and PAR(2) mRNA in the common bile duct was identified by RT-PCR. Moreover, two PAR(4)-selective agonists, AYPGKF-NH(2) and GYPGQV-NH(2), produced relaxation of the common bile duct. In contrast, all PAR(1), PAR(2) and PAR(4) inactive control peptides did not elicit relaxation. This indicates that PAR(1), PAR(2) and PAR(4) mediate common bile duct relaxation. The thrombin, TFLLR-NH(2), trypsin, and AYPGKF-NH(2)-induced responses were not affected by tetrodotoxin, implying that the PAR effects are not neurally mediated. Our findings provide the first evidence that PAR(1) and PAR(2) mediate whereas agonists of PAR(4) elicit relaxation of the guinea pig common bile duct. Trypsin and thrombin relax the common bile duct. PARs may play an important role in the control of common bile duct motility."

Little is known about the roles of FSH and LH during spermatogenesis in perciform fishes. In this study, we examined immunoreactive changes in FSH and LH cells, and changes in the gene expression of the three gonadotropin subunits in the pituitary of male chub mackerel Scomber japonicus during testicular development. FSHβ-immunoreactive (ir) and LHβ-ir cell area were measured immuno-histochemically based on the FSH and LH cell-occupying area in the proximal pars distalis. The FSHβ-ir cell area increased significantly during spermiation, while FSHβ mRNA levels, already high at the beginning of spermatogenesis, increased further, peaking during spermiation. In contrast, LHβ-ir cell area and LHβ mRNA levels, which were low at the beginning of spermatogenesis, increased significantly during late spermatogenesis, peaking during spermiation. For both FSH and LH, GtHβ-ir cell area and GtHβ mRNA levels decreased until gonadal resting. GPα mRNA levels showed similar changes to LHβ mRNA levels. These results suggest that in the chub mackerel, FSH may play an important role in the early and late phases of spermatogenesis, and that LH may play a role during late spermatogenesis and spermiation. Moreover, our results demonstrate that changes in GtHβ-ir cell area were accompanied by similar changes in the expression of the FSHβ and LHβ genes, both of which increased during testicular development."

The new species differs from Gymnophalloides tokiensis, Gymnophalloides seoi , and Gymnophalloides heardi mainly through the presence of a group of papillae located on the ventral surface between oral and ventral suckers. A detailed morphological study revealed the lack of pars prostatica, a character previously reported in G. seoi , which is why it was formerly placed in the Gymnophallinae. Molecular information proved that G. nacellae is close to G. seoi , being nestled together with Parvatrema representatives. This molecular information, along with the absence of pars prostatica, allows these 2 genera to be placed in Parvatrematinae. An amended diagnosis of Gymnophalloides is provided.

In teleost fish, SL is encoded by one or two paralogous genes, namely SL-α and -β. Our previous studies have revealed that pituitary adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide stimulates SL release from cultured goldfish pituitary cells, whereas melanin-concentrating hormone suppresses this release. As in other fish, the goldfish possesses SL-α and -β. So far, however, no useful means of detecting the respective SLs immunologically in this species has been possible. In order to achieve this aim, we raised rabbit antisera against synthetic peptide fragments deduced from the goldfish SL-α and -β cDNA sequences. Using these antisera, we observed adenohypophyseal cells showing SL-α- and -β-like immunoreactivities in the goldfish pituitary, especially the pars intermedia (PI). Several cells in the PI showed the colocalization of SL-α- and -β-like immunoreactivities. Then, using single-cell polymerase chain reaction with laser microdissection, we examined SL-α and -β gene expression in adenohypophyseal cells showing SL-α- or -β-like immunoreactivity. Among cultured pituitary cells, we observed three types of cell: those that possess transcripts of SL-α, -β, or both. These results suggest a polymorphism of SL-producing cells in the goldfish pituitary."

In this study, to understand the relationship between the δ-crys mRNA-expressing region and RP formation, we examined the embryonic expression pattern of δ-crys mRNA in the primordium of the adenohypophysis. δ-crys mRNA expression was initially found at stage 15 anterior to the foregut and posterior to the invaginated oral ectoderm. After RP formation, the δ-crys mRNA was expressed in the post-ventral region of RP and the anterior region of RP. δ-crys mRNA expression was then restricted to the cephalic lobe of the pituitary gland. From stage 20, the δ-crys and alpha-glycoprotein subunit (αGSU) mRNA-expressing regions were almost completely overlapping. The αGSU mRNA-expressing region is thought to be the primordium of the pars tuberalis, and these regions were overlapped with the Lhx3 mRNA-expressing region. The intensity of δ-crys mRNA expression gradually decreased with development and completely disappeared by stage 34. These results suggest that the embryonic chick pituitary gland consists of two different regions labeled with δ-crys and Lhx3."

In Parkinson's disease, DA cell bodies within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) progressively degenerate, with causes and mechanisms poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that Wnt signaling via Frizzled (Fzd) receptors may play a role in different degenerative states, but little is known about Wnt signaling in the adult midbrain. Using in vitro and in vivo model systems of DA degeneration, along with functional studies in both intact and SN lesioned mice, we herein highlight an intrinsic Wnt1/Fzd-1/β-catenin tone critically contributing to the survival and protection of adult midbrain DA neurons.RESULTS: In vitro experiments identifie Fzd-1 receptor expression at a mRNA and protein levels in dopamine transporter (DAT) expressing neurons, and demonstrate the ability of exogenous Wnt1 to exert robust neuroprotective effects against Caspase-3 activation, the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) neurons and [3H] dopamine uptake induced by different DA-specific insults, including serum and growth factor deprivation, 6-hydroxydopamine and MPTP/MPP+. Co-culture of DA neurons with midbrain astrocytes phenocopies Wnt1 neuroprotective effects, whereas RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Wnt1 in midbrain astrocytes markedly reduces astrocyte-induced TH+ neuroprotection. Likewise, silencing β-catenin mRNA or knocking down Fzd-1 receptor expression in mesencephalic neurons counteract astrocyte-induced TH+ neuroprotection. In vivo experiments document Fzd-1 co-localization with TH+ neurons within the intact SNpc and blockade of Fzd/β-catenin signaling by unilateral infusion of a Fzd/β-catenin antagonist within the SN induces reactive astrocytosis and acutely inhibits TH+ neuron survival in ipsilateral SNpc, an effect efficiently prevented by pharmacological activation of β-catenin signaling within the SNpc.CONCLUSION: These results defining a novel Wnt1/Fzd-1/β-catenin astrocyte-DA autoprotective loop provide a new mechanistic inside into the regulation of pro-survival processes, with potentially relevant consequences for drug design or drug action in Parkinson's disease."

We report that exogenous Engrailed-1 and Engrailed-2 (collectively Engrailed) protect mDA neurons from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a mitochondrial complex I toxin used to model Parkinson's disease in animals. Engrailed enhances the translation of nuclearly encoded mRNAs for two key complex I subunits, Ndufs1 and Ndufs3, and increases complex I activity. Accordingly, in vivo protection against MPTP by Engrailed is antagonized by Ndufs1 small interfering RNA. An association between Engrailed and complex I is further confirmed by the reduced expression of Ndufs1 and Ndufs3 in the substantia nigra pars compacta of En1 heterozygous mice. Engrailed also confers in vivo protection against 6-hydroxydopamine and α-synuclein-A30P. Finally, the unilateral infusion of Engrailed into the midbrain increases striatal dopamine content, resulting in contralateral amphetamine-induced turning. Therefore, Engrailed is both a survival factor for adult mDA neurons and a regulator of their physiological activity."

In the brain, excess superoxide production predicts neuronal cell loss, suggesting that Parkinson's disease (PD) with its wholesale death of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (nigra) may be a case in point. Although microglial NADPH oxidase-produced superoxide contributes to dopaminergic neuron death in an MPTP mouse model of PD, this is secondary to an initial die off of such neurons, suggesting that the initial MPTP-induced death of neurons may be via activation of NADPH oxidase in neurons themselves, thus providing an early therapeutic target.METHODS: NADPH oxidase subunits were visualized in adult mouse nigra neurons and in N27 rat dopaminergic cells by immunofluorescence. NADPH oxidase subunits in N27 cell cultures were detected by immunoblots and RT-PCR. Superoxide was measured by flow cytometric detection of H2O2-induced carboxy-H2-DCFDA fluorescence. Cells were treated with MPP+ (MPTP metabolite) following siRNA silencing of the Nox2-stabilizing subunit p22phox, or simultaneously with NADPH oxidase pharmacological inhibitors or with losartan to antagonize angiotensin II type 1 receptor-induced NADPH oxidase activation.RESULTS: Nigral dopaminergic neurons in situ expressed three subunits necessary for NADPH oxidase activation, and these as well as several other NADPH oxidase subunits and their encoding mRNAs were detected in unstimulated N27 cells. Overnight MPP+ treatment of N27 cells induced Nox2 protein and superoxide generation, which was counteracted by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, by siRNA silencing of p22phox, or losartan. A two-wave ROS cascade was identified: 1) as a first wave, mitochondrial H2O2 production was first noted at three hours of MPP+ treatment; and 2) as a second wave, H2O2 levels were further increased by 24 hours. This second wave was eliminated by pharmacological inhibitors and a blocker of protein synthesis.CONCLUSIONS: A two-wave cascade of ROS production is active in nigral dopaminergic neurons in response to neurotoxicity-induced superoxide. Our findings allow us to conclude that superoxide generated by NADPH oxidase present in nigral neurons contributes to the loss of such neurons in PD. Losartan suppression of nigral-cell superoxide production suggests that angiotensin receptor blockers have potential as PD preventatives."

High PAR1 expression has been documented in a variety of invasive cancers of epithelial origin. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of the four PAR family members to motility of lung carcinomas and primary tumor samples from patients. We found that of the four PARs, only PAR1 expression was highly increased in the lung cancer cell lines. Primary lung cancer cells isolated from patient lung tumors migrated at a 10- to 40-fold higher rate than epithelial cells isolated from nonmalignant lung tissue. Cell-penetrating pepducin inhibitors were generated against the first (i1) and third (i3) intracellular loops of PAR1 and tested for their ability to inhibit PAR1-driven migration and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activity. The PAR1 pepducins showed significant inhibition of cell migration in both primary and established cell lines similar to silencing of PAR1 expression with short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Unlike i1 pepducins, the i3 loop pepducins were effective inhibitors of PAR1-mediated ERK activation and tumor growth. Comparable in efficacy with Bevacizumab, monotherapy with the PAR1 i3 loop pepducin P1pal-7 provided significant 75% inhibition of lung tumor growth in nude mice.

Most epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that PD has a higher prevalence in males than in females. Both hormones and genetic factors have been considered to be contributors to this phenomenon. In the present study, we used primary cultures of ventral mesencephalic (VM) neurons from E13.5 Balb/C mice to investigate whether there were any gender differences in gene expression and cell sensitivity to oxidative stress in sex segregated cultures. We also investigated the role of SRY, the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome, and the female hormone estrogen in the gender dimorphism. We measured the expression levels of genes that previously were thought to be related to PD or DA neuron development and functions by real-time PCR, and found six of them, ATP13A2, ERβ, MAO-A, D2, DAT, and Pitx3, showing significantly differential expression between males and females in the normal physiological state or under stress conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that male VM neurons are more vulnerable than female neurons to rotenone-induced cytotoxicity and that 17β-estrogen has a moderate protective effect in both male and female VM neurons. Moreover, we document that SRY can upregulate monoamine oxidase A and downregulate estrogen receptor-β, and SRY-overexpressing N2A cells enhance the resistance to oxidative stress-induced cell injury. Our results suggest that gender indeed influences several PD-related gene expressions in VM neurons, and SRY and estrogen are involved in the different responses to oxidative stress in culture."

The mechanism by which melatonin regulates reproduction is not known. The circannual rhythmicity of other factors, including prolactin, is also regulated by photoperiod via changes in melatonin secretion. In sheep, plasma prolactin levels are higher in the nonbreeding season than the breeding season. Kisspeptin, synthesised by neurones in the ovine arcuate nucleus (ARC) and preoptic area, is a key regulator of reproduction through stimulation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone secretion and its expression in the ARC is reduced during the nonbreeding season. We hypothesised that kisspeptin expression is directly, or indirectly, regulated by melatonin and/or prolactin. We first examined the expression of melatonin receptor (MTNR1A) in kisspeptin (Kiss1 mRNA) neurones in the ARC of ovariectomised (OVX) sheep using double-label in situ hybridisation. MTNR1A mRNA was not expressed by kisspeptin neurones, whereas strong expression was detected in the pars tuberalis. We then examined the expression of the long-form prolactin receptor (PRLR-L) in ARC kisspeptin neurones. In OVX ewes, approximately 60% of kisspeptin neurones expressed PRLR-L mRNA at similar levels in the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. We then aimed to determine whether prolactin treatment during the breeding season regulates kisspeptin expression in the ARC. Continuous central infusion of prolactin (20 μg/h for 7 days) in oestradiol-treated OVX sheep did not alter Kiss1 mRNA expression or luteinising hormone secretion, although it induced substantial phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5-immunoreactive nuclei staining in the mediobasal hypothalamus. We conclude that the seasonal change in kisspeptin neurones cannot be regulated directly by melatonin, although it may be a result of changes in prolactin levels. Despite this, kisspeptin expression was unchanged after exogenous prolactin treatment in breeding season ewes."

APC can also proteolytically cleave PAR-2, although subsequent function is unknown. On the basis of recent evidence that APC promotes wound healing, the aim of this study was to determine whether APC acts through PARs to heal murine excisional wounds or to regulate human cultured keratinocyte function and to determine the signaling mechanisms. Topical administration of APC accelerated wound healing in wild-type mice and, unexpectedly, in PAR-1 knockout mice. PAR-2 knockout mice healed significantly slower than wild-type mice, and healing was not altered by adding APC, indicating that APC acts through PAR-2 to heal wounds. In cultured human primary keratinocytes, APC enhanced PAR-2, stimulated proliferation, activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Src/Akt, and inhibited phosphorylated (P)-p38. Inhibiting PAR-1 or PAR-2, by small-interfering RNA or blocking antibody, reversed APC-induced keratinocyte proliferation and Akt activation. Blocking PAR-2, but not PAR-1, reversed the inhibition of P-p38 by APC. Furthermore, inhibition of P-p38 accelerated wound healing in wild-type mice. In summary, although APC acts through both PAR-1 and PAR-2 to activate Akt and to increase keratinocyte proliferation, APC-induced murine wound healing depends on PAR-2 activity and inhibition of P-p38."

Animal models of neurotoxic MA exposure show reductions in dopamine, serotonin, and their associated transporters. MA abuse can result in long-term attention, working memory, and executive function deficits in humans and deficits in route-based egocentric learning, novel object recognition, and novel odor preference in rodents. MA has also been shown to affect brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in humans and rodents. This experiment examined the effects of a MA binge dosing regimen (10 mg/kg x 4 at 2 h intervals, s.c.) in Sprague-Dawley rats on BDNF, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA expression, and plasma corticosterone. Tissues were collected 1, 7, and 24 h following the last MA dose. Expression of BDNF and TrkB mRNA was analyzed using in situ hybridization with cRNA probes. Frontal, parietal, and entorhinal cortical BDNF mRNA expression were increased by MA exposure at all time-points. Increases in BDNF mRNA were also seen in the hippocampal CA1, prefrontal cortex (PFC), piriform cortex, and locus coeruleus but only at specific times. TrkB mRNA expression was modified in several subregions of the hippocampus as well as in PFC and striatum. TH mRNA was increased at the 1 h time-point in the substantia nigra pars compacta with no differences noted at the other times. Corticosterone levels were increased at all three time-points. The findings suggest that BDNF and its receptor may be upregulated as a compensatory mechanism after MA exposure."

The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster has been used to study the molecular mechanism underlying these physiological processes. Here we show that the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) gene, known as basket (bsk) in Drosophila, functions in neurons to regulate both sleep and longevity in Drosophila. Pan-neuronal knockdown of JNK mRNA expression by RNA interference resulted in a decrease in both sleep and longevity. A heterozygous knockout of JNK showed similar effects, indicating the molecular specificity. The JNK knockdown showed a normal arousal threshold and sleep rebound, suggesting that the basic sleep mechanism was not affected. JNK is known to be involved in the insulin pathway, which regulates metabolism and longevity. A JNK knockdown in insulin-producing neurons in the pars intercerebralis had slight effects on sleep. However, knocking down JNK in the mushroom body had a significant effect on sleep. These data suggest a unique sleep regulating pathway for JNK."

Emerging evidence highlights the glia as a pivotal factor in PD etiology, and epidemiological studies indicate that certain nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may prevent or delay the progression of PD. Given that the exaggerated inflammatory response observed in old age may play a critical role in exacerbating DAergic vulnerability, we hypothesize here that switching the harmful glial response to inflammation and oxidative stress might increase the ability of the SN to resist inflammatory attacks. To this end, we developed a treatment in which we combined the effects of nitric oxide (NO) with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory activity by using HCT1026, a NO-donating derivative of flurbiprofen that has a safe profile and additional immunomodulatory properties. Young and aged mice fed with control or HCT1026 (30 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) diet were exposed to a single systemic injection of a subtoxic dose (0.2 mg kg(-1)) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), one of the most extensively used glial activators. HCT1026 efficiently reversed the age-dependent increase of microglial activation in response to LPS to levels measured in younger mice. In aged mice, LPS induced a progressive loss of DAergic neurons with no recovery for their entire life span, whereas younger mice or aged mice fed with HCT1026 were resistant to systemic LPS-induced DAergic neurodegeneration, underscoring glia as a key pharmacological target for DAergic neuroprotection."

Oestrogen acts mainly via its oestrogen receptor (ER), namely, ERα and ERβ in target tissues, including the brain. During ageing, the actions of oestrogen are altered in both females and males, raising the possibility that the expression level of ER may be altered with age. Age-related changes in ER expression in female rat brain have been well demonstrated with regard to reproductive ageing, whereas very little is known about the effects of age on the expression of ERs, especially ERβ, in males. In the present study, which aimed to elucidate the effects of ageing on ERβ expression in the male brain at the transcriptional level, we performed in situ hybridisation using young (10weeks), middle-aged (12months) and old (24 months) gonadally-intact male rats. We revealed a wide distribution of ERβ mRNA-positive cells throughout the brain, and found that the number of ERβ mRNA-positive cells was reduced in several brain regions in males with ageing. ERβ mRNA-positive cells were decreased with age in layer 6 of the cerebral cortex, hippocampal CA1/CA3 regions, the dorsal endopiriform nucleus, the medial septal nucleus, various subregions of the amygdala (central, lateral, anterior cortical and posterolateral cortical subnuclei), the anteroventral periventricular nucleus, the substantia nigra pars compacta, the raphe magnus nucleus and the locus coeruleus. These results suggest that ERβ expression in male rat brain decreases with age at the transcriptional level and that these ageing effects are region-specific."

Although these channels have been extensively studied in expression systems, their role in the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), remains unknown. In this study, we assessed the expression and functional properties of TRPM2 channels in rat dopaminergic SNc neurons, using acute brain slices. RT-PCR analysis revealed TRPM2 mRNA expression in the SNc region. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated expression of TRPM2 protein in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons. Channel function was tested with whole cell patch-clamp recordings and calcium (fura-2) imaging. Intracellular application of ADP-ribose (50-400 μM) evoked a dose-dependent, desensitizing inward current and intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) rise. These responses were strongly inhibited by the nonselective TRPM2 channel blockers clotrimazole and flufenamic acid. Exogenous application of H(2)O(2) (1-5 mM) evoked a rise in [Ca(2+)](i) and an outward current mainly due to activation of ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels. Inhibition of K(+) conductance with Cs(+) and tetraethylammonium unmasked an inward current. The inward current and/or [Ca(2+)](i) rise were partially blocked by clotrimazole and N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA). The H(2)O(2)-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rise was abolished in &quot;zero&quot; extracellular Ca(2+) concentration and was enhanced at higher baseline [Ca(2+)](i), consistent with activation of TRPM2 channels in the cell membrane. These results provide evidence for the functional expression of TRPM2 channels in dopaminergic SNc neurons. Given the involvement of oxidative stress in degeneration of SNc neurons in Parkinson's disease, further studies are needed to determine the pathophysiological role of these channels in the disease process."

Numbers of mesotocin (MT; the avian analog of mammalian oxytocin) immunoreactive (ir) neurons were higher in the nucleus paraventricularis magnocellularis (PVN) and nucleus supraopticus, pars ventralis (SOv) of late stage incubating hens compared to the layers. When incubating and laying hens were presented with poults, all incubating hens displayed brooding behavior. c-fos mRNA expression was found in several brain areas in brooding hens. The majority of c-fos mRNA expression by MT-ir neurons was observed in the PVN and SOv while the majority of c-fos mRNA expression in dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons was observed in the ventral part of the nucleus preopticus medialis (POM). Following intracerebroventricular injection of DA or oxytocin (OT) receptor antagonists, hens incubating eggs were introduced to poults. Over 80% of those injected with vehicle or the D1 DA receptor antagonist brooded poults, while over 80% of those receiving the D2 DA receptor antagonist or the OT receptor antagonist failed to brood the poults. The D2 DA/OT antagonist groups also displayed less c-fos mRNA in the dorsal part of POM and the medial part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTM) areas than did the D1 DA/vehicle groups. These data indicate that numerous brain areas are activated when incubating hens initially transition to poult brooding behavior. They also indicate that DAergic, through its D2 receptor, and MTergic systems may play a role in regulating brooding behaviors in birds."

For fourteen days, male and female rats were administered, by oral gavage vehicle, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/day of RO2910. Treated groups had elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and decreased total thyroxine, and hypertrophy in the liver, thyroid gland, and pituitary pars distalis. These were considered consequences of hepatocellular induction and often were dose dependent and more pronounced in males than in females. Hepatocellular centrilobular hypertrophy corresponded with increased expression of cytochrome P450s 2B1/2, 3A1, and 3A2 and UGT 2B1. Bilateral thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy occurred concurrent to increased mitotic activity and sometimes colloid depletion, which were attributed to changes in thyroid hormone levels. Males had hypertrophy of thyroid-stimulating hormone-producing cells (thyrotrophs) in the pituitary pars distalis. All findings were consistent with the well-established adaptive physiologic response of rodents to xenobiotic-induced hepatocellular microsomal enzyme induction. Although the effects on the pituitary gland following hepatic enzyme induction-mediated hypothyroidism have not been reported previously, other models of stress and thyroid depletion leading to pituitary stimulation support such a shared pathogenesis."

One emerging gene candidate identified by our group was SKP1A (p19, S-phase kinase-associated protein 1A), found significantly decreased in the SNpc. It is part of the SCF (Skp1, Cullin 1, F-box protein) complex, the largest class of sophisticated ubiquitin-proteasome/E3 ligases, and can directly interact with Fbxo7, a gene defective in PARK15-linked PD. In vitro target validation by viral-mediated RNA interference revealed that the deficiency of Skp1 in a mouse SN-derived DAergic neuronal cell line potentiated the damage caused by exogenous insults implicated in PD pathology and caused the death of neurons undergoing differentiation, which developed Lewy body-like, α-synuclein-positive inclusions preceding cell death. Furthermore, recent animal studies show that site-directed intranigral stereotaxic injections of lentiviruses targeting SKP1A induce pathological and behavioral deficits in mice, supporting a significant role of Skp1 in SN DAergic neuronal survival in SPD. Thus, strategies aimed at increasing the activity or content of Skp1 may represent a novel therapeutic approach that has the potential to treat PD."

We have previously shown that PAR1 or PAR2 occupancy by specific PAR-agonist peptides (PAR-APs) induces tissue factor (TF) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), where TF regulation by PAR1 (but not by PAR2) requires intact endothelial caveolin-enriched membrane microdomains in which PAR1 and caveolin-1 associate.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of cholesterol-lowering agents (statins) and cholesterol-loading lipoprotein on PAR1-AP-mediated and PAR2-AP-mediated TF induction in HUVECs.RESULTS: Statins completely prevented TF induction by PAR-APs in an isoprenoid-independent manner, induced the delocalization of PAR1 from caveolin-enriched membrane microdomains without affecting PAR1 mRNA, and decreased PAR2 mRNA and protein levels. Statins also prevented PAR-AP-mediated extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 activation, which is crucial for TF induction. The redistribution of PAR1 is accompanied by the relocation of the membrane microdomain-associated G-protein α, caveolin-1, and Src, which we previously showed to play a key role in signal transduction and TF induction. Conversely, cholesterol loading potently amplified PAR1-AP-induced TF, probably as a result of the increased abundance of PAR1 and the Src and G-protein α signaling molecules in the caveolin-1-enriched fraction, without affecting PAR1 mRNA.CONCLUSIONS: As PARs have important functions in hemostasis, cancer, thrombosis, and inflammatory processes, our findings that statins prevent TF induction by PAR-APs altering the membrane localization of PAR1 and the expression of PAR2 suggest that they may provide health benefits other than reducing atherosclerosis."

The aim of the present study was to examine the role of PAR-2 on ischemia/reperfusion-induced small intestinal injury in rats. Intestinal damage was induced in male Wistar rats by clamping both the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac trunk for 30 min, followed by reperfusion for 60 min. Expression of PAR-2 in the intestinal mucosa was estimated by Western blot analysis and real-time PCR. Anti-rat PAR-2 cleavage site (PCS) antibody was intraperitoneally administered to the rats 1 h before the vascular clamping. The intestinal mucosal injury and inflammation were evaluated by biochemical markers and histological findings. Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reactive substances and tissue-associated myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were measured in the intestinal mucosa as indices of lipid peroxidation and neutrophil infiltration, respectively. Expression of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) in intestinal mucosa was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of PAR-2 mRNA and protein in the intestinal mucosa was increased after reperfusion following ischemia. Reperfusion after ischemia resulted in an increase in luminal protein concentrations, hemoglobin concentrations, TBA reactive substances, MPO activity and CINC-1 protein. Pre-treatment with anti-rat PCS antibody significantly inhibited the increases in these parameters. These results suggest that PAR-2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion-induced intestinal injury."

New therapeutic approaches aiming at delaying or reversing the neurodegenerative process are under active investigations. In this work, we found that harpagoside, an iridoid purified from the Chinese medicinal herb Scrophularia ningpoensis, could not only prevent but also rescue the dopaminergic neurodegeneration in MPTP/MPP(+) intoxication with promising efficacy. Firstly, in cultured mesencephalic neurons, harpagoside significantly attenuated the loss of TH-positive neuron numbers and the shortening of axonal length. Secondly, in a chronic MPTP mouse model, harpagoside dose-dependently improved the loco-motor ability (rotarod test), increased the TH-positive neuron numbers in the substantia nigra pars compacta (unbiased stereological counting) and increased the striatal DAT density ((125) I-FP-CIT autoradiography). Thirdly, harpagoside markedly elevated the GDNF mRNA and GDNF protein levels in MPTP/MPP(+) lesioned models. However, the protecting effect of harpagoside on the dopaminergic degeneration disappeared when the intrinsic GDNF action was blocked by either the Ret inhibitor PP1 or the neutralizing anti-GDNF antibody. Taken together, we conclude that harpagoside attenuates the dopaminergic neurodegeneration and movement disorder mainly through elevating glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor."

Here we show that NHE2 is expressed in the pituitary, with the highest mRNA expression in pars distalis and lower expression in pars intermedia. In pars distalis of NHE2-null mice, prominent cyst-like dilatations of folliculo-stellate (FS) cell canaliculi developed with age, and there were increased FS cell area, accumulation of lipid in FS cell cytoplasm, redundancies in FS cell basement membrane, and other changes. The expansion of the canaliculi indicates that NHE2 is a major absorptive Na+/H+ exchanger in the luminal membranes lining the extensive network of channels formed by FS cells, which may provide a means of intrapituitary communication. The results suggest that NHE2 contributes to homeostatic regulation of the volume and composition of the canalicular fluid and may counter the secretory activity of the CFTR Cl⁻ channel, which is known to be expressed in pituitary."

We apply PARS to profile the secondary structure of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and obtain structural profiles for over 3,000 distinct transcripts. Analysis of these profiles reveals several RNA structural properties of yeast transcripts, including the existence of more secondary structure over coding regions compared with untranslated regions, a three-nucleotide periodicity of secondary structure across coding regions and an anti-correlation between the efficiency with which an mRNA is translated and the structure over its translation start site. PARS is readily applicable to other organisms and to profiling RNA structure in diverse conditions, thus enabling studies of the dynamics of secondary structure at a genomic scale."

To provide insight into the turnover of α-synuclein, degradation pathways for this protein were studied in a dopaminergic cell line.RESULTS: The expression levels of the chaperone-mediated autophagy proteins LAMP2A and hsc70 were significantly reduced in the substantia nigra pars compacta and amygdala of PD brains compared with age-matched AD and control brain samples. Lewy bodies in these regions contained autophagy-related proteins. We demonstrated that decreased LAMP2A levels in dopaminergic cell lines reduced chaperone-mediated autophagy activity and increased the half-life of α-synuclein.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that there is reduced chaperone-mediated autophagy activity in the PD brain, provide evidence for the role of autophagy in PD pathogenesis and Lewy body formation, and suggest that this pathway may be a suitable therapeutic target in PD."

Photoperiodic decoding relies on circadian clocks, but the underlying molecular pathways have remained elusive [1]. In mammals and birds, photoperiodic responses depend crucially on expression of thyrotrophin β subunit RNA (TSHβ) in the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary gland [2-4]. Now, using our well-characterized Soay sheep model [2], we describe a molecular switch governing TSHβ transcription through the circadian clock. Central to this is a conserved D element in the TSHβ promoter, controlled by the circadian transcription factor thyrotroph embryonic factor (Tef). In the PT, long-day exposure rapidly induces expression of the coactivator eyes absent 3 (Eya3), which synergizes with Tef to maximize TSHβ transcription. The pineal hormone melatonin, secreted nocturnally, sets the phase of rhythmic Eya3 expression in the PT to peak 12 hr after nightfall. Additionally, nocturnal melatonin levels directly suppress Eya3 expression. Together, these effects form a switch triggering a strong morning peak of Eya3 expression under long days. Species variability in the TSHβ D element influences sensitivity to TEF, reflecting species variability in photoperiodic responsiveness. Our findings define a molecular pathway linking the circadian clock to the evolution of seasonal timing in mammals."

Reduction of alpha-syn resulted in a rapid (4 week) reduction in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells and striatal dopamine (DA) on the injected side. The level of neurodegeneration induced by the different siRNAs correlated with their ability to downregulate alpha-syn protein and mRNA in tissue culture and in vivo. Examination of various SNc neuronal markers indicated that neurodegeneration was due to cell loss and not just downregulation of DA synthesis. Reduction of alpha-syn also resulted in a pronounced amphetamine induced behavioral asymmetry consistent with the level of neurodegeneration. In contrast, none of the three control siRNAs, which targeted genes not normally expressed in SNc, showed evidence of neurodegeneration or behavioral asymmetry, even at longer survival times. Moreover, co-expression of both rat alpha-syn and alpha-syn siRNA partially reversed the neurodegenerative and behavioral effects of alpha-syn siRNA alone. Our data show that alpha-syn plays an important role in the rat SNc and suggest that both up- and downregulation of wild-type alpha-syn expression increase the risk of nigrostriatal pathology."

To date, no neuropathological reports have been published from patients with Parkinson's disease with both phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 gene copies mutated. We analysed the coding region of phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 gene in a large Spanish family with six members with parkinsonism. The phenotype was characterized by an early-onset (mean: 31.6, standard deviation: 9.6 years, range: 14-45 years), slowly progressive levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, initial gait impairment and psychiatric symptoms. We identified two segregating pathogenic phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 mutations that were either in homozygous or heterozygous compound state in all affected family members. We found an exon 7 deletion (g.16089_16383del293; c.1252_1488del) and a novel+1U1-dependent 5' splice-site mutation in exon 7 (g.16378G&gt;A; c.1488+1G&gt;A). Leukocyte-derived messenger RNA analysis showed that both mutations caused exon 7 skipping and c.1488+1G&gt;A also lead to an in-frame transcript with a 33 base-pair deletion (p.L485_R497del) resulting from activation of a 5' cryptic exon 7 splice site. Single photon emission computed tomography quantification of striatal dopamine transporter binding (123I-Ioflupane) revealed a posterior-anterior gradient similar to that of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but there was no correlation between striatal reduced uptake and disease duration. Post-mortem neuropathological examination of an early-onset Parkinson's disease carrier of two heterozygous compound phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 mutations showed neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta, Lewy bodies and aberrant neurites in the reticular nuclei of the brainstem, substantia nigra pars compacta and Meynert nucleus, but the locus ceruleus and the amygdala were spared. This is the first neuropathological report of the brain from an early-onset phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1-linked parkinsonism showing that mutated phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 protein induces Lewy body pathology. Unbalanced preservation of the locus ceruleus may well play a role in the slow evolution of motor symptoms and, probably, in the psychiatric symptoms often encountered in Parkinson's disease associated with phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 mutation."

Melatonin acts directly on the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary, regulating expression of thyrotropin, which then relays messages back to the hypothalamus to control reproductive circuits. In addition, a second local intrapituitary circuit controls seasonal prolactin (PRL) release via one or more currently uncharacterized low-molecular-weight peptides, termed &quot;tuberalins,&quot; of PT origin. Studies in birds have identified the transcription factor Eya3 as the first molecular response activated by long photoperiod (LP). Using arrays and in situ hybridization studies, we demonstrate here that Eya3 is the strongest LP-activated gene in sheep, revealing a common photoperiodic molecular response in birds and mammals. We also demonstrate TAC1 (encoding the tachykinins substance P and neurokinin A) to be strongly activated by LP within the sheep PT. We show that these PRL secretagogues act on primary pituitary cells and thus are candidates for the elusive PT-expressed tuberalin seasonal hormone regulator."

We evaluated the time-dependent changes of the αIIbβ3 activation state by measuring PAC-1 binding velocity. The initial velocity analysis clearly showed that PAR1-activating peptide stimulation induced only transient αIIbβ3 activation, whereas PAR4-activating peptide induced long-lasting αIIbβ3 activation. When αIIbβ3 activation signaling dwindled, α-actinin became rephosphorylated and reassociated with αIIbβ3. Compared with control platelets, the dissociation of α-actinin from αIIbβ3 was only transient in PAR4-stimulated P2Y(12)-deficient platelets in which the sustained αIIbβ3 activation was markedly impaired. Overexpression of wild-type α-actinin, but not the mutant Y12F α-actinin, increased its binding to αIIbβ3 and inhibited PAR1-induced initial αIIbβ3 activation in the human megakaryoblastic cell line, CMK. In contrast, knockdown of α-actinin augmented PAR-induced αIIbβ3 activation in CMK. These observations suggest that α-actinin might play a potential role in setting integrins to a default low-affinity ligand-binding state in resting platelets and regulating αIIbβ3 activation by inside-out signaling."

In this study, we examined the functional impact of subchronic high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of Pf in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned hemiparkinsonian rat model. Pf-HFS had significant anti-akinetic action, evidenced by alleviation of limb use asymmetry (cylinder test). Whereas this anti-akinetic action was moderate, Pf-HFS totally reversed lateralized neglect (corridor task), suggesting potent action on sensorimotor integration. At the cellular level, Pf-HFS partially reversed the dopamine denervation-induced increase in striatal preproenkephalin A mRNA levels, a marker of the neurons of the indirect pathway, without interfering with the markers of the direct pathway (preprotachykinin and preprodynorphin). Pf-HFS totally reversed the lesion-induced changes in the gene expression of cytochrome oxidase subunit I in the subthalamic nucleus, the globus pallidus, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata, and partially in the entopeduncular nucleus. Unlike HFS of the subthalamic nucleus, Pf-HFS did not induce per se dyskinesias and directly, although partially, alleviated L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced forelimb dyskinesia. Conversely, L-DOPA treatment negatively interfered with the anti-parkinsonian effect of Pf-HFS. Altogether, these data show that Pf-DBS, by recruiting a large basal ganglia circuitry, provides moderate to strong anti-parkinsonian benefits that might, however, be affected by L-DOPA. The widespread behavioral and cellular outcomes of Pf-HFS evidenced here demonstrate that CM/Pf is an important node for modulating the pathophysiological functioning of basal ganglia and related disorders."

Control of initiation, duration, and magnitude of PAR effects is linked to the level of receptor expression, availability of proteases, and the intracellular signal transduction machinery. We investigated nematode infection-induced changes in PAR(2) expression and the impact on smooth muscle and epithelial responses to PAR(2) agonists.METHODS: Smooth muscle and epithelial cell function were assessed in wild-type, and IL-4, IL-13 or STAT6 gene-deficient mice following treatment with vehicle, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or Heligmosomoides polygyrus, or IL-13. The role of enteric nerves was determined using tetrodotoxin to block nerve conduction. Expression of PAR(2) was assessed by real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry.KEY RESULTS: Nematode infection induced a STAT6- and IL-13-dependent up-regulation of PAR(2) mRNA expression. The infection-induced hypercontractility to PAR(2) agonists required STAT6/IL-13 and was neurally mediated. In contrast, the infection-induced decrease in epithelial secretion to PAR(2) agonists was partly dependent on STAT6 and independent of enteric nerves. The hyposecretion was correlated with decreased PAR(2) immunofluorescent staining on the apical surface of epithelial cells, but enhanced lamina propria immunostaining for PAR(2).CONCLUSIONS &amp; INFERENCES: This is the first study to demonstrate an immune regulation of PAR(2) expression that impacts both smooth muscle and epithelial cell responses to PAR(2) agonists. Differences in responses between smooth muscle and epithelial cells are related to the contribution of enteric nerves. These data provide a mechanism by which activation of PAR(2) in immune-based pathologies can induce both transient and long-lasting changes in gut function."

Neuropathology of PD primarily involves loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, pars compacta, although more widespread pathology from the brainstem to the cerebral cortex occurs at different stages of the disease. Cognitive deficits in PD are thought to involve the cerebral cortex, and imaging studies have identified the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as a possible site for some of the symptoms. GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex play a key role in the modulation of pyramidal neurons and alterations in muscimol binding to GABA(A) receptors have been reported in Brodmann area 9 (BA9) of the prefrontal cortex in PD patients (Nishino et al., 1988). In order to further assess the likelihood that GABAergic activity is altered in the prefrontal cortex in PD, gene expression of the 67 kilodalton isoform of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67 encoded by the GAD1 gene), was examined in BA9 of post-mortem brains from 19 patients and 20 controls using isotopic in situ hybridization histochemistry. GAD67 mRNA labeling was examined and quantified on X-ray films and emulsion radioautographs. We show that GAD67 mRNA labeling is significantly lower in PD compared to control cases. Analysis of emulsion radioautographs indicates that GAD67 mRNA labeling is decreased in individual neurons and is not paralleled by a decrease in the number of GAD67 mRNA-labeled neurons. Analysis of expression data from a microarray study performed in 29 control and 33 PD samples from BA9 confirms that GAD67 expression is decreased in PD. Another finding from the microarray study is a negative relationship between GAD67 mRNA expression and age at death. Altogether, the results support the possibility that GABAergic neurotransmission is impaired in the DLPFC in PD, an effect that may be involved in some of the behavioral deficits associated with the disease."

A crippled protein in coagulation or a key player in non-haemostatic processes?";"Full-length tissue factor (flTF) initiates coagulation, but also exerts non-hemostatic functions such as inflammation and angiogenesis through protease activated receptors (PARs). In 2003 a soluble variant of flTF was described which results from alternative splicing. Since its discovery the role of alternatively spliced tissue factor (asTF) in coagulation has been debated. asTF may have pro-coagulant properties but due to structural differences when compared to flTF, asTF coagulant function may be relatively low. Nevertheless, similar to flTF, asTF appears to have non-hemostatic properties; asTF expression in tumors correlates with increased tumor size, vessel number and poor survival in some cancer types, and drives tumor growth in animal models. Interestingly, unlike flTF, asTF does not promote angiogenesis through activating PARs but rather via integrin ligation. flTF is a critical determinant in cardiovascular disease but little is known about asTF in cardiovascular disease. asTF is produced by monocytes and macrophages, thus macrophage-derived asTF may contribute to atherosclerotic disease. In conclusion, unraveling asTF's non-hemostatic properties may generate new insights in the pathophysiology and diagnostics of cancer and cardiovascular disease."

The goal of this study was to investigate how silencing one receptor affects the expression of other receptors and downstream innate immune markers in response to bacteria. Human gingival epithelial cells (GECs) were transfected with siRNA specific for PAR1 or PAR2, then stimulated with periopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, bridging organism between pathogens and non-pathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum, or non-pathogen Streptococcus gordonii. PAR1 or PAR2 knock-down resulted in up-regulated NOD1 and NOD2 expression with P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum stimulation (p&lt;0.01), as well as enhanced TLR2 and TLR4 expression when cells were stimulated by bacteria that utilize TLR2 or TLR4, respectively. Involvement of PARs for induction of CC chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), a cytokine with antimicrobial properties, was observed following stimulation of the three bacterial species. Furthermore, results from multiple cytokine ELISA array showed receptors utilized in the induction of various innate immune markers are tailored to individual bacterium tested. Our data suggest complex interplay of several receptors is required for appropriate innate immune responses to the different types of bacteria present within the oral cavity and that receptor expression itself is altered depending on which organism the cell encounters."

Interleukin (IL)-8 is a potent chemoattractant and is also involved in angiogenesis. The molecular mechanism whereby PARs induce epithelial IL-8 expression is not known. In HT-29 colonic epithelial cells, PAR(1) or PAR(2) agonists stimulated the expression of IL-8 through a NF-kappaB-dependent pathway without inducing IkappaB degradation and disassociation of IkappaB from NF-kappaB. Further studies revealed that PAR activation induced the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-276 in the nucleus, which increased the recruitment of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300 to p50. Inhibition of ERK activation completely blocked PAR-induced IL-8 expression, phosphorylation of p65 and HAT activity. We also demonstrated that RSK p90 was the downstream kinase that mediated ERK-induced nuclear p65 phosphorylation. In conclusion, activation of either PAR(1) or PAR(2) stimulated the transcriptional up-regulation of IL-8 in HT-29 colonic epithelial cells through a pathway that involved ERK/RSK p90, NF-kappaB phosphorylation, and HAT activity. These studies provide evidence of a new role for serine proteinases and PARs in the regulation of gene expression in colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis."

According to the location and expression types of the receptors in the brain, DA signals act in either stimulatory or inhibitory manners. Although DA autoreceptors in the substantia nigra pars compacta are known to regulate firing activity, the exact expression patterns and roles of DA autoreceptor types on the firing activity are highly debated. Therefore, we performed individual correlation studies between firing activity and receptor expression patterns using acutely isolated rat substantia nigra pars compacta DA neurons. When we performed single-cell RT-PCR experiments, D(1), D(2)S, D(2)L, D(3), and D(5) receptor mRNA were heterogeneously expressed in the order of D(2)L &gt; D(2)S &gt; D(3) &gt; D(5) &gt; D(1). Stimulation of D(2) receptors with quinpirole suppressed spontaneous firing similarly among all neurons expressing mRNA solely for D(2)S, D(2)L, or D(3) receptors. However, quinpirole most strongly suppressed spontaneous firing in the neurons expressing mRNA for both D(2) and D(3) receptors. These data suggest that D(2) S, D(2)L, and D(3) receptors are able to equally suppress firing activity, but that D(2) and D(3) receptors synergistically suppress firing. This diversity in DA autoreceptors could explain the various actions of DA in the brain."

Little is known about transcription factors that influence midbrain dopaminergic subgroup phenotypes or their potential role in disease. Here, we demonstrate elevated expression of the transcription factor orthodenticle homeobox 2 in A10 dopaminergic neurons of embryonic and adult mouse, primate and human midbrain. Overexpression of orthodenticle homeobox 2 using lentivirus increased levels of known A10 elevated genes, including neuropilin 1, neuropilin 2, slit2 and adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide in both MN9D cells and ventral mesencephalic cultures, whereas knockdown of endogenous orthodenticle homeobox 2 levels via short hairpin RNA reduced expression of these genes in ventral mesencephalic cultures. Lack of orthodenticle homeobox 2 in the ventral mesencephalon of orthodenticle homeobox 2 conditional knockout mice caused a reduction of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and selective loss of A10 dopaminergic projections. Orthodenticle homeobox 2 overexpression protected dopaminergic neurons in ventral mesencephalic cultures from Parkinson's disease-relevant toxin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, whereas downregulation of orthodenticle homeobox 2 using short hairpin RNA increased their susceptibility. These results show that orthodenticle homeobox 2 is important for establishing subgroup phenotypes of post-mitotic midbrain dopaminergic neurons and may alter neuronal vulnerability."

These neurons constitute several anatomical and functional subpopulations, but their molecular heterogeneity and developmental regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we have studied the involvement of the proneural gene Ascl1 in the development of the midbrain GABAergic neurons. Analysis of Ascl1 mutant mice demonstrated highly region-specific requirements for Ascl1 for development of different GABAergic neuron subpopulations. Ascl1 is dispensable for the development of the ventral-most midbrain GABAergic neurons associated with dopaminergic nuclei substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) GABAergic neurons. In the ventrolateral midbrain, loss of Ascl1 results in markedly delayed neurogenesis in the midbrain domains m3-m5. Within this region, Ascl1 has a unique role in m4, where it also regulates glutamatergic neurogenesis. Our results suggest that the m3-m5 midbrain neuroepithelium gives rise to the GABAergic neuron groups located in the midbrain reticular formation and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. In contrast to m3-m5, Ascl1 is absolutely required in the dorsal midbrain domains m1-m2, for generation of the GABAergic neurons populating the superior and inferior colliculi as well as dorsal periaqueductal gray. These studies demonstrate different molecular regulatory mechanisms for the distinct midbrain GABAergic neuron subpopulations. Also, our results have implications on understanding the origins of the various midbrain GABAergic neuron groups in the embryonic neuroepithelium."

Expression of tissue factor (TF) and PARs 1-4 genes was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cell surface TF and PARs 1-4 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. For in vitro studies, purified normal monocytes were incubated with purified APS patient IgG, normal human serum IgG, or lipopolysaccharide, in the presence or absence of specific monoclonal antibodies anti-PAR-1 (ATAP2) or anti-PAR-2 (SAM11) to test the effect of blocking the active site of PAR-1 or PAR-2.RESULTS: Analysis of both mRNA and protein for the 4 PARs revealed significantly increased expression of PAR-2 as compared with the control groups. PAR-1 was significantly overexpressed in APS patients with thrombosis and in the control patients with thrombosis but without APS. PAR-3 expression was not significantly altered. PAR-4 expression was absent in all groups analyzed. In addition, we demonstrated a correlation between the levels of PAR-2 and the titers of IgG aCL, as well as parallel behavior of TF and PAR-2 expression. In vitro, IgG from APS patients significantly increased monocyte expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2. Inhibition studies suggested that there was direct cross-talk between TF and PAR-2, such that inhibition of PAR-2 prevented the aCL-induced expression of TF.CONCLUSION: These results provide the first demonstration of increased expression of PARs in monocytes from patients with APS. Thus, PAR antagonists might have therapeutic potential as antithrombotic agents in APS."

Caspase-8 and -3 levels, cell size, and changes in nuclear morphology were recorded using the ArrayScan microscope and 84 apoptosis-related genes were screened with the RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array.RESULTS: In serum starved MDA-MB-231 cells, a TF/FVIIa-sensitive upregulation of apoptosis markers was recorded. Similarly, TRAIL-induced apoptosis was negatively regulated by TF/FVIIa (10 and 100 nM) and TF/FVIIa/FXa but not by active-site inhibited FVIIa. FVIIa, moreover, decreased the transcription of DAPK1 and thereby diminished the association between DAPK1 and FADD in the caspase-8 activating death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). TF/FVIIa regulation of caspase-8 and DAPK1 was dependent on PI3-kinase/AKT and independent of the protease activated receptors (PAR) 1 and 2. Despite of receptor expression and functional signaling, both PAR-agonist treatment and PAR-blocking antibodies in combination with FVIIa failed to influence the anti-apoptotic signal.CONCLUSIONS: We hereby report that TF/FVIIa-induced signaling governs the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis by reducing the levels of DAPK1 in the DISC independently of PAR1 and PAR2. This implies the conceivable involvement of cell surface components other than the PARs and entails the search for TF-dependent regulators of DAPK1 transcription."

The gene and protein expressions of IL-8 from CraA-stimulated A549 cells were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The activity of different mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was assessed by Western blot.RESULTS: CraA-induced A549 cell IL-8 secretion in a dose-dependent manner at both the messenger RNA and protein levels. CraA-induced IL-8 secretion can be blocked by serine protease inhibitors, phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin but not by other protease inhibitors. Blocking antibodies against the cleavage sites of PAR-2 and PAR-3, but not of PAR-1, inhibited CraA-induced IL-8 production. CraA induced significant PAR-2 and PAR-3 messenger RNA upregulation and extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK/1/2) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation but not p38 MAPK. Furthermore, ERK1/2 (U0126) and JNK (SP600125) inhibitors inhibited CraA-induced IL-8 secretion by 100% and 45%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Both PAR-2 and PAR-3 might play a role in CraA-induced IL-8 secretion from human airway epithelial cells. It signals mainly through the ERK1/2 and partly from the JNK pathways. The key receptors and signaling molecules mediate cytokine release from the respiratory epithelium and can be potential therapeutic targets in treating cockroach allergy."

Uptake via the dopamine transporter (DAT) is a key mechanism for regulating the concentrations of extracellular DA. Accordingly, we questioned whether DAT expression and function are altered in striatum in nicotine withdrawal. Male mice, 30-35 g, were injected with nicotine free base 2 mg/kg, s.c., or saline four times daily for 14 days and euthanized 4-72 h after drug discontinuation. DA uptake into striatal synaptosomes was increased 12-24 h into nicotine withdrawal, and accompanied by elevated DAT mRNA in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area, evaluated by in situ hybridization. The overflow of endogenous DA, measured under basal conditions in striatal slices ex vivo, was decreased during nicotine withdrawal in a time pattern paralleling to that of uptake. Added to striatal slices, the DAT inhibitor nomifensine reduced the observed difference in DA overflow between saline and nicotine withdrawn mice implying a role for the transporter. The presented data suggest that DAT is transiently upregulated in the striatum early during nicotine withdrawal, and enhanced transporter function contributes to the decreased extracellular DA levels."

The products of repA and repB, in conjunction with the parS region, make up the segregation system, and they negatively regulate operon transcription. The last gene of the operon, repC, encodes the initiator protein. The ctRNA is a negative posttranscriptional regulator of repC. In this work, we analyzed the secondary structures of the ctRNA and its target and mapped the motifs involved in the complex formed between them. Essential residues for the effective interaction localize at the unpaired 5' end of the antisense molecule and the loop of the target mRNA.

Both the rostral tip of Rathke's pouch (pars tuberalis primordium) and the pars tuberalis expressed alphaGSU mRNA, and were immunoreactive for LH, chromogranin A, and TSHbeta in mice. Hes genes control progenitor cell differentiation in many embryonic tissues and play a crucial role for neurulation in the central nervous system. We investigated the Hes1 function in outgrowth and differentiation of the pars tuberalis by using the markers for the pars tuberalis. In homozygous Hes1 null mutant embryos, the rostral tip was formed in the basal-ventral part of Rathke's pouch at embryonic day (E)11.5 as well as in wild-type embryos. In contrast to the wild-type, the rostral tip of null mutants could not extend rostrally with age; it remained in the low extremity of Rathke's pouch during E12.5-E13.5 and disappeared at E14.5, resulting in lack of the pars tuberalis. Development of the ventral diencephalon was impaired in the null mutants at early stages. Rathke's pouch, therefore, could not link with the nervous tissue and failed to receive inductive signals from the diencephalon. In a very few mutant mice in which the ventral diencephalon was partially sustained, some pars tuberalis cells were distributed around the hypoplastic infundibulum. Thus, Hes1 is required for development of the pars tuberalis and its growth is dependent on the ventral diencephalon."

Recently, a new genetic cell model of sporadic PD was developed by knocking-down SKP1A in SN-derived cell-line infected with short hairpin RNA lentiviruses. SKP1A deficiency resulted in increased susceptibility to cell death and a decline in the expression of dopaminergic phenotypic markers. SKP1A-silenced cells were unable to arrest at G(0)/G(1,) when induced to differentiate, entering into an aberrant cell cycle and progressive death. During this process the cells developed rounded aggregates with characteristics of LB-like inclusions (aggresomes) including immunoreactivity for gamma-tubulin, alpha-synuclein, ubiquitin, tyrosine hydroxylase, Hsc-70 and proteasome subunit. In conclusion, future studies should focus on a careful consideration of crucial dopaminergic interacting genes, as emerged from human sporadic PD, which will serve as a basis for the development of a slowly progressive genetic animal model of sporadic PD, with the potential of evaluating drugs with &quot;disease modifying activity&quot;."

The hypophyseal pars tuberalis (PT) is a major target for melatonin and shows a high density of melatonin type 1 receptors (MT1). Melatonin affects expression of clock genes in PT cells which encode for transcriptional regulators of rhythmic gene expression. In this study, microarray analysis was performed to screen for genes coding for transcriptional regulators under the control of MT1 receptors in the mouse PT. Gene expression levels were compared between melatonin-proficient mice deficient for MT1 (MT1-/-) and the corresponding wild-type (WT) during mid-subjective day (CT06, low endogenous melatonin levels) and mid-subjective night (CT18, high endogenous melatonin levels). In situ hybridization was used to validate the data obtained by microarray analysis to analyze the acute effect of daytime melatonin application on gene expression in the wild-type PT. In the wild-type PT, expression of Tim was higher during day as compared to night. These day/night differences in gene expression were not observed in the PT of MT1-/- mice, demonstrating the impact of MT1-mediated signal transduction pathway. Day-time application of melatonin acutely affected Tim and Cry1 expression but not Neurod1 and Npas4 expression. We conclude that melatonin regulates expression of genes coding for transcriptional regulators in the PT through MT1 receptors by either acute or long-term mechanisms."

SV2 proteins appear to play an important, but not yet fully understood role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release. Moreover, SV2 seems to be the receptor of the botulinum neurotoxin A. In the present study, using single and double-labeling fluorescent immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization we have identified the brain pattern of SV2C mRNA and protein expression in mice. Our results indicated that SV2C protein was expressed in a small subset of brain regions including the olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, ventral pallidum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. These results were confirmed by means of in situ hybridization, except for the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata, in which no labeling was found, suggesting that SV2C-positive fibers in these areas are terminals of striatal projecting neurons. In the striatum, we found that, in addition to its presence in the projection neurons, SV2C was densely expressed in a fraction (around 45%) of cholinergic interneurons. In addition, our data also showed that SV2C was densely expressed in most dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area (more than 70% of the dopaminergic neurons analyzed were SV2C-positive). Altogether, our results suggest that SV2C may contribute to the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission in the basal ganglia including cholinergic striatal interneurons and nigro-striatal/mesolimbic dopamine neurons."

Hg5 rats showed an increase in urinary excretion of Oat5 and NaDC1 as well as alterations of other widely used parameters for renal dysfunction and injury (plasma creatinine, plasma urea, urinary AP activity, kidney weight, histological lesions). In Hg0.2 group only an increase of urinary excretion of Oat5 was observed. The increase of Oat5 urinary excretion in Hg1 group was associated to the beginning of tissular injury. These results suggest that urinary excretion of Oat5 might be an early indicator of mercury-induced nephropathy, which predicts the perturbation before the manifestation of histopathological damages."

Nurr1 is essential to the differentiation, maturation, and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and is expressed in different brain regions. We have reported that adult mice with reduced Nurr1 expression displayed an increase in immobility response to acute stress. These mice were also deficient in the retention of emotional memory. Thus, Nurr1 expression seems to be relevant to normal cognitive processes. To investigate the response of Nurr1 to a stress stimulus, Nurr1 mRNA expression was examined by in situ hybridization in adult mice using a depression-like behavior paradigm, the forced swim test. The Nurr1 gene was rapidly and widely up-regulated throughout the brain, including cortical areas (i.e., prefrontal cortex, primary and secondary visual cortex, primary auditory cortex, and secondary somatosensory cortex), hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA1, CA2, and CA3), and midbrain (substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area) at 30 min and 3 hr after the forced swim test. Dopamine content was reduced in prefrontal cortex and midbrain following swim stress. These results suggest that the increase in Nurr1 expression might be a compensatory mechanism to counteract the changes in forebrain dopamine transmission in coping with acute stress."

It has been long recognized as a crucial player in the pathogenesis of allergy. However, little is known of its effects on cytokine secretion and protease activated receptor (PAR) expression in mast cells. In the present study, we examined potential influence of RANTES on IL-13 and IL-12 release from P815 cells and PAR expression on P815 cells by using flow cytometry analysis, quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA and cellular activation of signaling ELISA (CASE) techniques. The results showed that RANTES induced up to 2.2-fold increase in IL-13, but not IL-12 release from P815 cells. Blocking antibodies against RANTES and CCR5 diminished RANTES induced IL-13 release. Furthermore, RANTES upregulated expression of PAR-1, PAR-2 and PAR-3 mRNAs, but enhanced only PAR-1 protein expression. At 1 ng/ml, RANTES can abolish tryptase induced IL-13 release, but enhance trypsin, tryptase and thrombin induced PAR-1, -2 and -4 expression. LY204002 abolished RANTES induced IL-13 release, indicating an Akt cell signaling pathway may be involved in the event. In conclusion, RANTES can stimulate IL-13 release from mast cells through a CCR5 and Akt cell signaling pathway dependent mechanism. It can also enhance trypsin, tryptase and thrombin-induced expression of PARs in mast cells. RANTES may contribute to modulation of IL-13 production and PAR expression in mast cells, through which participates in the mast cell related inflammation."

However, the signaling molecules that transmit photoperiodic information from the PT to the PD and control prolactin release (the so-called &quot;tuberalins&quot;) have not yet been identified, despite an intense search for more than three decades. Here, we demonstrate an endocannabinoid system in the PT of the Syrian hamster, a photoperiodic species. By means of in situ hybrization, the PT was found to express N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), sn-1-selective diacylglycerol lipases (DAGLalpha and DAGLbeta), and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), enzymes involved in endocannabinoid synthesis and degradation. The expression of NAPE-PLD, FAAH, and DAGLalpha was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Expression and protein levels of DAGLs controlling the synthesis of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), a major endocannabinoid, were upregulated in the PT of Syrian hamsters kept under long-day conditions. Consequently, 2-AG levels were increased in the PT of these hamsters. A primary target of 2-AG, the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), was expressed in the PD. Double-immunolabeling revealed that most of the CB1-immunoreactive cells in the PD were folliculostellate cells that were also immunoreactive for S-100 protein. Thus, the PT comprises an endocannabinoid system, and 2-AG may act as a photoperiodic messenger from the PT to the PD for the regulation of hypophysial hormonal secretion."

Muscle biopsy specimens were collected from both groups and processed for RNA and cDNA extraction. Validation of the most stable housekeeping genes for skeletal muscle was performed and used to compare gene expression of the following proteolytic systems: cysteine aspartate protease-dependent systems (caspases), lysosomal-dependent systems (cathepsins), non-lysosomal calcium protease-dependent systems (calpains), and ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent systems (ubiquitins). Gene expression of negative regulators of muscle growth (myostatin and inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) was also determined.RESULTS: No significant difference between groups was detected in expression of the major proteolytic systems except for m-calpain, which was greater in horses with PPID. No differences in gene expression of myostatin and interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were detected between groups.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Greater expression of m-calpain may suggest that calpains play an important role in development of muscle atrophy in horses with PPID. However, because posttranslational events may alter protein activation, inactivation, and functions not studied here, other mechanisms of muscle atrophy cannot be excluded."

MPTP increased ppN/OFQ mRNA expression in the substantia nigra (SN). We have evaluated the temporal relationship of dopamine cell loss to increased ppN/OFQ mRNA expression in the substantia nigra after MPTP treatment, and characterized the cellular locations in which increased ppN/OFQ mRNA expression was observed after MPTP treatment. MPTP increased by about 5-fold the number of neurons expressing ppN/OFQ mRNA in the pars reticulata of SN (SNr) by 24 h after treatment and the elevation remained significant for at least 7 days. This period coincided with the timing of the loss of dopamine neurons from the pars compacta of substantia nigra (SNc) after MPTP. The increased expression of ppN/OFQ mRNA co-localized with a neuronal marker in the SNr. MPTP treatment resulted in a small increase in the numbers of neurons expressing ppN/OFQ in the SNc in mice from one mouse colony but the increase did not reach statistical significance in mice from another colony. No changes in ppN/OFQ-mRNA expression were observed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the caudate-putamen, the subthalamic nucleus, or in two other brains areas. These results demonstrate that increased N/OFQ expression in the SNr is closely associated with the MPTP-induced loss of dopamine neurons in the SNc in a widely used animal model of Parkinson's disease."

Furthermore, added knockout of the dopamine-metabolizing enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, found almost absent in sporadic PD SN pars compacta, exacerbated the vulnerability of SKP1A-silenced neurons to MPP(+) and neurotrophin deprivation.CONCLUSION: Future studies should focus on a careful consideration of crucial dopaminergic gene network interactions as emerged from human sporadic PD, which will serve as a basis for the development of a slowly progressive genetic animal model of sporadic PD, with the potential of evaluating drugs with 'disease-modifying activity'."

Both pathways involve the release of prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) and the stimulation of their basolateral receptors (EP-Rs). We sought to determine whether gap junctions contribute to the coordination of these pathways for modulating CFTR activity and mucus hydration. We used RT-PCR and Western blotting to determine connexin (Cx), CD73, and EP-R expression in a Calu-3 airway epithelial cell line grown on Transwell (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) inserts. We used dye coupling to evaluate gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). We used Ussing chamber studies and X-Z confocal microscopy to monitor Cl(-) secretion and ASL volume regulation. We found that connexin 43 (Cx43)-mediated GJIC was increased either by endogenous ADO after the hydrolysis of purine nucleotides by CD73 or by the direct activation of ADO-Rs. Inhibition of phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase prevented ADO-dependent increases in GJIC, suggesting the involvement of PGE₂. PGE₂ was found to increase GJIC markedly by stimulating EP4-Rs. The modulation of ADO signaling also affected the PAR-dependent activation of CFTR. The reduction of GJIC by CD73 or Cx43 inhibition prevented PAR-evoked CFTR currents in Ussing chambers. The inhibition of GJIC resulted in a failure of PGE₂ to increase ASL volume in Calu-3 cells and in primary cultures of well-differentiated human airway epithelial cells. Thus, gap junctions coordinate a signaling network comprising CFTR, ADO-Rs, PARs, and EP-Rs, and are required for ASL volume homeostasis."

Next, we examined whether mite allergen-stimulated cells release chemokines and whether physiological protease inhibitors such as secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) and α1-antitrypsin can inhibit their production. We also looked at the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in giant papillae of patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis and examined whether the as Toll-like receptor 3 ligand polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) can induce expression of TSLP in cultured human conjunctival epithelial cells.RESULTS: PAR 1, PAR2, and PAR3 were expressed in cultured human conjunctival epithelial cells and fibroblasts at mRNA level. These epithelial cells released interleukin (IL) 6 and IL-8, with an upregulation in their gene expression, in response to the serine protease activity of mite allergens. This response was inhibited by SLPI and α1-antitrypsin. Transforming growth factor β1 decreased the production of SLPI in corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. TSLP was expressed in giant papillae epithelium in patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis at mRNA and protein levels. Poly I:C induced expression of TSLP in cultured conjunctival epithelial cells at mRNA level. Costimulation with TSLP and IL-33 had a synergistic effect for IL-13 mRNA expression in cultured human mast cells.CONCLUSIONS: Imbalance between protease of mite allergens and innate protease inhibitors of the epithelium may induce inflammation and disrupt barrier function. Viral infection may induce expression of TSLP via Toll-like receptors and release IL-33 by necrosis. These phenomena promote excessive allergic reactions; hence, the epithelium takes &quot;center stage&quot; in allergic conjunctivitis."

In this study we therefore analyzed the nigrostriatal system of aged Tgfbeta2 (+/-)/Gdnf (+/-) double-heterozygous mice. Unexpectedly, we found no morphological changes in the nigrostriatal system as compared with age-matched wild-type mice. There were no significant differences in the number of TH-positive midbrain neurons and no changes in the optical density of TH immunoreactivity in striata of Tgfbeta2 (+/-)/Gdnf (+/-) double-heterozygous mice. Moreover, we found no significant differences in the striatal levels of dopamine and its metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid. Our results indicate that a combined haploinsufficiency for Tgfbeta2 and Gdnf has no impact on the function and the survival of midbrain DA neurons under normal aging conditions."

Comparing the images under TEM with those under AFM, we found that the latter could reveal the surface topograph and ultramicrostructure of viruses more truly than did the former. The samples of viruses were treated by Tritonx-100, the lipid envelopes of virions were partly or completely resolved, and then most of their capsids were exposed. We could observe the different appearances of the virions under AFM, the lipid envelopes of which were gradually removed. The samples of viruses were also treated by SDS, and the RNA was released from the virions. From the AFM images, we could see the structure of the RNA.

PPAR-gamma can modulate inflammatory responses in the brain, and agonists might be beneficial in neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study we used a chronic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine plus probenecid (MPTPp) mouse model of progressive Parkinson's disease (PD) to assess the therapeutic efficacy of rosiglitazone on behavioural impairment, neurodegeneration and inflammation. Mice chronically treated with MPTPp displayed typical features of PD, including impairment of motor and olfactory functions associated with partial loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), decrease of dopamine (DA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) content and dynorphin (Dyn) mRNA levels in the caudate-putamen (CPu), intense microglial and astroglial response in the SNc and CPu. Chronic rosiglitazone, administered in association with MPTPp, completely prevented motor and olfactory dysfunctions and loss of TH-positive cells in the SNc. In the CPu, loss of striatal DA was partially prevented, whereas decreases in DOPAC content and Dyn were fully counteracted. Moreover, rosiglitazone completely inhibited microglia reactivity in SNc and CPu, as measured by CD11b immunostaining, and partially inhibited astroglial response assessed by glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity. Measurement of striatal MPP+ levels 2, 4, 6 h and 3 days after chronic treatment indicated that MPTP metabolism was not altered by rosiglitazone. The results support the use of PPAR-gamma agonists as a putative anti-inflammatory therapy aimed at arresting PD progression, and suggest that assessment in PD clinical trials is warranted."

Endogenous ghrelin receptors [growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)] are also present in extrahypothalamic sites where they promote circuit activity associated with learning and memory, and reward seeking behavior. Here, we show that the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), a brain region where dopamine (DA) cell degeneration leads to Parkinson's disease (PD), expresses GHSR. Ghrelin binds to SNpc cells, electrically activates SNpc DA neurons, increases tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA and increases DA concentration in the dorsal striatum. Exogenous ghrelin administration decreased SNpc DA cell loss and restricted striatal dopamine loss after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment. Genetic ablation of ghrelin or the ghrelin receptor (GHSR) increased SNpc DA cell loss and lowered striatal dopamine levels after MPTP treatment, an effect that was reversed by selective reactivation of GHSR in catecholaminergic neurons. Ghrelin-induced neuroprotection was dependent on the mitochondrial redox state via uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2)-dependent alterations in mitochondrial respiration, reactive oxygen species production, and biogenesis. Together, our data reveal that peripheral ghrelin plays an important role in the maintenance and protection of normal nigrostriatal dopamine function by activating UCP2-dependent mitochondrial mechanisms. These studies support ghrelin as a novel therapeutic strategy to combat neurodegeneration, loss of appetite and body weight associated with PD.

In the present study, to investigate the precise distribution of VGLUT3-expressing nonserotonergic neurons in the DR and MnR, we performed double fluorescence in situ hybridization for VGLUT3 and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2). According to the distribution of VGLUT3 and TPH2 mRNA signals, we divided the DR into six subregions. In the MnR and the rostral (DRr), ventral (DRV), and caudal (DRc) parts of the DR, VGLUT3 and TPH2 mRNA signals were frequently colocalized (about 80%). In the lateral wings (DRL) and core region of the dorsal part of the DR (DRDC), TPH2-producing neurons were predominantly distributed, and about 94% of TPH2-producing neurons were negative for VGLUT3 mRNA. Notably, in the shell region of the dorsal part of the DR (DRDSh), VGLUT3 mRNA signals were abundantly detected, and about 75% of VGLUT3-expressing neurons were negative for TPH2 mRNA. We then examined the projection of VGLUT3-expressing nonserotonergic neurons in the DRDSh by anterograde and retrograde labeling after chemical depletion of serotonergic neurons. The projection was observed in various brain regions such as the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta, hypothalamic nuclei, and preoptic area.

The expression of ErbB1 and ErbB2 mRNAs was relatively high at the perinatal stage and frequently colocalized with mRNA for S100beta and Olig2, markers for immature astrocytes or oligodendrocyte precursors. Modest signal for ErbB1 mRNA was also detected in a subset of dopaminergic neurons. ErbB3 mRNA was detectable at postnatal day 10, peaked at postnatal day 18, and colocalized with 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, a marker for oligodendrocytes. In contrast, ErbB4 mRNA was exclusively localized in neurons throughout development. Almost all of ErbB4 mRNA-expressing cells (94%-96%) were positive for tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra pars compacta but 66%-78% in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars lateralis. Conversely, 92%-99% of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells expressed ErbB4 mRNA.

However, PD is a systemic disease of the nervous system with variegated clinical symptoms appearing before parkinsonism and due to the involvement of selected nuclei of the medulla oblongata, pons, autonomic nervous system and olfactory structures, among others. Furthermore, recent clinical data have shown modifications in behavior, personality changes and cognitive impairment leading to dementia. Lewy pathology, hallmark of PD, in the cerebral cortex does not correlate with cognitive impairment. However, recent studies have shown abnormal mitochondria content and function, and increased oxidative stress and oxidative responses in the cerebral cortex in PD. Furthermore, several key PD-related proteins are oxidatively damaged, including alpha-synuclein, beta-synuclein, superoxide dismutases, parkin, DJ1, UCHL1 and enzymes involved in glycolysis and energy metabolism. DNA and RNA are also targets of oxidative damage. Furthermore, abnormal phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein and tau occurs at the cortical synapses. Finally, abnormal cortical metabolism has been revealed with neuroimaging methods. These data demonstrate early involvement of the cerebral cortex in PD due to the convergence of multiple metabolic defects. Lewy pathology is a relative late event, geared to isolate unremoved damaged protein, with little significance on cortical neurological deficits."

In the current study, we examined the possible role of a class of protease stimulated HBMEC G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) known as protease activated receptors (PARs) that might be implicated in calcium signaling by African trypanosomes.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using RNA interference (RNAi) we found that in vitro PAR-2 gene (F2RL1) expression in HBMEC monolayers could be reduced by over 95%. We also found that the ability of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense to cross F2RL1-silenced HBMEC monolayers was reduced (39%-49%) and that HBMECs silenced for F2RL1 maintained control levels of barrier function in the presence of the parasite. Consistent with the role of PAR-2, we found that HBMEC barrier function was also maintained after blockade of Galpha(q) with Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT). PAR-2 signaling has been shown in other systems to have neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective roles and our data implicate a role for proteases (i.e. brucipain) and PAR-2 in African trypanosome/HBMEC interactions. Using gene-profiling methods to interrogate candidate HBMEC pathways specifically triggered by brucipain, several pathways that potentially link some pathophysiologic processes associated with CNS HAT were identified.SIGNIFICANCE: Together, the data support a role, in part, for GPCRs as molecular targets for parasite proteases that lead to the activation of Galpha(q)-mediated calcium signaling. The consequence of these events is predicted to be increased permeability of the BBB to parasite transmigration and the initiation of neuroinflammation, events precursory to CNS disease."

Recent studies in quail have identified long-day induced TSH-beta expression in the pars tuberalis (PT) as a rapid trigger of gonadal activation. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) induces type 2 deiodinase (Dio2) in the ependymal cell layer (EC) of the infundibular recess to stimulate the gonadal axis. A similar mechanism is proposed in sheep and mice, but the experimental data on the temporal patterns of induction and suppression of TSH-beta and Dio2 expression are incomplete. In the present study, we examined the expression of TSH-beta and Dio2 in hamsters transferred from short- to long-day conditions for 9 days, and demonstrate the induction of TSH-beta and Dio2 on day 8 after transition. These data demonstrate the close relationship between TSH-beta and Dio2 expression in the inductive pathway. The temporal expression of TSH-beta and Dio2 in the suppressive pathway was also examined by s.c. melatonin injection, which mimics the transition from long to short days. Importantly, Dio2 expression in the EC is suppressed on day 1 after the onset of injection, whereas TSH-beta expression in the PT was not suppressed until day 10. These data suggest that regulated transcription of TSH-beta is involved in the induction of the gonadal axis in mammals, whereas the suppression of this axis is mediated by different mechanisms."

This involves the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from PT that activates type II deiodinase (DIO2) gene expression in hypothalamic ependymal cells, locally generating biologically active T3, and thus triggering a neuroendocrine cascade. In the present study, we investigated whether a similar regulatory mechanism operates in the European hamster. This species utilises both melatonin signalling and a circannual timer to time the seasonal reproductive cycle. We found that expression of betaTSH RNA in the PT was markedly increased under long compared to short photoperiod, whereas TSH receptor expression was localised in the ependymal cells lining the third ventricle, and in the PT, where its expression varied with time and photoperiod. In the ependymal cells at the base of the third ventricle, DIO2 and type III deiodinase (DIO3) expression was reciprocally regulated, with DIO2 activated under long and repressed under short photoperiod, and the reverse case for DIO3. These data are consistent with recent observations in sheep, and suggest that the PT TSH third ventricle-ependymal cell relay plays a conserved role in initiating the photoperiodic response in both long- and short-day breeding mammals."

The Drosophila large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (dSlo) binds to and is modulated by its binding partner Slob. We have constructed flies in which Slob expression is manipulated by P-element mutagenesis, or by transgenic expression of Slob protein or Slob-RNAi. In vivo recordings of both macroscopic and single dSlo channel currents in identified neurosecretory neurons in the pars intercerebralis (PI) region of the Drosophila brain reveal that whole-cell potassium current and properties of single dSlo channels are modulated by Slob expression level. Furthermore, Slob genotype influences action potential duration in vivo. This unprecedented combination of current-clamp, macroscopic-current, and single-channel recordings from neurons in brains of living flies defines a critical role for an ion channel modulatory protein complex in the control of neuronal excitability. We show further that Slob-null flies exhibit significantly longer lifespan than controls under conditions of complete food deprivation. Crosses with deficiency lines demonstrate that this enhanced resistance to starvation-induced death maps close to the slob locus. Together, these results indicate that Slob may serve a novel regulatory function in feeding behavior, possibly by influencing the excitability of the PI neurons."

Here we report the cloning of another melatonin receptor, MT(2), from sheep.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Using a thermo-resistant reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction primer set homologous to the bovine MT(2) mRNA sequence, we have cloned and characterized MT(2) receptors from sheep retina.KEY RESULTS: The ovine MT(2) receptor presents 96%, 72% and 67% identity with cattle, human and rat respectively. This MT(2) receptor stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells showed high-affinity 2[(125)I]-iodomelatonin binding (K(D)= 0.04 nM). The rank order of inhibition of 2[(125)I]-iodomelatonin binding by melatonin, 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralin and luzindole was similar to that exhibited by MT(2) receptors of other species (melatonin &gt; 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralin &gt; luzindole). However, its pharmacological profile was closer to that of rat, rather than human MT(2) receptors. Functionally, the ovine MT(2) receptors were coupled to G(i) proteins leading to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, as the other melatonin receptors. In sheep brain, MT(2) mRNA was expressed in pars tuberalis, choroid plexus and retina, and moderately in mammillary bodies. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that in sheep pars tuberalis, premammillary hypothalamus and mammillary bodies, the temporal pattern of expression of MT(1) and MT(2) mRNA was not parallel in the three tissues.CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Co-expression of MT(1) and MT(2) receptors in all analysed sheep brain tissues suggests that MT(2) receptors may participate in melatonin regulation of seasonal anovulatory activity in ewes by modulating MT(1) receptor action."

Neuregulins (NRGs) are pleotrophic growth factors for many cell types, including mesencephalic dopamine cells in culture and in vivo. The functional NRG receptor ErbB4 is expressed by virtually all midbrain dopamine neurons. To determine if levels of the NRG receptor are maintained during aging in the dopaminergic ventral mesencephalon, expression of ErbB4 mRNA and protein was examined in young (3 months), middle-aged (18 months), and old (24-25 months) Brown Norway/Fischer 344 F1 rats. ErbB4 mRNA levels in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), but not the adjacent ventral tegmental area (VTA) or subtantia nigra pars lateralis (SNl), were significantly reduced in the middle-aged and old animals when compared to young rats. Protein expression of ErbB4 in the ventral midbrain was significantly decreased in the old rats when compared to the young rats. Expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA levels was significantly reduced in the old rats when compared to young animals in the SNpc, but not in the VTA or SNI. TH protein levels in the ventral midbrain were also decreased in the old animals when compared to the young animals. These data demonstrate a progressive decline of ErbB4 expression, coinciding with a loss of the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme TH, in the ventral midbrain of aged rats, particularly in the SNpc. These findings may implicate a role for diminished NRG/ErbB4 trophic support in dopamine-related neurodegenerative disorders of aging such as Parkinson's disease."

In this study, we investigated the effects of alpha-synuclein and the mechanisms of invasive microglial migration into the SNpc. We show that alpha-synuclein up-regulates the expressions of the cell adhesion molecule CD44 and the cell surface protease membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase through the extracellular regulated kinases 1/2 pathway. These concurrent inductions increased the generation of soluble CD44 to liberate microglia from the surrounding extracellular matrix for migration. The effects of alpha-synuclein were identical in BV-2 murine microglial cells subjected to cDNA transfection and extracellular treatment. These inductions in primary microglial cultures of C57Bl/6 mice were identical to those in BV-2 cells. alpha-Synuclein-induced microglial migration into the SNpc was confirmed in vivo using a 6-hydroxydopamine mouse model of PD. Our data demonstrate a correlation between alpha-synuclein-induced phenotypic changes and microglial migration. With the recruitment of the microglial population into the SNpc during dopaminergic neurodegeneration, alpha-synuclein may play a role in accelerating the pathogenesis of PD."

Thus, the identification and biological evaluation of novel proteins involved in these pathways is critical to providing a more comprehensive understanding of PD pathogenesis. Previously, in a cellular model of PD, we identified nucleolin as a protein interacting with alpha-synuclein and DJ-1, two critical proteins involved in PD pathogenesis. In our current study, we found the expression levels of nucleolin were dramatically reduced in the substantia nigra pars compacta of human PD subjects, compared with controls. Furthermore, manipulation of nucleolin in an in vitro model of PD resulted in significant alterations in the generation of oxidative stress as well as proteasomal inhibition following rotenone exposure. Interestingly, nucleolin expression did not influence mitochondrial complex I activity, suggesting a selective specificity for oxidative stress and proteasomal pathways."

The SCN and peripheral oscillators share several components of the molecular clockwork and comprise transcriptional activators (BMAL1 and CLOCK/NPAS2) and inhibitors (mPER1/2 and mCRY1/2). Here we compared the ontogenetic maturation of the clockwork in the SCN and pars tuberalis (PT). The PT is a peripheral oscillator that strongly depends on rhythmic melatonin signals. Immunoreactions for clock gene proteins were determined in the SCN and PT at four different timepoints during four differential stages of mouse ontogeny: foetal (embryonic day 18), newborn (2-day-old), infantile (10-day-old), and adult. In the foetal SCN, levels of immunoreactions of all clock proteins were significantly lower than adult levels except for BMAL1. In the newborn SCN the clock protein immunoreactions had not yet reached adult levels, but the infantile SCN showed similar levels of immunoreactions as the adult. In contrast, immunoreactions for all clock gene proteins in the foetal PT were as intense as in newborn, infantile and adult, and showed the same phase. As the foetal pineal gland is not yet capable of rhythmic melatonin production, the rhythms in clock gene proteins in the foetal PT are presumably dependent on the maternal melatonin signal. Thus, our data provide the first evidence that maternal melatonin is important for establishing and maintaining circadian rhythms in a foetal peripheral oscillator."

PAR-1 is the prototypic member of the PAR family and has been shown to be upregulated in several brain pathologies being expressed by neurons and glial cells. The present experiments show that the administration of the PAR-1 activating peptides (TRAP6 and TFLLR) inhibits the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 in microglial cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) while promoting the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Conversely, the addition of the specific PAR-2 agonist SLIGRL had no effect on the amount of cytokines released following LPS treatment. Consistent with these data PAR-1, but not PAR-2, stimulation upregulates the expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3). The present data support the hypothesis that in microglia PAR-1 may be involved in the regulation of inflammatory reactions modulating the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines possibly through SOCS induction."

In addition, a family of G protein-coupled-receptors known as protease-activated receptors (PARs) has also been implicated in tumor biology. These receptors might be activated by blood coagulation proteases thus eliciting a number of pro-tumoral responses, including the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8). Therefore, in this study we analyzed the expression of TF, PAR-1, PAR-2 and IL-8 genes in patients with esophageal cancer, one of the most aggressive neoplastic diseases. Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples (tumor and the corresponding normal mucosa) obtained from patients submitted to esophagectomy or endoscopy and further analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase (RT-PCR) and/or real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Expression of full-length transmembrane TF was significantly higher in tumor samples whereas no differences were observed in alternatively spliced TF transcripts. Tumor tissue showed increased mRNA levels for PAR-1 but not PAR-2. Remarkably, IL-8 expression was not detected in most normal tissues but showed very high expression in tumor samples. As expected, qPCR revealed greater differences in the expression pattern of all transcripts analyzed but the general profile was very similar to that observed by RT-PCR. Altogether our data suggest a possible role for blood clotting proteins in the biology of human esophageal cancer."

To assess the role of neuregulin-1 in the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, we used in situ hybridization and immunoblotting to investigate the cellular distribution of ErbB4 mRNA in the substantia nigra of Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata) and human postmortem brains. In both monkeys and humans, significant signal for ErbB4 mRNA was detected in substantia nigra dopamine neurons, which were identified by melanin deposits. The expression of ErbB4 mRNA in nigral dopamine neurons was confirmed with an independent RNA probe, as well as with combined tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining. Immunoblotting appeared to support the observation of in situ hybridization. Immunoreactivity for ErbB4 protein was much more enriched in substantia nigra pars compacta containing dopamine neurons than in neighboring substantia nigra pars reticulata. These observations suggest that ErbB4 is expressed in the dopaminergic neurons of primate substantia nigra and ErbB4 abnormality might contribute to the dopaminergic pathology associated with schizophrenia or other brain diseases."

In this study, we show that a major gap junctional protein, connexin43 (Cx43), in astrocytes is enhanced both in a rat Parkinson's disease (PD) model induced with rotenone, a widely used pesticide that inhibits mitochondrial complex I, and in vitro in cultured astrocytes stimulated with rotenone. Enhancement of Cx43 protein levels in rotenone-treated cultured astrocytes occurred in parallel with an increase in gap junctional intercellular communication, but was not accompanied with an increase in Cx43 mRNA levels. Furthermore, the rotenone-induced increase of Cx43 protein levels both in vitro and in vivo was associated with increased levels of phosphorylated Cx43, which is required for gap junctional intercellular communication. In our rat PD model, phosphorylated Cx43 was selectively enhanced in the basal ganglia regions, which contain DA neurons or their terminal areas. The increase of Cx43 levels was lower in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the striatum than in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the globus pallidus. Our findings indicate that modulation of Cx43 protein, and consequently gap junctional cellular communication, in astrocytes may play an important role in PD pathology."

In the present study, we have investigated the role of PAR-2, which can be activated by trypsin-like proteases, in microglial activation and neuronal cell death. In cultured rat primary microglia, activation of PAR-2 induced nitrite production by PKC- and MAPKs-dependent mechanism. Among the three members of MAPK pathway, ERK and JNK but not p38 mediated PAR-2-induced microglial activation. The down-stream regulator of PAR-2-PKC-MAPK pathway-induced microglial activation was NF-kappaB pathway. Besides nitrite, PAR-2 activation increased production of a variety of inflammatory mediators such as ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. The addition of culture spent media from PAR-2 activated microglia induced neuronal cell death in primary rat cortical neuron cultures with apoptotic features such as increased number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive neurons, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bax, decreased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and activation of caspase-3 in neurons. Interestingly, the increased production of cytoactive molecules as well as the neuronal cell death was normalized by PAR-2 or trypsin inhibitor or an NO synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester. Taken together, these results suggest that overt PAR-2 activation may induce microglial activation, which contributes to neuronal cell death."

The cellular specificity of transgene expression from rAAV2/1 vectors (recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors pseudotyped with viral capsids from serotype 1) using the tetracycline-inducible (TetON) expression cassette in comparison with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was investigated in the rat nigrostriatal pathway. After intrastriatal injection, although green fluorescent protein (GFP) was expressed mainly in neurons with both vectors, the relative proportions of DARPP-32-positive projection neurons and parvalbumin-positive interneurons were, respectively, 13:1 and 2:1 for the CMV and TetON vectors. DARP32-positive neurons projecting to the globus pallidus were strongly GFP positive with both vectors, whereas those projecting to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) were efficiently labeled by the CMV vector but poorly by the TetON vector. Numerous GFP-positive cells were evidenced in the subventricular zone with both vectors. However, in the olfactory bulb (OB), GFP-positive neurons were observed with the CMV vector but not the TetON vector. We conclude that the absence of significant amounts of transgene product in distant regions (SN and OB) constitutes a safety advantage of the AAV2/1-TetON vector for striatal gene therapy. Midbrain injections resulted in selective GFP expression in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons by the TetON vector whereas with the CMV vector, GFP-positive cells covered a widespread area of the midbrain. The biodistribution of GFP protein corresponded to that of the transcripts and not of the viral genomes. We conclude that the rAAV2/1-TetON vector constitutes an interesting tool for specific transgene expression in midbrain dopaminergic neurons."

One hypothetical advantage associated with the use of mGlu receptor ligands is the lack of the adverse effects typically induced by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, such as sedation, ataxia, and severe learning impairment. Low doses of the mGlu2/3 metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, LY379268 (0.25-3 mg/kg, i.p.) increased glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mRNA and protein levels in the mouse brain, as assessed by in situ hybridization, real-time PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. This increase was prominent in the striatum, but was also observed in the cerebral cortex. GDNF mRNA levels peaked at 3 h and declined afterwards, whereas GDNF protein levels progressively increased from 24 to 72 h following LY379268 injection. The action of LY379268 was abrogated by the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist, LY341495 (1 mg/kg, i.p.), and was lost in mGlu3 receptor knockout mice, but not in mGlu2 receptor knockout mice. In pure cultures of striatal neurons, the increase in GDNF induced by LY379268 required the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathways, as shown by the use of specific inhibitors of the two pathways. Both in vivo and in vitro studies led to the conclusion that neurons were the only source of GDNF in response to mGlu3 receptor activation. Remarkably, acute or repeated injections of LY379268 at doses that enhanced striatal GDNF levels (0.25 or 3 mg/kg, i.p.) were highly protective against nigro-striatal damage induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in mice, as assessed by stereological counting of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. We speculate that selective mGlu3 receptor agonists or enhancers are potential candidates as neuroprotective agents in Parkinson's disease, and their use might circumvent the limitations associated with the administration of exogenous GDNF."

Although the specific etiology and pathogenesis of sporadic PD remains unknown, neuronal death was proven to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and protein misfolding. However, molecular links between mitochondrial dysfunction and protein misfolding remains obscure. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a classical glycolytic enzyme, is responsible for carbohydrate metabolism under normal circumstances. When translocated to the nucleus, GAPDH promotes neuron apoptosis in several neurodegenerative disorders. But it seems that GAPDH translocation is not the sole mechanism responsible for neuronal apoptosis. We found that rotenone, a common mitochondrial complex I inhibitor used to produce experimental parkinsonism, cannot only induce GAPDH translocation but also trigger intermolecular disulfide bonding and result in the formation of intracytoplasmic aggregates of GAPDH. This suggests a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and protein misfolding, and sheds light on the pathophysiology of Lewy body formation in Parkinson's disease."

An increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression may be one of the molecular signals associated to compensatory and plastic responses occurring in basal ganglia during presymptomatic PD. In the present study, we used in vivo microdialysis, semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry to study N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor regulation of BDNF expression in substantia nigra (SN) of adult rats after partial lesioning of the nigrostriatal DA pathway with unilateral striatal injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). A time-dependent partial decrease of striatal DA tissue content as well as parallel and gradual increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate levels in SN were found 1 to 7 days after unilateral 6-OHDA intrastriatal injection. Instead, the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (IR) cells in the ipsilateral SN pars compacta remained statistically unchanged after neurotoxin injection. Intrastriatal administration of 6-OHDA also produced an early and transient augmentation of pan-BDNF, exon II-BDNF, and exon III-BDNF transcripts in the ipsilateral SN. The pan-BDNF and exon II-BDNF transcript increases were completely abolished by the prior systemic administration of MK-801, a selective antagonist of NMDA receptors. MK-801 also blocked the increase in BDNF-IR cells in SN observed 7 days after unilateral 6-OHDA intrastriatal injections. Our findings suggest that a coupling between glutamate release, NMDA receptor activation, and BDNF expression may exist in the adult SN and represent an important signal in this midbrain nucleus triggered in response to partial DA loss occurring in striatal nerve endings during presymptomatic PD."

DA is an important mediator of the behavioral actions of nicotine, and dopaminergic neurotransmission is altered following nicotine administration. We investigated the effect of nicotine withdrawal on the expression of VMAT2 in the midbrain DA neurons in animals dependent to nicotine. Mice were injected with nicotine free base 2mg/kg, sc, four times daily for 14 days and killed 12-72h after drug discontinuation. VMAT2 protein was increased in the striatum of nicotine-treated mice in a time-dependent fashion at all times studied. Furthermore, in situ hybridization studies demonstrated that VMAT2 mRNA was elevated in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area, indicating enhanced gene expression and subsequent protein synthesis. Tissue DA content and synthesis were unaltered in the striatum of nicotine-treated mice at the times studied. However, basal DA release was decreased at 12 and 24h after nicotine discontinuation which coincided with the elevated levels of VMAT2 protein. VMAT2 up-regulation might be a compensatory mechanism to restore and maintain synaptic transmission in dopaminergic midbrain neurons during nicotine withdrawal."

The two most highly expressed members of the PAR family in gingival epithelial cells (GECs) are PAR1 and PAR2. The major virulence factors of periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis are its proteases which can activate PAR2. However, little is known about the function of PARs in GECs when they are activated by their endogenous agonist enzymes. The purpose of this study was to characterize how the expression of innate immune markers is modulated when PAR1 and PAR2 are activated by their agonist enzymes, thrombin and trypsin, respectively. Here, we report that activation of PAR1 and PAR2 induces cell proliferation at low concentration. Activation of PAR via proteolytic activity of thrombin and trypsin induces expression of CXCL5/ENA-78 and CCL20/MIP3alpha in a concentration-dependent manner. Induction of CXCL5 via PAR1 was inhibited in the presence of PAR1 cleavage blocking antibodies and by PAR1 siRNA. The induction of CXCL5 and CCL20 via PAR2 was inhibited by PAR2 siRNA. These findings indicate an active role in innate immune responses by PAR1 and PAR2 in GECs. Modulation of innate immunity by PARs may contribute to co-ordinated and balanced immunosurveillance in GECs."

Therefore, we investigated P2X receptor expression and regulation of spontaneous firing activity in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in rats using patch-clamp and Ca(2+)-imaging techniques. In most neurons, application of ATP (1 microM-1 mM) increased firing rate dose-dependently (EC(50)=1.26+/-0.26 microM, n=45). When the P2-receptor agonists such as 2-methylthio-adenosine 5'-triphosphate (2-MeSATP) or ATPgammaS were applied or pressure-applied to the neuron, the firing activity increased together with a rise in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]c), but application of beta,gamma-methylene ATP (P2X(1, 3) agonist) or methylthio-adenosine 5'-diphosphate (P2Y(1) agonist) had no effect. In many neurons, the effect of ATP was abolished by the application of the P2-receptor antagonists, suramin or pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS). When ATP was applied in a Ca(2+)-free solution, there was no detectable change in [Ca(2+)]c, suggesting that ATP does not release Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. In the single-cell reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we found that 65% of dopaminergic neurons expressed mRNAs for P2X receptors; positive amplifications of P2X(6) (57.1%), P2X(2/6) (25.0%), and P2X(4) mRNA (17.9%), respectively. From the above results, we could conclude that ATP modulates firing activities in the rat SNc dopaminergic neurons, possibly via P2X(2), P2X(2/6), and/or P2X(4) receptors."

Mast cell has been identified to be able to express PARs and release an array of cytokines upon activation. Recently, it was reported that interleukin (IL)-12 could regulate the expression of PARs in mast cells, and tryptase could induce IL-4 and IL-6 release from mast cells. In order to further investigate the issues, RNA interference (RNAi) technique was employed and small interfering RNAs (siRNA) of PARs were transfected in P815 cells.RESULTS: The results showed that siRNAs for PAR-1, PAR-2 and PAR-4 significantly downregulated expression of PAR-1, PAR-2 and PAR-4 mRNAs and proteins in P815 cells at 24, 48 and 72 h following transfection. siRNA PAR-1.2 and siRNA PAR-4.2 significantly reduced IL-12 induced upregulation of PAR-1 and PAR-4 expression, respectively when P815 cells were transfected with them for 48 h. siRNA PAR-2.3 blocked IL-12 induced downregulation of PAR-2 expression on both mRNA and protein levels. It was also observed that siRNA PAR-2.3 and siRNA PAR-1.2 reduced trypsin induced IL-4 release by approximately 92.6% and 65.3%, and SLIGKV-NH2 induced IL-4 release by 82.1% and 60.1%, respectively. Similarly, siRNA PAR-2.3 eliminated tryptase-induced IL-4 release by 75.3%, and siRNA PAR-1.2 diminished SFLLR-NH2 induced IL-4 release by 79.3%. However, siRNA PAR-1.2, siRNA PAR-2.3 and siRNA PAR-4.3 at 10 nM did not show any effect on tryptase-induced IL-6 release from P815 cells.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, siRNAs of PARs can modulate PAR expression and PAR related cytokine production in mast cells, confirming that PARs are likely to play a role in allergic reactions."

Male Sprague-Dawley rats received a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) administration in the nigrostriatal pathway. Rats were divided into three groups treated with: (i) levodopa (6 mg/kg) twice daily for 22 days starting at 4 weeks after 6-OHDA (Early group); (ii) levodopa at the same dose, regimen and duration but starting at 12 weeks after 6-OHDA (Late group), and (iii) saline starting at 4 weeks after 6-OHDA and continuing until the Late group finished treatment. Dyskinesias were quantified on days 1 and 22 of levodopa treatment. Striatal expression of preproenkephalin and preprodynorphin mRNAs, subthalamic cytochrome oxidase mRNA, and glutamate decarboxylase 67 mRNA in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra was measured by in-situ hybridization. After 22 days of levodopa treatment, the percentage of rats showing dyskinesia was lower in the Early group than in the Late group (60% vs. 100%, respectively). No significant differences in total dyskinesia score were observed between both groups with the exception of the orolingual dyskinesias that were significantly less frequent in the Late group (P &lt; 0.01). No significant differences were observed in the molecular markers between the Early and Late groups. Prompt initiation of levodopa treatment might be able to delay some of the basal ganglia molecular and circuitry changes underlying the development of dyskinesia but, once developed, they are behaviorally and molecularly similar to those appearing after late initiation of levodopa."

We here report that stimulation of the lung epithelial cell line A549 by thrombin leads to transient increase of SPHK1 activity and elevation of intracellular sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P); abrogation of this stimulation by SPHK1-specific siRNA, pharmacological inhibition, or expression of a dominant-negative SPHK1 mutant blocks the response to thrombin, as measured by secretion of MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, and PGE(2). Using selective stimulation of proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) a specific involvement of SPHK1 in the PAR-1 induced responses in A549 cell, including activation of NFkappaB, was evident, while PAR-2 and PAR-4 responses were independent of SPHK1. Moreover, PAR-1 or thrombin-induced cytokine production and adhesion factor expression of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was also seen to depend on SPHK1. Using dermal microvascular endothelial cells from SPHK1-deficient mice, we showed that absence of the enzyme abrogates MCP-1 production induced in these cells upon treatment with thrombin or PAR-1 activating peptide. We propose SPHK1 inhibition as a novel way to block PAR-1 mediated signalling, which could be useful in treatment of a number of diseases, in particular in atherosclerosis."

Vitrectomy was performed after 1 (n = 12) or 2 (n = 22) intravitreous antibiotic injections. McNemar's nonparametric test was used to compare culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results between diluted and undiluted samples.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of positivity of conventional culture (brain heart infusion broth) and eubacterial PCR tests from undiluted and diluted vitreous samples.RESULTS: The microbiological analysis of both undiluted and diluted vitreous samples detected and identified a bacterial pathogen in 26 out of 34 cases (76.4%). The analysis of undiluted and diluted vitreous at the time of PPV, using eubacterial PCR and conventional culture, gave similar results (P = 0.99; McNemar test). However, eubacterial PCR was more sensitive than culture in detecting bacteria in vitreous at the time of PPV (76% vs 6%; P = 0.001; McNemar test). The difference in sensitivity between the 2 techniques was primarily associated with false-negative culture results for undiluted samples (2/3 of cases), mainly for coagulase-negative staphylococci.CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological results obtained combining PCR and culture techniques were similar for diluted vitreous and undiluted vitreous analysis. When eubacterial PCR is available, sampling diluted vitreous, an easier procedure, may replace sampling undiluted vitreous."

The object of this study was to demonstrate the presence and function of PAR-1 and PAR-2 in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV).METHODS: DMNV neurons were isolated from neonatal rat brainstems using micro-dissection and enzymatic digestion. Neurons were cultured in Neurobasal medium A containing 2% B27 supplement. Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was measured using fura-2 based microspectrometry. Expression of PARs was detected by RT-PCR and immunofluorescent staining. KEY RESULT: Thrombin and PAR-1 agonist peptide activate PAR-1 with a maximum change in [Ca(2+)](i) expressed as DeltaF/F0 of 229 +/- 14% and 137 +/- 7%, respectively. Trypsin and PAR-2 agonist peptide activate PAR-2 with a maximum DeltaF/F0 change of 258 +/- 12% and 242 +/- 10%, respectively. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) by U73312 (1 microm) decreased the maximal change in DeltaF/F0 induced by PAR-1 activation from 140 +/- 17% to 21 +/- 3%, while the PAR-2-mediated maximal change in DeltaF/F0 decreased from 185 +/- 21% to 19 +/- 6%. Blockade of IP3 receptor with 2APB inhibited the maximal change in DeltaF/F0 due to PAR-1 and PAR-2 activation by 72 +/- 13% and 71 +/- 20% respectively. PAR-1 immnuoreactivity was present in DMV neurons. Increase in transcripts for PAR-1 and PAR-2 were detected in DMV tissues derived from IBD rats relative to control animals.CONCLUSIONS &amp; INFERENCES: Our results indicate that PAR-1 and PAR-2 are present in the DMV neurons, and their activation leads to increases in intracellular calcium via signal transduction mechanism that involves activation of PLC and the production of IP3."

Here, we provide evidence that anti-akinetic STN-HFS or dyskinesiogenic L-DOPA similarly reversed the dopamine lesion-induced increases in gene expression of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (CoI), a metabolic marker of neuronal activity, in the globus pallidus, STN and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in rats. In contrast, in entopeduncular nucleus (EP), STN-HFS did not modify the lesion-induced increase in CoI mRNA levels, whereas L-DOPA induced a marked decrease versus control. Combining the two treatments did not reveal significant interaction. Interestingly, CoI gene expression in EP but not in SNr was inversely correlated with striatal preprodynorphin mRNA level, a LID marker. This work suggests the existence of two functional basal ganglia subcircuits: the one, including STN and SNr, involved in antiparkinsonian action, and the other, including EP, preferentially involved in LID."

Furthermore, the expression of CB mRNA and protein levels in SN was studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. An 11% loss of CB+ DA neurons was detected in both the rostral (8.9%) and caudal (1.7%) segments but not in the intermedial segment of SNc in aged rats compared to adult rats (P&lt;0.05). No difference was detected in CB mRNA and protein levels between aged and adult rats (P&gt;0.05). These data suggest that expression levels of CB mRNA and protein may increase in the existing SNc DA neurons, which may compensate for the partial age dependent loss of CB+ DA neurons in the SNc."

Within these midbrain regions and admixed with the dopamine neurons, are also substantial populations of GABAergic neurons that regulate dopamine neuron activity and have projection targets similar to those of dopamine neurons. Additionally, there is a small group of putative glutamatergic neurons within the ventral tegmental area whose function remains unclear. Although dopamine neurons have been intensively studied and quantified, there is little quantitative information regarding the GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. We therefore used unbiased stereological methods to estimate the number of dopaminergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic cells in these regions in the rat. Neurons were identified using a combination of immunohistochemistry (tyrosine hydroxylase) and in situ hybridization (glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 mRNA). In substantia nigra pars compacta 29% of cells were glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA-positive, 58% in the retrorubral field and 35% in the ventral tegmental area. There were further differences in the relative sizes of the GABAergic populations in subnuclei of the ventral tegmental area. Thus, glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA-positive neurons represented 12% of cells in the interfascicular nucleus, 30% in the parabrachial nucleus, and 45% in the parainterfascicular nucleus. Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 mRNA-positive neurons were present in the ventral tegmental area, but not substantia nigra or retrorubral field. They were mainly confined to the rostro-medial region of the ventral tegmental area, and represented approximately 2-3% of the total neurons counted ( approximately 1600 cells). These results demonstrate that GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons represent large proportions of the neurons in what are traditionally considered as dopamine nuclei and that there are considerable heterogeneities in the proportions of cell types in the different dopaminergic midbrain regions."

KLK4 and PAR-2 are co-expressed during prostate cancer progression.";"Kallikrein-related peptidase 4 (KLK4) is one of the 15 members of the human KLK family and a trypsin-like, prostate cancer-associated serine protease. Signaling initiated by trypsin-like serine proteases are transduced across the plasma membrane primarily by members of the protease-activated receptor (PAR) family of G protein-coupled receptors. Here we show, using Ca(2+) flux assays, that KLK4 signals via both PAR-1 and PAR-2 but not via PAR-4. Dose-response analysis over the enzyme concentration range 0.1-1000 nM indicated that KLK4-induced Ca(2+) mobilization via PAR-1 is more potent than via PAR-2, whereas KLK4 displayed greater efficacy via the latter PAR. We confirmed the specificity of KLK4 signaling via PAR-2 using in vitro protease cleavage assays and anti-phospho-ERK1/2/total ERK1/2 Western blot analysis of PAR-2-overexpressing and small interfering RNA-mediated receptor knockdown cell lines. Consistently, confocal microscopy analyses indicated that KLK4 initiates loss of PAR-2 from the cell surface and receptor internalization. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated the co-expression of agonist and PAR-2 in primary prostate cancer and bone metastases, suggesting that KLK4 signaling via this receptor will have pathological relevance. These data provide insight into KLK4-mediated cell signaling and suggest that signals induced by this enzyme via PARs may be important in prostate cancer."

Parkinsonian movement disorders are often associated with abnormalities in SNr GABA neuron firing intensity and/or pattern. A fundamental question remains regarding the molecular identity of the ion channels that drive these neurons to a depolarized membrane potential. We show here that SNr GABA projection neurons selectively express type 3 canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC3) channels. These channels are tonically active and mediate an inward, Na+-dependent current, leading to a substantial depolarization in these neurons. Inhibition of TRPC3 channels induces hyperpolarization, decreases firing frequency, and increases firing irregularity. These data demonstrate that TRPC3 channels play important roles in ensuring the appropriate firing intensity and pattern in SNr GABA projection neurons that are crucial to movement control."

Genome screens have provided evidence of linkage to chromosome 2q31-q33, which includes the SLC25A12 gene. Association between autism and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in SLC25A12 has been reported in various studies. SLC25A12 encodes the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier functionally important in neurons with high-metabolic activity. Neuropathological findings and functional abnormalities in autism have been reported for Brodmann's area (BA) 46 and the cerebellum. We found that SLC25A12 was expressed more strongly in the post-mortem brain tissues of autistic subjects than in those of controls, in the BA46 prefrontal cortex but not in cerebellar granule cells. SLC25A12 expression was not modified in brain subregions of bipolar and schizophrenic patients. SLC25A12 was expressed in developing human neuronal tissues, including neocortical regions containing excitatory neurons and neocortical progenitors and the ganglionic eminences that generate neocortical inhibitory interneurons. At mid-gestation, when gyri and sulci start to develop, SLC25A12 molecular gradients were identified in the lateral prefrontal and ventral temporal cortex. These fetal structures generate regions with abnormal activity in autism, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA46), the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal cortex and the fusiform gyrus. SLC25A12 overexpression or silencing in mouse embryonic cortical neurons also modified dendrite length and the mobility of dendritic mitochondria. Our findings suggest that SLC25A12 overexpression may be involved in the pathophysiology of autism, modifying neuronal networks in specific subregions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and fusiform gyrus, at both pre- and postnatal stages."

In the present study, double in situ hybridization was used to examine tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and VGLUT2 mRNA expression during the embryonic development of these neurons, and postnatally, in normal rats and rats injected with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) at P4 to destroy partially DA neurons. At embryonic days 15 and 16, there was a regional overlap in the labeling of TH and VGLUT2 mRNA in the ventral mesencephalon, which was no longer found at late embryonic stages (E18-E21) and postnatally. In normal pups from P5 to P15, only 1-2% of neurons containing TH mRNA in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra, pars compacta, also displayed VGLUT2 mRNA. In contrast, after the cerebroventricular administration of 6-OHDA at P4, 26% of surviving DA neurons in the VTA of P15 rats expressed VGLUT2. To search for a colocalization of TH and VGLUT2 protein in axon terminals of these neurons, the nucleus accumbens of normal and 6-OHDA-lesioned P15 rats was examined by electron microscopy after dual immunocytochemical labeling. In normal rats, VGLUT2 protein was found in 28% of TH positive axon terminals in the core of nucleus accumbens. In 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, the total number of TH positive terminals was considerably reduced, and yet the proportion also displaying VGLUT2 immunoreactivity was modestly but significantly increased (37%). These results lead to the suggestion that the glutamatergic phenotype of a VTA DA neurons is highly plastic, repressed toward the end of normal embryonic development, and derepressed postnatally following injury. They also support the hypothesis of co-release of glutamate and DA by mesencephalic neurons in vivo, at least in the developing brain."

Yet, the subunit composition and specific location of nAChRs involved in DA-mediated locomotion remain to be established in vivo. Mice lacking the beta2 subunit of nAChRs (beta2KO) display striking hyperactivity in the open field, which suggests an imbalance in DA neurotransmission. Here, we performed the selective gene rescue of functional beta2*-nAChRs in either the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of beta2KO mice. SNpc rescued mice displayed normalization of locomotor activity, both in familiar and unfamiliar environments, whereas restoration in the VTA only rescued exploratory behavior. These data demonstrate the dissociation between nigrostriatal and mesolimbic beta2*-nAChRs in regulating unique locomotor functions. In addition, the site-directed knock-down of the beta2 subunit in the SNpc by RNA interference caused hyperactivity in wild-type mice. These findings highlight the crucial interplay of nAChRs over the DA control of spontaneous locomotion."

These peptides mediate stress responses by their interactions with the CRF receptors and the CRF-binding protein (CRF-BP). Because the CRF-BP is implicated in neurotransmission within the ventral tegmental area (VTA), we investigated whether the CRF-BP is expressed in VTA neurons. By in situ hybridization, we detected cellular expression of CRF-BP mRNA in the VTA; no such expression was seen in neighboring substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) or substantia nigra pars reticulata. By double in situ hybridization, we determined that VTA neurons with CRF-BP mRNA coexpressed transcripts encoding either tyrosine hydroxylase [TH; a marker for dopamine (DA) neurons] or glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD; synthesizing enzyme of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)]. Neurons with CRF-BP mRNA represented 25% of the total population of TH-expressing neurons and 28% of the total population of GAD-expressing neurons, indicating that discrete subpopulations of dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons are present in the VTA. Within the total population of neurons containing CRF-BP mRNA, 70% coexpressed TH mRNA and only 27% coexpressed GAD mRNA. As far as we are aware, we provide the first anatomical evidence that a molecule, CRF-BP, is encoded by DAergic neurons of the VTA but not by those of the SNC. We propose, based on the observation that the majority of VTA neurons expressing CRF-BP mRNA are DAergic, that in the VTA interactions of CRF-BP with CRF, or with CRF-related peptides, are likely to be mediated predominantly by DAergic neurons."

Thrombin up-regulates expression of several proteins including cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and contributes to vascular diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying thrombin-regulated COX-2 expression in VSMCs remain unclear. Western blotting, RT-PCR, and EIA kit analyses showed that thrombin induced the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein and PGE(2) release in a time-dependent manner, which was attenuated by inhibitors of PKC (GF109203X and rottlerin), c-Src (PP1), EGF receptor (EGFR; AG1478) and MEK1/2 (U0126), or transfection with dominant negative mutants of PKC-delta, c-Src or extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and ERK1 short hairpin RNA interference (shRNA). These results suggest that transactivation of EGFR participates in COX-2 expression induced by thrombin in VSMCs. Accordingly, thrombin stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 which was attenuated by GF109203X, rottlerin, PP1, GM6001, CRM197, AG1478, or U0126, respectively. Furthermore, this up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA and protein was blocked by selective inhibitors of AP-1 and NF-kappaB, curcumin and helenalin, respectively. Moreover, thrombin-stimulated activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and COX-2 promoter activity was blocked by the inhibitors of c-Src, PKC, EGFR, MEK1/2, AP-1 and NF-kappaB, suggesting that thrombin induces COX-2 promoter activity mediated through PKC(delta)/c-Src-dependent EGFR transactivation, MEK-ERK1/2, AP-1, and NF-kappaB. These results demonstrate that in VSMCs, activation of ERK1/2, AP-1 and NF-kappaB pathways was essential for thrombin-induced COX-2 gene expression. Understanding the regulation of COX-2 expression and PGE(2) release by thrombin/PARs system on VSMCs may provide potential therapeutic targets of vascular inflammatory disorders including arteriosclerosis."

In mammals, this depends on pineal melatonin secretion and effects in the hypothalamus, but the cellular and molecular substrates of its action are poorly understood. The recent identification of a mammalian orthologue of the avian gonadotrophin-inhibitory hormone gene has led to interest in its possible involvement in seasonal breeding. In long-day breeding Syrian hamsters, hypothalamic RFamide-related peptide (RFRP) expression is increased by exposure to long photoperiod. Because, opposite to hamsters, sheep are short-day breeders, we predicted that a conserved role in mammalian reproductive activation would decrease RFRP expression in sheep under a long photoperiod. We cloned the ovine RFRP cDNA and examined its expression pattern in Soay sheep acclimated to a 16 : 8 h or 8 : 16 h light /dark cycle (LP and SP, respectively). RFRP was expressed widely in the sheep hypothalamus and increased modestly overall with exposure to LP. Interestingly, RFRP expression in the ependymal cells surrounding the base of the third ventricle was highly photoperiodic, with levels being undetectable in animals held on SP but consistently high under LP. These data are inconsistent with a conserved reproductive role for RFRP across mammals. Additionally, we cloned the ovine homologue of the cognate RFRP receptor, rfr-2 (NPFF1) and found localised expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and in the pars tuberalis. Taken together, these data strengthen the emerging view that interplay between ependymal cells and the pars tuberalis might be important for the seasonal timing system."

Circadian clock genes are known to be expressed in the PT in response to the decline (Per1) and onset (Cry1) of MEL secretion, but to date little is known of other molecular changes in this key MEL target site. To identify transcriptional pathways that may be involved in the diurnal and photoperiod-transduction mechanism, we performed a whole genome transcriptome analysis using PT RNA isolated from sheep culled at three time points over the 24-h cycle under either long or short photoperiods. Our results reveal 153 transcripts where expression differs between photoperiods at the light-dark transition and 54 transcripts where expression level was more globally altered by photoperiod (all time points combined). Cry1 induction at night was associated with up-regulation of genes coding for NeuroD1 (neurogenic differentiation factor 1), Pbef / Nampt (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase), Hif1alpha (hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha), and Kcnq5 (K+ channel) and down-regulation of Rorbeta, a key clock gene regulator. Using in situ hybridization, we confirmed day-night differences in expression for Pbef / Nampt, NeuroD1, and Rorbeta in the PT. Treatment of sheep with MEL increased PT expression for Cry1, Pbef / Nampt, NeuroD1, and Hif1alpha, but not Kcnq5. Our data thus reveal a cluster of Cry1-associated genes that are acutely responsive to MEL and novel transcriptional pathways involved in MEL action in the PT."

Recently, multiple causative mutations have been identified in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene for both familial and sporadic PD cases. Therefore, to investigate functional roles of LRRK2 in normal and/or diseased brain, it is critical to define LRRK2 expression in mDA neurons. To address whether LRRK2 mRNA and protein are expressed in mDA neurons, we purified DA neurons from the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-GFP transgenic mouse using FACS-sorting and analyzed the expression of LRRK2 and other mDA markers. We observed that all mDA markers tested in this study (TH, Pitx3, DAT, Nurr1 and Lmx1a) are robustly expressed only in GFP(+) cells, but not in GFP(-) cells. Notably, LRRK2 was expressed in both GFP(+) and GFP(-) cells. Consistent with this, our immunohistochemical analyses showed that LRRK2 is expressed in TH-positive mDA neurons as well as in surrounding TH-negative cells in the rat brain. Importantly, in the midbrain region, LRRK2 protein was preferentially expressed in A9 DA neurons of the substantia nigra, compared to A10 DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area. However, LRRK2 was also highly expressed in the cortical and hippocampal regions. Taken together, our results suggest that LRRK2 may have direct functional role(s) in the neurophysiology of A9 DA neurons and that dysfunction of these neurons by mutant LRRK2 may directly cause their selective degeneration."

Bacterial cultures were performed on the same ocular samples by using traditional methods (brain-heart infusion broth).RESULTS: At the time of admission, the detection rate was not significantly different between cultures and PCR (38.2% for cultures versus 34.6% for PCR in aqueous humor samples; 54% versus 57% in vitreous from a vitreous tap). In contrast, in the vitreous obtained from vitrectomy, after intravitreous injection of antibiotics, PCR detected bacteria in 70% of the cases, compared with 9% in cultures. By combining PCR and cultures, bacterial identification was obtained in 47% of aqueous humor samples at admission, in 68% of vitreous samples from a vitreous tap at admission, and in 72% of vitreous samples from pars plana vitrectomy. Gram-positive bacteria predominated (94.3%). The concordance between cultures and PCR was 100%. The contamination rate was 2%.CONCLUSIONS: Cultures and eubacterial PCR are complementary techniques for bacterial identification in eyes with acute postcataract endophthalmitis.

It has been claimed that PAR-3 does not signal autonomously, although the wide expression of human PAR-3 indicates its important physiological roles. We demonstrate that in HEK-293 cells, stably transfected with human PAR-3, thrombin induced calcium signaling, IL-8 gene expression and IL-8 release. We confirmed this finding using human lung epithelial and human astrocytoma cells that express endogenous PAR-3. Moreover, thrombin exposure of HEK-293 cells resulted in ERK1/2 activation coinciding with IL-8 release. The effects of thrombin were not dependent on PAR-1 activation, as confirmed by PAR-1 gene silencing. Thus, we propose that PAR-3 is able to signal autonomously to induce IL-8 release mediated by ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which contributes actively to inflammatory responses."

There are striking similarities between tumor cell invasion and cytotrophoblast implantation to the deciduas whereby the role of Protease Activated Receptors (PARs) and wnt signaling is well recognized. We examine here consequences of modulation of PAR1 and PAR2 expression and function on CTB invasion and beta-catenin stabilization. Toward this end, we utilized a model system of extravillous trophoblast (EVT) organ culture and various placenta cell lines (e.g., JAR and HTR-8/Svneo). Activation of PAR1 induces EVT invasion while hPar1-SiRNA and PAR1 antagonist SCH79797--effectively inhibited it. In parallel, the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) similarly inhibited it. Nuclear localization of beta-catenin is seen only after PAR1 activation, and is markedly reduced following the application of hPar1-SiRNA construct and PAR1 antagonist in CTBs. In contrast, PAR2 elicited a low cytoplasmic beta-catenin level as also proliferation and invasion. In the non-activated CTBs in-comparison, beta-catenin appeared limited to the membrane pools. Concomitantly, a temporal regulated pattern of Wnt-4, 5a, 7b, 10a, 10b expression is seen along PAR1 appearance. Enforced expression of Wnt antagonists, Secreted Frizzled Related Proteins; SFRP2 &amp; 5; into HTR-8/Svneo, resulted with a markedly reduced nuclear beta-catenin levels, similar to the effect obtained by hPar1-SiRNA treatment. Identification of PAR1 downstream target/s may nonetheless contribute to the formation of a future platform system for eliciting a firm placenta-uterus interactions and to the definition of late pregnancy outcomes."

Here we show that isoform 2 of the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT2) is expressed by neurons in the ENT nucleus but not in the SNr. Indeed, dual in situ hybridization demonstrated that the ENT nucleus contains two different subpopulations of projection neurons, one single-expressing GAD65/67 mRNAs and another one that co-expresses either of the GAD isoforms together with VGLUT2 mRNA. Unilateral dopaminergic depletion induced marked changes in pallidothalamic-projecting neuron gene expression, resulting in increased expression of GAD65/67 mRNAs together with a clear down-regulation of VGLUT2 mRNA expression. Our results indicate that the increased thalamic inhibition typical of dopamine depletion might be explained by a synergistic effect of increased GABA outflow coupled to decreased glutamate levels, both neurotransmitters coming from ENT neurons."

In this study, we analyzed the role of direct cell-to-cell Delta-Notch signaling in zebrafish anterior pituitary cell type specification. We demonstrate that initial formation of the anterior pituitary placode is independent of Notch signaling. Later however, loss of Notch signaling in mind bomb (mib) mutant embryos or by DAPT treatment leads to increased numbers of lactotropes and loss of corticotropes in the anterior pars distalis (APD), increased number of thyrotropes and loss of somatotrope cell types in the posterior pars distalis (PPD), and fewer melanotropes in the posterior region of the adenohypophysis, the pars intermedia (PI). Conversely, Notch gain of function leads to the opposite result, loss of lactotrope and thyrotrope cell specification, and an increased number of corticotropes, melanotropes, and gonadotropes in the pituitary. Our results suggest that Notch acts on placodal cells, presumably as a permissive signal, to regulate progenitor cell specification to hormone secreting cell types. We propose that Notch mediated lateral inhibition regulates the relative numbers of specified hormone cell types in the three pituitary subdomains."

Local delivery of the trophic factors can rescue dopaminergic neurons and halt the progression of PD. In this study we show that fetal E11 striatum-derived neurospheres and E14.5 ventral mesencephalon (VM) -derived neurospheres (NS E11 and NSvm, respectively) are a source of factors that rescue dopaminergic neurons. First, long-term expanded NS E11 and NSvm rescued primary dopaminergic neurons from serum-deprivation induced apoptosis and promoted survival of dopaminergic neurons for 14 days in vitro and this effect was due to soluble contact-independent factor/s. Second, green fluorescent protein-expressing NS E11 and NSvm grafted into the midbrain of mice with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced Parkinsonism resulted in partial rescue of the nigro-striatal system and improvement of the hypo-dopaminergic behavioral deficit. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that intact NS E11 and NSvm expressed fibroblast growth factor-2, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), pleiotrophin, neurotrophin-3, but not glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). GDNF expression was also undetectable in vivo in grafted NS E11 and NSvm suggesting that NS-derived factor/s other than GDNF mediated the rescue of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Identification of NS-derived soluble factor(s) may lead to development of novel neuroprotective therapies for PD. An unexpected observation of the present study was the detection of the ectopic host-derived tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -expressing cells in sham-grafted mice and NS E11- and NSvm -grafted mice. We speculate that injury-derived signals (such as inflammatory cytokines that are commonly released during transplantation) induce TH expression in susceptible cells."

Although the GR has been intensively studied in mammals, very little is known about the GR in nonmammalian tetrapods. We analyzed the distribution and GC regulation of GR in the brain of the frog Xenopus laevis by immunohistochemistry. GR-immunoreactive (GR-ir) cells were widely distributed, with the highest densities in the medial pallium (mp; homolog of the mammalian hippocampus), accumbens, anterior preoptic area (POA; homolog of the mammalian paraventricular nucleus), Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and rostral anterior pituitary gland (location of corticotropes). Lower but distinct GR-ir was observed in the internal granule cell layer of the olfactory bulbs, dorsal and lateral pallium, striatum, various subfields of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), optic tectum, various tegmental nuclei, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, reticular nuclei, and the nuclei of the trigeminal motor nerves. Treatment with corticosterone (CORT) for 4 days significantly decreased GR-ir in the POA, mp, medial amygdala (MeA), BNST, and rostral pars distalis. Treatment with the corticosteroid synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (MTP) also significantly reduced GR-ir in the POA, mp, MeA and BNST, but not in the rostral pars distalis. Replacement with a low dose of CORT in MTP-treated animals reversed these effects in brain. Thus, chronic increase or decrease in circulating corticosteroids reduces GR-ir in regions of the frog brain. Our results show that the central distribution of GR-ir and regulation by corticosteroids are highly conserved among vertebrates."

Genes homologous to parA and parB, and two putative parS copies, have been identified in the Mycobacterium bovis BCG and Mycobacterium smegmatis chromosomes. As in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the parA and parB genes in these two non-pathogenic mycobacteria are located near the chromosomal origin of replication. The present work focused on the determination of the transcriptional organisation of the ~6 Kb orf60K-parB region of M. bovis BCG and M. smegmatis by primer extension, transcriptional fusions to the green fluorescence protein (GFP) and quantitative RT-PCR.RESULTS: The parAB genes were arranged in an operon. However, we also found promoters upstream of each one of these genes. Seven putative promoter sequences were identified in the orf60K-parB region of M. bovis BCG, whilst four were identified in the homologous region of M. smegmatis, one upstream of each open reading frame (ORF).Real-time PCR assays showed that in M. smegmatis, mRNA-parA and mRNA-parB levels decreased between the exponential and stationary phases. In M. bovis BCG, mRNA-parA levels also decreased between the exponential and stationary phases. However, parB expression was higher than parA expression and remained almost unchanged along the growth curve.CONCLUSION: The majority of the proposed promoter regions had features characteristic of Mycobacterium promoters previously denoted as Group D. The -10 hexamer of a strong E. coli sigma70-like promoter, located upstream of gidB of M. bovis BCG, overlapped with a putative parS sequence, suggesting that the transcription from this promoter might be regulated by the binding of ParB to parS."

Although the binding protein (BP) for CRF-related peptides, CRF-BP, is an important player in the many functions of the CRF system, the distribution of CRF-BP and the impact of stressors on its expression in fish are poorly understood. In the present study, we describe the distribution of CRF-BP in the brain and peripheral tissues of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using a combination of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. Our results indicate a widespread and highly localised distribution of CRF-BP in the central nervous system, but do not support a significant peripheral production of the protein. Major expression sites in the brain include the area ventralis telencephali, nucleus preopticus, anterior and lateral tuberal nuclei, and the posterior region of the pituitary pars distalis. We further characterise changes in CRF-BP gene expression in three discrete brain regions after exposure to 8 h and 24 h of social stress or hypoxia. The plasma cortisol concentration in subordinate fish was much higher than in dominant fish and controls, and was indicative of a relatively severe stressor. By contrast, the increase in plasma cortisol concentration in fish exposed to hypoxia was characteristic of the response to a mild stressor. Changes in CRF-BP gene expression were only observed after 24 h of either stressor, and were region-specific. CRF-BP mRNA in the telencephalon increased in both subordinate fish and fish exposed to hypoxia, but CRF-BP in the preoptic area only increased after 24 h of hypoxia exposure. In the hypothalamus, CRF-BP mRNA levels decreased in dominant fish relative to controls after 24 h. Taken together, our results support a diverse role for CRF-BP in the central actions of the fish CRF system, but a negligible role in the peripheral functions of circulating CRF-related peptides. Furthermore, the differential changes in forebrain CRF-BP mRNA appear to occur independently of the hypothalamic-pituitary-inter-renal axis."

In fibrotic diseases, PAR-1 plays a major role in controlling fibroproliferative and inflammatory responses. Therefore, in these diseases, regulation of PAR-1 expression plays an important role. Using the selective prostaglandin EP2 receptor agonist butaprost and cAMP-elevating agents, we show here that prostaglandin (PG)E(2), via the prostanoid receptor EP2 and subsequent cAMP elevation, downregulates mRNA and protein levels of PAR-1 in human lung fibroblasts. Under these conditions, the functional response of PAR-1 in fibroblasts is reduced. These effects are specific for PGE(2). Activation of other receptors coupled to cAMP elevation, such as beta-adrenergic and adenosine receptors, does not reproduce the effects of PGE(2). PGE(2)-mediated downregulation of PAR-1 depends mainly on protein kinase A activity, but does not depend on another cAMP effector, the exchange protein activated by cAMP. PGE(2)-induced reduction of PAR-1 level is not due to a decrease of PAR-1 mRNA stability, but rather to transcriptional regulation. The present results provide further insights into the therapeutic potential of PGE(2) to specifically control fibroblast function in fibrotic diseases."

Teleostean fishes lack aldosterone and mineral regulatory processes seem under dominant control by cortisol. Despite the absence of the classical mineralocorticoid aldosterone, teleostean fishes do have an MR with cortisol and possibly 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) (as alternative for aldosterone) as predominant ligands. We studied corticoid receptors in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L). Through homology cloning and bioinformatic analysis, we found duplicated GR genes and a single MR gene. The GR genes likely result from a major genomic duplication event in the teleostean lineage; we propose that the gene for a second MR was lost. Transactivation studies show that the carp GRs and MR have comparable affinity for cortisol; the MR has significantly higher sensitivity to DOC, and this favours a role for DOC as MR ligand in fish physiology. mRNA of the GRs and the MR is expressed in forebrain (in pallial areas homologous to mammalian hippocampus), corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) cells in the pre-optic nucleus (NPO) and pituitary pars distalis ACTH cells, three key neural/endocrine components of the stress axis. After exposure to prolonged and strong (not to mild acute) stressors, mRNA levels of both GRs and MR become down-regulated in the brain, but not in the NPO CRH cells or pituitary ACTH cells. Our data predicts a function in stress physiology for all CRs and suggest telencephalon as a first line cortisol target in stress."

Dlk1, an epidermal growth factor-like repeat protein in preadipocytes, functions in maintaining the preadipose state. Expression of Dlk1 mRNA in the pituitary at E13.5 and in the adult pituitary was confirmed by in situ hybridization. The expression pattern of Dlk1 during pituitary development was also studied by immunohistochemistry. Dlk1 protein first appeared in Rathke's pouch and the infundibulum at E11.5; as development proceeded, expression became restricted to the pars distalis and pars tuberalis (PT). Dlk1 was expressed in most ACTH cells during the embryonic stages, but its expression was limited to only a few ACTH cells in the adult pituitary. It was also expressed in a small population of TSH, GTH, and PRL cells throughout development, whereas it was present in the cytoplasm of most GH cells at all developmental stages. Similarly, Dlk1 was localized in the cytoplasm of PT cells during development. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of Dlk1 regarding its regulation of pituitary hormone-secreting cells during development."

The chronic systemic administration of an agonist of dopamine D1/D5-preferring receptors is known to alter GAD mRNA levels in striatonigral neurons in intact and dopamine-depleted rats. In the present study, the effects of a single or subchronic systemic administration of the dopamine D1/D5-preferring receptor agonist SKF-81297 on GAD65, GAD67, PPD and vGAT mRNA levels in the striatum and GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit mRNA levels in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata, were measured in rats with a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion. After a single injection of SKF-81297, striatal GAD65 mRNA levels were significantly increased at 3 but not 72 h. In contrast, striatal GAD67 mRNA levels were increased and nigral alpha1 mRNA levels were decreased at 72 but not 3 h. Single cell analysis on double-labeled sections indicated that increased GAD or vGAT mRNA levels after acute SKF-81297 occurred in striatonigral neurons identified by their lack of preproenkephalin expression. Subchronic SKF-81297 induced significant increases in striatal GAD67, GAD65, preprodynorphin and vGAT mRNA levels and decreases in nigral alpha1 mRNA levels. In the striatum contralateral to the 6-OHDA lesion, subchronic but not acute SKF-81297 induced a significant increase in GAD65 mRNA levels. The other mRNA levels were not significantly altered. Finally, striatal GAD67 mRNA levels were negatively correlated with nigral alpha1 mRNA levels in the dopamine-depleted but not dopamine-intact side. The results suggest that different signaling pathways are involved in the modulation by dopamine D1/D5 receptors of GAD65 and GAD67 mRNA levels in striatonigral neurons. They also suggest that the down-regulation of nigral GABA(A) receptors is linked to the increase in striatal GAD67 mRNA levels in the dopamine-depleted striatum."

However, in teleosts with testis of semi-cystic type and asynchronous spermatogenesis, as the flatfish Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis), the physiological roles of FSH and LH are still not well understood. To gain insight into this mechanism, full-length complementary DNAs (cDNAs) encoding Senegalese sole FSH beta and LH beta subunits, and the common glycoprotein alpha subunit (CG alpha), were cloned and sequenced. The three cDNAs consisted of 550, 582 and 744 nucleotides encoding peptides of 120, 148 and 132 amino acids, respectively. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of sole FSH beta, LH beta and CG alpha with those from other teleosts indicated that cysteine residues and potential N-linked glycosylation sites were fully conserved with respect to other percomorphs and salmonids. However, the primary structure of FSH beta and LH beta in pleuronectiforms appeared to be highly divergent. In situ hybridization of mature male pituitaries showed that fshb, lhb and cga mRNAs were localized in the proximal pars distalis and in the periphery of pars intermedia. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction indicated that the levels of all three transcripts in the pituitary of males increased during winter and spring, at the time when plasma levels of androgens raised and testicular germ cell development and spermatozoa production were stimulated. These results suggest that FSH and LH may regulate spermatogenesis in Senegalese sole similarly to that described for other teleosts with testis of cystic type and synchronous germ cell development."

In the present study, we determined the cDNA sequences of pigeon VGLUT2 and GluR1 and mapped the distribution of their mRNA in the pigeon CNS. The predicted amino acids of pigeon VGLUT2 and GluR1 showed a 93% identity to human VGLUT2 and GluR1 both. In situ hybridization autoradiograms showed VGLUT2 mRNA expression exclusively in the pallium of the telencephalon, and no expression in the subpallium. Within the diencephalon, VGLUT2 mRNA was more abundant in the thalamus than in the hypothalamus. Rich VGLUT2 mRNA expression was found in the optic tectum, nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis, pars dorsalis, nucleus isthmi, pars parvocellularis, isthmo-optic nucleus, pontine nuclei, and granular layer of the cerebellum.

Signaling molecules including SHH, FGF, WNT, BMP and Notch are involved in regulating primordial pituitary proliferation and lineage determination. However, morphogenic events and molecular mechanisms governing anterior and intermediate lobe specification are not clear. Pituitary expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the common precursor for adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) of pars distalis corticotropes and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) of pars intermedia melanotropes, provides a unique marker for anterior and intermediate lobe morphogenesis. We performed time-lapse confocal microscopy lineage tracing in live zebrafish embryos expressing GFP driven by the pomc promoter and show distinct migration pathways of POMC cells destined to the anterior and intermediate lobes. Using morpholino oligonucleotides, we show that hypomorphic FGF3 down-regulation induces specific defects of pars intermedia POMC cells while pomc, growth hormone and prolactin expression remain intact in the pars distalis. This lineage-specific process is independent of the FGF3 effect on early pituitary specifying transcription factors as indicated by normal Lim3 and Pit1 expression in hypomorphic FGF3 morphants. These findings suggest that the FGF3 signal, in addition to its previously described role of regulating progenitor proliferation and survival, delineates the melanotrope and corticotrope lineage boundary, contributing to establishment of the pituitary pars distalis and pars intermedia."

Consistent with this role, the release of PRL from the pituitary of the Mozambique tilapia is stimulated as extracellular osmolality is reduced. Stretch-activated calcium-permeant ion channels appear to be responsible for the initiation of the signal transduction that leads to increased PRL release when PRL cells are exposed to reductions in extracellular osmolality. In this study, we examined a possible involvement of the aquaporin-3 (AQP3) water channel in this osmoreceptive mechanism in PRL cells of the tilapia. AQP3 expression levels in the rostral pars distalis of the pituitary, consisting predominantly of PRL cells, were higher in fish adapted to FW than in seawater (SW)-adapted fish. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that AQP3 is located in the cell membrane and perinuclear region of PRL cells, with more intense immunosignals in PRL cells of FW-adapted fish than in those of SW fish. In FW PRL cells, the magnitude of hyposmoticity-induced cell volume increase was greater than that seen in SW PRL cells. Mercury, a potent inhibitor of AQP3, inhibited hyposmoticity-induced cell volume increase and PRL release from FW PRL cells. The inhibitory effect of mercury was partially restored by beta-mercaptoethanol, whereas no effect of mercury was observed on PRL release stimulated by a depolarizing concentration of KCl, which induces Ca2+ influx and stimulates the subsequent Ca2+-signaling pathway. These results indicate significant contribution of AQP3 to osmoreception in PRL cells in FW-adapted tilapia."

Two groups of urea transporters (UT-A and UT-B) have been identified in mammals, and both are involved in intrarenal recycling of urea. The aim of our study was to examine the renal urea handling in rats with chronic renal failure (CRF).METHODS: CRF rats were induced by 5/6 nephrectomy followed by a high-protein (HP) diet to increase the progressive loss of renal function for 5 months. Functional studies on water and urea handling were performed. RT-PCR, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were used to identify UT-A proteins in remnant kidney.RESULTS: A significant decrease in creatinine clearance consistent with development of CRF was observed. The remnant kidneys were hypertrophied, and total renal mass was increased. Urine production increased markedly, whereas urine osmolality and solute-free water reabsorption decreased significantly. Fractional urea excretion was increased reaching values of 105% -/+ 8%. UT-A protein was localized in pars recta by immunohistochemical studies, and it was identified as UT-A2 in outer medulla from remnant kidneys by RT-PCR and immunoblotting.CONCLUSION: In uremic rats, an urea transporter type UT-A2 was expressed in the pars recta, suggesting a possible relation with the fractional urea excretion increase. This expression may be a consequence of an adaptive mechanism in the handling of urea during development of CRF. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the contribution of this mechanism to renal damage observed in the progression of CRF."

Therefore, opioids can modulate the immune response. We cloned and sequenced all three classical opioid receptors (MOR, DOR and KOR) in common carp, and studied changes in their expression during stress and immune responses. Messenger RNA of opioid receptors was constitutively expressed in brain areas, specially in the preoptic nucleus NPO (homologous to mammalian hypothalamus). After exposure to prolonged restraint stress, mRNA levels of MOR and DOR decreased in the NPO and in the head kidney. Increased expression of all studied opioid receptors was observed in the pituitary pars distalis (containing ACTH-producing cells). In immune organs, constitutive but lower expression of opioid receptor genes was observed. During in vivo zymosan-induced peritonitis or after in vitro LPS-induced stimulation, when pro-inflammatory functions are activated, expression of the OR genes in leukocytes was concomitantly up-regulated. Additionally, specific agonists of opioid receptors especially reduced leukocyte migratory properties, manifested by reduced chemotaxis and down-regulated expression of chemokine receptors. Our data indicate an evolutionary conserved role for the opioid system in maintaining a dynamic equilibrium while coping with stress and/or infection."

However, the nature and behavior of anterior pituitary progenitor cells remain unclear. We established bovine anterior pituitary progenitor cell line (BAPC)-1 from the anterior pituitary gland, which expressed stem/progenitor cell-related genes and several inflammatory cytokines. To characterize and localize these pituitary progenitor cells, we produced a mAb (12B mAb) against BAPC-1. The 12B mAb recognized the 4Ig-B7-H3 molecule, which is a costimulatory molecule and negative regulator in T cell activation. WC1(+) gammadelta T cells in young bovine PBMC express the 4Ig-B7-H3 molecule, but few or no 4Ig-B7-H3-immunoreactive cells are expressed in PBMC in adult cattle. The 12B-immunoreactive cells in the bovine anterior pituitary gland were localized around Rathke's pouch and expressed IL-18 and MHC class II. However, the number of 12B-immunoreactive cells was lower in adult than in young cattle. BAPC-1 expressed IL-18 and MHC class II, and demonstrated phagocytotic activity. BAPC-1 also had the ability to promote CD25 expression in PBMC after 5 days of coculture, and blocking 4Ig-B7-H3 x 12B mAb enhanced their expression of CD25. In addition, the 12B-immunoreactive cells were observed around the pars tuberalis closely bordering the median eminence and in the blood vessels of the primary portal plexus in the anterior pituitary gland. These results suggest that an established BAPC-1 may originate from these progenitor cells, and that the progenitor cells with 4Ig-B7-H3 may play a critical role in the immunoendocrine network."

In the age-dependent study, male Wistar rats were treated with a single injection of HCBD (100mg/kg b.w. i.p.) or chromate (25 mg/kg b.w. s.c.) at 5 weeks or 12 weeks of age; in dose-response study, rats were treated with a single injection of three doses of HCBD (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg b.w. i.p.) or chromate (8, 12.5, and 25mg/kg b.w. s.c.) at 8 weeks of age. Forty-eight hours after treatment, Rgn and glutamine synthetase (GS) activity in kidney cortex, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and plasma creatinine were measured; light microscopy was performed also. The results show that young rats are less susceptible to chromate (severe necrosis is evident only in adult rats), whereas age does not influence HCBD nephrotoxicity. Rgn is down regulated by HCBD at both age points, but not by chromate at 5 weeks of age. In addition, HCBD causes down-regulation of Rgn from the low dose in 8-week-old rats, whereas chromate causes the same effect at the high dose only. GS activity in kidney cortex shows a similar behavior, even if sensitive to low doses of chromate also, whereas BUN and creatinine increase after the high dose of both chemicals only. Accordingly, light microscopy shows a segment-specific, dose-dependent increase of severity of damage caused by the chemicals. Rgn gene expression appears a sensitive genomic marker to evaluate the renal impairment caused by chemicals and its down-regulation seems to be related to damage, early or already established, to S(3) segment of the proximal tubule."

Humans may become more susceptible to mood disorders, e.g. depression. In livestock species, such as pigs, early weaning is a form of maternal deprivation. We investigated behavioural consequences in 99 female pigs weaned at three different ages (12, 21 and 42 days; d12, d21, d42). Pigs were habituated to an open field arena over 6 days before being given 5-min open-field tests over three subsequent days (days 77-79). Early-weaned pigs (d12) showed behavioural inhibition (reduced vocalisations and lower activity) compared with later-weaned pigs, although in all groups these measures declined over the three tests, so this treatment difference might reflect more rapid habituation to the test in d12 pigs. Long-term effects on mood-related 5-HT receptor subtypes were measured in the brain at 90 days in a random sample of the d12 (n=8) and d42 pigs (n=8), using (3)H-ligand-binding and autoradiography and in situ hybridisation histochemistry. There were no differences between weaning ages in binding of (3)H-8-OH-DPAT (5-HT(1A) receptor agonist) or of (3)H-ketanserin (5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist) to any brain region studied. In d12 pigs, 5-HT(1A) receptor mRNA expression per unit area was 29%, 63%, 52% and 64% lower than in d42 pigs in the parvocellular PVN, amygdala and hippocampal dentate gyrus and pyramidal cell layer, respectively. The ratio of expression per cell to expressing cells per unit area was also lower, by 31%, in the pars horizontalis of the PVN in d12 pigs. Conversely, 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA was expressed at a 25% and 28% higher density per unit area in the amygdala and pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, respectively, in these d12 pigs. In individual pigs, across brain regions, 5-HT(1A) receptor mRNA data were 70-79% correlated with binding data but no correlation was found for 5-HT(2A) data, suggesting different regulatory mechanisms. The behavioural and neurobiological responses to early weaning might represent either dysfunction or adaptation. Further investigation is required."

The pathologic events contributing to development of neurodegeneration or clinical signs in equids with PPID are unknown. Chronic inflammation may contribute to initiation or progression of PPID.HYPOTHESIS: Horses with PPID have a distinct systemic cytokine profile compared with that of normal adult or aged horses. The cytokine profile of healthy aged horses differs from that of adult horses.ANIMALS: Aged horses with PPID, healthy aged-matched controls, and adult controls (n = 14 per group).METHODS: Total leukocyte cytokine expression was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plasma concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) TNF-alpha response after endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) treatment was assessed by ELISA.RESULTS: Aged healthy horses had increased expression of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and interferon-gamma as well as PBMC TNF-alpha release after LPS stimulation compared with healthy adult horses. In contrast, aged horses with PPID had increased IL-8 expression, but expression of other cytokines was similar to that of healthy adult horses, not age-matched controls.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Aged horses show evidence of a proinflammatory state that may contribute to development of age-associated diseases. Horses with PPID have increased expression of IL-8, which may influence the ability of horses with PPID to respond to bacterial pathogens. The general decrease in proinflammatory cytokine expression observed in horses with PPID may be the outcome of high plasma concentrations of anti-inflammatory hormones."

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism by which hypothalamic neurons reach the pars intermedia (PI) by correlating the development of dopaminergic (DA) neurons arising in the periventricular nucleus (PeV) of fetal rats with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the rat pituitary. The differentiation of DA neurons was observed by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), whereas the ontogenesis of BDNF mRNA in the PI was examined by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. Immunoreactive TH-neurons were first observed in the PeV at embryonic day (E) 16.5, following which time their axons elongated toward the pituitary. TH-positive reactions were observed in the connective tissue between the PI and the pars nervosa at E20.5. Innervation of the PI by TH-positive neurons was determined at postnatal day (P) 1.5; however, BDNF mRNA was first detected in the PI cells at E17.5, with an increase in its expression clearly visible at E21.5 and continuing high expression levels in the PI thereafter. These results suggest that BDNF is a specific guidance cue for DA neurons elongating from the PeV to the PI."

To investigate and compare the effects mediated by PARs in the human gallbladder with those in the guinea-pig gallbladder, we measured contractions of isolated human and guinea-pig gallbladder strips caused by PAR agonists. Results in human were similar to those in guinea-pig gallbladder. The PAR(1) agonists, thrombin, TFLLR-NH2 and SFLLRN-NH2, as well as the PAR(2) agonists, trypsin, SLIGKV-NH2 and SLIGRL-NH2, caused contraction in both human and guinea-pig gallbladders. These indicate the existence of PAR(1) and PAR(2) mediating gallbladder contraction. Furthermore, the existence of PAR(1) and PAR(2) in the human gallbladder was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

The contractile responses to TFLLR-NH2, SFLLRN-NH2 and trypsin in both human and guinea-pig gallbladders were insensitive to atropine and tetrodotoxin, suggesting direct effects. These results demonstrate that, similar to the guinea-pig gallbladder, both PAR(1) and PAR(2) but not PAR(4) mediate muscle contraction in the human gallbladder.

However, the mechanisms regulating gonadotrophin synthesis and release in this species remain unclear. Here, we investigated the expression of gonadotrophin subunits and GnRH receptor (GnRH-R) mRNA in the pituitary glands of Thoroughbred horses during the breeding (BS) and non-breeding (NBS) season. Seasonal effects on the prevalence of gonadotrophs in the pars distalis were also examined. GnRH-R and common alpha-, LHbeta- and FSHbeta-subunit mRNA contents were determined by Northern analysis and the prevalence of LH-gonadotrophs assessed by immunohistochemistry in pituitaries from sexually active females (mares) in the BS, and sexually inactive mares in the NBS. These variables were then measured in castrated male horses (geldings). In mares, pituitary content of FSHbeta mRNA was significantly higher in the NBS (P&lt;0.01). Conversely, the content of common alpha-subunit mRNA was significantly higher during the BS (P&lt;0.05). In contrast, GnRH-R and LHbeta mRNA abundance were unaffected by season. Interestingly, whereas no seasonal effects were apparent on the number of LH-gonadotrophs/field, the proportion of LH cells (in relation to all other cells) was higher in BS than NBS animals (P&lt;0.05); this resulted from an increased number of non-gonadotroph cells during the NBS (P&lt;0.05). In geldings, no significant seasonal effects were detected for any of the variables investigated (P&gt;0.05). These results reveal robust seasonal effects on common alpha-subunit and FSHbeta gene expression in the pituitary of the mare, in the absence of detectable changes in the content of LHbeta or GnRH-R mRNA."

Immunohistochemistry of NPY and specific hormones using mirror sections revealed that NPY was colocalized in GH immunoreactive cells. Over 90% of somatotrophs corresponded to NPY-ir cells.

Evidence for PACAP induction of somatolactin-alpha and -beta gene expression via activation of pituitary PAC-I receptors.";"Somatolactin (SL), the latest member of the growth hormone/prolactin family, is a novel pituitary hormone with diverse functions. At present, SL can be identified only in fish but not in tetrapods and its regulation at the pituitary level has not been fully characterized. Using grass carp as a model, we examined the direct effects of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) on SL secretion and synthesis at the pituitary cell level. As a first step, the structural identity of grass carp SL, SLalpha and SLbeta, was established by 5'/3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. These two SL isoforms are single-copy genes and are expressed in two separate populations of pituitary cells located in the pars intermedia. In the carp pituitary, PACAP nerve fibers were detected in the nerve tracts of the neurohypophysis and extended into the vicinity of pituitary cells forming the pars intermedia. In primary cultures of grass carp pituitary cells, PACAP was effective in stimulating SL release, cellular SL content, and total SL production. The increase in SL production also occurred with parallel rises in SLalpha and SLbeta mRNA levels. With the use of a combination of molecular and pharmacological approaches, PACAP-induced SL release and SL gene expression were shown to be mediated by pituitary PAC-I receptors. These findings, as a whole, suggest that PACAP may serve as a hypophysiotropic factor in fish stimulating SL secretion and synthesis at the pituitary level. Apparently, PACAP-induced SL production is mediated by upregulation of SLalpha and SLbeta gene expression through activation of PAC-I receptors."

DLB cases were classified as pure form or common form according to the absence or the presence of Alzheimer pathology including neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposits by Braak staging. Using Western Blot and Real-time Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, we have shown that cortical COX-2 protein levels were decreased in DLB cases (P &lt; 0.01). However, no differences in nigral COX-2 mRNA expression were observed between control and DLB cases.

In addition, ethanol-induced alterations in opioidergic nigrostriatal transmission could be involved in brain sensitivity to ethanol and play a role in addictive processes. The aim of this work was to study the effects of acute ethanol administration on proenkephalin (proenk) mRNA expression in the rat substantia nigra and caudate-putamen (CP) for up to 24 h post treatment. Male Wistar rats received ethanol (2.5 g/kg) or distilled water by intragastric administration, and proenk mRNA expression was studied by in situ hybridization and densitometry. Ethanol transiently increased proenk mRNA expression in the CP 1 h after drug administration. Proenk mRNA levels remained elevated 2 h post treatment in the anterior-medial and medial-posterior regions of the CP. In contrast, ethanol decreased proenk mRNA expression in the substantia nigra pars compacta and pars reticulata 2 h after drug exposure. Alterations in enkephalin expression in the substantia nigra and CP in response to ethanol exposure could be involved in the mechanisms underlying brain sensitivity to the drug."

We assessed for enrichment of functional categories with a hypergeometric distribution. The data were validated with QPCR. We observed that gender has a pervasive effect on gene expression in DA neurons. Genes upregulated in females relative to males are mainly involved in signal transduction and neuronal maturation, while in males some of the upregulated genes (alpha-synuclein and PINK1) were previously implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. In females with PD we found alterations in genes with protein kinase activity, genes involved in proteolysis and WNT signaling pathway, while in males with PD there were alterations in protein-binding proteins and copper-binding proteins. Our data reveal broad gender-based differences in gene expression in human dopaminergic neurons of SNc that may underlie the predisposition of males to PD. Moreover, we show that gender influences the response to PD, suggesting that the nature of the disease and the response to treatment may be gender-dependent."

DJ-1 loss-of-function mutations are involved in inherited early-onset PD forms and result in dysfunction of the oxidative stress response. In mice models, DJ-1 loss provokes sensitivity to oxidative insults but does not produce neurodegeneration. Similar results have been found when analyzing Drosophila mutants for the DJ-1 orthologous genes, DJ-1alpha and DJ-1beta. Here, we report the analysis of two new mutations for the Drosophila DJ-1 genes. Both ubiquitous induction of DJ-1alpha knockdown by RNAi and loss of function of DJ-1beta caused by an insertional mutation result in increased sensitivity to paraquat insults, reduced lifespan and motor impairments. However these mutations do not lead to DA neuron loss. Besides, we find that targeted inhibition of DJ-1alpha function in DA neuron results in certain DA neurodegeneration. Our results, together with findings in other Drosophila DJ-1 mutants, indicate that both Drosophila DJ-1 genes are implicated in the protection against the chemical induced oxidative stress response, but also in fly survival. The differences observed in DA neurodegeneration suggest that the motor impairments exhibited by the mutants could be caused by different pathways."

We have identified a Bak-dependent cell death mechanism that is required for PQ-induced neurotoxicity. PQ induced morphological and biochemical features that were consistent with apoptosis, including dose-dependent cytochrome c release, with subsequent caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Changes in nuclear morphology and loss of viability were blocked by cycloheximide, caspase inhibitor, and Bcl-2 overexpression. Evaluation of Bcl-2 family members showed that PQ induced high levels of Bak, Bid, BNip3, and Noxa. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of BNip3, Noxa, and Bak each protected cells from PQ, but Bax knockdown did not.

In sepsis, TF is up-regulated as part of the proinflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes leading to systemic coagulation activation. Here we demonstrate that TF cytoplasmic domain-deleted (TF(Delta CT)) mice show enhanced and prolonged systemic coagulation activation relative to wild-type upon LPS challenge. However, TF(Delta CT) mice resolve inflammation earlier and are protected from lethality independent of changes in coagulation. Macrophages from LPS-challenged TF(Delta CT) mice or LPS-stimulated, in vitro-differentiated bone marrow-derived macrophages show increased TF mRNA and functional activity relative to wild-type, identifying up-regulation of macrophage TF expression as a possible cause for the increase in coagulation of TF(Delta CT) mice. Increased TF expression of TF(Delta CT) macrophages does not require PAR2 and is specific for toll-like receptor, but not interferon gamma receptor, signaling. The presence of the TF cytoplasmic domain suppresses ERK1/2 phosphorylation that is reversed by p38 inhibition leading to enhanced TF expression specifically in wild-type but not TF(Delta CT) mice. The present study demonstrates a new role of the TF cytoplasmic domain in an autoregulatory pathway that controls LPS-induced TF expression in macrophages and procoagulant responses in endotoxemia."

Human beta-defensins (hBDs) and the macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha/CC chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) produced by epithelial cells are antimicrobial peptides that provide cytokine function and play an important role in innate immunity. The aim of the present study was to determine whether specific members of the PAR family mediate the expression of these innate immunity markers in gingival epithelial cells (GECs) when exposed to P. gingivalis cell-free culture supernatant or purified RgpB. hBD-2 mRNA in GECs was induced in response to supernatant and purified RgpB from P. gingivalis (P = 0.02 and P = 0.016, respectively). This effect was abrogated by the protease inhibitor tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) (P &lt; 0.05). In response to P. gingivalis supernatant and to purified RgpB, the hBD-2 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in PAR-2 gene knockdown cells, whereas no change was detected in PAR-1 gene knockdown cells.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether (1S,3R,4S)-1-aminocyclo-pentane-1,3,4-tricarboxylic acid (ACPT-1), an agonist of group III mGluRs, injected bilaterally into the globus pallidus (GP), striatum or substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), can attenuate the haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats, and whether that effect was related to modulation of proenkephalin (PENK) or prodynorphin (PDYN) mRNA expression in the striatum. Administration of ACPT-1 (0.05-1.6 microg/0.5 microl/side) caused a dose-and-structure-dependent decrease in the haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg i.p. or 1.5 mg/kg s.c.)-induced catalepsy whose order was as follows: GP&gt;striatum&gt;SNr. ACPT-1, given alone to any of those structures, induced no catalepsy in rats. Haloperidol (3 x 1.5 mg/kg s.c.) significantly increased PENK mRNA expression in the striatum, while PDYN mRNA levels were not affected by that treatment. ACPT-1 (3 x 1.6 microg/0.5 microl/side) injected into the striatum significantly attenuated the haloperidol-increased PENK mRNA expression, whereas administration of that compound into the GP or SNr did not influence the haloperidol-increased striatal PENK mRNA levels. Our results demonstrate that stimulation of group III mGluRs in the striatum, GP or SNr exerts antiparkinsonian-like effects in rats. The anticataleptic effect of intrastriatally injected ACPT-1 seems to correlate with diminished striatal PENK mRNA expression. However, since the anticataleptic effect produced by intrapallidal and intranigral injection of ACPT-1 is not related to a simultaneous decrease in striatal PENK mRNA levels, it is likely that a decrease in enkephalin biosynthesis is not a necessary condition to obtain an antiparkinsonian effect."

Most primary systemic infections are associated with R5-type HIV-1 targeting the R5-specific coreceptor CCR5, which is not usually expressed on oral keratinocytes. Because coinfection with other microbes has been suggested to modulate cellular infection by HIV-1, we hypothesized that oral keratinocytes may up-regulate CCR5 in response to the oral endogenous pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis by cysteine-protease (gingipains) activation of the protease-activated receptors (PARs) or LPS signaling through the TLRs. The OKF6/TERT-2-immortalized normal human oral keratinocyte line expressed CXCR4, whereas CCR5 was not detectable. When exposed to P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, TERT-2 cells induced greater time-dependent expression of CCR5-specific mRNA and surface coreceptors than CXCR4. By comparing arg- (Rgp) and lys-gingipain (Kgp) mutants, a mutant deficient in both proteases, and the action of trypsin, P. gingivalis Rgp was strongly suggested to cleave PAR-1 and PAR-2 to up-regulate CCR5. CCR5 was also slightly up-regulated by an isogenic gingipain-deficient mutant, suggesting the presence of a nongingipain-mediated mechanism. Purified P. gingivalis LPS also up-regulated CCR5. Blocking TLR2 and TLR4 receptors with Abs attenuated induction of CCR5, suggesting LPS signaling through TLRs. P. gingivalis, therefore, selectively up-regulated CCR5 by two independent signaling pathways, Rgp acting on PAR-1 and PAR-2, and LPS on TLR2 and TLR4. By inducing CCR5 expression, P. gingivalis coinfection could promote selective R5-type HIV-1 infection of oral keratinocytes."

However, studies using the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD have also identified inflammatory responses in the nigrostriatal pathway that precede neuronal degeneration in the SNpc. To assess the pathological relevance of these inflammatory responses and to identify candidate genes that might contribute to neuronal vulnerability, we used quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to measure mRNA levels of 11 cytokine and chemokine encoding genes in the striatum of MPTP-sensitive (C57BL/6J) and MPTP-insensitive (Swiss Webster, SWR) mice following administration of MPTP. The mRNA levels of all 11 genes changed following MPTP treatment, indicating the presence of inflammatory responses in both strains. Furthermore, of the 11 genes examined only 3, interleukin 6 (Il-6), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha/CC chemokine ligand 3 (Mip-1alpha/Ccl3) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta/CC chemokine ligand 4 (Mip-1beta/Ccl4), were differentially regulated between C57BL/6J and SWR mice. In both mouse strains, the level of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1/CC chemokine ligand 2 (Mcp-1/Ccl2) mRNA was the first to increase following MPTP administration, and might represent a key initiating component of the inflammatory response. Using Mcp-1/Ccl2 knockout mice backcrossed onto a C57BL/6J background we found that MPTP-stimulated Mip-1alpha/Ccl3 and Mip-1beta/Ccl4 mRNA expression was significantly lower in the knockout mice; suggesting that Mcp-1/Ccl2 contributes to MPTP-enhanced expression of Mip-1alpha/Ccl3 and Mip-1beta/Ccl4. However, stereological analysis of SNpc neuronal loss in Mcp-1/Ccl2 knockout and wild-type mice showed no differences. These findings suggest that it is the ability of dopaminergic SNpc neurons to survive an inflammatory insult, rather than genetically determined differences in the inflammatory response itself, that underlie the molecular basis of MPTP resistance."

However, it is not known whether the thrombin profibrogenic effect is due to effects on blood coagulation or to signaling via protease-activated receptors (PARs). We took advantage of the lack of blood coagulation defects in PAR-1-knockout mice. Acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) toxicity was similar in wild-type (WT), PAR-1(-/-), and PAR-1(+/-) mice as judged by aminotransferase levels, area of liver necrosis, and liver peroxidation measured by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy. Fifteen mice/group received CCl(4) or its solvent for 6 wk (300 microl/kg, 3 times a week). Fibrosis area was increased 10-fold by CCl(4) treatment in WT mice. PAR-1 deficiency protected against fibrosis, with 36% and 56% decrease in PAR-1(+/-) and PAR-1(-/-) mice, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Similar results were obtained for area of activated fibrogenic cells (64% and 79% decrease in PAR-1(+/-) and PAR-1(-/-) mice, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). These findings were corroborated by measurements of type I collagen, matrix metalloproteinase-2, and PDGF-beta receptor mRNA levels. There was also a significant decrease in T lymphocyte infiltration in PAR-1-deficient mice. Altogether, these results suggest that thrombin profibrogenic effects are independent of effects on blood coagulation and are instead due to direct effects on fibrogenic cells and possibly on T lymphocytes."

Their role in LNCaP prostate cancer cell migration and Rac1/Cdc42 signaling was assessed with Boyden chamber analysis and Western blot, respectively.RESULTS: PAR mRNA expression was higher in cancer, and protein expression was increased in PAR-1 (45%), PAR-2 (42%), and PAR-4 (68%), compared to normal glands. Increased PAR-1 (periglandular stroma) was associated with higher rates of biochemical recurrence (median follow-up, 5 years; P = 0.006). LNCaP migration was enhanced twofold and Rac1/Cdc42 signaling was activated by stimulation of PAR-1 and PAR-2.CONCLUSIONS: PARs are overexpressed in prostate cancer and may serve as potential predictors of recurrence. The data suggest potential role of PARs in autocrine and paracrine mechanisms of prostate cancer."

We examined the effects of genetic deletion and pharmacologic blockade of PAR1 in the mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by nigrostriatal dopamine damage and gliosis. After MPTP injection, PAR1-/- mice showed significantly higher residual levels of dopamine, dopamine transporter, and tyrosine hydroxylase and diminished microgliosis compared with wild-type mice. Comparable levels of dopaminergic neuroprotection from MPTP-induced toxicity were obtained by infusion of the PAR1 antagonist, BMS-200261 into the right lateral cerebral ventricle. MPTP administration caused changes in the brain protease system, including increased levels of mRNA for two PAR1 activators, matrix metalloprotease-1 and Factor Xa, suggesting a mechanism by which MPTP administration could lead to overactivation of PAR1. We also report that PAR1 is expressed in human substantia nigra pars compacta glia as well as tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons. Together, these data suggest that PAR1 might be a target for therapeutic intervention in Parkinson's disease."

However, the influence of proteases and protease-activated receptors (PARs) on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) release from airway epithelial cells remains largely unknown. In the present study, A549 cells were challenged with agonists of PARs, and levels of MCP-1 released in the supernatant and mRNA expression were examined by ELISA and real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. The results show that thrombin, tryptase, elastase and trypsin induced an up to 6.5-, 1.8-, 1.6-, and 3.1-fold increase in MCP-1 release from A549 cells, respectively, following a 16-h incubation period. The protease-induced secretion of MCP-1 can be abolished by specific protease inhibitors. Agonist peptides of PAR-1 and PAR-2 stimulate MCP-1 secretion up to 15- and 12.7-fold, respectively. Real-time PCR showed that MCP-1 mRNA is up-regulated by the serine proteases tested and by agonist peptides of PAR-1 and PAR-2. In conclusion, serine proteases can stimulate MCP-1 release from A549 cells possibly through a PARs-related mechanism, suggesting that they are likely to contribute to MCP-1-related airway inflammatory disorders in man."

However, little is known of the effect of IL-12 on protease-induced cytokine release from mast cells. In the present study, we examined potential influence of IL-12 on mast cell PAR expression and IL-4 and IL-6 release. The results showed that IL-12 downregulated the expression of PAR-2 and upregulated expression of PAR-4 on P815 cells. It also downregulated expression of PAR-2 mRNA, and upregulated expression of PAR-1, PAR-3 and PAR-4 mRNAs. However, IL-12 enhanced trypsin- and tryptase-induced PAR-2 and PAR-2 mRNA expression. It was observed that IL-12 induced release of IL-4, but reduced trypsin- and tryptase-stimulated IL-4 secretion from P815 cells. PD98059, U0126 and LY294002 not only abolished IL-12-induced IL-4 release but also inhibited IL-12-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt.

Niacinamide inhibits PARS or PARP. The present experiment tests the effects of niacinamide (NCA) on organ dysfunction and acute lung injury (ALI) following lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS was administered to anesthetized rats and to isolated rat lungs. In anesthetized rats, LPS caused systemic hypotension and increased biochemical factors, nitrate/nitrite (NOx), methyl guanidine (MG), tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFalpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). In isolated lungs, LPS increased lung weight (LW) to body weight ratio, LW gain, protein and dye tracer leakage, and capillary permeability. The insult also increased NOx, MG, TNFalpha, and IL-1beta in lung perfusate, while decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content with an increase in PARP activity in lung tissue. Pathological examination revealed pulmonary edema with inflammatory cell infiltration. These changes were abrogated by posttreatment (30 min after LPS) with NCA. Following LPS, the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression was increased. NCA reduced the iNOS expression. Niacinamide exerts protective effects on the organ dysfunction and ALI caused by endotoxin. The mechanisms may be mediated through the inhibition on the PARP activity, iNOS expression and the subsequent suppression of NO, free radicals, and proinflammatory cytokines with restoration of ATP."

Ocular samples included aqueous humor collected before the first intravitreal injection of antibiotics and vitreous samples collected at the time of the therapeutic pars plana vitrectomy.RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 32% of cases and PCR in 61% of cases with aqueous humor samples.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in altered GABA neurotransmission remain poorly understood. In order to be released from synaptic vesicles, newly synthesized GABA is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by a vesicular GABA transporter. The objective of this study was to examine the hypothesis that expression of the vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) is altered in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease. Our results provide evidence that a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion results in increased and decreased vGAT mRNA levels in striatopallidal and striatonigral neurons, respectively. These two subsets of neurons were identified by the co-expression or lack of co-expression of preproenkephalin, a marker of striatopallidal neurons, using double-labeling in situ hybridization histochemistry. Such changes occurred in the striatum ipsilateral to the 6-hydroxydopamine lesion and were paralleled by decreased vGAT protein levels in the substantia nigra, pars reticulate (SNr). On the other hand, the subchronic systemic administration of L-DOPA increased vGAT mRNA levels in preproenkephalin-negative neurons on the side ipsilateral and, to a lesser extent, the side contralateral to the 6-hydroxydopamine lesion. Systemic L-DOPA also increased vGAT protein levels in the ipsi- and contralateral SNr. As a whole, the results provide original evidence that vGAT expression is altered in the 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease. They also suggest that the behavioral effects induced by a subchronic administration of L-DOPA to 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats involve an increase in the vesicular release of GABA by striatonigral neurons."

PARs are activated by a serine-dependent cleavage generating a tethered activating ligand. PAR-2 was shown to be involved in inflammatory pathways. We investigated the in situ levels and modulation of PAR-2 in human normal and osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage/chondrocytes. Furthermore, we evaluated the role of PAR-2 on the synthesis of the major catabolic factors in OA cartilage, including metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-13 and the inflammatory mediator cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), as well as the PAR-2-activated signalling pathways in OA chondrocytes. PAR-2 expression was determined using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein levels by immunohistochemistry in normal and OA cartilage. Protein modulation was investigated in OA cartilage explants treated with a specific PAR-2-activating peptide (PAR-2-AP), SLIGKV-NH2 (1 to 400 microM), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) (100 pg/mL), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (5 ng/mL), transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-beta1) (10 ng/mL), or the signalling pathway inhibitors of p38 (SB202190), MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) (PD98059), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) (SN50), and PAR-2 levels were determined by immunohistochemistry. Signalling pathways were analyzed on OA chondrocytes by Western blot using specific phospho-antibodies against extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), p38, JNK (c-jun N-terminal kinase), and NF-kappaB in the presence or absence of the PAR-2-AP and/or IL-1beta. PAR-2-induced MMP and COX-2 levels in cartilage were determined by immunohistochemistry. PAR-2 is produced by human chondrocytes and is significantly upregulated in OA compared with normal chondrocytes (p &lt; 0.04 and p &lt; 0.03, respectively). The receptor levels were significantly upregulated by IL-1beta (p &lt; 0.006) and TNF-alpha (p &lt; 0.002) as well as by the PAR-2-AP at 10, 100, and 400 microM (p &lt; 0.02) and were downregulated by the inhibition of p38. After 48 hours of incubation, PAR-2 activation significantly induced MMP-1 and COX-2 starting at 10 microM (both p &lt; 0.005) and MMP-13 at 100 microM (p &lt; 0.02) as well as the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and p38 within 5 minutes of incubation (p &lt; 0.03). Though not statistically significant, IL-1beta produced an additional effect on the activation of Erk1/2 and p38. This study documents, for the first time, functional consequences of PAR-2 activation in human OA cartilage, identifies p38 as the major signalling pathway regulating its synthesis, and demonstrates that specific PAR-2 activation induces Erk1/2 and p38 in OA chondrocytes. These results suggest PAR-2 as a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment of OA."

PARs regulate a broad range of cellular functions and are active in the pathogenesis of disorders characterized by chronic inflammation or activation of the coagulation cascade. Signaling through PAR1 and PAR2 shifts the endothelium towards a prothrombotic phenotype, thereby exacerbating the initial pathophysiologic condition.OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to analyze the localization of PARs in the cell membrane and how their compartmentalization affects tissue factor (TF) in human endothelial cells.METHODS: TF expression was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and by activity assays. The interaction of PARs with caveolin was investigated through: (i) caveolin-1 gene knockdown performed by transfection with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA); (ii) caveolin-enriched membrane microdomain disruption; and (iii) coimmunoprecipitation assay.RESULTS: We have shown that PAR1, but not PAR2, is present in endothelial caveolin-enriched membrane microdomains, where it is bound to caveolin-1, and that these structures must be intact if PAR1-induced signaling is to increase TF activity. Cholesterol depletion of endothelial cells by cholesterol-sequestering agents caused the PAR1 to relocate to high-density membranes, and impaired the induction of TF (P &lt; 0.01) without affecting the PAR2-mediated procoagulant effect. In addition, siRNA directed against caveolin-1 inhibited TF activation by PAR1 (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: PAR1 localization in the caveolin-enriched membrane microdomain, bound to caveolin-1, represents a crucial requirement for TF induction in endothelial cells."

In previous papers we have demonstrated that corticosterone increases FGF-2 immunoreactivity mainly in the astrocytes of the substantia nigra [Chadi, G., Rosen, L., Cintra, A., Tinner, B., Zoli, M., Pettersson, R.F., Fuxe, K., 1993b.

Temporal and spatial increase of astroglial basic fibroblast growth factor synthesis after 6-hydroxydopamine-induced degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Neuroscience 61, 891-910.]. Rats were adrenalectomized and received a 6-OHDA stereotaxical injection in the ventral midbrain 2 days later. Seven days after the dopamine lesion, Western blot analysis showed a decreased level of tyrosine hydroxylase in the lesioned side of the midbrain, an event that was not altered by ADX or corticosterone replacement. Moreover, the degeneration of nigral dopamine neurons, which was confirmed by the disappearance of acidic FGF (FGF-1) mRNA and the decrement of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA labeled nigral neurons, was not altered by ADX. The FGF-2 protein (23 kDa isoform but not 21 kDa fraction) levels increased in the lesioned side of the ventral midbrain. This elevation was counteracted by ADX, an effect that was fully reversed by corticosterone replacement. In situ hybridization revealed that ADX counteracted the elevated FGF-2 mRNA levels in putative glial cells of the ipsilateral pars compacta of the substantia nigra and in the ventral tegmental area. The ADX also counteracted the increased density and intensity of the astroglial FGF-2 immunoreactive profiles within the lesioned pars compacta of the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area as determined by stereology. The stereotaxical mechanical needle insertion triggered the expression of FGFR2 mRNA in putative glial cells, spreading to the entire ipsilateral ventral midbrain from the region of needle track, an occurrence that was partially reversed by ADX. In conclusion, bilateral ADX counteracted the increased astroglial FGF-2 synthesis in the dopamine regions of the ventral midbrain following a 6-OHDA-induced local lesion and interfered with FGF receptor regulation around injury. These findings give further evidence that adrenocortical hormones may regulate the astroglial FGF-2-mediated trophic mechanisms and wound repair events in the lesioned central nervous system."

Although these findings suggest that TSH production in the rat PT is regulated by melatonin and/or the biological clock, there have been no studies focusing on the diurnal change and regulation mechanism of TSH production in the rat PT. Therefore, in the present study, we examined diurnal changes of in TSH beta and alpha-glycoprotein subunit (alpha GSU) mRNA expression and TSH immunoreactivity (-ir) in the rat PT, and also examined the relationship between melatonin and TSH production in vivo. Both TSH beta mRNA expression and alpha GSU mRNA expression in the PT showed diurnal variations: the expression levels were lowest at the light phase [Zeitgeber time (ZT)4] and high at the dark phase (ZT12 and ZT20). TSH-ir in the PT showed the lowest level at ZT4, as was found for mRNA expression. Interestingly, TSH-ir, which was confined to the Golgi apparatus at ZT4, spread to the cytoplasm, and most of the TSH cells in the PT were uniformly immunostained in the cytoplasm at ZT20. Despite the fact that chronic administration of melatonin suppressed TSH beta and alpha GSU mRNA expression, TSH-ir in the PT was significantly enhanced. These findings results clearly show that there are diurnal changes in TSH expression and accumulation in rat PT-TSH cells and suggest that these fluctuations are regulated by melatonin."

The present study identified RFamide peptides, which are teleost prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) homologs, in the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus and characterized their effect on the release of pituitary hormones in vitro. Two RFamide peptides (RFa-A and RFa-B) were isolated from an acid extract of sea lamprey brain, including hypothalamus by Sep-Pak C18 cartridge, affinity chromatography using anti-salmon PrRP serum, and reverse-phase HPLC on an ODS-120T column. Amino acid (aa) sequences and mass spectrometric analyses revealed that RFa-A and RFa-B consist of 25 and 20 aa, respectively, and have 75% sequence identity within the C-terminal 20 aa. The RFa-B cDNA encoding a preprohormone of 142 aa was cloned from the lamprey brain, and the deduced aa sequence from positions 48-67 was identical to the sequence of RFa-B. However, the preprohormone does not include an aa sequence similar to the RFa-A sequence. Cell bodies, which were immunoreactive to anti-salmon PrRP serum, were located in the periventricular arcuate nucleus, ventral part of the hypothalamus, and immunoreactive fibers were abundant from the hypothalamus to the brain. A small number of immunoreactive fibers were detected in the dorsal half of the rostral pars distalis of the pituitary, close to the GH-producing cells. In addition, anti-salmon PrRP immunoreactivities were observed in the pars intermedia, corresponding to melanotropin cells. Likewise, signal of RFa-B mRNA was detected not only in the brain but also in the pars intermedia. The synthetic RFa-A and -B inhibited GH mRNA expression in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro, which is comparable to the inhibitory effect of teleost PrRP on GH release. Both RFa-A and -B also inhibited the expression of proopiomelanotropin mRNA, but no effects were observed in the expression of proopiocortin and gonadotropin beta mRNAs. The results indicate that RFamide peptides, which are teleost PrRP homologs, are present in the hypothalamus and pituitary of sea lamprey, and may be physiologically involved in the inhibition of GH and melanotropin release in the sea lamprey pituitary."

When exposed to light during the photoinducible phase, reproductive neuroendocrine responses occur. However, the neuroendocrine systems involved in avian reproduction are poorly understood. We investigated the effect of light exposure at different circadian times upon the hypothalamus and components of the circadian system, using c-fos mRNA expression, measured by in situ hybridisation, as an indicator of light-induced neuronal activity. Levels of c-fos mRNA in these areas were compared after turkey hens (on a daily 6-h light period) had been exposed to a 30-min period of light occurring at 8, 14, or 20 h after the onset of first light of the day (subjective dawn). Non-photostimulated control birds were harvested at the same times. In birds, photostimulated within the photoinducibile phase (14 h), in contrast to before or after, c-fos mRNA was significantly increased in the nucleus commissurae pallii (nCPa), nucleus premamillaris (PMM), eminentia mediana (ME), and organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT). Photostimulation increased c-fos mRNA expression in the pineal gland, nucleus suprachiasmaticus, pars visualis (vSCN) and nucleus inferioris hypothalami compared to that of their corresponding nonphotostimulated controls. However, the magnitudes of the responses in these areas were similar irrespective of where in the dark period the pulses occurred. No c-fos mRNA was induced in the nucleus infundibulari, in response to the 30-min light period at any of the circadian times tested. The lack of c-fos up-regulation in the pineal gland and vSCN following photostimulation during the photoinducible phase lends credence to the hypothesis that these areas are not involved in the photic initiation of avian reproduction. On the other hand, c-fos mRNA increases in the nCPa, ME, and OVLT support other studies showing that these areas are involved in the onset of reproductive behaviour initiated by long day lengths. The present study provides novel data showing that the PMM in the caudal hypothalamus is involved in the neuronally mediated, light-induced initiation of reproductive activity in the turkey hen."

In this study, we evaluated the effect of ketamine on glutamatergic markers of the postsynaptic density (PSD), a pivotal site for dopamine-glutamate interaction. We assessed gene expression of Homer1a, alpha and betaCaMKII, and dopamine transporter (DAT) by two different doses of ketamine. These genes were chosen because of their impact on signal transduction and dopamine-glutamate interplay in postsynaptic density. Moreover, Homer1a is modulated by antipsychotics and represents a candidate gene for schizophrenia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with saline, 12mg/kg ketamine or 50mg/kg ketamine, and sacrificed 90 minutes after injections. In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to quantitate the rate of gene expression in rat forebrain. Homer1a was induced by 50mg/kg ketamine in ventral striatum and by both 50 and 12mg/kg ketamine in nucleus accumbens, whereas gene expression was not affected in dorsal striatum. alphaCaMKII was increased by 12mg/kg ketamine against saline in almost all subregions assessed. betaCaMKII was not affected by ketamine. DAT was increased by both doses of ketamine in the ventro-tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta. We suggest that these changes may represent molecular adaptations to the perturbation in glutamatergic transmission induced by ketamine blockade of NMDA receptors and may be implicated in molecular alterations occurring in schizophrenia."

Since the number of TH-immunoreactive cells in the SNc decreased to 50% of that in the control after 14 days and since our previous study showed that down-regulation of mRNA levels precedes cell death, genes for which mRNA levels were below 50% of levels in the vehicle-treated control throughout the experimental period were defined as being vulnerable to MPTP in the present study. There were 48 genes that satisfied this condition. In order to elucidate mechanisms of dopaminergic cell death in Parkinson's disease, extensive gene expression studies at various time points after MPTP and with various MPTP doses are required."

Of the telomerase subunits, the reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is the main determinant of enzyme activity. Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)-C and (VEGF)-D, matrix metalloprotease type 1 (MMP-1) and protease-activated receptors (PARs) have all been linked to promotion of tumour invasiveness and metastatic dissemination. This study aims to examine the association between hTERT transcription and that of VEGF-D, VEGF-C, MMP-1, PAR1a and PAR1b through a correlative analysis of the mRNA transcripts of these genes in human breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Breast cancer tissues (n = 116) and normal tissues (n-31) were collected immediately after surgery and stored at -80 degrees C until use. The level of hTERT transcripts from the prepared DNA from the above samples was determined using real time-quantitative PCR based on the Amplifluor technology. The levels of the transcript were generated from a standard that was simultaneously amplified with the samples. Normalisation against cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was also carried out.RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between hTERT mRNA expression (after CK19 normalisation) with both VEGF-D and MMP-1 in human breast cancer. PAR1 was seen to correlate with hTERT (after GAPDH normalisation) with a highly significant correlation with PAR1a alone. However there was no correlation between hTERT transcription and VEGF-C or with PAR1b alone.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that hTERT is a potential up-regulator of MMP-1, PAR1 and VEGF-D expression and this may explain its apparent control over the invasiveness and metastasis of the malignancy concerned."

At the electron microscopic level, D1a receptors were strongly associated with axons and axonal endings in the SNr, but also with numerous glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive dendrites and neuronal cell bodies. This neuronal expression of D1a receptors was confirmed using RT-PCR. G(alphaolf) protein-specific immunostaining displayed a similar distribution in dendrites and cell bodies to that of D1a receptors. The localization of D1a receptors in both GABAergic cell bodies and terminals is in accordance with the well known complex action of dopamine in the SNr. Moreover, the intracytoplasmic localization of D1a receptors in cell bodies and dendrites that we observed suggests that these receptors are only effective in specific conditions, or are transported to different nigral targets where they may have a presynaptic function."

It was revealed that the distribution of c-RET-immunoreactive neurons and HRP-labeled nigrostriatal neurons overlapped. Numerous double-labeled HRP/c-RET neurons were found in the substantia nigra pars compacta with predominate distribution ipsilateral to the injected striatum. Semiquantitative cell count indicated that a large percentage (97%) of HRP-labeled neurons showed c-RET immunoreactivity. Furthermore, double-labeled HRP/c-RET ones constituted only 61% of total c-RET-immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra ipsolateral to the injected striatum. Taken together with previous observations on glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in the basal ganglia, this study provides evidence that the c-RET protein may mediate biological activity of GDNF family ligands in most of projecting neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta where the dopaminergic neurons are numerously distributed. Specially, it suggests that c-RET-mediating signaling cascades may play important roles in neuron-glial interaction that support and sustain nigrostriatal neuronal circuits in the basal ganglia."

The role of SIFamide in adult courtship behavior in both sexes was studied using two different approaches to perturb the function of SIFamide; targeted cell ablation and RNA interference (RNAi). Elimination of SIFamide by either of these methods results in promiscuous flies; males perform vigorous and indiscriminant courtship directed at either sex, while females appear sexually hyper-receptive. These results demonstrate that SIFamide is responsible for these behavioral effects and that the four SIFamidergic neurons and arborizations play an important function in the neuronal circuitry controlling Drosophila sexual behavior."

In contrast, little is known about the effect of methamphetamine self-administration on these neuronal pathways. We studied the effect of methamphetamine self-administration on two key regulators of dopamine transmission, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and dopamine transporter (DAT), in components of the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine pathways.METHODS: Rats self-administered methamphetamine (0.1 mg/kg per infusion, fixed-ratio-1 reinforcement schedule) or saline (control condition) for 9 h/day over 10 days. The brains of these rats were collected after 1 or 30 days of forced abstinence and the expression levels of TH and DAT were assayed by in situ, hybridization and western blot.RESULTS: TH mRNA and protein levels were increased in the ventral tegmental area (VTA, the cell body region of the mesolimbic dopamine system) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC, the cell body region of the nigrostriatal dopamine system) after 1 day, but not 30 days, of forced abstinence from methamphetamine. In contrast, methamphetamine self-administration had no effect on TH protein levels in dopaminergic terminals located in the nucleus accumbens and caudate-putamen. In addition, methamphetamine self-administration had no effect on DAT mRNA levels in the VTA.CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that extended daily access to self-administered methamphetamine results in a transient, short-lasting effect on mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine neurons of the rat brain."

Tissue factor (TF) is up-regulated during IR, and TF inhibition reduces renal injury. However, the underlying mechanisms by which TF contributes to injury have not been elucidated. We postulated that TF contributes to IR injury by production of coagulation proteases and subsequent signaling by protease activated receptor (PARs). We compared renal injury after 25 minutes of bilateral renal ischemia and varying periods of reperfusion in C57BL/6 mice, those expressing low levels of TF (low-TF), hirudin-treated C57BL/6, and mice lacking either PAR-1 or PAR-2. C57BL/6 mice developed severe renal failure and died within 48 hours of reperfusion. In contrast, low-TF, hirudin-treated C57BL/6, and PAR-1-/- mice were protected from renal failure and had reduced mortality, tubular injury, neutrophil accumulation, and lower levels of the chemokines KC and MIP-2. Importantly, PAR-1-/- mice had lower chemokine levels despite up-regulation of TF and fibrin deposition. In addition, treating PAR-1-/- mice with hirudin conferred no additional benefit. Somewhat surprisingly, PAR-2 deficiency did not protect from renal failure. These experiments indicate that increased TF activity after renal IR leads to increased CXC chemokine expression and subsequent neutrophil-mediated injury predominantly by thrombin-dependent PAR-1 signaling."

Mutations in the parkin gene, which encodes for E3 ubiquitin ligase, have been implicated in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism, an early-onset and common familial form of PD. Although several parkin substrates have already been identified, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of enzymatic activity of parkin has yet to be clarified. In a previous study, we demonstrated that RanBP2 becomes a new target for parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase and is processed via parkin-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. RanBP2, which is localized in the cytoplasmic filament of the nuclear pore complex, belongs to the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase family. Here we show that parkin appears to bind selectively to the SUMO-1 in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the physical association of SUMO-1 with parkin results in an increase in the nuclear transport of parkin as well as its self-ubiquitination. Our findings suggest that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of parkin and its intracellular localization may be modulated through the SUMO-1 association."

The mechanism whereby proteasome dysfunction leads to dopaminergic cell death, however, is unknown. In this study, we show that proteasome inhibition in both PC12 cells and dopaminergic neurons derived from embryonic stem cells is associated with mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, activation of caspase-3, and nuclear changes consistent with apoptosis. Prior to the emergence of apoptotic features, we found that proteasome inhibition induced increased levels of phosphorylated p53. Inhibition of p53 by pifithrin-alpha or by RNA interference prevented mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and cytotoxicity. There was no increase in p53 mRNA in proteasome-inhibited cells, suggesting that p53 was increased in a transcription-independent manner. Further, there was no increase in Puma or Bax mRNA and p53 co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl-xL and Mdm2. These findings suggest that p53 mediates cell death by way of a direct mitochondrial effect in this model. We also observed increased levels of phosphorylated p53 in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta of mice following systemic administration of a proteasome inhibitor. These changes preceded degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Increased phosphorylated p53 was also demonstrated in the substantia nigra pars compacta of post-mortem PD brains. These results suggest that abnormalities in p53 signaling play a role in dopaminergic cell death induced by proteasome inhibition and may be relevant to neurodegeneration in PD."

The resulting accumulation of Parkin-associated endothelin receptor-like receptor (Pael-R), a substrate of Parkin, leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress, causing neuronal death. We previously reported that human E3 HRD1 in the endoplasmic reticulum protects against endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. This study shows that HRD1 was expressed in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) dopaminergic neurons and interacted with Pael-R through the HRD1 proline-rich region, promoting the ubiquitylation and degradation of Pael-R. Furthermore, the disruption of endogenous HRD1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) induced Pael-R accumulation and caspase-3 activation. We also found that ATF6 overexpression, which induced HRD1, accelerated and caused Pael-R degradation; the suppression of HRD1 expression by siRNA partially prevents this degradation. These results suggest that in addition to Parkin, HRD1 is also involved in the degradation of Pael-R."

Expression of PAR-1 was demonstrated only in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes in SNpc, and the number of astrocytes expressing PAR-1 increased in SNpc of PD as compared with nonneurologic control brain. Immunoreactivity for thrombin and prothrombin was stronger in astrocytes and the vessel walls in SNpc of PD brains. PAR-1 was expressed in human astrocytes and neurons, but not in oligodendrocytes or microglia as determined by RT-PCR. We investigated thrombin-mediated activation of human astrocytes. Thrombin treatment activates human astrocytes and induces morphologic change and a marked increase in proliferation of astrocytes. Increased expression of glial cell line-derived growth factor and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) but no change in the expression of nerve growth factor and inflammatory cytokines/chemokine (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1) was found in thrombin/PAR-activated astrocytes. Next, we studied the neuroprotective effect exerted by thrombin-activated astrocytes in human cerebral neuron x human neuroblastoma hybrid neurons. Although thrombin showed neurotoxicity against human hybrid neurons in a dose-dependent manner, the conditioned media derived from thrombin-pretreated astrocyte cultures promoted the survival of human hybrid neurons. The protective effect was completely inhibited with a GPx inhibitor, mercaptosuccinic acid, indicating that GPx released from thrombin/PAR-activated astrocytes is responsible for neuroprotection of hybrid neurons against thrombin cytotoxicity. The present study suggests that the increased expression of PAR-1 in astrocytes in SNpc of PD brain is the restorative move taken by the brain to provide neuroprotection against neuronal degeneration and cell death of dopaminergic neurons caused by noxious insults during the progression of PD pathology."

Here, we investigate whether the two PAR receptor subtypes can signal separately. PAR-2-induced GRO/CINC-1 release was independent of protein kinase C, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase)-1/2 activation, whereas these three kinases were involved in PAR-1-induced GRO/CINC-1 release. Despite such clear differences between PAR-1 and PAR-2 signalling pathways, JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) was identified in both signalling pathways to play a pivotal role. By isoform-specific loss-of-function studies using small interfering RNA against JNK1-3, we demonstrate that different JNK isoforms mediated GRO/CINC-1 secretion, when it was induced by either PAR-1 or PAR-2 activation. JNK2 and JNK3 isoforms were both activated by PAR-1 and essential for chemokine GRO/CINC-1 secretion, whereas PAR-1-mediated JNK1 activation was mainly responsible for c-Jun phosphorylation, which was not involved in GRO/CINC-1 release. In contrast, PAR-2-induced JNK1 activation, which failed to phosphorylate c-Jun, uniquely contributed to GRO/CINC-1 release. Therefore our results show for the first time that JNK-mediated chemokine GRO/CINC-1 release occurred in a JNK isoform-dependent fashion and invoked PAR subtype-specific mechanisms. Furthermore, here we demonstrate that activation of PAR-2, as well as PAR-1, rescued astrocytes from ceramide-induced apoptosis via regulating chemokine GRO/CINC-1 release. Taken together, our results suggest that PAR-1 and PAR-2 have overlapping functions, but can activate separate pathways under certain pathological conditions to rescue neural cells from cell death. This provides new functional insights into PAR/JNK signalling and the protective actions of PARs in brain."

The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome includes a single gene (At1g64660) encoding a protein (AtMGL) with approximately 35% identity to bacterial and protozoan MGLs. When overexpressed in Escherichia coli, AtMGL allowed growth on L-methionine as sole nitrogen source and conferred a high rate of methanethiol emission. The purified recombinant protein exhibited a spectrum typical of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate enzymes, and had high activity toward l-methionine, L-ethionine, L-homocysteine and seleno-L-methionine, but not L-cysteine. Quantitation of mRNA showed that the AtMGL gene is expressed in aerial organs and roots, and that its expression in leaves was increased 2.5-fold by growth on low sulfate medium. Emission of methanethiol from Arabidopsis plants supplied with 10 mM L-methionine was undetectable (&lt;0.5 nmol min(-1) g(-1) FW), suggesting that AtMGL is not an important source of volatile methanethiol. Knocking out the AtMGL gene significantly increased leaf methionine content (9.2-fold) and leaf and root S-methylmethionine content (4.7- and 7-fold, respectively) under conditions of sulfate starvation, indicating that AtMGL carries a significant flux in vivo. In Arabidopsis plantlets fed L-[(35)S]methionine on a low sulfate medium, label was incorporated into protein-bound cysteine as well as methionine, but incorporation into cysteine was significantly (30%) less in the knockout mutant.

In the case of monoaminergic neurotransmitters, this clearance is carried out by high-affinity reuptake transporters located in the plasma membrane of the presynaptic terminals. Recently plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT), a transporter from the SLC29 (equilibrative nucleoside transporter) family, was shown to transport in vitro monoaminergic neurotransmitters, in particular dopamine and serotonin, nearly as efficiently as the high-affinity transporters. This transporter, well expressed in CNS, represents an interesting candidate for the control and modulation of aminergic pathways. We performed an extensive study of the distribution of PMAT in the rat brain. Our results highlight PMAT expression in brain regions which play a pivotal role in significant CNS functions and human neuropathologies. Using in situ hybridization immunohistochemistry co-labeling, PMAT mRNA was found in various neuron subtypes, including glutamatergic neurons of the hippocampus, mitral cells of the olfactory bulbs and GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and hypothalamus. Paradoxically, rat PMAT mRNA was found in some but not all monoaminergic nuclei. It was on the contrary predominantly expressed in major cholinergic groups throughout the brain, including brainstem motor nuclei, components of the basal forebrain cholinergic system and cholinergic interneurons of the striatum. These systems, implicated in locomotion, associative and spatial memory and reward-related learning, are disrupted at early stages of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Taken together, our observations support a role for PMAT in monoamine uptake in cholinergic neurons."

Dopamine and adenosine receptors have been demonstrated to exhibit a parallel distribution on certain neuronal populations, and even when not directly co-localized, relationships (both antagonistic and synergistic) have been described. This study was designed to investigate dopaminergic and purinergic systems in mice with ablations of individual dopamine or adenosine receptors. In situ hybridization histochemistry and autoradiography was used to examine the level of mRNA and protein expression of specific receptors and transporters in dopaminergic pathways. Expression of the mRNA encoding the dopamine D2 receptor was elevated in the caudate putamen of D1, D3 and A2A receptor knockout mice; this was mirrored by an increase in D2 receptor protein in D1 and D3 receptor knockout mice, but not in A2A knockout mice. Dopamine D1 receptor binding was decreased in the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and ventral pallidum of D2 receptor knockout mice. In substantia nigra pars compacta, dopamine transporter mRNA expression was dramatically decreased in D3 receptor knockout mice, but elevated in A2A receptor knockout mice. All dopamine receptor knockout mice examined exhibited increased A2A receptor binding in the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. These data are consistent with the existence of functional interactions between dopaminergic and purinergic systems in these reward and motor-related brain regions."

Two pituitary gonadotropins (GTHs: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)) have been identified in representative species of all classes of vertebrates except the agnathans. The present study was undertaken to identify GTH in sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, to gain a further understanding of the origin and evolution of reproductive pituitary hormones and their respective genes in vertebrates. Sea lamprey preGTHbeta-like cDNA was cloned from a plasmid cDNA library using an expressed sequence tag analysis. The preGTHbeta-like cDNA encoded 150 amino acids, in which the GTHbeta-like protein consisted of 134 amino acid residues. Sea lamprey GTHbeta-like protein contained 12 Cys residues and two N-glycosylation sites at homologous positions to those of FSHbeta and LHbeta. The region of the molecule that has been proposed to control receptor binding specificity (i.e., the region between the 10th and 12th Cys residues) suggests that the proposed heterodimer would be more like a FSH than a LH. Sea lamprey GTHbeta-like protein-producing cells were identified immunocytochemically in the ventral part of the proximal pars distalis of pituitary using antiserum prepared against a synthetic peptide of preGTHbeta-like protein (52-68). Intraperitoneal administration of sea lamprey GnRH-I and -III at 100 microg/g body weight (twice at a 24h interval) increased expression of GTHbeta-like protein in the pituitary of adult female sea lamprey during the final maturational period. Thus, these results are the first to demonstrate the presence of a single GTH-like system in lampreys. Because the sea lamprey GTHbeta-like protein is a clear out-group compared to those of the LH and FSH family based on phylogenic analysis, we propose that an ancestral glycoprotein hormone gave rise to only one GTH in lampreys and to the glycoprotein hormone family that gave rise to LH, FSH, and TSH during the early evolution of gnathostomes."

While FS has been shown to possess osteoinductive potential, little is known about its effects on chondrogenic cells. In this study, we assessed the bioactivity of FS (Tisseel) on the migration and proliferation of human articular chondrocytes in vitro. Using a co-culture assay to mimic matrix-induced ACI (MACI), chondrocytes were found to migrate from collagen membranes towards FS within 12 h of culture, with significant migratory activity evident by 24 h. In addition, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation experiments revealed that thrombin, the active component of the tissue glue, stimulated chondrocyte proliferation, with maximal efficacy observed at 48 h post-stimulation (1-10 U/ml). In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these thrombin-induced effects, we examined the expression and activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs), established thrombin receptors. Using a combination of RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, all four PARs were detected in human chondrocytes, with PAR-1 being the major isoform expressed. Moreover, thrombin and a PAR-1, but not other PAR-isotype-specific peptide agonists, were found to induce rapid intracellular Ca2+ responses in human chondrocytes in calcium mobilization assays. Together, these data demonstrate that FS supports both the migration and proliferation of human chondrocytes. We propose that these effects are mediated, at least in part, via thrombin-induced PAR-1 signalling in human chondrocytes."

Mast cells have been proposed as an immune gate to the brain, as well as sensors of environmental and emotional stress, and are likely involved in neuropathologic processes such as multiple sclerosis. Among mast cell products, the protease tryptase could be associated with neurodegenerative processes through the activation of specific receptors (PARs) expressed in the brain, while interleukin (IL)-6 likely causes neurodegeneration and exacerbates dysfunction induced by other cytokines; or it could have a protective effect against demyelinisation. In this report we show that quercetin, a natural compound able to act as an inhibitor of mast cell secretion, causes a decrease in the release of tryptase and IL-6 and the down-regulation of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) mRNA from human mast cell (HMC)-1 cells. As quercetin dramatically inhibits mast cell tryptase and IL-6 release and HDC mRNA transcription by HMC-1 cell line, these results nominate quercetin as a therapeutical compound in association with other therapeutical molecules for neurological diseases mediated by mast cell degranulation."

Mast cells produce serine proteases including tryptase and chymase (MCC) that act via protease-activated receptors (PARs) to induce synthesis of fibrogenic cytokines by renal cells. In the present study, we investigated direct effect of MCC and role of PARs on glomerular albumin permeability (P(alb)). Isolated rat glomeruli were incubated with MCC (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml) for 5-30 min in presence or absence of PAR-1 and PAR-2 blocking antibodies. P(alb) was determined from the change in glomerular volume in response to an albumin oncotic gradient. The effect of direct activation of PARs on P(alb) was verified by incubating glomeruli with synthetic hexapeptide known to activate PAR-1 and PAR-2. MCC increased P(alb) of isolated rat glomeruli in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Blocking PAR-2 prevented MCC-mediated increase in P(alb). RT-PCR analysis of glomerular RNA demonstrated the presence of constitutively expressed PAR-1, -2, and -3 and low levels of PAR-4. In addition, direct activation of PAR-2 by hexapeptide SLIGKV increased P(alb) comparable to MCC, whereas PAR-1 activation by TFLLRN had no effect on P(alb). Our results document that MCC induces increase in P(alb) and that this effect is mediated through PAR-2. MCC may also play a role in renal scarring. We propose that inhibiting MCC activity or blocking the activation of PAR-2 may provide new targets for therapy in renal diseases."

In addition to its functional importance in the classification of olfactory stimuli, the PC has been implicated in the study of memory processing, spread of excitatory information, and the facilitation and propagation of seizures within the limbic system. Previous data from the kindling model of epilepsy indicated that alterations in GABAergic inhibition in the transition zone between the anterior and posterior PC, termed here central PC, are particularly involved in the processes underlying seizure propagation. In the present study we studied alterations in GABAergic neurons in different parts of the PC following seizures induced by kainate or pilocarpine in rats. GABA neurons were labeled either immunohistochemically for GABA or its synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) or by in situ hybridization using antisense probes for GAD65 and GAD67 mRNAs. For comparison with the PC, labeled neurons were examined in the basolateral amygdala, substantia nigra pars reticulata, and the hippocampal formation. In the PC of controls, immunohistochemical labeling for GABA and GAD yielded consistently higher neuronal densities in most cell layers than labeling for GAD65 or GAD67 mRNAs, indicating a low basal activity of these neurons. Eight hours following kainate- or pilocarpine-induced seizures, severe neuronal damage was observed in the PC. Counting of GABA neurons in the PC demonstrated significant decreases in densities of neurons labeled for GABA or GAD proteins. However, a significantly increased density of neurons labeled for GAD65 and GAD67 mRNAs was determined in layer II of the central PC, indicating that a subpopulation of remaining neurons up-regulated the mRNAs for the GAD isoenzymes. One likely explanation for this finding is that remaining GABA neurons in layer II of the central PC maintain high levels of activity to control the increased excitability of the region. In line with previous studies, an up-regulation of GAD67 mRNA, but not GAD65 mRNA, was observed in dentate granule cells following seizures, whereas no indication of such up-regulation was determined for the other brain regions examined. The data substantiate the particular susceptibility of the central PC to seizure-induced plasticity and indicate that this brain region provides an interesting tool to study the regulation of GAD isoenzymes."

This peptide drives the pulsatile release of FSH and LH from the pituitary pars distalis via signaling pathways that are activated by the type I GnRH receptor (GnRH-R). Recently, a microarray analysis study reported that a number of genes, including mPer1, are induced by GnRH in immortalized gonadotrope cells. In view of these data, we have begun to analyze in detail the signaling pathways mediating the action of GnRH on mPer1 expression in these cells. Using quantitative real-time polymprose cho read (PCR), we could confirm that exposure of immortalized gonadotropes (LbetaT2 cells) to the GnRH analog, buserelin, markedly induces mPer1 (but not mPer2) expression. Consistent with GnRH receptor signaling via the protein kinase (PK)-C pathway, exposure of the cells to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate rapidly elevates both mPer1 and LHbeta subunit mRNA levels, while pharmacological inhibition of PKC prevents the mPer1 and LHbeta response to buserelin. As GnRH is known to regulate gonadotropin synthesis via activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, we then examined the involvement of this pathway in regulating mPer1 expression in gonadotropes. Our data reveal that GnRH-induced mPer1 expression is blocked following acute exposure to a MAPK kinase inhibitor. Although the involvement of this signaling mechanism in the regulation of mPer1 is known in neurons, e.g., in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the induction of mPer1 in gonadotropes represents a novel mechanism of GnRH signaling, whose functional significance is still under investigation."

Male Wistar rats were rendered endotoxemic by intra-peritoneal injection of LPS (15 mg/kg body weight). We examined the expression of protein and mRNA and the immunohistochemical localization of PAR isoforms in lung tissues 1, 3, 6, and 10 h after LPS administration. Induction of ALI by LPS was confirmed based on histopathological changes. LPS administration induced significant increases in the expression of PAR isoforms (protein) at the level of transcription in ALI. While the time course of PAR-1 and -2 expressions were different, those of PAR-3 and -4 were almost similar. An immunohistochemical analysis showed localization of PAR isoforms in the vascular endothelium, alveolar epithelium, and alveolar macrophages. However, the cellular distribution patterns of PAR isoforms were different. We conclude that LPS induces increase in protein expression of PAR isoforms at the level of transcription in rats with ALI. The differential expression patterns (over a time course) and distribution of PAR isoforms suggests a distinct role for each isoform in the pathogenesis of LPS-induced ALI."

The best known are CB1, mainly expressed in the central nervous system and CB2 which is almost exclusively expressed in the periphery. Here we report the molecular characterization of two duplicate CB2-like cannabinoid receptors from zebrafish (Danio rerio) (zebrafish Cb2a and zebrafish Cb2b). The amino acid sequences of these receptors present 56% identity with Takifugu rubripes CB2 sequence and 39% with human CB2 sequence and conserve some specific key residues for cannabinoid receptor function. Both duplicate receptors are expressed in peripheral tissues (gills, heart, intestine and muscle), immune tissue (spleen) and also in the central nervous system. Using in situ hybridization techniques zebrafish Cb2 mRNA expression was observed for the first time in the adenohypophysial cells of the rostral pars distalis and proximal pars distalis of the pituitary gland. Given the importance of the existence of duplication of genes in teleosts, the combined analysis of these two new cannabinoid receptors opens a new exciting door to investigate and understand cannabinoid function throughout evolution."

PAR2 has been implicated in inflammatory airways disease. Although fibroblasts are pathologically important in the airways, the proinflammatory role of PAR2 in these cells remains unknown. We assessed PAR expression and functionality in human primary bronchial fibroblasts (HPBFs) before assessing PAR2-mediated HPBF proliferation, cytokine production, and adhesion molecule expression. RT-PCR and flow cytometry demonstrated that HPBFs express hPAR1, hPAR2, and hPAR3, but not hPAR4. Intracellular calcium signaling in HPBFs in response to PAR agonists showed that only hPAR1 and hPAR2 were functional receptors. We used the MTT assay to assess HPBF proliferation. Of the PAR2 agonist proteinases or selective PAR2-activating peptides (PAR2-APs) tested, none stimulated HPBF proliferation, whereas thrombin was a HPBF growth factor. mRNA for IL-8 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was upregulated after addition of SLIGKV-NH2 when assessed by RT-PCR. No significant increase in G-CSF or IL-8 protein was detected. Trypsin stimulated IL-8 and G-CSF release from HPBF in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Leupeptin and soya trypsin inhibitor abrogated trypsin-stimulated cytokine release, indicating a requirement for trypsin's proteolytic activity. Trypsin and SLIGKV-NH2 stimulated an increase in VCAM-1 expression at 12 h after treatment, which declined thereafter. PAR2-driven upregulation of VCAM-1 cell surface expression and the release of IL-8 and G-CSF from bronchial fibroblasts may be important in promoting neutrophilic airways inflammation."

The best characterised model of melatonin signalling during development is the pars distalis of the rat pituitary. However, although many studies have characterised the postnatal decline of melatonin receptors in the rat pars distalis, the mechanism(s) that time the developmental onset of receptor expression during embryogenesis are unknown. Analysis of these mechanisms may yield important information regarding the putative role of melatonin in neuroendocrine development. Here, we report the expression of MT(1) melatonin receptor mRNA in the rat pituitary from embryonic day 15.5 (e15.5). Prior to e15.5, the homeodomain transcription factor Msx-1, an inhibitor of cellular differentiation, is widely expressed throughout the pituitary. In transient transfection experiments, Msx-1 potently inhibited pituitary homeobox-1 (Pitx-1)-induced MT(1) promoter activity and therefore may represent a key inhibitor of MT(1) expression in early pituitary development. During late embryogenesis, MT(1) mRNA was expressed in both the ventral and dorsal pituitary. Analysis of a 1.5-kb fragment of the rat MT(1) promoter revealed four putative cis-elements for the POU domain factor Pit-1, which is associated with mid-dorsal cell lineages. Although Pit-1 induced a strong, dose-dependent stimulation of MT(1) promoter activity in vitro, dual-labelled in situ hybridisation revealed no colocalisation of MT(1) and Pit-1 mRNAs in vivo at e19.5. By contrast, all MT(1) positive cells colocalised with alphaGSU and most with betaTSH mRNA. Our data therefore implicate the decline of Msx-1 expression as a key event that times the onset of melatonin receptor expression to the differentiation of endocrine cells types in the developing pituitary gland, and suggest that the melatonin-sensitive cells in the embryonic pituitary are primarily Pit-1-independent thyrotrophs in the rostral pituitary, with a secondary population of pars distalis gonadotrophs."

The objective of the present study was to investigate the pattern of protease- activated receptors (PARs) over time in a model of acute liver injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and whether PARs play a role in this process and exert their effects through inflammation and coagulation. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) were significantly expressed 1 h after LPS administration followed by: i) an increase in levels of tissue factor, factor VIIa, thrombin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; ii) unchanged or steady levels of tissue factor pathway inhibitor; and iii) subsequent deposition of fibrin in the liver tissue, that led to the elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which are associated with liver injury. The expression of all PAR isoforms (1-4) was elevated, and each isoform had a distinct cellular localization (hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, the portal triad area, and central veins) and a time-dependent pattern of expression. The immuno-reactivity of PAR2 and 4 in Kupffer cells was intense. Interestingly, PAR2 blocking peptide improved the healing of liver injuries, an effect that was associated with suppression of TNF-a elevation, and normalization of coagulation and fibrinolysis. This ultimately led to decreased fibrin formation in the injured liver. The present study reveals a distinct chronological expression and cellular localization of PARs in LPS-mediated liver injury and shows that blockade of PAR2 may play a crucial role in treating liver injury, via normalization of inflammation, coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways."

In mammals, the cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) takes a key position in the innate immune and inflammatory responses and influences the HPA-axis. In fish, studies that address the effects of cytokines on HPI-axis activation are limited. We quantitatively assessed expression of IL-1beta and its receptor, IL-1RI (the latter was cloned and sequenced), in an acute restraint stress paradigm in common carp, Cyprinus carpio. We also considered expression of the pituitary hormones prolactin (PRL) and GH that have been shown to be structurally related to cytokines and have immunomodulatory actions. Pituitary PRL expression increased fourfold during stress; GH mRNA levels were unaffected. Following restraint, hypothalamic IL-1beta expression was upregulated; in head kidney and pituitary pars intermedia, IL-1RI expression significantly increased. We suggest that during acute stress IL-1beta signalling in the HPI-axis becomes more sensitive, since both ligand and receptor expressions are enhanced. In vitro, recombinant carp IL-1beta stimulates release of alpha-MSH and N-Ac beta-endorphin from the pituitary gland. This observation concurs with increased in vivo plasma levels of alpha-MSH and N-Ac beta-endorphin following restraint. Our findings combined lead us to conclude that IL-1beta affects the activity of the HPI-axis and, in turn, expression profiles of genes encoding IL-1beta and its receptor are modified during acute stress. Our study provides convincing evidence for bi-directional communication of the HPI-axis and the immune system in fish."

The study of their local interactions has revealed that they are connected by electrical synapses. Connexins, the molecular substrate of electrical synapses, constitute a multigenic family of 20 proteins in rodents. The permeability and regulation properties of electrical synapses depend on their connexin composition. Therefore, the knowledge of the molecular composition of electrical synapses is fundamental to the understanding of their specific functions. We have investigated the connexin mRNA expression pattern of dopaminergic neurons by single-cell RT-PCR analysis, during two periods in which dopaminergic neurons are electrically coupled in vitro (P7-P10 and P17-P21). Our results show that dopaminergic neurons express mRNAs of various connexins (Cx26, Cx30, Cx31.1, Cx32, Cx36 and Cx43) in a developmentally regulated manner. Furthermore, we have observed that dopaminergic neurons display different connexin expression patterns, and that multiple connexins can be expressed in a single dopaminergic neuron. These observations underline the importance of electrical coupling in the development of dopaminergic neurons and raise the question of the existence of functionally distinct electrically coupled networks in the substantia nigra pars compacta."

Branchial Ca2+ influx, drinking rate and plasma calcium levels were assessed. Sea bream plasma parathyroid hormone related protein (sPTHrP) was measured, and mRNAs of pthrp, its main receptor, pth1r, and the calcium-sensing receptor (casr) were quantified in osmoregulatory tissues and the pituitary gland. When calcium is limited in water or diet, sea bream maintain calcium balance; however, both plasma Ca2+ and plasma sPTHrP concentrations were lower when calcium was restricted in both water and diet. Positive correlations between plasma sPTHrP and plasma Ca2+ (R2 = 0.30, N = 39, P &lt; 0.05), and plasma sPTHrP and body mass of the fish (R2 = 0.37, N = 148, P &lt; 0.001) were found. Immunoreactive sPTHrP was demonstrated in pituitary gland pars intermedia cells that border the pars nervosa and co-localises with somatolactin. In the pituitary gland, pthrp, pth1r and casr mRNAs were downregulated after both short- and long-term exposure to DSW. A correlation between pituitary gland pthrp mRNA expression and plasma Ca2+ (R2 = 0.71, N = 7, P &lt; 0.01) was observed. In gill tissue, pthrp and pth1r mRNAs were significantly upregulated after 30 days exposure to DSW, whereas no effect was found for casr mRNA expression. We conclude that in water of low salinity, declining pituitary gland pthrp mRNA expression accompanied by constant plasma sPTHrP levels points to a reduced sPTHrP turnover and that sPTHrP, through paracrine interaction, is involved in the regulation of branchial calcium handling, independently of endocrine pituitary gland sPTHrP."

DA neurons in the CGS preferentially expressed implicated in cell survival (7 out of 8 genes selected), whereas SNpc DA neurons preferentially expressed one gene making them potentially susceptible to undergo cell death in PD. We propose that factors making CGS DA neurons more resistant may be helpful in protecting SNpc DA neurons against a pathological insult."

In the present study, cellular expression of galectin subtypes in the urinary system of adult mice was examined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The major subtype expressed in the murine urinary system was galectin-3, which was expressed continuously from the kidney to the distal end of the urethra. The renal cortex expressed galectin-3 more intensely than the medulla. Renal galectin-3 immunoreactivity was strongest in the cortical collecting ducts, where principal cells were the sole cellular source. All cell layers of the transitional epithelium from the renal pelvis to the urethra strongly expressed galectin-3 at the mRNA and protein levels. An electron microscopic study demonstrated diffuse cytoplasmic localization of galectin-3 in principal cells of the collecting ducts and in the bladder epithelial cells. Urethral galectin-3 expression at the pars spongiosa decreased in intensity near the external urethral orifice, where the predominant subtype of galectin was substituted by galectin-7. The muscular layer of the ureter and urinary bladder contained significant signals for galectin-1. Taken together, the observations indicate that the adult urinary system shows intense and selective expression of galectin-3 in epithelia of the uretic bud- and cloaca-derivatives."

Since protease-activated receptors (PARs) are receptors of several serine proteinases and airway epithelial cells are a major source of cytokines, the influence of serine proteinases and PARs on interleukin (IL)-8 secretion and gene expression in cultured A549 cells was examined.RESULTS: A549 cells express all four PARs at both protein and mRNA levels as assessed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thrombin, tryptase, elastase and trypsin induce a up to 8, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1 fold increase in IL-8 release from A549 cells, respectively following 16 h incubation period. The thrombin, elastase and trypsin induced secretion of IL-8 can be abolished by their specific inhibitors. Agonist peptides of PAR-1, PAR-2 and PAR-4 stimulate up to 15.6, 6.6 and 3.5 fold increase in IL-8 secretion, respectively. Real time PCR shows that IL-8 mRNA is up-regulated by the serine proteinases tested and by agonist peptides of PAR-1 and PAR-2.CONCLUSION: The proteinases, possibly through activation of PARs can stimulate IL-8 release from A549 cells, suggesting that they are likely to contribute to IL-8 related airway inflammatory disorders in man."

Our results show that hyperthyroidism evokes a marked 3.2-fold reduction in basal plasma cortisol levels. Corticotropin-releasing hormone-binding protein (CRH-BP) mRNA levels in the hypothalamus, measured by real-time quantitative PCR, were significantly elevated by 40%, but CRH, urotensin-I, prepro-TRH, prohormone convertase-1 (PC1), and POMC mRNA levels were unchanged. In the pituitary pars distalis, PC1, CRH receptor-1, and POMC mRNA levels were unaffected, as was ACTH content. Plasma alpha-MSH concentrations were significantly elevated by 30% in hyperthyroid fish, and this was reflected in PC1 and POMC mRNA levels in pituitary pars intermedia that were increased 1.5- and 2.4-fold respectively. The alpha-MSH content of the pars intermedia was unchanged. Hyperthyroidism has profound effects on the basal levels of a central mediator, i.e., CRH-BP, of HPI-axis function in unstressed carp in vivo, and we conclude that HPI- and hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid-axis functions are strongly interrelated.

Four members of the Id gene family exhibit closely related but distinct expression patterns in various mammalian organs of not only embryos but also adults. Among them, Id2 is known to be expressed in Purkinje cells and neurons in the cortical layers of the adult mouse brain, suggesting that Id2 is involved in some neural functions in the adult. To get insight into the role of Id2 in the nervous system, we investigated the localization of Id2 mRNA-expressing cells in the adult mouse brain in detail by in situ hybridization with the radiolabeled antisense probe and compared it with the localization of other Id gene family members. The results indicated that Id2 mRNA is detected in more varied brain regions than previously reported. These regions include the amygdaloid complex, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the anterior part of the subventricular zone. These results suggest the possibility that Id2 plays a role in the neural activity and cognitive functions. On the other hand, Id1 was barely detectable. Although moderate or low expression of Id3 was observed diffusely, high expression was observed in some specific regions including the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the external capsule. Id4 mRNA was detected in the regions such as the caudate putamen and the lateral amygdaloid nucleus. Thus, the expression pattern of Id2 is distinct from those of other Id gene family members."

Previous studies have shown that GABA binding is reduced in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) of both epileptic and pre-epileptic gerbils compared with controls, suggesting that reduced expression of GABAA receptors in SNr might be epileptogenic in this model. To test this hypothesis, we measured the expression of the GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit, the dominant alpha subunit expressed in the SNr, and evaluated GABAA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents in SNr neurons. GABA(A) alpha1 subunit mRNA levels in substantia nigra-rich tissue from pre-epileptic animals were similar to controls, and immunocytochemistry for the alpha1 subunit showed similar strong expression in the SNr in both groups. Western analysis confirmed that expression of the alpha1 subunit protein was similar in substantia nigra-rich tissue from pre-epileptic and control gerbils. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and the frequency of miniature (m)IPSCs in SNr neurons of pre-epileptic gerbil were similar to those of controls. The amplitude of mIPSCs in the pre-epileptics was significantly larger than controls. Zolpidem, an alpha1 subunit-specific modulator of the GABAA receptor, was equally efficacious in prolonging the decay time of mIPSCs in both groups. Hence, contrary to the predictions of the hypothesis, mRNA and protein expression levels of the major GABAA receptor alpha subunit were normal, and neurons of the SNr in pre-epileptic gerbils displayed normal or enhanced IPSC frequencies and amplitudes. Therefore reduced expression of GABAA receptors in SNr is not likely to be an epileptogenic mechanism in this model."

CART peptides were recently shown to colocalise with luteinising hormone (LH) or prolactin in rat anterior pituitary, and contradictory results concerning the peptide effects on pituitary hormonal secretions were obtained in vitro from pituitary cell cultures. Thus, we reinvestigated the expression of CART mRNA within the pituitary. Immunohistochemistry for pituitary hormones was performed on sections from adult male Wistar rats followed by in situ hybridisation using CART mRNA antisense 35S-labelled probes. The most represented CART-expressing cells were lactotrophs (42 +/- 1% of CART cells) and gonadotrophs (32 +/- 3%), followed by thyrotrophs (10 +/- 2%), corticotrophs (7 +/- 2%) and somatotrophs (6 +/- 1%). In the pars tuberalis, CART mRNA was easily detectable in gonadotrophs and lactotrophs and, to a lesser extent, in corticotrophs and thyrotrophs. CART peptide was quickly and potently released from perifused pituitary by depolarisation (K+ 30 mM for 15 min; 465 +/- 37% over basal release, n = 5). Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (0.1 microM) were also active to a lesser extent (138 +/- 11% and 71 +/- 17, n = 7, respectively). CART (0.1 microM) did not modify basal LH or prolactin release but selectively inhibited K+-induced LH release without affecting K+-induced prolactin secretion. Pituitary CART mRNA and content were sex dependent and varied during the oestrous cycle, being lower in dioestrous 2. Pituitary CART content also varied widely amongst rat strains being five to six-fold higher in Wistar and Fischer rats compared to Brown Norway and Lou C rats. Ageing differentially affected pituitary CART mRNA and content, resulting in a marked decrease in Lou C and an increase in Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats. Taken together, these results suggest that pituitary CART expression is dependent of the sex steroid environment and may be physiologically involved in LH secretion."

In the kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy, this endogenous inhibitory control mechanism seems to be impaired. Neurochemical and neurophysiological studies have indicated that the activity of the GABAergic projection from the striatum to the substantia nigra pars reticulata is reduced in kindled rats, but the exact mechanisms involved in this observation are not known. Possible explanations include a kindling-induced loss of striatal GABAergic projection neurons to the substantia nigra or enhanced inhibition of these neurons by GABAergic interneurons. In the present experiments, the GABAergic system of the striatum (caudate-putamen) of amygdala-kindled rats and controls was studied immunohistochemically with a monoclonal antibody to GABA and with nonisotopic in situ hybridization with cRNA probes selective for glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) and GAD67, respectively. Compared to sham controls, an increased density of neurons heavily labeled for GAD67 mRNA was observed in the anterior striatum of kindled rats when cells were counted 6 weeks after the last kindled seizure. This subgroup of striatal GABAergic neurons has been suggested previously to correspond to the medium-sized aspiny interneurons in the striatum, indicating that kindling is associated with an increased activity of these neurons. Our previous finding of reduced GAD and GABA levels in synaptosomes isolated from the substantia nigra of kindled rats together with the present observation of increased density of GABAergic striatal interneurons in such rats suggest that kindling affects the regulation of the GABAergic projections from the striatum to the substantia nigra rather than directly damaging GABAergic neurons in the striatum."

In this study, we cloned TRbetaB from the brain of the Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) to extend our studies into thyroid hormone function in fish. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the TRbetaB transcripts were abundant in both the brain and pituitary. The TRbetaB cDNA encoded a 379 amino acid protein with much higher homology to the conger eel TRbetaB than to other fish TRs, supporting the existence of a TRbetaB isoform, at least in anguilliforms. In a transiently transfected Japanese eel cell line, Hepa-E1, TRbetaB and its splice variants in the ligand-binding domain (TRbetaBL) showed thyroid hormone (TH)-dependent activation of transcription from the TH-responsive promoter.

It has recently been shown that a family of protease-activated receptors (PARs) modulate endothelium-dependent vasodilatation.OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence and functional role of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) and protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) in mediating vascular tone in IMAs and GSVs from patients undergoing CABG by means of real time-PCR and isometric tension measurements.RESULTS: PAR1 mRNA levels were higher than those of PAR2 mRNA in both vessels. A selective PAR2-activating peptide (PAR2-AP), SLIGKV-NH(2) (0.01-100 micromol L(-1)), failed to induce vasorelaxation in precontracted IMA and GSV rings, whereas the selective PAR1-AP, TFLLR-NH(2) (0.001 to 10 micromol L(-1)), caused greater endothelium-dependent relaxation in the IMAs (pD(2) values 7.25 +/- 0.6 vs. 7.86 +/- 0.42, P &lt; 0.05; E(max) values 56.2 +/- 17.3% vs. 29.7 +/- 13.4%, P &lt; 0.001). Preincubation with TNFalpha (3 nmol L(-1)) induced vasorelaxation in IMAs in response to PAR2-AP (P &lt; 0.05 vs. non-stimulated vessels); the response to PAR1-AP was unchanged. The relaxation induced by both PAR-APs was NO- and endothelium-dependent.CONCLUSION: These data show that functionally active PAR1 and PAR2 are present in IMAs and GSVs, and that inflammatory stimuli selectively enhance endothelium-dependent relaxation to PAR2-AP in IMAs."

Weak hybridization signals for GAP-43 mRNA and intense signals for both MARCKS and neurogranin mRNAs were observed in the adult neostriatum. All three of the mRNAs were expressed in both substance P-positive direct pathway neurons and enkephalin-positive indirect pathway neurons. In the nucleus accumbens, the hybridization signals for the three mRNAs were weaker than those in the neostriatum. Double-label in situ hybridization histochemistry in the neostriatum revealed that GAP-43 and neurogranin mRNAs were expressed in a subset of MARCKS-positive neurons. While intense hybridization signals for MARCKS mRNA were observed in all of the other basal ganglia regions such as the globus pallidus, substantia innominata, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra, intense signals for GAP-43 mRNA were restricted to the substantia innominata and substantia nigra pars compacta. No signal for neurogranin mRNA was observed in the basal ganglia regions outside the neostriatum and the nucleus accumbens. These results indicate that the protein kinase C substrates are abundant in some specific connections in cortico-basal ganglia circuits. Developmental analysis showed that the expression level in the putamen and nucleus accumbens, but not in the caudate nucleus, was higher in the infant than in the adult, suggesting that synaptic maturation in the caudate nucleus occurs earlier than that in the putamen and nucleus accumbens."

In mammals and amphibia, evidence indicates that anterior pituitary endocrine cells also contain IGF-I. However, only preliminary and conflicting data exist on IGF-I gene expression in bony fish pituitary. Thus, we investigated the presence of IGF-I in the tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) pituitary by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. The absolute amount of IGF-I mRNA in the whole pituitary (7.4+/-3.3 x 10(-3)pg/microg total RNA) was 1000-times lower than in liver (7.5+/-3.1 pg/microg total RNA). IGF-I peptide occurred in both neuro- and adenohypophysis but IGF-I gene expression was mainly restricted to the adenohypophysis. In the neurohypophysis, only few cells, probably pituicytes, contained IGF-I mRNA whereas IGF-I peptide was found also in numerous axons in the pars nervosa. In the adenohypophysis, both IGF-I mRNA and peptide were present in the majority of ACTH cells in all individuals investigated. In alpha-MSH cells, only IGF-I mRNA but no IGF-I peptide was detected likely suggesting an immediate release of IGF-I after synthesis. IGF-I mRNA and peptide were further observed in GH cells but their presence showed pronounced inter-individual differences likely due to the physiological, e.g., nutritional, status of the individual. IGF-I released from the GH cells may serve as auto/paracrine mediator of a negative feedback mechanism in addition to liver-derived endocrine IGF-I. Generally, the constitutive synthesis of IGF-I in ACTH cells and the varying content in GH and alpha-MSH cells suggest particular roles for IGF-I. Local IGF-I may regulate synthesis and release of pituitary hormones in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner as well as prevent apoptosis and stimulate proliferation of endocrine cells."

In mouse stomach, the expression of DDV10 was detected in pars proventricularis but not in pars glandularis. Furthermore, the DDV10 gene was found to possess two transcripts, a long form (DDV10) and a short form (OCILrP1, osteoclast inhibitory lectin-related protein 1). DDV10 mRNA but not OCILrP1 mRNA was expressed in the stratified and cornified epithelial tissues. DDV10 mRNA was first detected between 12 and 18 h after E2 treatment in the vaginal epithelium, and was detected in the vagina of the neonatally diethylstilbestrol (DES)-treated mouse. Recently, a unified name was registered in GenBank (C-type lectin domain family 2, member g; Clec2 g).

One model that recapitulates the pathology of PD is the administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Here we show that exposure to an enriched environment (EE) (a combination of exercise, social interactions and learning) or exercise alone during adulthood, totally protects against MPTP-induced Parkinsonism. Furthermore, changes in mRNA expression would suggest that increases in glia-derived neurotrophic factors, coupled with a decrease of dopamine-related transporters (e.g. dopamine transporter, DAT; vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2), contribute to the observed neuroprotection of dopamine neurons in the nigrostriatal system following MPTP exposure. This non-pharmacological approach presents significant implications for the prevention and/or treatment of PD."

In the nervous system, MCP-1/CCL2 is implicated in neuroinflammatory pathologies. However, cerebral functions of MCP-1/CCL2 under normal conditions are still unclear. In this study, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and specific rat MCP-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approaches, we observed that MCP-1/CCL2 mRNA and protein were expressed in different punched regions of the normal rat central nervous system. Immunohistochemical studies further revealed that this chemokine is constitutively expressed not only in astrocytes but also in neurons, in discrete neuroanatomical regions. Neuronal expression of MCP-1/CCL2 is mainly found in the cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, hippocampus, paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra, facial nuclei, motor and spinal trigeminal nuclei, and gigantocellular reticular nucleus and in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Moreover, we obtained the first evidence that MCP-1/CCL2 is constitutively expressed in cholinergic neurons, notably in the magnocellular preoptic and oculomotor nuclei, and in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition, in the lateral hypothalamic area, MCP-1/CCL2 co-localized with melanin-concentrating hormone-expressing neurons. Interestingly, we demonstrate a co-localization of MCP-1/CCL2 with vasopressin in magnocellular neuronal cell bodies and processes in the supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, as well as in processes in the internal layer of the median eminence and in the posterior pituitary. Taken together, our data suggest that MCP-1/CCL2 could act as a modulator of neuronal activity and neuroendocrine functions."

The etiology of PD is still unknown, but recent identification of mutations in familial cases of PD has advanced the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this neurological disease. Mutations in the parkin gene, which encodes for ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), have been implicated in autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism, an early onset and common familial form of PD. Here we reported that Parkin selectively binds to RanBP2, which is localized in the cytoplasmic filament of the nuclear pore complex and belongs to the small ubiquitin-related modifier E3 ligase family. We also demonstrated that RanBP2 becomes a target for Parkin E3 ubiquitin-ligase and is processed via Parkin-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, Parkin controls the intracellular levels of sumoylated HDAC4, as a result of the ubiquitination and degradation of RanBP2. Our findings suggested that the intracellular levels of RanBP2 and its functional activity may be modulated by Parkin-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal pathways."

Here, we study the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in alterations of the nigrostriatal system associated with transgenics carrying mutant huntingtin. Using huntingtin-BDNF+/- double-mutant mice, we analyzed the effects of reducing the levels of BDNF expression in a model of Huntington's disease (R6/1). When compared with R6/1 mice, these mice exhibit an increased number of aggregates in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition, reduction of BDNF expression exacerbates the dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction seen in mutant huntingtin mice, such as the decrease in retrograde labelling of dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine content. However, mutant huntingtin mice with normal or lowered BDNF expression show the same decrease in the anterograde transport, number of dopaminergic neurons and nigral volume. In addition, reduced BDNF expression causes decreased dopamine receptor expression in mutant huntingtin mice. Examination of changes in locomotor activity induced by dopamine receptor agonists revealed that, in comparison with R6/1 mice, the double mutant mice exhibit lower activity in response to amphetamine, but not to apomorphine. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that the decreased BDNF expression observed in Huntington's disease exacerbates dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction, which may participate in the motor disturbances associated with this neurodegenerative disorder."

PAR-1 activation by thrombin results in several biologic effects, including platelet adhesion to other cells or extracellular matrix, fibroblast, and endothelial cell growth, whereas PAR-2, activated by trypsin, has mainly a proinflammmatory and angiogenetic role. PAR-1 and PAR-2 modulate cell proliferation in physiopathologic cell invasion processes, suggesting that they may play a role in the setting of cancer growth and metastasis. Here, we have investigated the expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2 proteins by immunohistochemistry in a series of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions: 20 melanocytic lesions (10 common melanocytic nevi and 10 atypical or &quot;dysplastic&quot; melanocytic nevi) and 50 melanomas (10 in situ melanomas, 10 melanomas T1, 10 melanomas T2, 10 melanomas T3 to T4, and 10 metastatic melanomas). PAR-1 was significantly overexpressed in atypical nevi and melanomas in comparison with common melanocytic nevi. PAR-2 was strongly and diffusely expressed by immunohistochemistry in all melanocytic lesions, with no statistically significant differences between nevi and melanomas. Because we found a differential expression in PAR-1 protein, but not in PAR-2, we next investigated the expression of PAR-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) by ribonuclease protection assay in paraffin-embedded tissues using a paraffin block RNA isolation procedure. Similarly to immunohistochemical results, PAR-1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in atypical nevi and melanomas in comparison with common nevi and controls. Overexpression of PAR-1 in atypical nevi and melanomas supports a role for PAR-1 in the initial phases of melanoma development as well as in tumor progression and metastasis. Conversely, the significance of PAR-2 up-regulation in both benign and malignant melanocytic lesions requires further research."

In the hypophyseal pars tuberalis (PT), melatonin is crucial for rhythmic expression of the clock genes mPer1 and mCry1, and melatonin acting in the PT influences prolactin secretion from the pars distalis. To examine further the possibility of a circadian clockwork functioning in the PT, and the impact of melatonin on this tissue, we assessed circadian clock proteins by immunohistochemistry and compared the diurnal expression in the PT of wild type (WT), and MT1 melatonin receptor-deficient (MT1-/-) mice. While in the PT of WT mice mPER1, mPER2, and mCRY1 showed a pronounced rhythm, mCRY2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 were constitutively present. Despite reported differences in maximal levels and timing of mCry1, mPer1, and mPer2 RNAs, the corresponding protein levels peaked simultaneously during late day, suggesting a codependency for their stabilization and/or nuclear entry. MT1-/- mice had reduced levels of mPER1, mCRY1, CLOCK and BMAL1, consistent with the earlier reported reduction in mRNA expression of these clock genes. Surprisingly, mPER2-immunoreaction was constitutively low, although mPer2 was rhythmically expressed in the PT of MT1-/- mice. This suggests that mPER2 is degraded due to the reduced levels of its stabilizing interaction partners mPER1 and mCRY1. The results show that melatonin, acting through the MT1, determines availability of the circadian proteins mPER1, mPER2 and mCRY1 and thus plays a crucial role in regulating rhythmicity in PT cells."

PAR1 expression and localization was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining of prostate specimens with benign prostatic hyperplasia (n=27), early- (n=32) and advanced-stage (n=22) prostate cancer. Association analyses of PAR1 expression with expression of VEGF-family of growth factors, their receptors, and clinicopathological characteristics of the patients were also performed.RESULTS: PAR1 RNA expression in advanced-stage prostate was 2.39-fold higher (P=0.024) and its protein expression was 2.75-fold higher (P=5.89x10(-5)) when compared with early-stage prostate cancer. PAR1 expression was localized to endothelial cells in vascular network of prostate tumor areas. The expression of PAR1 correlated statistically significantly with advanced disease stage (P=0.0006) and pre-operative PSA levels (P=0.005) in these samples.CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that PAR1 expression is increased in prostate cancer.

This neurotrophin has potent affects on dopaminergic neuron survival protecting them from the neurotoxins MPTP and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) commonly used to create animal models of Parkinson's disease and also promoting dopaminergic axonal sprouting. In this study, we demonstrate that an antisense oligonucleotide infusion (200 nM for 28 days) to prevent BDNF production in the substantia nigra of rats mimics many features of the classical animal models of Parkinson's disease. 62% of antisense treated rats rotate (P &lt; or = 0.05) in response to dopaminergic receptor stimulation by apomorphine. 40% of substantia nigra pars compacta tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons are lost (P &lt; or = 0.00001) and dopamine uptake site density measured by (3)H-mazindol autoradiography is reduced by 34% (P &lt; or = 0.005). Loss of haematoxylin and eosin stained nigral neurons is significant (P &lt; or = 0.0001) but less extensive (34%). These observations indicate that loss of BDNF expression leads both to down regulation of the dopaminergic phenotype and to dopaminergic neuronal death. Therefore, reduced BDNF mRNA expression in Parkinson's disease substantia nigra may contribute directly to the death of nigral dopaminergic neurons and the development of Parkinson's disease."

Studies of the pituitary pars tuberalis (PT) suggest that melatonin-regulated clock gene expression is critical to this process. Here, we considered whether clock gene rhythms continue in the PT in the absence of melatonin and whether the effects of melatonin on the expression of these genes are temporally gated. Soay sheep acclimated to long photoperiod (LP) were transferred to constant light for 24 h, suppressing endogenous melatonin secretion. Animals were infused with melatonin at 4-h intervals across the final 24 h, and killed 3 h after infusion. The expression of five clock genes (Per1, Per2, Cry1, Rev-erbalpha, and Bmal1) was measured by in situ hybridization. In sham-treated animals, PT expression of Per1, Per2, and Rev-erbalpha showed pronounced temporal variation despite the absence of melatonin, with peak times occurring earlier than predicted under LP. The time of peak Bmal1 expression remained LP-like, whereas Cry1 expression was continually low. Melatonin infusion induced Cry1 expression at all times and suppressed other genes, but only when they showed high expression in sham-treated animals. Hence, 3 h after melatonin treatment, clock gene profiles were driven to a similar state, irrespective of infusion time. In contrast to the PT, melatonin infusions had no clear effect on clock gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Our results provide the first example of acute sensitivity of multiple clock genes to one endocrine stimulus and suggest that rising melatonin levels may reset circadian rhythms in the PT, independently of previous phase."

They couple to G- proteins and are activated after proteolytic cleavage of the N terminus of the receptor. Evidence is growing that PAR subtype 2 plays a pivotal role in inflammatory airway diseases, such as allergic asthma or bronchitis. However, nothing is known about the effects of PAR-2 on electrolyte transport in the native airways. PAR-2 is expressed in airway epithelial cells, where they are activated by mast cell tryptase, neutrophil proteinase 3, or trypsin. Recent studies produced conflicting results about the functional consequence of PAR-2 stimulation. Here we report that stimulation of PAR-2 receptors in mouse and human airways leads to a change in electrolyte transport and a shift from absorption to secretion. Although PAR-2 appears to be expressed on both sides of the epithelium, only basolateral stimulation results in inhibition of amiloride sensitive Na+ conductance and stimulation of both luminal Cl- channels and basolateral K+ channels. The present data indicate that these changes occur through activation of phospholipase C and increase in intracellular Ca2+, which activates basolateral SK4 K+ channels and luminal Ca2+-dependent Cl- channels. In addition, the present data suggest a PAR-2 mediated release of prostaglandin E2, which may contribute to the secretory response. In conclusion, these results provide further evidence for a role of PAR-2 in inflammatory airway disease: stimulation of these receptors may cause accumulation of airway surface liquid, which, however, may help to flush noxious stimuli away from the affected airways."

Cocaine acts as an indirect agonist of dopamine at the dopamine transporter, resulting in the presence of excess dopamine in the synapse. Since synaptic dopamine can rapidly oxidize to form free radicals, it was hypothesized that exposure to this drug might produce damage in dopaminergic systems such as the substantia nigra pars compacta, damage to which is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. To test this hypothesis we exposed mice both in utero and as adults to cocaine and examined its effects on the nigrostriatal system. We found that exposure to cocaine both in utero or as adults did not affect substantia nigra cell number, but did make these neurons more susceptible to the parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. We also found long-lasting changes in D2 receptor mRNA levels as well as changes in the monoamine transport system and several growth factors.

To determine pathways for the activation of small-conductance, Ca2+-dependent K+ channels in substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons of rats and mice, we studied effects of the selective blocker of small-conductance, Ca2+-dependent K+ channels, apamin (0.01 or 0.3 microM). Apamin diminished the afterhyperpolarization following each action potential and induced burst discharges in substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons. Apamin had a robust effect already at a low (10 nM) concentration consistent with the expression of the SK2 subunit. Afterhyperpolarizations were also reduced by the Ca2+ channel blockers Ni2+ (100 microM) and omega-conotoxin GVIA (1 microM). Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores did not change the afterhyperpolarization. However, we observed outward current pulses that occurred independently from action potentials and were abrogated by apamin. Apart from a faster time course, they shared all properties with spontaneous hyperpolarizations or outward currents that ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores induces in juvenile dopamine neurons. Sensitization of ryanodine receptors by caffeine silenced substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons. This effect was abolished by the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. We conclude that SK2 channels in substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons are activated by Ca2+ influx through at least two types of Ca2+ channels in the membrane and by ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Ryanodine receptors do not amplify small-conductance, Ca2+-dependent K+ channel activation by the Ca2+ influx during a single spike. Yet, ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ release and, thereby, an activation of small-conductance, Ca2+-dependent K+ channels by intracellular Ca2+ are available for excitability modulation in these output neurons of the basal ganglia system."
"15829229";"PARS";"PARS AND RNA";"Brain research";10;2005;"Expression of mRNA for four subtypes of the proteinase-activated receptor in rat dorsal root ganglia.";"Proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) are members of the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors that initiate intracellular signaling by the proteolytic activity of extracellular serine proteases. Three member of this family (PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4) are considered thrombin receptors, whereas PAR-2 is activated by trypsin and tryptase. Recently, activation of PAR-2 signal was identified as a pro-inflammatory factor that mediates peripheral sensitization of nociceptors. Activation of PAR-1 in the periphery is also considered to be a neurogenic mediator of inflammation that is involved in peptide release. Here, we investigated the expression of these four members of PARs in the adult rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) using radioisotope-labeled in situ hybridization histochemistry. We detected mRNA for all subtypes of PARs in the DRG. Histological analysis revealed the specific expression patterns of the PARs. PAR-1, PAR-2, and PAR-3 mRNA was expressed in 29.0+/-4.0%, 16.0+/-3.2%, and 40.9+/-1.3% of DRG neurons, respectively. In contrast, PAR-4 mRNA was mainly observed in non-neuronal cells. A double-labeling study of PARs with NF-200 and alpha calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) also revealed the distinctive expression of PARs mRNA in myelinated or nociceptive neurons. This study shows the precise expression pattern of PARs mRNA in the DRG and indicates that the cells in DRG can receive modulation with different types of proteinase-activated receptors."

This CXC chemokine as well as platelet factor 4 (PF4), which is located genomically at a short distance from the PBP, were previously considered to be specific markers for the megakaryocyte cell lineage. Both chemokines have signaling and antimicrobial activity. In the present studies, transcriptional and expressional regulation of PF4 and related chemokines was studied in human monocytes. As shown by quantitative mRNA analysis, Western blots, radioimmunoprecipitation of cell extracts, and immunofluorescence and quantitatively with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, human monocytes express PF4 in the same order of magnitude as the known, regulated CXC chemokine interleukin (IL)-8. Expression of PF4 is up-regulated at the mRNA and protein level by thrombin and mediated by proteinase-activated receptors (PARs), resulting in a 32- to 128-fold higher mRNA level and leading to an up-to-sixfold increase of the peptide concentration in monocyte culture supernatants. Thrombin and the synthetic ligand of PAR-1 and PAR-2, SFLLRN, also induced comparable increases in the levels of mRNA for PBP, IL-8, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha and increased synthesis of these chemokines as shown by immunofluorescence or a quantitative immunobead-based method. The induction of increased mRNA levels for all chemokines by SFLLRN was unsurpassed by LPS, zymosan, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-1. Activation of monocytes through PARs represents an alternate activation mechanism, independent from IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or other signaling pathways."

In periodontitis, an inflammatory disease triggered by bacterial infection, the production of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is induced not only by various factors derived from the host, such as inflammatory cytokines, but also by bacterial components. In this study we examined the possible enhanced production of HGF produced by human gingival fibroblasts upon stimulation with gingipains. Arginine-specific gingipain (Rgp) caused a marked production of HGF into the supernatant, the induction of HGF expression on the cell surface, and the up-regulation of HGF mRNA expression in a dose-dependent and an enzymatic activity-dependent manner. Because it has been reported that Rgp activated protease-activated receptors (PARs), we examined whether the induction of HGF triggered by Rgps on human gingival fibroblasts occurred through PARs. An RNA interference assay targeted to PAR-1 and PAR-2 mRNA revealed that gingipains-induced secretion of HGF was significantly inhibited by RNA interference targeted to PAR-1 and PAR-2. In addition, the Rgps-mediated HGF induction was completely inhibited by the inhibition of phospholipase C and was clearly inhibited by RNA interference targeted to p65, which is an NF-kappaB component. These results suggest that Rgps activated human gingival fibroblasts to secrete HGF in the inflamed sites and the mechanism(s) involved may actively participate in both inflammatory and reparative processes in periodontal diseases."

Since chronic nicotine administration is known to result in desensitisation-induced upregulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), the present study investigated whether chronic pre-treatment could enhance the response to systemic nicotine and, if so, whether increases in specific nAChR subunit mRNA levels in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) may underlie this effect. In vivo microdialysis studies in male Sprague-Dawley rats revealed that following 4 days pre-treatment with nicotine (0.8 mg kg(-1)s.c.), local intrastriatal nicotine infusion (3 mM) elicited significantly higher dopamine efflux compared to vehicle pre-treated controls (peak release: 1273 +/- 199% basal versus 731 +/- 113% basal), whereas systemic nicotine challenge (0.8 mg kg(-1)s.c.) elicited no response. In contrast, following 8 days pre-treatment with nicotine (0.8 mg kg(-1)s.c.), systemic nicotine challenge (0.8 mg kg(-1)s.c.) now produced significantly higher dopamine efflux than that of vehicle pre-treated controls (147 +/- 30% basal versus 91 +/- 5% basal). Eight days pre-treatment with nicotine also significantly elevated the levels of alpha6 (approximately 55%) and beta3 (approximately 43%) nAChR subunit mRNA in the SNc, suggesting that up-regulation of these nAChR subunit genes in the nigrostriatal tract may contribute to the enhanced nicotine-evoked striatal dopamine release."

The SCN, however, is not the only brain region that expresses these genes. To understand the possible physiological roles of these rhythm-related genes, we examined expression of these genes in different brain regions at various time points in male Sprague--Dawley rats. Using semi quantitativein situ hybridization with 35S-riboprobes to evaluate mRNA levels, the diurnal rhythmicity of rPer1, and rPer2 mRNA levels was found in the SCN, arcuate nucleus, and median eminence/pars tuberalis. Expression patterns of mRNA for rPer1 and rPer2, however, were not similar in these brain regions. The rhythmicity in these brain regions was specific, because it was not observed in the cerebellum or hippocampus. Moreover, diurnal changes in rClock mRNA expression were not detected in any of the brain regions examined. These findings suggest that the different expression patterns observed for rPer1, rPer2, and rClock mRNAs may be attributed to their different physiological roles in these brain regions, and support previous work indicating that circadian rhythms in the brain are widespread."

The purpose of this study was to compare in adult rats with a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion the effects of an acute or chronic (for 3 or 7 days) injection of L-DOPA on mRNA levels encoding for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67) in the striatum and GABA(A) receptor alpha1, beta2 and gamma2 subunits in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNr), by in situ hybridization histochemistry. In addition, immunostaining levels for the alpha1 subunit were examined in the SNr. In agreement with previous studies, we found that L-DOPA administration increased GAD mRNA levels in the striatum of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. However, the magnitude of this effect increased with the number of injections of L-DOPA. On the other hand, we found that 6-OHDA lesions resulted in increases in alpha1, beta2 and gamma2 mRNA levels in the ipsilateral SNr, which were normalized or decreased compared with the contralateral side by the acute or chronic administration of L-DOPA. In addition, alpha1 immunostaining in the SNr was significantly decreased in rats injected for 7 days but not for 3 days or acutely with L-DOPA. Our results demonstrate that a chronic administration of L-DOPA results in a progressive increase in GAD and decrease in GABA(A) receptor expression in the striatum and SNr, respectively. They provide further evidence that behavioral sensitization and dyskinesia induced by a chronic administration of L-DOPA in an experimental model of Parkinson's disease is paralleled by a plasticity of GABA-mediated signaling in the SNr."

While it has been shown that GDNF mRNA is relatively abundant in postnatal striatum, the cellular basis of its expression has been unknown. We therefore used nonradioactive in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to examine the cellular basis of GDNF mRNA and protein expression, respectively, in postnatal striatum and related structures. We found that GDNF mRNA is expressed within medium-sized striatal neurons. Expression in glia was not observed. At the protein level, regionally, GDNF expression in striatum was observed in striosomal patches, as previously described. At a cellular level a few neurons were observed, but they do not account for the striosomal pattern. This pattern is predominantly due to GDNF-positive neuropil. Some of this neuropil arises from tyrosine hydroxylase-positive nigro-striatal dopaminergic afferents. Astrocytic processes do not appear to contribute to the striosomal pattern. GDNF-positive fibers are identified not only within intrinsic striatal neuropil, but also in fibers within the major striatal efferent targets: the globus pallidus, the entopeduncular nucleus, and the SN pars reticulata. We conclude that during normal postnatal development, medium-sized neurons are the principal source of GDNF within the striatum."

Intraneuronal gene expression of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), a metabolic index of neuronal activity, was increased in the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and decreased in frontal cortical areas, but paradoxically unchanged in the striatum, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus and ventrolateral thalamic nucleus. Neither preproenkephalin A nor preprotachykinin mRNA expression, markers of striatal projection neurons, were modified in the denervated striatal area despite 90% loss of dopamine (DA) terminals. Preproenkephalin A mRNA expression was however, decreased in the nondepleted striatal region, suggesting compensatory increase of dopamine tone from those spared areas. A chronic treatment with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethylnyl)-pyridine (MPEP), which alleviated the akinetic disorders produced by the lesion, reversed the lesion-induced variations of COI gene expression, moderately increased this marker in the structures unaffected by the lesion and did not modify the striatal neuropeptides gene expression. These data suggest that the expression of akinetic deficits in early parkinsonism is associated with focused metabolic changes in the cortico-basal ganglia-cortical loop downstream of the striatum and pallidal complex."

We show that challenge of hIPCs or PANC-1 cells with thrombin or trypsin resulted in stimulation of signaling via the inositol-tris-phosphate second messenger pathway leading to rapid, transient increases in cytosolic calcium ion concentration in the majority of the cells. Because we found that hIPCs, PANC-1 cells, human fetal pancreas, and human adult islets express two protease-activated receptors (PARs), PAR-1 and PAR-2, we tested whether the effects of thrombin and trypsin were mediated, at least in part, by these receptors. Peptide agonists that are relatively specific for PAR-1 (SFLLRN-amide) or PAR-2 (SLIGRL-amide) stimulated increases in inositol phosphates and cytosolic calcium ion concentration, and increased the phosphorylation of Rho, a small G-protein associated with cytoskeletal changes affecting cellular morphology and migration. Most importantly, we show that these agonists increased the rate of hIPC aggregation leading to the formation of more viable, smaller ICAs. Our data show that thrombin and trypsin accelerate aggregation, an early stage of hIPC differentiation in vitro, and imply that pancreatic trypsin and thrombin may be involved in islet development in vivo."

We report here that mice with TGF-beta2 haploinsufficiency (TGF-beta2+/-) have subclinical defects in the dopaminergic neurons of their substantia nigra pars compacta. At 6 weeks of age, the TGF-beta2+/- mice had 12% fewer dopaminergic neurons than wild-type littermates. No additional loss of neurons occurred during the next 5 months, although striatal dopamine declined to 70% of normal. The level of 3,4-dihydroxphenylacetic acid was normal in the TGF-beta2+/- mice, indicating that a compensatory mechanism maintains dopamine stimulation of their striatum. The TGF-beta2+/- mice had normal sensitivity to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, despite having reduced levels of monoamine oxidase-B. These results raise the possibility that people with naturally low levels of TGF-beta2 may have less functional reserve in their nigrostriatal pathway, causing them to be at increased risk of developing Parkinson disease."

In search for forkhead genes expressed in specific neural systems, we identified multiple family members. We performed a detailed expression analysis for Foxj2, Foxk1 and the murine orthologue of the human ILF1 gene, which show a remarkable preference for complex cortical structures. In addition, a comprehensive examination of forkhead gene expression in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta, revealed Ilf1 as a novel transcriptional regulator in midbrain dopamine neurons.

In teleosts, feedback regulations largely vary depending on species and physiological stage. In the present study the regulation of FSH and LH expression was investigated in the European eel, a fish of biological and phylogenetical interest as a representative of an early group of teleosts. The eel FSHbeta subunit was cloned, sequenced and together with earlier isolated eel LHbeta and glycoprotein hormone alpha (GPalpha) subunits used to study the differential regulation of LH and FSH. In situ hybridization indicated that FSHbeta and LHbeta are expressed by separate cells of the proximal pars distalis of the adenohypophysis, differently from the situation in mammals. The profiles of LHbeta and FSHbeta subunit expression were compared during experimental ovarian maturation, using dot-blot assays. Expression levels for LHbeta and GPalpha increased throughout ovarian development with a positive correlation between these two subunits. Conversely, FSHbeta mRNA levels decreased. To understand the role of sex steroids in these opposite variations, immature eels were treated with estradiol (E2)and testosterone (T), both steroids being produced in eel ovaries during gonadal development. E2 treatment induced increases in both LHbeta and GPalpha mRNA levels, without any significant effect on FSHbeta. In contrast, T treatment induced a decrease in FSHbeta mRNA levels, without any significant effect on the other subunits. These data demonstrate that steroids exert a differential feedback on eel gonadotropin expression, with an E2-specific positive feedback on LH and a T-specific negative feedback on FSH, leading to an opposite regulation of LH and FSH during ovarian development."

Per2, Bmal1, and Cry1 gene expression was determined by Northern blot analyses using ovine RNA probes in liver collected every 4h for 24h. Liver Per2 and Bmal1, but not Cry1, expression was rhythmic in all treatments. Under long days, peak Per2 expression occurred at end of the night with a similar timing to Bmal1, whereas, under short days the Per2 maximum was in the early night with an inverse pattern to Bmal1. There was a photoperiodxtime interaction for only Per2 (P &lt; 0.001). The 24-h pattern in plasma cortisol matched the observed phasing of Per2 expression, suggesting that it may act as an endocrine entraining factor. The clock gene rhythms in the peripheral tissues were different in timing compared with the ovine suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN, central pacemaker) and pars tuberalis (melatonin target tissue), and the hepatic rhythms were of lower amplitude compared with photoperiodic rodents. Thus, there are likely to be important species differences in the way the central and peripheral clockwork encodes external photoperiod."

In the human capsular bag model, cell growth was assessed by phase microscope inspection of the cell coverage of the posterior capsular surface. In the human lens cell line FHL124, it was assessed by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. Changes in p42/p44 ERK phosphorylation (p-ERK) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) phosphorylation (p-Akt) were monitored by Western blot. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) applied to isolated lens epithelia and ex vivo capsular bag preparations as well as FHL124 cells determined expression of mRNA for the PARs.RESULTS: Brief exposures to thrombin (10 nM) and PAR1-AP (10 microM) induced an increase in cytosolic calcium in both anterior and equatorial lens cells, but activating peptides for PAR2, -3, and -4 failed to produce responses. Repeated exposure to thrombin produced a significant increase in cell coverage in the capsular bag model and increased [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into FHL124 cells. In the latter, exposure to thrombin (10 nM) and PAR1-AP (10 microM) induced biphasic increases in the phosphorylation of p42/p44 (p-ERK), with peak responses at 20 minutes and 12 hours. Thrombin also produced a 20-fold increase in p-Akt at 12 hours compared with the control, whereas PAR1-AP (10 microM) induced a much smaller response. PAR1-AP did not induce a significant increase in [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and PAR2-AP, PAR3-AP, and PAR4-AP failed to reproduce any of the thrombin-stimulated effects. mPAR1 and -3 were expressed in native lens cells, and this expression was conserved in ex vivo capsular bag preparations as well as in FHL124 cells.CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies thrombin receptors coupled to calcium, ERK, and Akt signaling that modulate growth in native lens tissue and cultured cells, and it appears that the PAR1 subtype is mainly responsible. PAR3 mRNA was also detected, but the receptor itself, if present, was not coupled to the above signaling elements."

It displays an exquisite and differential regulation of expression by steroid and thyroid hormones (THs) in different proximal tubule segments. Whereas the pars recta (PR cells) responds to thyroid and sexual hormones, the pars convoluta (PCT cells) represents a truly androgen-dependent compartment because expression occurs only in the presence of androgens and functional androgen receptors. Nevertheless, different hypothyroidism models have indicated that TH might also contribute to the androgenic response in PCT cells. In the present study, we aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms that ultimately control KAP expression in these cells. Using several genetically deficient mouse models and different pharmacologic and hormonal treatments, we determined that thyroid and GH modulate CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha and beta levels that, in turn, control KAP expression in PCT cells in a developmentally dependent manner. We demonstrated that these factors bind to sites in the proximal KAP promoter, thereby collaborating with androgens for full KAP expression. Finally, we propose that TH and GH, acting through CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, may constitute a general regulatory mechanism of androgen-dependent genes in mouse kidney."

A similar phenomenon is observed in humans with Cushing's disease or Nelson's syndrome. The mechanism of the response in humans is not known, but an alteration in receptor expression, selectivity or responsiveness in abnormal corticotropes has been proposed. Horses with PPID, unlike humans, almost exclusively have adenomas of pars intermedia (PI) rather than pars distalis (PD) origin. Therefore, the mechanism responsible for the TRH response observed in horses likely differs. We proposed that TRH directly stimulates the PI in normal and PPID-affected horses to release proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptides. Using alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) as a marker of a PI response and ACTH as a marker of a PD response, we were able to demonstrate a marked increase in plasma concentration of alpha-MSH and a modest, but significant increase in ACTH after TRH treatment in normal horses. The ability of TRH to directly stimulate release of POMC peptides was confirmed using PI and PD tissue explants. The presence of TRH receptor mRNA in PI tissue from both normal and PPID horses was confirmed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We conclude that TRH triggers the release of POMC-derived peptides from the PI through the direct stimulation of TRH receptors normally expressed on melanotropes. The increase in plasma cortisol following TRH in horses with PPID is likely attributable to the release of ACTH from the hyperplastic PI."

We herein determined whether or not sex hormones contribute to this enhancement and the expression of protease-activated receptors (PARs). The nonpregnant rats received daily injections of either 17beta-estradiol or progesterone, and then the contractile response of the myometrium was examined ex vivo. Treatment with either 17beta-estradiol or progesterone had almost no significant enhancing effect on the high K(+)- or oxytocin-induced contraction. On the other hand, both 17beta-estradiol and progesterone dose-dependently enhanced the contractile response to trypsin. A maximal enhancement was obtained at 25 and 40 mg kg weight(-1) day(-1) for 17beta-estradiol and progesterone, respectively. The extent of the enhancement of the trypsin-induced contraction seen in the sex hormone-treated rats in the present study was comparable to that reported in the pregnant rats. However, the contractile response to thrombin and PAR1/PAR2-AP, SFLLRNP was not enhanced either by progesterone or 17beta-estradiol. PAR2-AP and PAR4-AP failed to induce contraction under any conditions. PAR1 mRNA was scarcely detected in the control myometrium by an RT-PCR analysis, while it slightly increased only in the progesterone-treated rats. Neither PAR2 nor PAR4 mRNA was detected. We thus conclude that the responsiveness to trypsin, but not thrombin, is controlled by sex hormones. A novel type of receptor, other than PAR1, PAR2 or PAR4, is suggested to mediate the trypsin-induced contraction as in the case of the pregnant rat myometrium."

Here we used three complementary approaches to assess the seasonal variation of growth hormone (GH) protein and mRNA levels in pituitary glands of acclimatized carp fish. First, a polyclonal antibody raised against an oligopeptide derived from the carp GH sequence was used for immunohistochemistry; second, oligonucleotides specific for GH transcripts were used for in situ hybridization. Specific immunodetection of GH coincides with visualization of GH mRNA in the proximal pars distalis, the specific location of somatotroph cells in carp pituitary gland. Finally, competitive RT-PCR analyses confirmed that GH expression exhibits seasonal cyclical reprogramming with higher levels in summer- than in winter-adapted fish. The expression pattern suggests an important role for GH in the molecular mechanisms underlying the acclimatization process. In parallel, amplification of sequences from the fourth intron and adjacent sites from exons IV and V demonstrates the existence of a new GH gene previously undescribed. The detection of transcripts corresponding to each gene suggests that both GH gene copies are active in the duplicated carp genome and that they are similarly affected by seasonal adaptation."

Neuroserpin is a member of this family. Here, we have characterized neuroserpin in the nonmammalian species Xenopus laevis and found a high degree of aminoacid sequence conservation, especially of the reactive center loop, of the Xenopus protein compared to mammalian and chicken neuroserpin sequences, suggesting a conserved target specificity. Neuroserpin mRNA and protein were expressed throughout Xenopus development, while in the adult frog high mRNA expression was found in neuronal and neuroendocrine tissues, and the reproductive organs, and the neuroserpin protein was detected mainly in brain and pituitary. More specifically, in Xenopus pituitary neuroserpin mRNA was expressed higher in the neurointermediate lobe than in the pars distalis. At the protein level, we detected a 55-kDa neuroserpin protein in the pars nervosa, two neuroserpin proteins of 44- and 50-kDa in the melanotrope cells of the pars intermedia, and a 46-kDa product in the pars distalis. On the basis of its relatively high degree of sequence conservation and its expression pattern, we conclude that Xenopus neuroserpin may play an important physiological role, e.g. as a serine protease inhibitor during development, and for proper neuronal and neuroendocrine cell functioning."

In spite of the high incidence of gastric ulcers in horses, particularly at pars nonglandularis, the presence of gap junctions in the equine stomach has not yet been studied. The objective was to obtain basic data on the distribution of gap junction protein connexin 32 (Cx32) in the different regions of normal equine gastric mucosa. Samples of mucosa were taken from seven horses at cardiac, fundic, and pyloric region and pars nonglandularis. To detect Cx32, immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis were performed. Corresponding mRNA was shown by RT-PCR and localised in tissue sections by in situ hybridisation. Cx32 was found in the glandular regions, whereas it was not detectable in squamous mucosa. Within the glandular epithelium, Cx32 was abundant in surface and foveolar cells and decreased towards the proliferative zone of the glands. These results suggest that gap junctions develop during the maturation of surface cells. Whether the lack of Cx32 at pars nonglandularis contributes to its susceptibility for developing ulcers, has to be further elucidated."

We describe, for the first time to our knowledge, perinuclear inclusion bodies in the midbrain reticular formation and periaqueductal gray in four clinically documented and genetically confirmed DYT1 patients but not in controls. The inclusions were located within cholinergic and other neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus, cuneiform nucleus, and griseum centrale mesencephali and stained positively for ubiquitin, torsinA, and the nuclear envelope protein lamin A/C. No evidence of inclusion body formation was detected in the substantia nigra pars compacta, striatum, hippocampus, or selected regions of the cerebral cortex. We also noted tau/ubiquitin-immunoreactive aggregates in pigmented neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and locus coeruleus in all four DYT1 dystonia cases, but not in controls. This study supports the notion that DYT1 dystonia is associated with impaired protein handling and the nuclear envelope. The role of the pedunculopontine and cuneiform nuclei, and related brainstem brainstem structures, in mediating motor activity and controlling muscle tone suggests that alterations in these structures could underlie the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia [corrected]"

Role of proteinase receptors in stellate cell activation.";"In fibroblasts, thrombin induces collagen deposition through activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor, proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR(1)). In the current study, we examined whether PAR(1) antagonism inhibits hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation in vitro and whether it protects against fibrosis development in a rodent model of cirrhosis. A rat HSC line was used for in vitro studies whereas cirrhosis was induced by bile duct ligation (BDL). The current results demonstrated that HSCs express PAR(1), as well as proteinase-activated receptors 2 (PAR(2)) and 4 (PAR(4)), and that all three PARs were up-regulated in response to exposure to growth factor in vitro. Exposure to thrombin and to SFLLRN-(SF)-NH(2), a PAR(1) agonist, and GYPGKF (GY)-NH(2), a PAR(4) agonist, triggered HSC proliferation and contraction, as well as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) production and collagen I synthesis and release. These effects were inhibited by the PAR(1) antagonist. Administration of this antagonist, 1.5 mg/kg/d, to BDL rats reduced liver type I collagen messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and surface collagen by 63%, as measured by quantitative morphometric analysis. Similarly, hepatic and urinary excretion of hydroxyproline was reduced significantly by the PAR(1) antagonist. In conclusion, PAR(s) regulates HSC activity; development of PAR antagonists might be a feasible therapeutic strategy for protecting against fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases."

The homeobox transcription factors engrailed 1 and engrailed 2 are expressed by this neuronal population from early in development to adulthood. Despite a large mid-hindbrain deletion in double mutants null for both genes, mesencephalic dopaminergic (mDA) neurons are induced, become postmitotic and acquire their neurotransmitter phenotype. However, at birth, no mDA neurons are left. We show that the entire population of these neurons is lost by E14 in the mutant animals, earlier than in any other described genetic model system for Parkinson's disease. This disappearance is caused by apoptosis revealed by the presence of activated caspase 3 in the dying tyrosine hydroxylase-positive mutant cells. Furthermore, using in vitro cell mixing experiments and RNA interference on primary cell culture of ventral midbrain we were able to show that the demise of mDA neurons in the mutant mice is due to a cell-autonomously requirement of the engrailed genes and not a result of the missing mid-hindbrain tissue. Gene silencing in the postmitotic neurons by RNA interference activates caspase 3 and induces apoptosis in less than 24 hours. This rapid induction of cell death in mDA neurons suggests that the engrailed genes participate directly in the regulation of apoptosis, a proposed mechanism for Parkinson's disease."

Though there are rodent data, little is known about its distribution in the human brain. The aim of this study was to ascertain the localization of NRG-1 and its mRNA in multiple regions of the normal adult human brain. We investigated NRG-1 mRNA in 11 subjects using in situ hybridization and northern analysis, and NRG-1 protein in six subjects using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. NRG-1 mRNA was present as bands of approximately 2, 3 and 6 kb. It was clearly detected in the prefrontal cortex (middle laminae), hippocampal formation (except CA1), cerebellum, oculomotor nucleus, superior colliculus, red nucleus and substantia nigra pars compacta. At the cellular level, NRG1 mRNA was abundant in hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons and some interneurons, and in cerebellar Purkinje cells and Golgi cells. NRG-1 protein was detected as bands of approximately 140, 110, 95 and 60 kD. Immunohistochemistry revealed NRG-1 in many cell populations, consistent with the mRNA data, being prominent in pyramidal neurons, Purkinje cells, several brainstem nuclei, and white matter neurons. Moderate NRG-1 immunoreactivity was also observed in cerebellar and dentate gyrus granule cells, and some glia. Within neurons, NRG-1 staining was primarily somatodendritic; in the cell body staining was granular, with clustering close to the plasma and nuclear membranes. There was also labeling of some fiber tracts, and local areas of neuropil (e.g. in the dentate nucleus) suggestive of a pre-synaptic location of NRG-1. The data show a widespread expression of NRG-1 in the adult human brain, including, but not limited to, brain areas and cell populations implicated in schizophrenia. Using these normative data, future studies can ascertain whether the role of NRG-1 in the disease is mediated, or accompanied, via alterations in its expression."

In the present study, we investigated the subunit composition of GABA(A) receptors in DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We isolated DA neurons from the ventral midbrain of transgenic mice that express green fluorescent protein under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene promoter and analyzed expression of various GABA(A) receptor subunits in single cells by using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This analysis showed the presence of the transcripts encoding alpha2, alpha3, alpha4, beta1, beta3 and gamma2 subunits in the isolated DA neurons. Double fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes for TH and GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNAs revealed the expression of these six subunits in the majority of DA neurons in the SNc and the VTA."

SLOB protein exhibits a similar distribution pattern, and we show that it cycles in Drosophila heads, in photoreceptor cells and in neurosecretory cells of the PI. The cycling of SLOB is altered in various clock gene mutants, and SLOB is expressed in ectopic locations in tim01 flies. We also demonstrate that SLOB no longer cycles in the PI neurons of Clkjrk flies, and that SLOB expression is reduced in the PI neurons of flies that lack pigment dispersing factor (PDF), a neuropeptide secreted by clock cells.CONCLUSIONS: These data are consistent with the idea that SLOB may participate in one or more circadian pathways in Drosophila."

Sumatriptan inhibited the miniature EPSC (mEPSC) rate in a dose dependent fashion, with an EC(50) of 250 nM. Sumatriptan (3 microM) inhibited the mEPSC rate by 36%, without altering the mEPSC amplitude. This effect was partially reversed by the 5HT(1D) specific antagonist BRL15572 (10 microM). In contrast, the 5HT(1B) agonist CP93129 (10 microm) did not alter the mEPSC rate. Furthermore, sumatriptan (3 microM) decreased the amplitude of electrically evoked EPSCs (eEPSC) by 40%. After incubating the slices in ketanserin (an antagonist which shows selectivity for 5HT(1D) over 5HT(1B) receptors) sumatriptan had little effect on eEPSC amplitude. In control conditions paired stimuli resulted in paired pulse depression (PPD; the ratio eEPSC(2)/eEPSC(1)=0.7+/-0.01), whilst in the presence of sumatriptan the PPD was blocked (ratio eEPSC(2)/eEPSC(1)=0.9+/-0.1). Sumatriptan produced no post-synaptic membrane current and had no significant effect on membrane conductance over a range of membrane potentials (-60 to -130 mV). RT-PCR experiments revealed the presence of mRNA for both 5HT(1D) and 5HT(1B) receptor subtypes in the trigeminal ganglia and subnucleus caudalis. These data suggest that sumatriptan acts pre-synaptically on trigeminal primary afferent central terminals to reduce the probability of release of glutamate, and that this action is mediated through 5HT(1D) receptors."

The presence and role played by PAR(4) in gastrointestinal functions have not been fully clarified. The aims of this study were: (i) to examine expression of PAR(4) in rat proximal colon; (ii) to determine the mechanical effects induced by PAR(4) activation in longitudinal muscle; and (iii) to characterise the underlying mechanisms.METHODS: PAR(4) expression was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Mechanical activity was recorded as changes in isometric tension.RESULTS: A PCR product corresponding to the predicted size of the PAR(4) signal was amplified from RNA prepared from the colon of rats, showing the presence of PAR(4) in those tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed that PAR(4) protein was expressed on epithelial surfaces and submucosa. PAR(4) activating peptides, GYPGKF-NH(2) and AYPGKG-NH(2), produced concentration dependent contractile effects on longitudinal muscle. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) or atropine significantly reduced the contractile responses to AYPGKG-NH(2), and atropine after TTX did not cause any further reduction. NK(1) receptor antagonist, SR140333, or NK(2) receptor antagonist, SR48968, alone or in combination, produced a reduction in PAR(4) induced contractile effect, and when coadministered with TTX abolished it. Capsaicin markedly reduced the contractions evoked by AYPGKG-NH(2).CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that PAR(4) is functionally expressed in rat colon and its activation induces contraction of the longitudinal muscle both through TTX sensitive release of acetylcholine and release of tachykinins, probably from sensory nerves. These actions may contribute to motility disturbances during intestinal trauma and inflammation."

In the model of focal ischemia, reduced blood flow results in a cascade of pathophysiologic events, including inflammation, excitotoxicity, and platelet activation at the site of injury. One serine protease that is associated closely with and produced in response to central nervous system (CNS) injury is thrombin. Thrombin enters the injury cascade in brain either via a compromised blood-brain barrier or possibly from endogenous prothrombin. Thrombin mediates its action through the protease-activated receptor family (PAR-1, -3, and -4). PARs belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors with a 7-transmembrane domain structure and are activated by proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminus. We showed that thrombin can be neuroprotective or deleterious when present at different concentrations before and during oxygen-glucose deprivation, an in vitro model of ischemia. We examined the change in mRNA expression levels of PAR-1 to 4 as a result of transient focal ischemia in rat brain, induced by microinjection of endothelin near the middle cerebral artery. Using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, after ischemic insult on the ipsilesional side, PAR-1 was found to be downregulated significantly, whereas PAR-2 mRNA levels decreased only moderately. PAR-3 was upregulated transiently and then downregulated, and PAR-4 mRNA levels showed the most striking (2.5-fold) increase 12 hr after ischemia, in the injured side. In the contralateral hemisphere, mRNA expression was also affected, where decreased mRNA levels were observed for PAR-1, -2, and -3, whereas PAR-4 levels were reduced only after 7 days. Taken together, these data suggest involvement of the thrombin receptors PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4 in the pathophysiology of brain ischemia."

In addition, cannabinoid CB1 receptor gene expression was lower in Cg, CPu, VMN and CA3 field of the hippocampus in Fawn Hooded than in Wistar rats.CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that lower cannabinoid function appears to be related to greater vulnerability to alcohol consumption.

"15610187";"PARS";"PARS AND RNA";"Epilepsia";8;2004;"Seizures in the developing brain.";"PURPOSE: Development and sex hormones are important determinants of seizure susceptibility. Seizures develop in the immature brain more readily than in the mature brain. Male children experience a higher incidence of epilepsy or unprovoked seizures than do female children. Sex-specific differences in the development of seizure-suppressing neuronal networks may account, at least in part, for this increased age- and sex-related susceptibility to seizures. The control of seizures can be influenced by the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) in an age- and sex-specific manner. In the adult male rat SNR, two topographically discrete regions (SNRanterior and SNRposterior) mediate distinct effects on seizures, by using divergent output networks in response to localized infusions of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A agents, such as muscimol. The GABAA-sensitive &quot;anticonvulsant&quot; region is located in the SNRanterior, whereas the GABAA-sensitive &quot;proconvulsant region is in the SNRposterior. In immature postnatal day (PN)15-21 male rats, the SNR is not topographically segregated, and GABAAergic drug infusions produce similar effects when applied in the SNRanterior or SNRposterior. Only a GABAA-sensitive proconvulsant network is evident. By contrast, female SNR does not contain any region that mediates muscimol-related proconvulsant effects. As with the adult, immature female rats do not develop a proconvulsant SNR region at any age.METHODS: We measured the effects of SNR muscimol infusions on seizures in male rats castrated at birth to better understand the effects of testosterone on the formation of age- and sex-specific features of the SNR.RESULTS: Neonatal castration permanently alters the maturation of the muscimol-sensitive SNR effect on seizures. The SNR of neonatally castrated rats develops functionally like the &quot;female&quot; SNR. The &quot;proconvulsant&quot; SNR region does not develop in the absence of testosterone in the immediate postnatal period. The &quot;male&quot; type of SNR effects can be induced in neonatally castrated rats by restoration of testosterone levels or in female rats by artificially increasing testosterone levels. Dihydrotestosterone and estrogen, produced by the reduction and aromatization of testosterone, respectively, are the direct mediators of testosterone actions. At PN0, only beta estrogen receptors are equally expressed in the SNRs of males and females and may be responsible for testosterone-mediated effects in both sexes.CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype of SNR GABAergic neurons, as characterized by GABAA-receptor subunit composition, by muscimol-induced electrophysiologic responses, and by connectivity of output networks each may be altered by the presence of testosterone. Higher KCC2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in female PN15 SNR neurons compared with males may be responsible for sex-related differences in muscimol-induced electrophysiologic responses. In summary, a growing body of compelling evidence identifying sex-related differences in the SNR implicates postnatal testosterone as a critical factor in the development of pro- or anticonvulsant circuits. The recognition of sex- and age-related features in the SNR holds the promise that these findings can be translated into the development of specific and effective treatments for seizure disorders."

This activity is critical during inflammation to prevent excessive oedema. Lymphatic pumping is intrinsic to the smooth muscle in the vessel wall and is due to the spontaneous occurrence of action potentials, the pacemaker of which is proposed to be spontaneous transient depolarizations (STDs). This function is highly susceptible to the fluid load and modulated by chemical agents, amongst which inflammatory mediators are important players. Activation of proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) has been involved in inflammation and affects vascular smooth muscle tone. The present study aims to investigate the role of PAR2, a member of the PAR family, in lymphatic vessel pumping. RT-PCR experiments revealed that PAR2 message is present in lymphatic vessels of the guinea-pig mesentery. Agonists of PAR2 such as trypsin and the activating peptide, SLIGRL-NH2, caused a decrease in the contractile activity of intraluminally perfused lymphatic vessels. Moreover, intracellular microelectrode recordings from isolated vessels revealed that PAR2 activation hyperpolarized the lymphatic smooth muscle membrane potential and altered STD amplitude and frequency. The decreases in constriction frequency and STD activity as well as the hyperpolarization were dependent on a functional endothelium, not affected by NO synthase or guanylyl-cyclase inhibition, but mimicked by PGE2 and iloprost and blocked by indomethacin (10 microM) and glibenclamide (1 microM). These results show that PAR2 activation alters guinea-pig lymphatic vessel contractile and electrical activity via the production of endothelium-derived cyclo-oxygenase metabolites."

Intervention against microglial activation may therefore exert a neuroprotective effect. Our previous study has shown that the electro-acupuncture (EA) stimulation at 100 Hz can protect axotomized dopaminergic neurons from degeneration. To explore the underlying mechanism, the effects of 100 Hz EA stimulation on medial forebrain bundle (MFB) axotomy-induced microglial activation were investigated. Complement receptor 3 (CR3) immunohistochemical staining revealed that 24 sessions of 100 Hz EA stimulation (28 days after MFB transection) significantly inhibited the activation of microglia in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) induced by MFB transection. Moreover, 100 Hz EA stimulation obviously inhibited the upregulation of the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta mRNA in the ventral midbrains in MFB-transected rats, as revealed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ED1 immunohistochemical staining showed that a large number of macrophages appeared in the substantia nigra (SN) 14 days after MFB transection. The number of macrophages decreased by 47% in the rats that received 12 sessions of EA simulation after MFB transection. These data indicate that the neuroprotective role of 100 Hz EA stimulation on dopaminergic neurons in MFB-transected rats is likely to be mediated by suppressing axotomy-induced inflammatory responses. Taken together with our previous results, this study suggests that the neuroprotective effect of EA on the dopaminergic neurons may stem from the collaboration of its anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic actions."

Here, we report the result of this experiment and describe the developmental expression pattern in the ventral midbrain of three of the isolated genes, HNF3alpha, synaptotagmin I, and Ebf3. Though not regulated by engrailed-1 and -2, the expression of all three genes is limited to mDA neurons and a few other brain areas. HNF3alpha appears in the precursors of mDA neurons at E9 and is expressed in the adult brain almost exclusively by this neuronal population. Synaptotagmin I is expressed from E14 into adulthood. Ebf3, in contrast, is transiently expressed during early postmitotic differentiation."

With the aim of improving our knowledge about the interaction between the nigrostriatal system of both brain hemispheres, we have studied the response of these three components of the mesostriatal system (GABA, DA/GABA, and DA) to the lesion of the contralateral mesostriatal DA pathway, by using morphological and neurophysiological techniques. Our findings show that, in the side contralateral to the lesion, (1) the number of nigrostriatal GABA cells increases from 6% to 17% with respect to the total number of nigrostriatal cells, (2) the soma of DA/GABA cells becomes immunoreactive for GABA and GAD65, and (3) there is an increase in the firing rate and burst activity of DA-neurons, except in those projecting to the striatum, which may be under the action of the GABA hyperactivity. Taken together, our results suggest that the GABAergic components of the mesostriatal projection play a regulatory role on the DA component, activated or upregulated after contralateral DA lesion and are probably addressed to restoring the functional symmetry in basal ganglia and to slowing down the contralateral progression of DA-cell degeneration in Parkinson's disease."

Elevated intraocular pressure is considered to be a major risk factor in glaucomatous neuropathy. This study aimed to characterize and document a new chronic glaucoma model in the rat with respect to the effect of elevated intraocular pressure on overall retinal dysfunction and retinal ganglion cell loss, and to elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying this cell loss. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured in rats using a Tonopen. RGCs were retrogradely labeled with the fluorescent dye, 4-[didecylaminostyryl]-N-methyl-pyridinium-iodide (4-Di-10 ASP) and quantified on retinal flat mounts using fluorescence microscopy. The optic nerve head was examined fundoscopically. Changes in the histological appearance of the whole eyes was studied in paraffin sections, and immunohistochemistry was carried out on cryostat sections. The levels of mRNA for several genes were compared between control and glaucomatous retinae using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Mutant animals are affected with either a unilateral or bilateral enlargement of the globes having an IOP that ranged from 25 to 45 mmHg, as compared to control values of 12-16 mmHg. The IOP of glaucomatous eyes increased significantly with age to attain a value of 35+/-7.3 at 1.5 years. Concomitant with the rise in IOP, the number of labeled RGCs continued to decrease in number with age. A total of 1887+/-117RGC mm(-2) could be labeled in wild-type control and juvenile mutant pre-glaucomatous retinas, whereas this number dropped to 92+/-26RGC mm(-2) at 1.5 years. Ophthalmoscopy revealed atrophied optic nerve heads in the affected eyes. The pars plicata and the pars plana of the ciliary body of glaucomatous eyes were hypertrophied and elongated, respectively. The anterior chamber was narrow and the irido-corneal angle open in glaucoma eyes. The mRNA of glial-fibrillary-acidic protein, endothelin-1, STAT-3 and STAT-6 increased in the retinas correlating with the severity and duration of the disease. Changes in the expression of GFAP and endothelin-1 could be confirmed using immunohistochemistry. This model may help to address several fundamental issues in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and aid in the development of neuroprotective strategies."

Synthetic peptides based on the proteolytically revealed receptor sequence can selectively activate PAR1 or PAR4 independently of receptor cleavage. However, corresponding peptides for PAR3 have not been identified thus far. Here, we demonstrate that the synthetic peptide TFRGAP representing the 1st six residues of the new amino terminus of PAR3 induced ERK activation in human A-498 carcinoma cells endogeneously expressing PAR1 and PAR3. This effect was completely abolished by single alanine substitution at positions 3, 4 and 6 in the peptide. Since the specific PAR1 antagonist RWJ 56110 completely abolished TFRGAP-induced ERK activation in A-498 cells we speculate that TFRGAP does signal MAPK via interaction with PAR1. This was underlined by experiments on PAR1-/- mouse lung fibroblasts (KOLF cells) that stably overexpress human PAR1 and PAR3, respectively. While TFRGAP was without effect on ERK activation in PAR3+ KOLF cells, it induced MAPK activation in KOLF cells transfected with PAR1. These studies provide evidence that analogues of the PAR3 tethered ligand can mediate cell signaling by interaction with PAR1-type thrombin receptors."

ET-1 is formed by the catalytic action of endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) on big ET-1 and its cellular actions are mediated via ET(A) and ET(B) receptors. Although localisation of these components in rodent brain has been extensively investigated, no single study has mapped their distribution in human brain. Here we describe the localisation of ET-1 mRNA, ET-1, ECE-1, ET(A) and ET(B) receptors within 24 human brain regions. In situ RT-PCR has previously detected ET-1 mRNA in 22 areas (excluding the post-central gyrus and pineal gland), and ET-1 immunoreactivity was visualised in cells of all regions. Using specific antibodies we have immunolocalised ECE-1 and ET(B) receptors in cells of 24 areas, and ET(A) receptors in nine regions (choroidal epithelial cells, neurones in the diencephalon, hippocampus, amygdaloid, dentate nucleus, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, flocculo-nodular lobe and vermis). ET-1 mRNA, ET-1, ECE-1 and ET(B) receptors were observed in cortical pyramidal cells, neurones (brainstem, basal nuclei, thalamus, insula and claustrum, limbic region), cells in the anterior pituitary gland; nerve cell processes in the pars nervosa; pinealocytes and choroidal epithelial cells. Only ET-1 mRNA, ET-1, ECE-1, and ET(B) receptors were visualised in cerebral capillary endothelial cells. The presence of ET-1 mRNA, ECE-1 and ET-1 in 22 brain regions confirms ET expression and processing in human brain. The localisation of ET-1 and ET(B) receptors suggests receptor-mediated action akin to a neurotransmitter role for ET-1."

Melatonin synthesis is driven by rhythmic activation of the rate-limiting enzyme, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT). In ungulates, AA-NAT mRNA is constitutively high throughout the 24-h cycle, and melatonin production is primarily controlled through effects on AA-NAT enzyme activity; this is in contrast to dominant transcriptional control in rodents. To determine whether there has been a selective loss of circadian control of AA-NAT mRNA expression in the sheep pineal, we measured the expression of other genes known to be rhythmic in rodents (inducible cAMP early repressor ICER, the circadian clock genes Period1 and Cryptochrome1, as well as AA-NAT). We first assayed gene expression in pineal glands collected from Soay sheep adapted to short days (Light: dark, 8-h: 16-h), and killed at 4-h intervals through 24-h. We found no evidence for rhythmic expression of ICER, AA-NAT or Cryptochrome1 under these conditions, whilst Period1 showed a low amplitude rhythm of expression, with higher values during the dark period. In a second group of animals, lights out was delayed by 8-h during the final 24-h sampling period, a manipulation that causes an immediate shortening of the period of melatonin secretion. This did not significantly affect the expression of ICER, AA-NAT or Cryptochrome1 in the pineal, whilst a slight suppressive effect on overall Per1 levels was observed. The attenuated response to photoperiod change appears to be specific to the ovine pineal, as the first long day induced rapid changes of Period1 and ICER expression in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei and pituitary pars tuberalis, respectively. Overall, our data suggest a general reduction of circadian control of transcript abundance in the ovine pineal gland, consistent with a marked evolutionary divergence in the mechanism regulating melatonin production between terrestrial ruminants and fossorial rodents."

A third, PAR3, is preferentially expressed by tissues of hematopoietic origin and megakaryocytes. Although PAR3 is also a thrombin substrate, its low-level expression on human platelets suggests a function distinct from that of PAR1, the major receptor involved in thrombin-mediated platelet activation. We studied the expression of PARs during megakaryocyte differentiation of human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells in order to determine the role of PAR3 in megakaryocytopoiesis.METHODS: HEL cells exposed to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce megakaryocyte differentiation were examined by light microscopy and flow cytometry (DNA ploidy, surface expression of PAR1, PAR3, GPIIb-IIIa). Northern blot, RT-PCR, and quantitative RT-PCR were used to evaluate the expression of PARs 1, 3, and 4 mRNA. HEL cells were also exposed to thrombin and thrombopoietin (TPO).RESULTS: In baseline studies, unstimulated HEL cells were found to express comparable levels of PAR1 and PAR3 by Northern blot. Minimal expression of PAR4 was detected by RT-PCR, but not by Northern analysis. Exposure to PMA, but not thrombin or TPO, resulted in megakaryocytic differentiation as evident by increased cell size and nuclear complexity, increased ploidy, and enhanced expression of GPIIb-IIIa, a specific marker of megakaryocytes/platelets. PMA-stimulated HEL cells showed enhanced PAR3 cell-surface expression (approximately threefold increase by day 2) by flow cytometry. In contrast, there was no change in cell-surface PAR1 expression. Northern blot analysis (approximately 10-fold) and quantitative RT-PCR (approximately threefold) confirmed the upregulation of PAR3 mRNA expression (by 24 hours) in cells exposed to PMA. This did not occur with exposure to TPO.CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate increased expression of PAR3 mRNA and protein in HEL cells undergoing megakaryocytic maturation following PMA exposure, suggesting a developmental role for PAR3. Furthermore, regulation of PAR3 expression appears to be specifically coupled to the protein kinase C system, but independent of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway."

We have previously shown that platelet basic protein (PBP), which gives rise to several antimicrobial peptides of platelets, is also expressed in human monocytes. In the present studies, we show that exposure of human monocytes to bacteria or microbial components (lipopolysaccharide and zymosan) induces a several-fold greater expression of derivates of PBP. Also, activation of proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) by thrombin or the synthetic peptide ligand SFLLRN of PAR-1 significantly increased PBP expression, presumably on the transcriptional level, as evidenced by higher mRNA levels. Derivates of PBP appeared to reach phago-lysosomes, as higher concentration was found in latex phagosomes isolated by a flotation method. By the gel-overlay technique, two bactericidal derivatives of PBP could be visualized, which were immunoreactive with anti-PBP antibody in Western blots. By matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight and surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization techniques, it was confirmed that the bands corresponded to PBP derivates. After immunofixation with a monoclonal antibody to PBP, the major peptide in zymosan-stimulated monocytes was identified to correspond by molecular weight to connective tissue-activating peptide III, which has been reported to be a major antimicrobial PBP derivate also in platelets. Our observations indicate that PBP and its derivates are constituents of the antimicrobial arsenal of human monocytes. Their increased expression after exposure to microorganisms allows a rapid host response to pathogens."

The aim of this study was to identify the high-affinity melatonin-receptor subtypes expressed in this structure. To achieve this, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and developed in situ hybridization techniques (ISH). By using RT-PCR, we detected a band corresponding to the MTNR1A melatonin-receptor cDNA in the PMH as well as in the pars tuberalis (PT). On the opposite, MTNR1B melatonin-receptor transcripts were not detected using degenerate primers in any of the structures considered, confirming the lack of expression of this receptor subtype in sheep. The expression of MTNR1A mRNA was further confirmed in the PMH by ISH with a 35S-labeled ovine MTNR1A riboprobe. We next investigated the variation in the expression of MTNR1A mRNA between the end of the day and the end of the night (absence and presence of melatonin, respectively). MTNR1A transcript expression was greater at the end of the night than at the end of the day in the PMH. In contrast, MTNR1A mRNA expression was lower at the end of the night than at the end of the day in the PT. No significant variation in the MTNR1A mRNA expression was observed in a more dorsal hypothalamic area. Overall, these results show that MTNR1A transcripts are expressed in the ovine PMH and that their expression follows a diurnal rhythm, which is different from the pattern of expression observed in the PT."

Increased expression of COX-2 has been shown in injured or degenerated neurons, thus suggesting that COX-2 may contribute to neuronal damage. In this study, we present the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA and protein in striatum following 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration to mice. MPTP causes an acute damage of dopaminergic neurons especially in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, thus diminishing dopamine (DA) content in striatum and decreasing the number of dopaminergic cells in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SN). C57Bl mice have received 60 mg/kg of MPTP introperitoneally. A group of mice received also rofecoxib 10 mg/kg from the 1st day following MPTP administration. Dopamine content in striatum (high-performance liquid chromatography-HPLC), mRNA expression of COX-1 and -2 (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique-RT-PCR), COX-1 and -2 protein content (immunoblotting) have been measured on day 1st, 3rd, 7th, 14th and 21st after the injury. We have found that COX-1 mRNA expression is not changed following MPTP administration, but COX-2 gene and protein expression in striatum increases from the 3rd to the 7th and 14th days, and diminishes on the 21st day. Production of prostaglandins is augmented only briefly after MPTP treatment and did not correlate with increased COX-2 mRNA and COX-2 protein production. Thus, the increase of COX-2 expression does not follow the acute stage of cell death but rather the recovery period after the injury. We also demonstrate that COX-2 activity inhibition by rofecoxib (10 mg/kg), which has been started 1 day after the injury, has not neuroprotective effect. Our study suggests that COX-2 does not contribute to neurons death following MPTP administration and that the inhibition of COX-2 activity is not beneficial to neurons injured by MPTP. However, COX-2 mRNA and protein expressions increase after MPTP injury; the role of these findings remains obscure."

These hormones affect behavior controlling circuits on both the gross morphological and ultrastructural levels. Here we study whether the expression of genes coding for synaptic proteins is sensitive to gonadal steroid hormones and whether such altered expression coincides with changes in brain area size. We treated adult male zebra finches with the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole, to reduce estrogen synthesis and analyzed the mRNA expression of the synaptic proteins synaptoporin (SPO) and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDa (SNAP-25) in song control areas and surrounding tissues of adult male zebra finches. SPO and SNAP-25 are differently expressed throughout the song system. Generally, the telencephalic song nuclei expressed SNAP-25 at high intensity whereas SPO expression was area-specific. Elevated levels of SNAP-25 mRNA were present in the nucleus hyperstriatalis ventrale pars caudale (HVC) and in the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA). SPO mRNA was found in moderate levels in the HVC, in low levels in the lateral nucleus magnocellularis (lMAN) and Area X, and was absent in the RA. The treatment significantly increased the mRNA level of SPO in the HVC, whereas SNAP-25 expression level was not affected. These expression patterns are not explained by the decrease of HVC volume after treatment. The decreased HVC size is not area-specific but correlates with an overall reduction in size and an overall increase in cell density of the forebrain."

We examined the metabolic effects of acute partial physiological leptin restoration in STZ-diabetic rats by using subcutaneous osmotic mini pumps. Groups: (1) Rats infused with vehicle (DV); (2) rats infused with recombinant murine methionine leptin (DL) at 4.5 microg . (kg body weight . d)(-1); (3)pair-fed rats (DP) given a food ration matching that consumed by the DL group. A fourth group of nondiabetic, normal (N) rats was also studied to assess normal metabolic efficiency, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity and sympathoadrenal activity. Following leptin infusion, food consumption by DL rats was significantly lower than in DV rats. Paradoxically, despite a similar food intake to that of the DP group, which demonstrated a 40% reduction in body mass, DL rats increased their initial body weight by approximately 20% (P &lt; .05). Plasma corticosterone and ACTH concentrations were elevated by 2-fold to 3-fold in DL versus N, DP, and DV rats. In the pars distalis, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA levels were significantly higher in DL and DP rats compared with N and DV rats. Our results suggest that partial restoration of physiologic leptin: (1) successfully reduces hyperphagia while allowing body weight gain in STZ-diabetic rats; (2) increases corticosterone levels in STZ-diabetic rats, which may in turn counteract the anorexic effects of diabetes; and (3) is associated with increased pituitary GR mRNA levels, despite elevated corticosterone levels, suggesting that leptin may interfere with the negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis."

Based on studies revealing anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties of poly (ADP)-ribose synthetase (PARS) inhibitors, we hypothesized that their administration would be protective in a heterotopic model of experimental OB.METHODS: We transplanted rat tracheas from Brown-Norway donors into Lewis recipients, and treated 2 groups with a novel PARS inhibitor, INO-1001. One group received 14 days of treatment, whereas a second received delayed treatment beginning on Day 7 post-transplant. Tracheas were analyzed by light microscopy and computerized morphometry. Effects on cytokine transcription, nuclear transcription factor activation and cellular death were assessed by in situ hybridization for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), electromobility shift assays for nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays, respectively.RESULTS: PARS inhibition significantly decreased luminal obstruction (p &lt; 0.001) and enhanced preservation of epithelial lining (p &lt; 0.001) at 14 days post-transplant. Day 7 controls confirmed the development of an obstructive lesion in the lumen, averaging 28% occlusion. Delayed treatment (beginning on Day 7) arrested (p &lt; 0.001) progression of the established lesion. Allograft airways treated with INO-1001 demonstrated attenuated NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, reduced transcription of TNF-alpha mRNA, and decreased cellular death on TUNEL and caspase 3 staining.CONCLUSIONS: PARS inhibition is anti-inflammatory, protects against experimental OB, and is associated with enhanced preservation of respiratory epithelium and decreased cellular death. Delayed treatment with INO-1001 arrests progression of the lesion developed by Day 7. These studies suggest that activation of PARS plays a critical role in the development of airway obliterative disease."

These findings led us to hypothesize that SgII is involved in reproduction and is physiologically regulated. We investigated the effects of different sex steroids on pituitary SgII expression throughout the seasonal reproductive cycle of the female goldfish, as well as the effects of GnRH and testosterone on pituitary LHbeta subunit, GH, and SgII expression in sexually recrudescent female fish using northern blot analysis. We demonstrated that SgII expression levels vary seasonally, with levels being highest in winter and lowest in spring. Sex steroids did not alter SgII expression at any of the time periods studied. In sexually mature goldfish, injection of a GnRH agonist stimulated the expression of LHbeta and SgII specifically in the pars distalis but not the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary. Although testosterone alone did not alter the expression of either of these genes, it did abolish the stimulatory effects of GnRH on both LHbeta and SgII expression. This represents the first study where testosterone is shown to modulate SgII expression in the pituitary."

Distinct diurnal rhythms were found for alpha-subunit mRNA expression in both species. In the hamster PT, alpha-subunit mRNA levels gradually increased during the dark phase; the diurnal peak was found at time (ZT) 21. The lowest value was obtained at ZT 5 during the day. In the chicken PT, alpha-subunit mRNA levels were maintained at a low constant level at night between ZT 13 and 21. Thus, alpha-subunit mRNA expression in the PT depends on the light-dark cycle and may be controlled by the pineal hormone melatonin. The effect of various photoperiods on the hamster PT was examined by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. In hamsters kept under short photoperiod (L/D=8 h:16 h) or complete darkness, a dramatic decrease of alpha-subunit mRNA level was induced, and the PT-specific cells accumulated glycogen-like particles and enlarged secretory granules. Under long photoperiods (L/D=16 h:8 h), however, the alpha-subunit mRNA level was elevated and the PT-specific cells exhibited highly active features, i.e., piles of lamellar cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum and well-developed Golgi complexes. The alpha-subunit synthesized by the PT-specific cells may therefore participate in the circadian and seasonal regulation of endocrine activities."

The specific brain nuclei that express galanin mRNA are the area ventralis telencephali pars ventralis, nucleus preopticus periventricularis, nucleus lateralis tuberis, and the nucleus recessus lateralis. No changes in preprandial preprogalanin mRNA expression were found in the brain regions studied. No changes in postprandial preprogalanin mRNA expression were found compared to the preprandial levels. However, in unfed fish, a significant increase in preprogalanin mRNA expression was found in the telencephalon (1 and 3 h) and hypothalamus (3 h) after the scheduled feeding time. The postprandial preprogalanin mRNA expression in the telencephalon and hypothalamus of fed fish at 1 and 3 h were significantly lower than the mRNA expression levels in the unfed fish at the same time. Preprogalanin mRNA expression levels remain unaltered during 7 days of starvation. The presence of preprogalanin mRNA in brain nuclei involved in the regulation of food intake and pituitary hormone secretion suggests important physiological roles for galanin in goldfish."

The expression sites of this GnRH-R were studied in the brain and pituitary of sea bass by means of in situ hybridization. A quantitative analysis of the expression of the GnRH-R gene along the reproductive cycle was also performed. The GnRH-R brain expression was especially relevant in the ventral telencephalon and rostral preoptic area. Some GnRH-R messenger-expressing cells were also evident in the dorsal telencephalon, caudal preoptic area, ventral thalamus, and periventricular hypothalamus. A conspicuous and specific GnRH-R expression was detected in the pineal gland. The highest expression of the GnRH-R gene was observed in the proximal pars distalis of the pituitary. This expression was evident in all LH cells and some FSH cells but not in somatotrophs. In the pituitary, the quantitative analysis revealed a higher expression of GnRH-R gene during late vitellogenesis in comparison with maturation, spawning, and postspawning/resting periods. However, in the brain, the highest GnRH-R expression was evident at spawning or postspawning/ resting periods. These results suggest that the expression of this GnRH-R is regulated in a different manner in the brain and the pituitary of sea bass."

We have examined the molecular responses of CNS neurons induced to regenerate axons by tibial nerve grafting to the neostriatum of adult rats. Brain sections were probed for mRNAs for the transcription factor c-jun, and the cell recognition molecule CHL1, or immunoreacted for TrkA or p75, 1 day to 29 weeks after grafting (dpo; wpo). In unoperated rats, scattered neurons throughout the neostriatum showed weak signals for CHL1 mRNA and slightly stronger signals for c-jun mRNA. Cells of similar appearance strongly expressed TrkA but possessed little p75. By 1 dpo, many neostriatal neurons of various sizes and GFAP + glial cells near the host/graft interface had upregulated CHL1 mRNA, c-jun mRNA and p75. Most of the larger (20-25 microm diameter) CHL1 mRNA+ cells were also TrkA+, indicating that they were NGF-sensitive cholinergic interneurons. From two weeks postgrafting, high levels of CHL1 and c-jun mRNAs and p75 in the neostriatum were confined to a few presumptive cholinergic interneurons; p75+ cells were also TrkA+ and were larger than TrkA+ neurons on the contralateral side. Retrograde labelling showed that most p75+ and some TrkA+ neurons regenerated axons through the graft. Neurons in the SNpc showed a moderate to strong signal for CHL1 mRNA, weaker signal for c-jun mRNA, and no p75 or TrkA. Some SNpc cells upregulated c-jun mRNA after graft implantation, although they did not upregulate CHL1 mRNA, p75 or TrkA. Since neostriatal neurons which regenerate axons into grafts express receptors for NGF, and grafts mimic the effects of NGF treatment on these cells, sensitivity to graft-derived NGF may be a determinant of their high regenerative capacity. The finding that c-jun and CHL1 are consistently expressed by CNS neurons induced to regenerate their axons strongly supports the idea that these molecules are directly involved in axonal regeneration."

To increase our understanding of the occurrence and regulation of SNAP-25 isoforms, we identified and characterized SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b mRNAs in the pituitary gland and brain of the amphibian Xenopus laevis. The proteins are strongly conserved and are resistant to botulinum neurotoxin A but not to botulinum neurotoxin E, as shown by Western blotting. The spatial distribution of the two SNAP-25 isoforms was assessed with in situ hybridization. Both SNAP-25a mRNA and SNAP-25b mRNA reside in cells in the pituitary distal lobe and, particularly, in the endocrine melanotrope cells in the pituitary intermediate lobe. The melanotrope cells are involved in the background adaptation process of the skin by releasing alpha-melanophore-stimulating hormone. Quantitation of the respective in situ hybridization signals in the Xenopus pars intermedia indicated a differential response, SNAP-25b mRNA being more highly expressed in black-adapted animals than SNAP-25a mRNA, and more than in white-adapted toads. This differential upregulation was also studied by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, showing that in the intermediate pituitary lobe, both isoforms are physiologically controlled by the background light intensity stimulus, but with different intensities; in black-adapted animals SNAP-25b mRNA is upregulated by 3.33 times compared with white-adapted animals, but SNAP-25a only by 1.96 times. As to neural tissue, in situ hybridization showed that both isoforms coexist throughout the brain, sometimes with similar strengths, but in various areas either SNAP-25a mRNA or SNAP-25b mRNA expression is prevalent. It is speculated that each of the SNAP-25 isoforms in the Xenopus pituitary and brain has a distinct function in cellular fusion processes including secretion, and that their occurrence and regulation depend on the type of secreted neurotransmitter/hormone and/or the activity state of the cell."

In the present study, unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats received chronic intermittent treatment with the adenosine A(2A) antagonist SCH58261 (5 mg/kg) plus l-DOPA (3 mg/kg) or l-DOPA (6 mg/kg) alone, at doses producing the same intensity of contralateral turning on first administration. Three days after discontinuation of treatments, GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) mRNA was evaluated at cellular level in the globus pallidus (GP) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) by in situ hybridization. 6-OHDA lesion significantly increased GAD67 mRNA levels in both the GP and SNr ipsilateral to the lesion. Chronic l-DOPA (6 mg/kg), in contrast to SCH58261 plus l-DOPA (3 mg/kg), produced a sensitized contralateral turning indicative of dyskinetic potential and further increased GAD67 mRNA in the GP. In the SNr, a significant decrease in GAD67 mRNA was observed after either treatments. However, while l-DOPA (6 mg/kg) decreased SNr GAD67 mRNA below the intact side, SCH58261 plus l-DOPA (3 mg/kg) brought GAD67 mRNA to the same level of the intact SNr. l-DOPA (3 mg/kg) or SCH58261 (5 mg/kg) alone failed to modify GAD67 mRNA. Results suggest that an increase in GAD67 mRNA in GP and a decrease in SNr might underlie dyskinetic movements induced by chronic l-DOPA. In contrast, the lack of GAD67 mRNA changes in the GP and a less marked inhibition of SNr might correlate with the absence of dyskinetic potential observed after SCH58261 plus l-DOPA."

Activators of these receptors are present in blood, and can enter the brain during central nervous system (CNS) injury. Reactive astrogliosis, a prominent component of CNS injury with potentially harmful consequences, may involve proliferation of astrocytes. In this study, we have examined the expression and activation of protease activated receptors (PARs), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors on murine astrocytes. We show that activation of these three receptor classes can lead to astrogliosis in vivo and proliferation of astrocytes in vitro. Cultured murine cortical astrocytes express mRNA for multiple receptor subtypes of PAR (PAR-1-4), LPA (LPA-1-3) and S1P (S1P-1, -3, -4, and -5) receptors. Comparison of the intracellular signaling pathways of glial PAR-1, LPA, and S1P receptors indicates that each receptor class activates multiple downstream signaling pathways, including Gq/11-directed inositol lipid/Ca2+ signaling, Gi/o activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and stress activated protein kinase/c-jun N-terminal kinase, but not p38), and activation of Rho pathways. Furthermore, activation of these different receptor classes can differentially regulate two transcription factor pathways, serum response element and nuclear factor of activated T cells. Blockade of Gi/o signaling with pertussis toxin, MAPK activation with 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophynyltio)butadiene (U0126), or Rho kinase signaling with R-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexane carboxamide (Y27632) can markedly reduce the proliferative response of glial cells to PAR-1, LPA, or S1P receptor activation, suggesting that each of these pathways is important in coupling of receptor activation to glial proliferation."

In the present study, we used electrophysiological and biochemical techniques to investigate the function and the endogenous stimulation of VR1 in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The VR1 agonist capsaicin increased the frequency of both TTX-sensitive and -insensitive spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) without affecting their amplitude, suggesting a presynaptic site of action. In contrast, no effect was detected with regard to GABAergic transmission. No increase in sEPSC frequency was observed in the presence of cadmium chloride, while the voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonist omega-conotoxin MVIIC did not prevent capsaicin action. The VR1 antagonists capsazepine and iodoresiniferatoxin (IRTX) blocked the effects of capsaicin. Importantly, IRTX per se reduced sEPSC frequency, suggesting a tonic activity of VR1. The endogenous VR1 agonist anandamide (AEA) produced an IRTX-sensitive increase in the frequency of sEPSCs on dopaminergic neurons that was more pronounced when protein kinase A had been activated. Furthermore, mass spectrometric analyses and binding experiments revealed high levels of endogenous AEA and specific binding of AEA to VR1 receptors in the SNc. These data suggest a tonic facilitation of glutamate release exerted by VR1 in the SNc through a stimulation of VR1 by endovanilloids, including anandamide. The increase in sEPSC frequency by VR1 onto midbrain dopaminergic neurons suggests the involvement of these receptors in motor and cognitive functions involving the dopaminergic system."

Among the many components of this reaction, cytokines have been proposed as candidates to mediate neurodegenerative or neuroprotective effects. We investigated the interleukin-1 system and tumour necrosis factor-alpha mRNA and protein levels at different time intervals in the subacute intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of PD, in parallel with the inflammatory response. Immunohistochemistry showed that microglial cells were activated from days 6-30 postlesion in the substantia nigra pars compacta. This microglial activation was accompanied by an atypical proinflammatory cytokine production: Interleukin-1alpha and beta mRNAs were found to be elevated 30 days post-6-hydroxydopamine injection (2- and 16-fold, respectively), but no induction for interleukin-1alpha or beta at the protein level was detected by ELISA. As a control, a classical proinflammatory stimulus, namely endotoxin, was capable of inducing these cytokines at similar mRNA levels but also at the protein level. In addition, tumour necrosis factor-alpha mRNA was hardly or not detected in the substantia nigra at any time point studied. Our data point out a tight control of key proinflammatory cytokine production in our model of PD. This work supports the notion that chronic neuronal death per se does not induce secretion of these proinflammatory cytokines but that an additional stimulus is necessary to stimulate proinflammatory cytokine production. The production of proinflammatory cytokines from &quot;primed&quot; microglia may in turn modulate disease progression as has been recently proposed in a model of prion disease."

In the nervous system, SDF-1/CXCL12 is crucial for neuronal guidance in developing brain, intercellular communication and the neuropathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. However, cerebral functions of SDF-1/CXCL12 in adult brain are poorly understood. The understanding of its role in the adult brain needs a detailed neuroanatomical mapping of SDF-1/CXCL12. By dual immunohistochemistry we demonstrate that this chemokine is constitutively expressed not only in astrocytes and microglia but also in neurons, in discrete neuroanatomical regions. Indeed, neuronal expression of SDF-1/CXCL12 is mainly found in cerebral cortex, substantia innominata, globus pallidus, hippocampus, paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra and oculomotor nuclei. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that SDF-1/CXCL12 is constitutively expressed in cholinergic neurons in the medial septum and substantia innominata and in dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area. Interestingly we also show, for the first time, a selective co-localization of SDF-1/CXCL12 with vasopressin-expressing neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei. In addition, in the lateral hypothalamic area, SDF-1/CXCL12 was found to be located on melanin concentrating hormone-expressing neurons. Altogether, these original data suggest that SDF-1/CXCL12 could be a modulatory neuropeptide regulating both central cholinergic and dopaminergic systems. In addition, a key role for SDF-1/CXCL12 in neuroendocrine regulation of vasopressin-expressing neurons represents an exciting new field of research."

Understanding the regulation of enzymes involved in DA metabolism may therefore lead to new treatment strategies for these severe conditions. We investigated mRNA expression of the cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1), presumably involved in DA degradation, by in situ hybridization in DA neurons of human postmortem material. Parallel labeling for GAPDH, neuron-specific enolase, tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase was used to ensure suitability of tissue specimen and to identify all dopamine neurons. ALDH1 was found to be expressed highly and specifically in DA cells of both substantia nigra (SN) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of controls. A marked reduction of ALDH1 expression was seen in surviving neurons of SN pars compacta but not of those in the VTA in Parkinson's disease. In patients suffering from schizophrenia we found ALDH1 expression at normal levels in DA cells of SN but at significantly reduced levels in those of the VTA. We conclude that ALDH1 is strongly and specifically expressed in human mesencephalic dopamine neurons and that low levels of ALDH1 expression correlate with DA neuron dysfunction in the two investigated human conditions."

The SCN, however, is not the only brain region that expresses these genes. To understand the distributions and possible physiological roles of these rhythm-related genes, we examined the gene expressions of rPer1, rPer2, and rClock in different brain regions by serial coronal, sagittal, and horizontal brain sections in Sprague-Dawley male rats. Animals were housed in a light-controlled room (lights on from 0600 to 1800 h) and killed at 1000 or 1200 h, which corresponds to Zeitgeber time 4 or 6. Semi-quantitative in situ hybridization with (35)S-riboprobes was used to evaluate mRNA levels. The mRNAs of rPer1, rPer2, and rClock were widely distributed in the rat CNS, including the olfactory bulb, cortex, piriform cortex, SCN, ventromedial hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus, hippocampus, mammillary nucleus, pontine nucleus, superior and inferior colliculus, cerebellum, median eminence/pars tuberalis, pineal gland, and pituitary. The expression patterns of mRNAs for rPer1 and rPer2 were almost identical. In contrast, different expression patterns were observed between rClock and rPer1 or rPer2 in several brain regions, including the hypothalamic supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei, the paraventricular zone of the caudate putamen, the superior olivary nucleus, and anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary. These findings suggest that the different expression patterns observed for rPer1, rPer2, and rClock might be due to their different physiological role(s) in those brain regions."

Therefore, neurotrophic factors for dopaminergic neurons are of substantial clinical interest. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-20 preferentially expressed in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC) of the rat brain significantly enhanced the survival of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Here we examined the mechanism of action of FGF-20 on dopaminergic neurons. FGF-20 slightly enhanced the survival of total neurons of the midbrain, indicating that it preferentially enhanced the survival of dopaminergic neurons. FGF receptor (FGFR)-1c was found to be expressed abundantly in dopaminergic neurons in the SNPC but at much lower levels in neurons of other midbrain regions by in situ hybridization. FGF-20 was also found to bind FGFR-1c with high affinity with the BIAcore system. Furthermore, FGF-20 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is the major intracellular signaling pathway of FGFs. Both the FGFR-1 inhibitor SU5402 and the MAPK pathway inhibitor PD98059 also significantly inhibited the activation of the MAPK pathway by FGF-20 and the neurotrophic activity of FGF-20. The present findings indicate that the activation of the MAPK pathway by FGF-20 signaling through FGFR-1c plays important roles in the survival of dopaminergic neurons in the SNPC."

Microinfusions of muscimol (a GABA(A) receptor agonist) produce specific effects on seizures depending on sex, infusion site (SNR(anterior) or SNR(posterior)) and age. To assess whether these effects are due to sex differences in GABAergic indices within the SNR we analyzed the expression of alpha(1) subunit mRNA of the GABA(A) receptor and the levels of GABA immunoreactivity (IR) of male and female rats at postnatal day 15 (PN15) and PN30. In each age, within the same SNR region, expression of alpha(1) subunit mRNA and intensity of GABA IR per neuron was higher in females compared to males. At PN15, in both sexes, there were no regional differences in expression of alpha(1) subunit mRNA and intensity of GABA IR. However, at PN30 in both sexes, expression of alpha(1) subunit mRNA and intensity of GABA IR per cell was higher in SNR(anterior) than in SNR(posterior). These results demonstrate that expression of alpha(1) subunit mRNA for GABA(A) receptor and levels of GABA IR in the SNR are sex- and site-specific, which may contribute to sex-, regional- and age-related differences in the expression of movement disorders and seizures."

The neural mechanisms underlying treatment-related dyskinesias may involve underactivity of the output regions of the basal ganglia, i.e., the medial segment of the globus pallidus (GPm) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR). Increased activity of GABAergic neurons of the &quot;direct&quot; striatopallidal pathway has been implicated in the suppression of the GPm and SNR and thus the development of dyskinesia. The direct pathway uses opioids as a co-neurotransmitter. These opioid peptides are products of the high-molecular weight opioid precursor pre-proenkephalin B (PPE-B). In situ hybridisation studies were employed to investigate PPE-B mRNA expression in postmortem striatal tissue from patients with a clinicopathological diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, all of whom displayed levodopa-induced motor complications, including dyskinesia prior to death and in the caudate-putamen (striatum) of the MPTP-lesioned macaque model of Parkinson's disease with treatment-related dyskinesia. Striatal PPE-B mRNA expression was significantly increased by 172% in dyskinetic Parkinson's disease patients compared to age-matched controls. This increase was heterogeneous with increased expression within the striosomes compared to matrix compartments of the striatum. Striatal PPE-B mRNA expression was significantly increased by 185% in the MPTP-lesioned macaque exhibiting dyskinesia, compared to parkinsonian, nondyskinetic MPTP-lesioned macaques, and by 146% compared to non-parkinsonian, nondyskinetic controls. Increased PPE-B mRNA expression, with subsequent elevations in opioid peptide transmission within the direct striatal output pathways, may underlie treatment-related dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease."

Here, we report that rats with partial bilateral dopamine lesions exhibit akinetic deficits associated with dramatically increased neuronal metabolic activity in selective structures of the basal ganglia such as the subthalamic nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata, but not in the entopeduncular nucleus. Furthermore, chronic treatment with the mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethylnyl)-pyridine alleviated the akinesia and was associated with a normalization of the activity of these two overactive structures.

These genes are not only expressed in the master circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) but also in many peripheral tissues where they exhibit similar but not identical dynamic to that seen in the SCN. Among these peripheral tissues, the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary expresses clock genes. We show here that the PT of the rat, like that of other rodents, rhythmically expresses Per1. We also report rhythmic expression of another clock gene, Cry1. The peak of Cry1 mRNA expression occurs during the night concomitantly with rising blood plasma melatonin concentrations. Using an acute injection paradigm, we demonstrate that Cry1 expression is directly induced by melatonin in the PT. Melatonin injection at the end of the subjective day also affects Per1 expression, leading to diminished mRNA levels. These data support the existence of a time-measurement model in the PT based on direct opposite actions of melatonin on Per1 and Cry1 expression."

However, cross-species consensus concern only a few of them like the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the master circadian clock, and the pars tuberalis of the pituitary. Recently, MT1 melatonin receptor cDNA have been cloned in several mammals providing us with new tools to investigate its tissular location at the gene level.

To semi-quantify the melatonin receptor mRNA expression level, each cDNA was amplified concomitantly with both beta-actin and MT1 specific primers.RESULTS: In central and peripheral tissues previously reported to bind melatonin, strong PCR signals were logically observed. More surprisingly, a vast majority of studied tissues express MT1 mRNA and then might be responsive to melatonin.CONCLUSION: Numerous biological functions express diurnal rhythmicity and internal-synchronization. As, most of them apparently do not receive any out-coming neuronal message from the SCN, endocrine communication was proposed to support biological rhythm synchronization. Our present data strengthen the idea that the nocturnally restricted melatonin secretion could be one internal zeitgeber that putatively distributes the endogenous circadian rhythmicity to all tissues expressing melatonin receptors."

Previous studies showed that thrombin promotes LPS-induced liver injury independent of its ability to form fibrin clots. In isolated, buffer-perfused livers from LPS-treated rats, thrombin added to the perfusion buffer caused dose-dependent liver injury with an EC(50) value of 0.4 nM, consistent with activation by thrombin of a protease-activated receptor (PAR). Actions of thrombin at PARs can be mimicked by thrombin receptor-activating peptides (TRAPs). TRAPs for PAR-1 reproduced the injury caused by thrombin in isolated livers, suggesting that one mechanism by which thrombin promotes LPS-induced liver injury is by activating PAR-1. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated the presence of PAR-1 on sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells but not on parenchymal cells or neutrophils. Previous studies showed that thrombin interacts with neutrophils in the genesis of liver injury after LPS treatment. To explore this interaction further, the influence of thrombin on mediators that modulate neutrophil function were evaluated. Inhibition of thrombin in LPS-treated rats prevented liver injury but did not prevent up-regulation of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, or intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Thrombin inhibition did, however, prevent neutrophil (PMN) degranulation in vivo as measured by plasma elastase levels. In addition, elastase concentration was increased in the perfusion medium of livers isolated from LPS-treated rats and perfused with TRAPs. These results suggest that activation of PAR-1 after LPS exposure promotes PMN activation and hepatic parenchymal cell injury."

Fibroblasts are the most abundant cells in connective tissue, and damage to blood vessels places coagulation factors in contact with these and other cell types.OBJECTIVES: To investigate cellular responses of primary dermal fibroblasts to FVIIa, FXa and thrombin by following changes in expression of candidate proteins: monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and to determine the expression of receptors implicated in signaling by these coagulation factors.METHODS: Steady-state mRNA levels were quantified by RNase protection assay, and protein secretion by ELISA. PAR gene expression was assessed by ribonuclease protection assay and conventional and quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: FVIIa did not induce the candidate genes. In contrast, FXa and thrombin induced MCP-1 mRNA and protein secretion strongly, IL-8 moderately, and IL-6 weakly. Neither FXa nor thrombin induced VEGF mRNA or protein secretion, although FXa induced VEGF protein secretion in lung fibroblasts. Comparison of the presence of candidate receptors in the two fibroblast subtypes demonstrated higher levels of PAR-1 and PAR-3 in lung fibroblasts relative to their dermal counterparts and the additional expression of PAR-2.CONCLUSIONS: FXa and thrombin induce expression of MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-6, and distribution and expression of PARs on dermal fibroblasts is reduced relative to their lung counterparts.

Activation of PAR-2 activates G-protein followed by an increase of intracellular free Ca2+, [Ca2+]in. This study was undertaken to clarify whether HAT can activate PAR-2 in HBEC or not. RT-PCR showed that HAT mRNA is expressed in HBEC, and PAR-2 mRNA is the most strongly expressed of the known PARs in HBEC. Both PAR-2 agonist peptide (PAR-2 AP) and HAT increased [Ca2+]in in HBEC in a biphasic fashion; a prompt, sharp increase (peak I) and a sustained low plateau (peak II). PAR-2 AP over 100-200 microM and HAT over 200-300 mU/ml (0.08-0.12 microM) induced both peak I and II, and PAR-2 AP below 100 microM and HAT below 200 mU/ml induced only peak II. Both PAR-2 AP-induced and HAT-induced peak I were induced by Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores, because they appeared even in Ca2+-free medium. Both PAR-2 AP-induced and HAT-induced peak II were induced by an influx of extracellular Ca2+, because they were abolished in Ca2+-free medium. The Ca2+ response to HAT was desensitized by exposure of HBEC to PAR-2 AP.

The changes in mRNA levels of pro-apoptotic protein tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and its &quot;death receptor&quot; TNFalphaRI and then bax mRNA, as an important regulator of apoptotic neurodegeneration were followed by RT-PCR procedure. In situ analysis revealed an increased number of TUNEL-positive neurons in 6-OHDA-treated animals in all examined time points. The highest number of apoptotic neurons was detected 24 h after the lesion, both in the ipsilateral striatum (3.41+/-0.18) and SNpc (5.8+/-0.79). A significant increase in the level of TNFalpha mRNA was observed in 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum, with maximal value after 24 h (46%) comparing to the control. In contrast, 6-OHDA did not significantly change the level of TNFalphaRI mRNA in any time point. Six and 24 h post-operatively, we observed a significant increase of bax mRNA expression (40% and 45%, respectively) in the ipsilateral striatum of treated animals in comparison with the right striatum of the controls. However, the highest level of the bax mRNA expression was reached 7 days after the surgery (94%) in the ipsilateral striatum of 6-OHDA-treated animals.

Factors that control the release of these toxic mediators are targets for potential therapeutic intervention.

To date, PAR1-4 have been identified, and there are several studies that have demonstrated the expression of PARs in airway tissue, particularly the respiratory epithelium. We have investigated whether eosinophils express PARs and if activation of these receptors will then trigger a functional response. Using a combination of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and flow cytometry analysis, we have demonstrated that eosinophils express PAR1 and PAR2. FACS analysis showed that PAR1 could be clearly detected on the surface of the cells, whereas PAR2 appeared to be primarily intracellular. Trypsin and the PAR2 agonist peptide were seen in trigger shape change, release of cysteinyl leukotrienes, and most obviously, generation of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, thrombin had no effect on eosinophil function. The PAR1 agonist peptide did have a minor effect on eosinophil function, but this was most likely down to its ability to activate PAR1 and PAR2. These results demonstrate that PAR2 is the major PAR receptor that is capable of modulating eosinophil function."

It regulates neuroendocrine target tissues through G-protein-coupled receptors, of which MT(1) is the predominant subtype. These receptors are transiently expressed in several fetal and neonatal tissues, suggesting distinct roles for melatonin in development and that specific developmental cues define time windows for melatonin sensitivity. We have investigated MT(1) gene expression in the rat pituitary gland. MT(1) mRNA is confined to the pars tuberalis region of the adult pituitary, but in neonates extends into the ventral pars distalis and colocalizes with luteinizing hormone beta-subunit (LH beta) expression. This accounts for the well documented transient sensitivity of rat gonadotrophs to melatonin in the neonatal period. Analysis of an upstream fragment of the rat MT(1) gene revealed multiple putative response elements for the transcription factor pituitary homeobox-1 (Pitx-1), which is expressed in the anterior pituitary from Rathke's pouch formation. A Pitx-1 expression vector potently stimulated expression of both MT(1)-luciferase and LH beta-luciferase reporter constructs in COS-7 cells. Interestingly, transcription factors that synergize with Pitx-1 to trans-activate gonadotroph-associated genes did not potentiate Pitx-1-induced MT(1)-luciferase activity. Moreover, the transcription factor, early growth response factor-1, which is induced by gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and trans-activates LH beta expression, attenuated Pitx-1-induced MT(1)-luciferase activity. Finally, pituitary MT(1) gene expression was 4-fold higher in hypogonadal (hpg) mice, which do not synthesize GnRH, than in their wild-type littermates. These data suggest that establishment of a mature hypothalamic GnRH input drives the postnatal decline in pituitary MT(1) gene expression."

Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was used, in combination with a single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification technique, to record synaptic potentials and to identify the phenotype of the recorded PPN neuron. In the presence of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, 6-cyano-2, 3-dihydroxy-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2, 3, dione, and dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, single electrical stimuli were applied to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), one of the basal ganglia output nuclei. Stimulation of the SNr evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in 73 of the 104 neurons in the PPN. The IPSPs were abolished with a GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents of the neurons were reversed in polarity at approximately -93.5 mV, which was close to the value of the equilibrium potential for chloride ions of -88.4 mV. Single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions revealed that approximately 30% (9/32) of the PPN neurons that received inhibition from the SNr expressed detectable levels of choline acetyltransferase mRNA. These findings show that output from the SNr regulates the activity of cholinergic PPN neurons through GABAA receptors."

Calcyon mRNA is found to be abundantly distributed throughout the primate brain. In neocortex, moderately dense, diffuse signal is found in all areas, with increased intensity present in a superficial isodense band corresponding generally to cortical layers II and III. Increased intensity of signal is also seen in the pyramidal cell layers of medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex. Calcyon mRNA is present abundantly in subcortical limbic areas such as the nucleus accumbens, septum, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. Moderate calcyon transcript expression is seen in caudate and putamen, with lower levels in globus pallidus. Thalamic nuclei, including the reticular nucleus, express low to moderate levels. Very dense expression is noted in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Numerous brainstem regions express this transcript, notably monoaminergic nuclei including the locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe. The cerebellum has detectable levels of expression in both cortex and deep nuclei. Although calcyon is hypothesized as a means for D1-like receptors to modulate &quot;cross-talk&quot; with other neurotransmitter receptor systems, it is notable that abundant calcyon transcript is detected in brain regions not associated with D1-like neurotransmission, particularly the substantia nigra pars compacta and other dopamine-synthesizing cell groups. A substantial proportion of this may relate to the reported association of calcyon with the D5 receptor, or in addition, may suggest that calcyon has a wider role as a regulator of intracellular signal transduction."

Because alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) influences anxiety, aggressiveness and motor activity, we investigated the effect of A2AR gene disruption on alpha-MSH content in discrete brain regions and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) expression in the hypothalamus and pituitary. No modification in alpha-MSH content was observed in the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata where POMC-expressing perikarya are located. In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, POMC mRNA levels were not affected by A2AR disruption. Conversely, in A2AR-/- mice, a significant increase in alpha-MSH content was observed in the amygdala and cerebral cortex, two regions that are innervated by POMC terminals. In the pars intermedia of the pituitary, A2AR disruption provoked a significant reduction of POMC mRNA expression associated with a decrease in alpha-MSH content. By contrast, in the anterior lobe of the pituitary, a substantial increase in POMC mRNA and adrenocorticotropin hormone concentrations was observed, and plasma corticosterone concentration was significantly higher in A2AR-/- mice, revealing hyperactivity of their pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Together, these results suggest that adenosine, acting through A2A receptors, may modulate the release of alpha-MSH in the cerebral cortex and amygdala. The data also indicate that A2A receptors are involved in the control of POMC gene expression and biosynthesis of POMC-derived peptides in pituitary melanotrophs and corticotrophs."

By light- and electron-microscopic immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that the tanycytes of Djungarian hamsters were intensely immunostained with the vimentin monoclonal antibody V9. The cells always extended long radial processes in which aggregations of vimentin-immunoreactive intermediate filaments were prominent. The tanycytes showed photoperiod-dependent changes. The population of vimentin-immunoreactive tanycytes was increased in hamsters exposed to continuous lighting for 1 month or to a long photoperiod (16 h light:8 h dark) for 2 months. On the other hand, the immunoreactive cells were significantly decreased in hamsters exposed to complete darkness for 1 month or to a short photoperiod (8 h light:16 h dark) for 2 months. The pericapillary spaces of the primary plexus of the portal circulation system were lined by the end-feet of tanycytic processes. Electron microscopy confirmed that the tanycytic processes were markedly decreased in number and size after exposure to complete darkness. Expression of vimentin mRNA in the hamster mediobasal hypothalamus was detected by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The alterations of vimentin mRNA expression under different photoperiods were analyzed using laser capture microdissection and real-time quantitative PCR. The level of vimentin mRNA in the mediobasal hypothalamus was enhanced after exposure to continuous lighting for 1 month or to a long photoperiod for 2 months, whereas it was significantly diminished after exposure to constant darkness or short photoperiod. These changes in the tanycytes under different photoperiods may influence the portal circulation system and also the cell activity of the pars tuberalis, and may thus participate in photoperiodic regulation of the endocrine system."

Prolonged exposure to short winter day lengths results in refractoriness, a spontaneous reversion to long-day physiological status. Despite its critical role in the timing of seasonal rhythms, refractoriness remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was therefore to describe cellular and molecular mechanisms driving the seasonal secretion of a key hormone, prolactin, in refractory Syrian hamsters. We used recently developed single cell hybridization and reporter assays to show that this process is initiated by timed reactivation of endocrine signaling from the pars tuberalis (PT) region of the pituitary gland, a well-defined melatonin target site, causing renewed activation of prolactin gene expression. This timed signaling is independent of per1 clock gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and PT and of melatonin secretion, which continue to track day length. Within the PT, there is also a continued short day-like profile of ICER expression, suggesting that the change in hormone secretion is independent of cAMP signaling. Our data thus identify the PT as a key anatomical structure involved in endogenous seasonal timing mechanisms, which breaks from prevailing day length-induced gene expression."

As the disease evolves, other neuronal populations are also progressively affected. A transgenic mouse model of the disease (R6/2) that expresses exon 1 of the human Huntington gene with approximately 150 CAG repeats has been developed, but GABA concentrations are reported to be normal in the striatum of these animals. In the present study, we analysed the status of GABAergic systems by means of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)67 mRNA in situ hybridization in the brain of R6/2 transgenic mice and wild-type littermates. We show that GAD67 expression is normal in the striatum, cerebellum and septum but decreased in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata of R6/2 mice. These data, which may, in part, account for the behavioural changes seen in these animals, indicate that at 12.5 weeks of age the pathological features seen in the mice differ from those seen in humans with Huntington's disease."

One important target for the hormone is the pars tuberalis (PT) of the adenohypophysis which displays a very high number of melatonin binding sites in mammals and is implicated in the seasonal regulation of prolactin secretion. To gain insight into the mechanism by which the melatonin signal is decoded in the PT, we studied the effect of photoperiod on the PT cells expressing the MT1 melatonin receptor in a highly photoperiodic species, the European hamster. Recently, we showed that, in the rat, the MT1 receptor mRNA is expressed in PT-specific cells characterized by their expression of beta-thyroid stimulating hormone (beta-TSH) along with the alpha-glycoprotein subunit (alpha-GSU). As the cellular composition of the PT shows variability among species, we first identified the cell type expressing the MT1 receptor in the European hamster by combining immunocytochemistry and nonradioactive in situ hybridization for the MT1 receptor mRNA. Our results show that, in the European hamster, as in the rat, the MT1 receptor is only expressed by the PT-specific-cells, beta-TSH and alpha-GSU positive. In a second step, we analysed the effects of photoperiod on the MT1 mRNA, and on beta-TSH and alpha-GSU both at the mRNA and protein levels. Our data show that, compared to long photoperiod, short photoperiod induces a dramatic decrease of MT1, beta-TSH and alpha-GSU expression. Protein levels of beta-TSH and alpha-GSU were also dramatically reduced in short photoperiod. Together, our data suggest that melatonin exerts its seasonal effects in the PT by signalling to PT specific-cells through the MT1 receptor subtype."

We studied the expression of the brain-type vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) in the Flinders sensitive line (FSL) rats, which represent a genetic animal model for clinical depression in humans. VMAT2 expression at the protein level was assessed by autoradiography using [(3)H]dihydrotetrabenazine ([(3)H]TBZOH) binding, in the prefrontal cortex, the striatum and its subregions, nucleus accumbens (NAC), ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC). The VMAT2 mRNA level was analyzed by in situ hybridization, in the VTA, SNC and the dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus. Reduced levels of [(3)H]TBZOH binding were detected in the striatum and its subregions, NAC shell but not in the NAC core. A marked reduction of 21% was found in the VTA while only a slight reduction (13%) was observed in the SNC. The reduced levels of VMAT2 protein binding capacity were not accompanied by a parallel alteration in VMAT2 mRNA levels in the VTA, the SNC and the DR. Since the VMAT2 is responsible for the intracellular storage and regulated release of monoamines, the reduced [(3)H]TBZOH binding levels in limbic brain regions of FSL rats may imply a reduced density of vesicular monoamine transporters, which can result in reduced monoamine transmission. Such reduction in the limbic neurotransmission, especially in NAC shell and VTA regions, may be involved in the depressive features of anhedonia and lack of motivation reported in the FSL rats."

In mammals, the pars tuberalis (PT) in the pituitary is involved in the regulation of photoperiodic regulation of PRL secretion. In birds, however, hypothalamic vasoactive intestinal peptide is implicated in PRL secretion, and physiological roles of the avian PT remain unknown. In the present study, we show that PRL secretion increases under long days and short days with a night interruptive schedule, both of which also cause gonadal growth in Japanese quail. We have also found Cry1 gene expression in the PT of Japanese quail. Cry1 expression was rhythmic under long and short photoperiods in the PT, and the peak was phase delayed under a lengthened photoperiod. Moreover, expression of Cry1 gene was induced by a light pulse but only when given during the photoinducible phase. In our previous study, we have shown rhythmic Per2 gene expression with a peak in the PT during the early day under various photoperiods. When taken together with the results from the present study, different phase relationships between Per2 and Cry1 in the Japanese quail PT under different photoperiods may decode photoperiodic information and regulate photoperiodic PRL secretion in a manner similar to that of mammals."

Although PARs are highly expressed in the kidney, their roles in regulating renal function are not known. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of PAR activation on renal hemodynamics using PAR1- and PAR2-activating peptides (TFLLR-NH2 and SLIGRL-NH2) and proteinases (thrombin and trypsin) as PAR agonists in the isolated perfused rat kidney preparation. PAR1 activation resulted in renal vasoconstriction and a marked reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In contrast, PAR2 activation caused vasodilation, partially reversing the vasoconstriction induced by TFLLR-NH2 and ANG II and increasing GFR that had been prereduced by ANG II. The vasoconstrictor actions of PAR1 activation were abolished by protein kinase C inhibition. The PAR2-induced vasodilation was only partially blocked by NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, suggesting both nitric oxide-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Although PAR4 mRNA was detected in renal parenchyma, the PAR4-activating peptide AYPGKF-NH2 had no effect on renal perfusion flow rate. We conclude that PAR1 and PAR2 play bidirectional roles in the regulation of renal hemodynamics."

Similar to other FSHbeta genes, the cfFSHbeta gene consisted of three exons interrupted by two introns. The cfFSHbeta cDNA coded for a mature protein of 115 amino acids. The 12 cysteines that are required for the typical tertiary folding of glycoprotein hormone beta subunits were positionally conserved in cfFSHbeta. The cfFSHbeta mRNA expression was exclusively detected in the pituitary and was detectable before pubertal development was initiated. The cfFSHbeta transcript levels increased in particular during early stages of puberty and reached constantly high levels after the first appearance of spermatids in the testis. The cfFSHbeta mRNA-positive cells were localized in the proximal pars distalis. Castration of mature males caused elevated cfFSHbeta mRNA levels that were decreased by steroid replacement. Previous work indicated that the African catfish is an interesting model to study the regulation of gonadal functions because cfLH is able to activate both the catfish luteinizing hormone receptor (cfLH-R) and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (cfFSH-R). Because cfFSH purification has failed so far, ongoing studies are directed toward the production of recombinant cfFSH. After all, the developmental and hormonal regulation of cfFSHbeta transcript levels opens the possibility for physiologically relevant actions of the putative cfFSH, next to the presumptive bifunctionally acting cfLH."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether PAR-mediated DNA synthesis differed in various endothelial cell types.METHODS: We examined the incorporation of BrdU by human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs), human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).RESULTS: When the endothelial cells were treated with the selective PAR-1-activating peptide, SFLLRN, HAECs showed the highest BrdU incorporation rate (182 +/- 28%). In contrast, treatment with the PAR-2-activating peptide, SLIGKV, resulted in the highest BrdU incorporation rate (173 +/- 37%) in HPAECs, when pretreated with TNF-alpha. The PAR-4-activating peptide, GYPGQV, induced DNA synthesis in HPAECs and HAECs, but not in HUVECs.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that each PAR preferentially targets an endothelial cell type, and thus plays a distinct role in diverse physiological or pathological conditions."

Obviously, fetal development can be disturbed so profoundly, that fetal programming is changed permanently. We have examined the effects of hypoxia, or more precisely hypoxemia, on the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and lungs using molecular biology techniques in order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Chronically catheterized fetal sheep were subjected to a hypoxemia (48 h) without change in arterial pH or paCO2. Major changes occurred, although the degree of hypoxemia was just moderate. There was a transient increase in the fetal plasma ACTH-concentrations with an upregulation of the cortisol-concentrations, which was more pronounced in the older, hypoxemic fetuses (134-136 days of gestation) than in the younger, hypoxemic animals (126-130 days of gestation; term is 145 days). There was an unique, differential regulation for pro-opiomelanocortin messenger RNA (mRNA), the precursor molecule of e.g. ACTH, in the pars distalis and pars intermedia of the pituitary gland. This finding supported the increased bioactivity besides the increased concentrations for ACTH. Simultaneously, there was an increase in the mRNAs of the ACTH-receptor and of the steroid-synthesizing enzymes in the fetal adrenal gland of the older, hypoxemic fetuses. No changes in the fetal plasma androstenedione-concentrations were observed. Clearly, there was a selective increase of the cortisol-synthesis. Growth and maturation of the fetal lung might also have been affected, because of the increase in surfactant-protein A mRNA in the older, hypoxemic animals and the decrease in the insulin-like growth factor-I and its binding protein-5 mRNA in the younger, hypoxemic fetuses. In summary, even a moderate degree of hypoxemia was shown to affect the different levels of fetal organism profoundly, offering a pathophysiological basis for changes in fetal development."

Accompanying changes in GABA(B) receptor binding have been noted in some basal ganglia regions in parkinsonian primates, suggesting that plasticity of this receptor may also occur in PD. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the changes in receptor binding and the manner and extent to which different GABA(B) receptor mRNA subunits and splice-variants are affected remain unknown. This study used in situ hybridisation to examine the full profile of changes in expression of the known rat GABA(B) receptor genes and gene variants in the basal ganglia and thalamus of rats, brought about by degeneration of the nigrostriatal tract. All of the GABA(B) mRNA species examined showed unique expression patterns throughout the basal ganglia and thalamus. In addition, all exhibited a marked loss of expression (between 46 and 80%) in the substantia nigra pars compacta of animals bearing a complete 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion of the nigrostriatal tract, confirming the presence of these variants in dopaminergic neurones in this region. Further analysis of autoradioagrams revealed additional changes only in GABA(B(1a)) mRNA in discrete anatomical regions. Expression of the GABA(B(1a)) variant was significantly increased in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (33+/-2%), entopeduncular nucleus (26+/-1%) and the subthalamic nucleus (16+/-1%). Since these regions all receive reduced GABAergic innervation following nigrostriatal tract lesioning, it is possible that the increased expression occurs as a compensatory measure. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that GABA(B) receptor genes exhibit regional- and subunit/variant-specific plasticity at the molecular level under parkinsonian conditions."

The three cDNAs consisted of 614, 595, and 666 nucleotides encoding peptides of 131, 146, and 124 amino acids, respectively. Halibut FSHbeta and LHbeta showed unique structural features among the vertebrate glycoprotein hormones. First, in contrast to all known FSHbeta, which contain either one or two conserved N-glycosylation sites, no potential binding site was found in Atlantic halibut FSHbeta. Second, the conserved glycosylation site in the N-terminus of all vertebrate LHbeta has been substituted with a unique C-terminal binding site in Atlantic halibut LHbeta. Furthermore, a specific cysteine residue of importance for the folding and heterodimerization of mammalian FSH is lacking in the FSHbeta from Atlantic halibut as well as many other teleosts. However, teleost FSHbeta is characterized by an additional N-terminal cysteine, which has likely replaced the missing residue, implicating a modified folding pattern of this subunit. In situ hybridization of mature male pituitaries revealed that FSHbeta and LHbeta mRNA were expressed in distinct cell types throughout the proximal pars distalis of the adenohypophysis, while alpha-subunit mRNA was identified in all parts of the proximal pars distalis, and also along the periphery of pars intermedia. Consistently, Northern blot analysis of pituitary RNA from mature males showed that FSHbeta, LHbeta, and alpha-subunit mRNAs were highly expressed. In juvenile male pituitaries very few cells containing FSHbeta, LHbeta, and alpha-subunit mRNA were identified by in situ hybridization. Low mRNA levels encoding LHbeta and the alpha-subunit were also demonstrated by Northern blot analysis of the juvenile pituitaries, while no FSHbeta mRNA was detected using this less sensitive technique. The results suggest that both FSH and LH play a role during both the very early and the final reproductive stages in Atlantic halibut males."

However, some aspects of this response remain unclear. In this work, different electrophysiological and neurochemical parameters were studied in GABAergic cells of the SN after unilateral nigrostriatal dopaminergic lesion using 6-hydroxydopamine injection in rats. Our data showed that 1) the SN under normal conditions contains different subsets of GABAergic cells according to their firing pattern and glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA levels, and 2) the response of these GABAergic cell subgroups was different after the ipsi- and contralateral dopaminergic cell degeneration. These findings indicate a complex regulation of nigral GABAergic activity after nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration that probably involves local mechanisms, the nigro-striato-nigral loop, as well as interhemispheric mechanisms whose anatomical basis remains unstudied."

The present study investigates the effects normal and MPTP-lesioned mice chronically treated with two different doses of levodopa. We assess changes in striatal dopamine (DA) receptor binding, striatal DA receptor mRNA levels and striatal neuropeptide precursor levels (preproenkephalin-A [PPE-A]; preprotachykinin [PPT]; preproenkephalin-B [PPE-B]). The extent of the lesion was measured by striatal DA transporter binding and stereological estimation of the number of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurones in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). In non-lesioned animals, chronic levodopa treatment induced an increase in PPE-A mRNA, whereas both D3R binding and PPE-B mRNA levels were dramatically increased in the lesioned animals in a dose dependent manner. The present results show that chronic levodopa administration may induce pathophysiological changes, even in the absence of a lesion of the nigro-striatal pathway, suggesting that the sensitization process involves predominantly the indirect striatofugal pathway in non-lesioned animals, whereas the direct pathway is primarily involved in lesioned animals."

(Gingiberaceae), has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) play a role in inflammation, and human leukemic mast cells (HMC-1) co-express PAR2 and PAR4. In the present study, the effect of curcumin on PAR2- and PAR4-mediated HMC-1 activation was examined.METHODS: HMC-1 cells were stimulated with trypsin (100 nmol/l, PAR2 and PAR4 agonist), SLIGKV-NH(2) (100 microM, PAR2-activating peptide) or GYPGQV-NH(2) (100 micromol/l PAR4-activating peptide) in the presence or absence of curcumin (1, 10, and 100 micromol/l). TNF-alpha secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). TNF-alpha and tryptase mRNA were measured by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was assessed by Western blot analysis. Trypsin activity was measured using the substrate Bz-DL-Arg-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA).RESULTS: Curcumin (10 and 100 micromol/l) inhibited TNF-alpha secretion from trypsin or activating peptide-stimulated HMC-1. Curcumin (10 and 100 micromol/l) also inhibited TNF-alpha and tryptase mRNA expression in trypsin-stimulated HMC-1. Furthermore, curcumin inhibited trypsin-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. However, curcumin did not affect the trypsin activity even at 100 micromol/l.CONCLUSION: Curcumin inhibits PAR2- and PAR4-mediated human mast cell activation, not by inhibition of trypsin activity but by block of ERK pathway."

Dopamine (DA), R-apomorphine (R-APO), green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechine-3-gallate (EGCG), and melatonin are neuroprotective and radical scavenger compounds. The aim of this study was to establish the mechanism of the concentration-dependent neuroprotective and pro-apoptotic action of these drugs via gene expression and protein determination. cDNA microarrays provide new prospects to study and identify various mechanisms of drug action. We employed this technique for the study reported in this paper. Total RNA was extracted from SH-SY5Y cells exposed to low neuroprotective and high toxic concentrations of the drugs, followed by synthesis of cDNA, and hybridization to a microarray membrane related to apoptosis, survival, and cell cycle pathways. We demonstrated a concentration and time-dependent correlation between R-APO, DA, EGCG, and melatonin in modulation of cell survival/cell death-related gene pathways. The results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and protein profiles. Unlike the effects of low concentrations (1-10 micro M), where an antiapoptotic response was manifest, a proapoptotic pattern of gene expression was observed at high toxic concentrations (50-500 micro M) of the antioxidants (e.g., increase in caspases, fas, and gadd45). Our results have provided novel insights into the gene mechanisms involved in both the neuroprotective and proapoptotic activities of neuroprotective drugs. We have shown that DA, R-APO, EGCG, and melatonin exhibit similar gene expression and protein profiles."

ED1(+) cells were observed for at least 8 weeks after hemorrhage. Phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was shown in ED1(+) cells with the expression of both brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and BDNF, suggesting that activated-p38 MAPK(+)/ED1(+) cells would produce BDNF and may exhibit trophic effect on the degenerating neurons in the SN. However, in ELISA, BDNF protein decreased significantly in ipsilateral SN at 7 days after hemorrhage, which may be due to a dramatic decrease of BDNF immunoreactive neurons in pars compacta. Data suggest that activation of p38 MAPK in ED1(+) cells infiltrating in ipsilateral SN after hemorrhage may produce BDNF, but that the amount of BDNF produced from ED1(+) cells is insufficient for the rescue of degenerating neurons."

However, both the order of appearance and potential interactions of compensatory mechanisms acting within the nigrostriatal pathway as well as inside and outside the basal ganglia are not clear. We hypothesize that, after the striatal dopaminergic homeostasis breakdown, a modification in the expression of several striatal markers (neuropeptide precursors and dopamine receptors) may occur before a change in the activity of both globus pallidus (GP) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in response to a partial nigrostriatal lesion. The present data show, in MPTP-treated mice, that preproenkephalin-A and preprotachykinin mRNA expression and D(3) receptor binding are modified without changes in cytochrome oxidase metabolic activity in both GP and SNr, respectively. These changes in neuropeptide expression would compensate for the dopamine depletion-induced changes in inhibitory GABAergic input from the striatum to GP and SNr. It also indicates that nondopaminergic compensatory mechanisms inherent to the basal ganglia are activated before those residing outside the basal ganglia."

Intense immunostaining for nitrotyrosine residue was seen within the lung lesions from A. pleuropneumoniae-infected pigs, but it was minimal in the unaffected parts of the lung from A. pleuropneumoniae-infected pigs and in the normal lung from control pigs. Staining was especially strong in neutrophils and macrophages in the periphery of the lesions and within the alveolar spaces. There was close cell-to-cell correlation when serial sections were examined by immunohistochemistry for NOS2 and nitrotyrosine in each of the 20 lung samples. Expression of PARS was always present within inflammatory lesions but was minimal in the unaffected lung of A. pleuropneumoniae-infected pigs. Macrophages in alveolar spaces frequently exhibited strong staining for PARS. Colocalization of nitrotyrosine and PARS antigen was especially prominent in macrophages in the periphery of lesions. NOS2 expression in pleuropneumonic areas associated with protein nitrosation and PARS suggests that NOS2 is functionally active during infections caused by A. pleuropneumoniae."

Loss of nigral target cells in the striatum was accompanied by significant induction of BDNF mRNA levels in the ipsilateral substantia nigra (SN) at 12 and 24 h post lesion. Dual tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and BDNF mRNA in situ hybridization (ISH) confirmed the dopaminergic nature of the BDNF mRNA expressing cells. Analysis of neuronal activity in terms of cFos mRNA expression demonstrated intense induction of this marker in the ipsilateral SN pars reticulata (SNPR), but not in SN pars compacta. Dual glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and cFos mRNA ISH confirmed this view. Colchicine injections into the medial forebrain bundle to specifically disrupt neuronal trafficking between SN and striatum induced BDNF mRNA levels in the ipsilateral SNPC, thus demonstrating that nigral expression of BDNF mRNA is dependent of striatal target tissue. In addition, we found significant elevations of BDNF in the subthalamic nucleus following striatal excitotoxic lesion, which may bring novel roles of BDNF in the basal ganglia complex."

Further, we examined the spatio-temporal expression pattern of FSH-beta and LH-beta in the brain and pituitary of two species of teleost (tilapia, O. niloticus; sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka), using in situ hybridization and immunological methods. The expression of FSH and LH immunoreactivity appeared simultaneously in the brain and pituitary (tilapia, 14 days; sockeye, 51 days after fertilization). In the pituitary, FSH mRNA and peptide expressing cells were distinct from LH expressing cells located in the ventral proximal pars distalis. In the brain, FSH and LH immunoreactivity was co-localized in cells of the preoptic nucleus parvocellularis, magnocellularis, and gigantocellularis. Fibers immunoreactive to FSH and LH antisera were seen along the forebrain-hypothalamus and in the neurohypophysis of the pituitary. Double-label immunofluorescence revealed FSH and LH immunoreactivity co-localized in arginine vasotocin synthesizing preoptic neurons. Our results show that FSH and LH-producing cells have developmental origins in the brain as well as in the pituitary. In addition, we propose that the brain-derived gonadotropins may function as hypophysiotropic hormones that regulate pituitary cells and along with arginine vasotocin could act as neuromodulators of reproductive behaviors."

We demonstrate the expression of all four PAR subtypes in the postnatal eye and in retina of the adult rat by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). PAR-1 is regulated developmentally in the eye, with a decrease from P1, P9, to P16, whereas levels for PAR-2, PAR-3, and PAR-4 remain unchanged throughout. In the retina of the adult rat, PAR-1 is highly expressed, whereas PAR-2 and PAR-3 are moderately expressed, compared to low PAR-4 expression. To elucidate possible roles of PARs after trauma, we carried out semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of expression of all 4 PAR subtypes, beginning 6 hr after partial optic nerve crush (ONC) in the adult rat until 3 weeks after the mild trauma. Levels of PAR mRNA for all four subtypes were upregulated as early as 6 hr after unilateral ONC, except PAR-3, which showed a delayed upregulation. PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4 mRNA levels returned to almost basal levels at 3 weeks post-crush, whereas PAR-2 mRNA level was still high by the end of 3 weeks after crush. Although the lesion was unilateral, PAR mRNA expression in the contralateral, uninjured side was affected to levels almost comparable to those in the injured side. Previous studies have shown an increase in thrombin levels at the site of injury, retinal ganglion cell degeneration by necrosis and apoptosis, and PAR activation as consequences of nerve crush. PAR upregulation because of nerve crush in the mild trauma model could act as an effector of early cell death. Eventual return of receptor mRNA to basal levels is consistent with neuroprotection."

It is stimulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), whereas somatostatin (SRIH) exerts an inhibitory effect. In order to determine the mechanism by which these hypothalamic hormones modulate chicken TSH release, we examined the cellular localization of TRH receptors (TRH-R), CRH receptors type 1 (CRH-R1) and somatostatin subtype 2 receptors (SSTR2) in the chicken pars distalis by in situ hybridization (ISH), combined with immunological staining of thyrotropes. We show that thyrotropes express TRH-Rs and SSTR2s, allowing a direct action of TRH and SRIH at the level of the thyrotropes. CRH-R1 expression is virtually confined to corticotropes, suggesting that CRH-induced adrenocorticotropin release is the result of a direct stimulation of corticotropes, whereas CRH-stimulated TSH release is not directly mediated by the known chicken CRH-R1. Possibly CRH-induced TSH secretion is mediated by a yet unknown type of CRH-R in the chicken. Alternatively, a pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptide, secreted by the corticotropes following CRH stimulation, could act as an activator of TSH secretion in a paracrine way."

We have investigated the levels of AST expression in the brain of adult mated and virgin females, and adult males of the cockroach Diploptera punctata, for 11 days following emergence. To quantify Dippu-AST mRNA we have used an optimized, sensitive and specific quantitative competitive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QC-RT-PCR) method. Using this technique, we show that Dippu-AST is expressed at higher levels in the brains of mated females than in the brains of virgin females. Specifically, levels of Dippu-AST mRNA in day 0 mated females are 2.5x higher than levels in day 0 virgin females. By day 6-7, levels in mated females are 20x higher than those in virgin females. However, the general pattern of expression is preserved in mated and virgin females; levels of Dippu-AST mRNA are relatively high in newly eclosed females, fall steadily to significantly lower levels on day 5 (mated) and day 5-7 (virgins), and then increase and remain relatively stable until at least day 10. No significant changes in Dippu-AST mRNA are apparent in male brains during the observation period. However, the general pattern of expression is virtually the inverse of that seen in females. Dippu-AST mRNA in male brains is relatively low following emergence, increases to maximum levels on day 5, following which, levels steadily fall. In situ hybridization suggests that fluctuations in Dippu-AST mRNA expression are a result of differential transcription within medial and lateral cells of the pars intercerebralis in both males and females. In addition to yielding insights into Dippu-AST function, the quantification of Dippu-AST expression under normal conditions is useful in providing a basis for comparison of Dippu-AST expression following various physiological manipulations."

The SL1 transcripts in contrast to the SL2 transcripts presented high expression levels in embryos and younger larvae. Moreover, the SL2 transcripts were slightly present or absence in embryonic stage and the newly hatched larvae, respectively. The differences in the expression levels of SL1 and SL2 in embryos and larvae may be due to the fact that two distinct genes express both isoforms of the protein. Thus, both SLs may play different physiological roles throughout development. Moreover, the hybridization signals for SL1- and SL2-mRNAs were detected in 4-day-old larvae. Both in larvae and adults the somatolactotroph cells co-expressed both transcripts of SL and were located bordering the neurohypophysis in the pars intermedia."

As hypoxia has been proposed as a causative factor in the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the correlation between TATA-binding protein (TBP) in the brainstem of SIDS victims as a marker of transcription and the incidence of sleep apnea was investigated.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 infants, including 26 cases of SIDS, died under 6 months of age, in a cohort of 27,000 infants studied prospectively to characterize their sleep-wake behavior. The frequency and duration of sleep apnea was analyzed. Brainstem material was collected and immunohistochemistry of TBP was carried out. The density of TBP-positive neurons was measured quantitatively. Correlation analyses were carried out between the density of TBP-positive neurons and the data concerning sleep apnea.RESULTS: One SIDS-specific positive correlation occurred between the density of TBP-positive neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of the midbrain and the duration of central apnea (p=0.049) and two SIDS-specific negative correlations between the density of TBP-positive neurons in the pars compacta and dissipata of the pedunculopontine tegmentum nucleus (PPTNc, PPTNd) in the midbrain and the duration of apnea (p=0.035).CONCLUSIONS: The significant correlation between the findings of TBP-positive neurons in the midbrain arousal pathway and the characteristics of sleep apnea in SIDS victims is in agreement with the both association of apnea and arousal phenomenon in pathophysiology of SIDS."

Here, we tested the hypothesis that individual lactotroph cells exhibit a heterogeneous response to changes in photoperiod, by exploiting a recently developed assay for prolactin gene expression in single pars distalis (PD) cells. Male Syrian hamsters were exposed to either long (LD; 16 h light: 8 h dark) or short (SD; 8 h light: 16 h dark) photoperiods for 12 weeks. Response of the lactotrophic axis to photoperiod was confirmed by the significantly (P&lt;0.01) lower plasma prolactin concentrations in SD than LD hamsters. Analysis of freshly dispersed PD cells by in situ hybridisation demonstrated that photoperiod has no effect (P&gt;0.05) on the proportion of PD cells (approximately 25%) that expressed prolactin mRNA. Heterogeneity of prolactin mRNA expression was observed in both LD and SD. A similar proportion of cells expressed low levels of prolactin mRNA in both photoperiods, suggesting that they may be unresponsive to photoperiod change. In contrast, the remaining PD cells that expressed prolactin mRNA exhibited markedly increased gene expression in LD, consistent with the selective recruitment of a lactotroph subpopulation to a more transcriptionally active state in this photoperiod."

The distribution of GH mRNA studied by in situ hybridization (ISH) was found to be pituitary specific. Hybridization signals for GH mRNA were detected for the first time in 4-day-old larvae. Throughout development the cells that express GH mRNA were mainly located in the proximal pars distalis. Mammosomatotroph cells coexpressing GH and PRL were not detected in juveniles or adults. Moreover, the possible involvement of GH in asynchronic growth in cultivation of gilthead sea bream was also examined by ISH. No differences in the distribution of GH cells were observed in the three sizes of juveniles of gilthead sea bream studied.

Whilst the pathogenesis of tardive dyskinesia remains unclear, altered expression of neuropeptides in the basal ganglia has been implicated in its emergence. The peptide neurotensin is expressed in both dopamine D1 receptor-bearing neurons of the direct striatonigral pathway and dopamine D2 receptor-bearing neurons of the indirect striatopallidal pathway. Increased levels of striatal neurotensin messenger RNA (mRNA) are reported following chronic neuroleptic therapy. Chronic treatment with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol elicits neurotensin immunoreactivity in a large number of striatopallidal and a modest number of striatonigral projection neurons, whilst treatment with the potent dopamine releaser, methamphetamine, induces intense neurotensin immunoreactivity in striatonigral projection neurons. In order to determine whether increased levels of striatal neurotensin mRNA in the direct striatonigral or the indirect striatopallidal pathway play a more influential role in the development of tardive dyskinesia, we explored the effects of a specific neurotensin antagonist in a rodent model (vacuous chewing movements [VCMs] induced by chronic neuroleptics). Three groups of animals received injections of fluphenazine decanoate (25 mg/kg) or its vehicle sesame oil every 3 weeks for at least 18 weeks. They were then surgically implanted with bilateral guide cannulae aimed at the striatum, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, or the globus pallidus respectively. After recovery, animals were infused with 2-[(1-(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)-5-(2,6-imethoxyphenyl)pyrazol-3-yl)carbonylamino]tricyclo(3.3.1.1.(3.7))decan-2-carboxylic acid (SR48692; 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 nmol/microl), or its vehicle (10% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] in saline) and observed for 60 min. Intra-striatal, intra-nigral or intra-pallidal infusion of SR48692 attenuated neuroleptic-induced VCMs. These findings lend further support to a role for neurotensin in the development of VCMs but do not clarify which pathway plays a more important role. Thus, treatments that reduce or prevent the effects of increased neurotensin expression and release may be useful in the management of tardive dyskinesia."

Between embryonic day E16 and postnatal day P16, brainstem nuclei expressed both bNOS messenger RNA (mRNA) in situ hybridization signals and protein immunoreactivity. However, NOS mRNA signals were absent from the Edinger Westphal, facial or motory trigeminal nucleus. Strong patterns of mRNA signals and immunoreactivity occurred in neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the laterodorsal tegmental nuclei. Between E24 and P16, altered patterns of bNOS mRNA positive and immunoreactive neurons, e.g. superior and inferior colliculi, raphe nuclei, solitary tract or pontine nucleus were documented. Altered NOS expression patterns thus may reflect developmental processes within distinct neuronal populations such as cell phenotype discrimination or synaptogenesis within efferent or afferent brainstem pathways. The NOS/NO system therefore appears to be a modulator for intra-/intercellular adjustment processes in normal development."

The signals generated on adjacent brain sections by each probe were quantified and/or rated and were compared in order to identify neuronal populations expressing the receptor. In addition, the cellular localization of the transcripts within various brain structures was analyzed in sections dipped in a photographic emulsion. In the cerebral cortex, the strong mRNA expression in intermediate and deep layers indicates the presence of H(3) receptors on several types of neurons. The binding is dense except in layer V, suggesting that H(3) receptors are located on granule cells and apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. In addition to their localization on monoaminergic afferents, the dense binding in layer IV and strong mRNA expression in thalamic nuclei suggest the presence of heteroreceptors on thalamocortical projections. In the hippocampus, the strong mRNA expression but low binding in pyramidal layers of the CA1 and ventral CA3 fields suggest that H(3) receptors are abundant on efferent projections of pyramidal cells. In the dentate gyrus, some binding sites in the molecular layer may correspond to H(3) receptors synthesized in granule cells and coexpressed with H(1) and H(2) receptors in their dendrites. In the basal ganglia, H(3) receptors are highly expressed in the striatal complex and olfactory tubercles but not in islands of Calleja. Some of the striatal binding sites may correspond to presynaptic receptors present on afferents. The mRNAs in cortical layer V may encode for heteroreceptors on corticostriatal neurons. The presence of mRNAs in the substantia nigra pars compacta suggests that H(3) receptors are located upon nigrostriatal afferents. However, the absence of any signal in the ventral tegmental area indicates that some but not all dopaminergic neurons express H(3) receptors. In addition, the homogeneous mRNA expression within the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens suggests that many striatal H(3) receptors are present on medium-sized, spiny projection neurons of both the direct and indirect movement pathways. In agreement, a dense binding, but low mRNA expression, is observed in external and internal pallidum and in substantia nigra pars reticulata. In the amygdala, the dense binding and mRNA expression indicate the presence of receptors on both afferents and projections. In the thalamus, the binding in some association nuclei may correspond to receptors present on neurons emanating from the deep cortical layers that strongly express the mRNAs, as well as receptors on the visual systems. However, the low binding and high mRNA expression in most nuclei indicate that many receptors are present upon thalamic projections. In the hypothalamus, the mRNA expression parallels the density of binding sites and is the highest in the tuberomammillary nucleus. Further investigation is needed to know if the dense binding and mRNA expression observed in other nuclei such as the paraventricular, ventromedial and medial tuberal nuclei correspond to pre- and/or postsynaptic receptors. mRNAs are also observed in several areas projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus, such as the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus. In the lower brainstem, the high mRNA expression and very low binding in the locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei indicate that presynaptic rather than somatodendritic receptors regulate noradrenaline and serotonin release, respectively. A similar pattern in vestibular nuclei suggests that receptors located on projections account for the anti-vertigo properties of H(3) receptor antagonists. In the cerebellum, binding is hardly detectable but a strong mRNA expression is found in most, if not all, Purkinje cells as well as in several central cerebellar nuclei, suggesting the presence of H(3) receptors on efferent projections. The present study reports the first detailed quantification and/or rating of H(3) receptor mRNAs in the brain. The comparison, performed in the same animals, with the distribution of the H(3) receptor protein provides evidence for the presence of H(3) receptors on many neuronal perikarya, dendrites and projections. Although some localizations, mainly as auto- or heteroreceptors, are consistent with previous functional studies, the physiological role, if any, of most of these presynaptic or postsynaptic receptors remains to be established."

Both LXRs are also expressed in the brain, but their roles in this tissue remain to be clarified. We examined the brains of mice in which the genes of both LXRalpha and -beta have been disrupted and found several severe abnormalities. One of the most striking features is that the lateral ventricles are closed and lined with lipid-laden cells. In addition, there are enlarged brain blood vessels, especially in the pars reticularis of the substantia nigra and in the globus pallidus. Other features of the brains are excessive lipid deposits, proliferation of astrocytes, loss of neurons, and disorganized myelin sheaths. Electron micrographs revealed that, as mice aged, lipid vacuoles accumulated in astrocytes surrounding blood vessels. Comparison of mRNA profiles in LXR knockout mice and wild-type littermates showed that expression of several LXR target genes involved in cholesterol efflux from astrocytes was reduced. These findings show that LXRs have an important function in lipid homeostasis in the brain, and that loss of these receptors results in neurodegenerative diseases. Further characterization of the role of LXRs in the brain could lead to new insights into the etiology and treatment of some neurodegenerative disorders."

Recent studies indicate that nanomolar concentrations of the serine protease, thrombin, can activate microglia in culture. However, in contrast to other neural cells responsive to thrombin, the participation of novel protease-activated receptors (PARs), such as the prototypic thrombin receptor PAR1, in thrombin-induced microglial activation was cast in doubt. In this report, by utilizing primary microglial cultures from PAR1 knockout (PAR1-/-) mice, application of the PAR1 active peptide TRAP-6 (SFLLRN) in comparison to a scrambled peptide (LFLNR), we have unambiguously demonstrated that murine microglia constitutively express PAR1 mRNA that is translated into fully functional protein. Activation of the microglial PAR1 induces a rapid cytosolic free [Ca2+]i increase and transient activation of both p38 and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Moreover, although in part, this PAR1 activation directly contributes to thrombin-induced microglial proliferation. Furthermore, although not directly inducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) release, PAR1 activation up-regulates microglial CD40 expression and potentiates CD40 ligand-induced TNF-alpha production, thus indirectly contributing to microglial activation. Taken together, these results demonstrate an essential role of PAR1 in thrombin-induced microglial activation. In addition, strategies aimed at blocking thrombin signaling through PAR1 may be therapeutically valuable for diseases associated with cerebral vascular damage and significant inflammation with microglial activation."

In the present work, we analyzed the activity of these elements in transgenic plants and other organisms. Comparison of the relative activities of the crTMV IRES elements and the IRES from an animal virus--encephalomyocarditis virus--in plant, yeast, and HeLa cells identified the 148-nt IRES(CP,148)(CR) as the strongest element that also displayed IRES activity across all kingdoms. Deletion analysis suggested that the polypurine (A)-rich sequences (PARSs) contained in IRES(CP,148)(CR) are responsible for these features. On the basis of those findings, we designed artificial PARS-containing elements and showed that they, too, promote internal translation from dicistronic transcripts in vitro, in tobacco protoplasts and in HeLa cells. The maximum IRES activity was obtained from multiple copies of either (A)(4)G(A)(2)(G)(2) or G(A)(2-5) as contained in IRES(CP,148)(CR). Remarkably, even homopolymeric poly(A) was moderately active, whereas a poly(G) homopolymer was not active. Furthermore, a database search for existing PARS sequences in 5'-untranslated regions (5'UTR) of genes in tobacco genome allowed the easy identification of a number of IRES candidates, in particular in the 5'UTR of the gene encoding Nicotiana tabacum heat-shock factor 1 (NtHSF1). Consistent with our prediction, the 5'UTR of NtHSF1 turned out to be an IRES element active in vitro, in plant protoplasts and HeLa cells. We predict that PARS elements, when found in other mRNAs, will show a similar activity."

Evidence is accumulating that disturbance of this equilibrium may be one of the key factors giving rise to schizophrenia. While there is widespread evidence that the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (PCP) induces schizophrenia-related symptoms, it is not clear how this dramatic effect is mediated. This study was designed to investigate acute and delayed effects of PCP on the mRNA expression of a range of markers of neuronal function associated with the glutamatergic and GABAergic systems within the rat brain. The mRNA levels of CaMKIIalpha, an enzyme which is located within the postsynaptic density and phosphorylates AMPA receptors, remained unaltered both 2 and 24 h posttreatment. Homer 1a, an immediate early gene associated with metabotropic glutamate receptors within the postsynaptic density, displayed region-specific differential changes within the prefrontal, primary auditory, and retrosplenial cortices 2 and 24 h posttreatment. Parvalbumin, a calcium-binding protein located within a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurones, displayed altered mRNA levels within the reticular nucleus of the thalamus at 2 and 24 h posttreatment and the substantia nigra pars reticulata 24 h posttreatment only. These phencyclidine-induced changes in mRNA expression were not accompanied by any changes in hsp-70 mRNA levels, a marker of NMDA antagonist-induced reversible neurotoxicity. These results indicate that the glutamatergic (group I metabotropic glutamate receptors) and GABAergic (parvalbumin-containing interneurones) neurotransmitter systems are differentially modulated in a region- and time-dependent manner by exposure to phencyclidine."

Iron accumulation, together with a lack of up-regulation of the iron-storing protein, ferritin, has been reported and may contribute to increased oxidative stress in this region. We investigated the binding activity of iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP1) to the iron-responsive element that precludes ferritin mRNA translation, in the substantia nigra of a group of parkinsonian patients who presented a statistically significant reduction in the number of nigral melanized-neurones and an increased iron content, together with unchanged H-ferritin and L-ferritin subunit levels as compared to matched controls. The levels of ferritin mRNAs and the binding activity of IRP1 to the iron-responsive element of ferritin mRNA did not differ significantly between the two groups. Moreover, there was no detectable contribution of the iron regulatory protein-2 (IRP2) binding activity. No change in IRP1 control of ferritin mRNA translation explains the lack of up-regulation of ferritin expression in cytoplasmic extracts of SNpc that would be normally expected with cytosolic iron accumulation. The data of this study do not favor changes in transcription and post-transcriptional regulation of ferritin expression in Parkinson's disease and suggest a 'compartmentalized' iron accumulation."

These are hetero-oligomeric proteins modulated by a number of clinically important drugs, depending on their subunit composition. We recently cloned and localised the rat GABA(A) receptor epsilon-subunit by in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical procedures. Here, in a dual-labelling immunohistochemical study in the rat brain, we used our affinity-purified antiserum to epsilon with antisera to markers of cholinergic, catecholaminergic, and serotonergic neurones. As far as cholinergic systems were concerned, epsilon-immunoreactivity was expressed in all forebrain cell-groups, as well as in the caudal lateral pontine tegmentum and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. As far as dopaminergic systems were concerned, epsilon-immunoreactivity was found to be expressed in a great number of hypothalamic cell-groups (A15, A14 and A12) and in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The noradrenergic, and to a lesser extent, adrenergic cell-groups were all epsilon-immunoreactive. Also, epsilon-immunoreactivity was detected in all serotonergic cell-groups. We also revealed by in situ hybridisation in a monkey brain that epsilon mRNA was expressed in the locus coeruleus, as previously observed in rats. Finally, by using in situ hybridisation in rat brains, we compared the distribution of the mRNA of epsilon with that of the recently cloned theta-subunit of the GABA(A) receptor. Both subunits showed strikingly overlapping expression patterns throughout the brain, especially in the septum, preoptic areas, various hypothalamic nuclei, amygdala, and thalamus, as well as the aforementioned monoaminergic cell-groups. No theta-mRNA signals were detected in cholinergic cell-groups. Taken together with previously published evidence of the presence of the alpha3-subunit in monoamine- or acetylcholine-containing systems, our data suggest the existence of novel GABA(A) receptors comprising alpha3/epsilon in cholinergic and alpha3/theta/epsilon in monoaminergic cell-groups."

Functional studies suggest that the PT mediates the seasonal effects of melatonin on prolactin (PRL) secretion. The aim of this study was the characterization of the phenotype of melatonin-responsive cells. Furthermore, we determined whether RORbeta, a retinoid orphan receptor present in the PT, was co-expressed in the same cells. We combined nonradioactive in situ hybridization (ISH) with hapten-labeled riboprobes for detection of the receptors and immunocytochemistry (ICC) for detection of alphaGSU (alpha-glycoprotein subunit), betaTSH, betaFSH, betaLH, GH, PRL, and ACTH. Expression of mt1 mRNA was found in small round cells, co-localized with alphaGSU and betaTSH. However, not all betaTSH-containing cells expressed mt1 mRNA. The distribution of mt1- and RORbeta-positive cells appeared to overlap, although more cells were labeled for RORbeta than for mt1. Gonadotrophs, as well as other pars distalis cell types, were never labeled for mt1 melatonin receptor. Therefore, this study identifies the &quot;specific&quot; cells of the PT as the mt1 melatonin receptor-expressing cells."

These findings, and others from rat models of HD generated by lesions with mitochondrial toxins, suggest that the loss of CB1 receptors may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. To explore further the changes in the endocannabinoid system, as well as the potential of endocannabinoid-related compounds, we examined the status of CB1 receptors in the HD94 transgenic mouse model of HD. These mice express huntingtin exon 1 with a polyglutamine tract of 94 repeats in a tissue-specific and conditional manner using the tet regulatable system. They develop many features of HD, such as striatal atrophy, intraneuronal aggregates and progressive dystonia. In these animals, we analyzed mRNA levels for the CB1 receptor, in addition to the number of specific binding sites and the activation of GTP-binding proteins by CB1 receptor agonists. mRNA transcripts of the CB1 receptor were significantly decreased in the caudate-putamen of HD transgenic mice compared to age-matched littermate controls. The decrease concurred with a marked reduction in receptor density in both the caudate-putamen and its projection areas such as the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Furthermore, the efficacy of CB1 receptor activation was reduced in the globus pallidus, as determined by agonist-induced [35S]GTPgammaS binding, and tended towards a decrease in the substantia nigra. None of these changes was seen in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, despite high levels of expression of the mutant protein in these regions. The decrease in CB1 receptor levels was accompanied by a decrease in the proenkephalin-mRNA levels but not in substance P-mRNA levels. Taken together, these results suggest that the loss of CB1 receptor might be preferential to the enkephalinergic CB1 receptor-containing striatopallidal neurons, and further implicate the CB1 receptor to the subsequent HD symptomatology and neuropathology."

Nigrostriatal tract degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) produces downstream pathological disturbances in glutamate and GABA transmission. The present study examined whether changes in mGlu receptor gene expression may either contribute to, or compensate for these pathological changes in transmission. In situ hybridisation studies examined the levels of mGlu receptor mRNA in motor loop regions in rats bearing a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced unilateral nigrostriatal tract lesion. Gene expression was reduced in the lesion compared to intact hemispheres for mGlu(1) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc; 51.8+/-11.5%), mGlu(3) in the striatum and globus pallidus (11.7+/-2.8% and 18.9+/-1.4%, respectively) and mGlu(4) in the striatum and premotor cortex (13.8+/-2.7% and 15.8+/-5.5%, respectively). Loss of mGlu(1) mRNA in the SNc confirms that mGlu(1) is highly expressed on dopaminergic neurones where it may contribute to their vulnerability in PD. The down-regulation of mGlu(3) and mGlu(4) mRNA may reflect reduced transcriptional activity in response to increased levels of extracellular glutamate in these regions under parkinsonian conditions. These changes are likely to exacerbate the pathophysiological glutamate and GABA transmission within these regions in PD."

Recent studies have shown that the serine protease thrombin, depending on its concentration, plays an important role in neuronal degeneration or protection after cerebral ischemia. However, it is still uncertain whether a change in prothrombin or alterations in the expression of specific PAR-subtypes or PN-1 are associated with postischemic thrombin effects. Using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, we show that prothrombin was up-regulated in the hippocampal formation 24 h after transient global ischemia in rats (two-vessel occlusion with hypotension), whereas the expression of PN-1 and the expression of PAR-subtypes 1-3 did not change significantly. Thus, control of the balance between the expression of prothrombin and PN-1 may reflect an important mechanism that underlies postischemic thrombin effects."

To further investigate the central role of NMU in energy homeostasis, we examined the distribution of NMU transcript and the effect of intracerebroventricular administration on several physiological parameters and on the pattern of c-Fos activation. Here we report that intracerebroventricular administration of NMU to 24-h fasted rats resulted in a decrease in subsequent food intake and body weight gain. NMU administration activated neurons in several brain regions implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior. Activated cells included catecholaminergic neurons of the arcuate nucleus and brain stem. Distribution studies revealed NMU expression in the caudal brain stem (nucleus of the solitary tract and inferior olive) and pituitary, with significant levels in the pars tuberalis. This contradicts earlier published observations. In obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats, decreases in NMU expression were detected in the nucleus of the solitary tract, pars tuberalis, and pars distalis, whereas in the fasted rat, a decrease in NMU transcript was detected in the pars distalis. These results confirm the effects of NMU on feeding and suggest additional roles for NMU in neuroendocrine function."

They were characterized by a similar structure including the C-terminal LPLRF-NH2 motif. To clarify that the expression of these novel hypothalamic neuropeptides is a conserved property in vertebrates, we characterized a cDNA encoding a similar novel peptide, having LPLRF-NH2 from the goldfish brain, by a combination of 3' and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The deduced peptide precursor consisted of 197 amino acid residues, encoding three putative peptide sequences that included -LPXRF (where X is L or Q) at their C-termini. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed that a tridecapeptide (SGTGLSATLPQRF-NH2) was derived from the precursor in the brain as an endogenous ligand. Southern blotting analysis of reverse-transcriptase-mediated PCR products demonstrated a specific expression of the goldfish peptide gene in the diencephalon. In situ hybridization revealed the cellular localization of goldfish peptide mRNA in the nucleus posterioris periventricularis in the hypothalamus. Immunoreactive cell bodies were also restricted to the the nucleus posterioris periventricularis and the nervus terminalis and immunoreactive fibers were distributed in several brain regions including the nucleus lateralis tuberis pars posterioris and pituitary. Thus, the goldfish hypothalamus expresses a novel neuropeptide containing the C-terminal -LPQRF-NH2 sequence, which may possess multiple regulatory functions and act, at least partly, on the pituitary to regulate pituitary hormone release."

To determine whether these changes in the striatonigral pathway persist for longer we examined neuropeptide mRNA expression in the striatum and cytochrome oxidase activity in the output nuclei of the basal ganglia after treatment with multiple high doses of methamphetamine. Rats exposed to multiple high doses of methamphetamine had significant depletion in dopamine and serotonin content, decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, and decreases in preprotachykinin mRNA expression, 6 and 12 weeks after methamphetamine treatment. Preprotachykinin mRNA expression was significantly reduced by approximately 20% in the middle striatum and approximately 32% in the caudal striatum, 6 weeks after treatment. Twelve weeks after treatment, preprotachykinin mRNA expression continued to be significantly reduced by approximately 20% in the middle striatum and approximately 14% in the caudal striatum. Cytochrome oxidase histochemical staining in the entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata was not significantly different from that in controls at either time point. These data suggest that neurotoxic regimens of methamphetamine induce changes in striatonigral neurons that persist for up to 3 months, although there is some recovery."

Neurons of the globus pallidus can be divided into subpopulations based on anatomical, physiological, and chemical features. Globus pallidus neurons project to several structures (the striatum, subthalamic nucleus, entopeduncular nucleus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata), have one of two alternative waveforms (positive/negative versus negative/positive), contain either the calcium binding protein parvalbumin or the neuropeptide precursor preproenkephalin mRNA and show differential immediate early gene responses to dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists. The objective of the present study was to characterize in greater detail the preproenkephalin mRNA-containing pallidal neurons using Sprague-Dawley rats. In situ hybridization for preproenkephalin mRNA was combined with immunocytochemical detection of: (i) the neuron-specific nuclear protein, NeuN, (ii) FluoroGold-labeled pallidostriatal and pallidosubthalamic cells, or (iii) Fos induced by either systemic combined D1-class/D2-class dopamine receptor agonists or a D2-class receptor antagonist. These experiments demonstrated that a substantial population (42%) of globus pallidus neurons contains preproenkephalin mRNA, and that globus pallidus neurons retrogradely labeled after FluoroGold injections into the striatum are more frequently preproenkephalinergic, compared to the population of pallidosubthalamic neurons. Furthermore, systemic administration of a D2 receptor antagonist, eticlopride, induced Fos immunoreactivity predominantly in globus pallidus neurons expressing preproenkephalin mRNA, while combined administration of D1 and D2 receptor agonists induced Fos predominantly in pallidal neurons lacking preproenkephalin mRNA.These results support the conclusion that preproenkephalin mRNA identifies one of the two major subpopulations of pallidal neurons. This preproenkephalin mRNA-expressing pallidal subpopulation preferentially targets the striatum and is more readily activated in its immediate early gene expression by D2 receptor antagonists than by dopamine receptor agonists. This projection provides a pallidal substrate for the dopaminergic regulation of striatal information processing."

We investigated whether tripchlorolide, an immunosuppressive extract of Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, could exert similar neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects similar to those of FK506. It was found that tripchlorolide promoted axonal elongation and protected dopaminergic neurons from a neurotoxic lesion induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) at concentrations of as low as 10(-12) to 10(-8) M. In situ hybridization study revealed that tripchlorolide stimulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression. In vivo administration of tripchlorolide (1 microg/kg, ip) for 28 days effectively attenuated the rotational behavior challenged by D-amphetamine in the model rats by transection of the medial forebrain bundle. In addition, tripchlorolide treatment (0.5 or 1 microg/kg/day for 28 days) increased the survival of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta by 50 and 67%, respectively. Moreover, tripchlorolide markedly prevented the decrease in amount of dopamine in the striatum of model rats. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that tripchlorolide acts as a neuroprotective molecule that rescues MPP+ or axotomy-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which may imply its therapeutic potential for Parkinson's disease. The underlying mechanism may be relevant to its neurotrophic effect and its efficacy in stimulating the expression of BDNF."

Renal physiology";5;2002;"PAR-2 elicits afferent arteriolar vasodilation by NO-dependent and NO-independent actions.";"Proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) are a novel class of G protein-coupled receptors that respond to signals through endogenous proteinases. PAR activation involves enzymatic cleavage of the extracellular NH(2)-terminal domain and unmasking of a new NH(2) terminus, which serves as an anchored ligand to activate the receptor. At least four PAR subtypes have been identified. In the present study, we used the in vitro perfused hydronephrotic rat kidney to examine the effects of activating PAR-2 on the afferent arteriole. The synthetic peptide SLIGRL-NH(2), which corresponds to the exposed ligand sequence and selectively activates PAR-2, did not alter basal afferent arteriolar diameter but caused a concentration-dependent vasodilation (3-30 microM) of arterioles preconstricted by angiotensin II (0.1 nM). A modified peptide sequence (LSIGRL-NH(2), inactive at PAR-2) had no effect. This vasodilation was characterized by an initial transient component followed by a smaller sustained response. A similar pattern of vasodilation was seen when SLIGRL-NH(2) was administered to isolated perfused normal rat kidney. The sustained component of the PAR-2-induced afferent arteriolar vasodilation was eliminated by nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibition (100 microM nitro-L-arginine methyl ester). In contrast, the transient vasodilation persisted under these conditions. This transient response was not observed when afferent arterioles were preconstricted with elevated KCl, suggesting involvement of an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. Finally, RT-PCR revealed the presence of PAR-2 mRNA in isolated afferent arterioles. These findings indicate that PAR-2 is expressed in the afferent arteriole and that its activation elicits afferent arteriolar vasodilation by NO-dependent and NO-independent mechanisms."

The cell adhesion molecules integrin and Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) play important roles in neurite outgrowth and fasciculation. In the present study, we found that subchronic GDNF administration to the pars compacta of substantia nigra in rats increased the expression of integrin alphav and NCAM. Immunostaining results demonstrated the wide distribution of integrin alphav and NCAM in all mesencephalic neurons. The results also demonstrated the co-expression of TH with integrin alphav and NCAM in the same neurons of mesencephalic culture. Further, GDNF significantly increased integrin alphav expression in single TH-positive neurons. Function-blocking anti-integrin alphav and anti-NCAM antibodies antagonized the effects of GDNF on DA neuron survival, outgrowth, DA turnover, and locomotor activity in rats. These results demonstrate that integrin alphav and NCAM mediate the effects of GDNF on DA neuron survival and outgrowth during development and on DA turnover and motor function during adulthood."

A putative GH-cDNA was cloned from the pituitary by RT-PCR. The entire coding region comprised an open-reading frame of 203 amino acids (aa). The mature protein was also isolated from pituitaries, and fractionated by gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC. A putative GH was monitored by Western blotting with a rabbit antiserum against a synthetic peptide corresponding to pre-GH sequence (aa 29-45). Sequence analysis of the purified protein demonstrated that the prehormone consists of a signal peptide of 22 aa and the mature protein of 181 aa, which shows 25% sequence identity with sturgeon GH. The site of production was identified through immunohistochemistry to be cells of the dorsal half of the proximal pars distalis of the pituitary. Following cDNA cloning of lamprey IGF cDNA, it was shown using RT-PCR that lamprey GH stimulates IGF expression in lamprey liver. This is the first study in which a member of the GH/prolactin/somatolactin family has been identified in an agnathan. In addition, GH appears to be the only member of this hormone family in the sea lamprey. Evidence suggests that GH is the ancestral hormone in the molecular evolution of the GH family and that the endocrine mechanism for growth stimulation was established at an early stage of vertebrate evolution."

More than 20 different RGSs have been identified and at least 10 are expressed in the CNS. The present study describes in detail the localization in the rat brain of one member of this family, RGS2. The distribution of RGS2 mRNA and protein has been studied in parallel by performing in situ hybridization and immunoautoradiography on adjacent rat brain sections. Our localization study reveals that RGS2 mRNA and protein are widely expressed in the brain. Protein and mRNA are mostly colocalized such as in neocortex, piriform cortex, caudate-putamen, septum, hippocampus, locus coeruleus. Some mismatches were also observed such as presence of mRNA but not protein in the paraventricular nucleus, the substantia nigra pars compacta and the red nucleus, suggesting that RGS2 protein is present in neuronal projections. Previous reports describing an induction of RGS2 mRNA in the rat striatum after psychostimulants (amphetamine, cocaine) led us to focus on the distribution of RGS2 in the basal ganglia circuitry. The absence of RGS2 mRNA and protein in the globus pallidus suggests that RGS2 would play its regulatory role more in the direct (striatonigral) than in the indirect (striatopallidal) striatal output pathway. In addition, to delineate the implication of RGS2 in pre- and/or postsynaptic functions in the basal ganglia, we performed lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and striatal quinolinic acid lesions. The 6-OHDA lesion did not modify RGS2 mRNA or protein levels in the caudate-putamen whereas the intrastriatal quinolinic acid infusion caused a marked reduction of RGS2 mRNA and protein in the lesioned zone. These data indicate that RGS2 is predominantly expressed in intrinsic striatal neurons. Moreover, the absence of detectable change in RGS2 expression after injections of 6-OHDA suggests also that RGS2 is not primarily involved in the hypersensitization of postsynaptic dopamine receptors observed after lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway."

By means of in situ hybridization histochemistry, we examined the consequences of ibotenate-induced unilateral lesion of intralaminar thalamic nuclei on mRNA expression of cytochrome oxidase subunit-I (CoI) in the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and of the two isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67) in the striatum, globus pallidus (GP), entopeduncular nucleus (EP) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). In the striatum, GAD67 mRNA expression decreased selectively in the rostral part of the structure at 5 and 12 days postlesion (approximately -30%), whereas, GAD65 mRNA levels was downregulated only in the caudal striatum at 12 days (-29%). In both the striatum and STN, CoI mRNA expression decreased ipsilaterally at 5 and bilaterally at 12 days. In GP, GAD67 and GAD65 mRNA expression decreased ipsilaterally at 5 (-20% and -26%) and 12 days (-23% and -36%). In EP, selective bilateral decreases in GAD67 mRNA expression were found at 5 and 12 days (-50% and -40%). Conversely, in SNr, only GAD65 mRNA expression was reduced bilaterally at both time points. These data show that the thalamus exerts a widespread excitatory influence on the basal ganglia network that cannot be accounted for solely by its known direct connections. Given the recent data showing that intralaminar thalamic nuclei are a major nondopaminergic site of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, these results may have a critical bearing on understanding the cellular basis of basal ganglia dysfunction in parkinsonism."

The present study examined the action of dopamine receptor agonists on c-fos gene expression in the subthalamic nucleus in normal rats. We found that systemic administration of the dopamine D1/5 receptor agonist, SKF 82958 (1 mg/kg), induces c-fos expression in the subthalamic nucleus. In contrast, systemic administration of the dopamine D2/3 receptor agonist, quinelorane (2 mg/kg) had no effect. When combined, SKF 82958 and quinelorane induced c-fos expression in subthalamic neurons that was similar to that found following administration of SKF 82958 alone. We also examined c-fos expression in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, the major projection area for subthalamic neurons, and found that SKF 82958, but not quinelorane, caused an induction of c-fos expression in this area. In order to clarify the mechanisms underlying the SKF 82958-mediated induction of c-fos expression in the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, in situ hybridization for the dopamine D1, D2, D3 and D5 receptor mRNAs was performed. The only significant observation was that D5 receptor mRNA is expressed in subthalamic neurons. The present data show that dopamine, via D1/D5 receptors, upregulates c-fos expression in subthalamic neurons, and that the high expression of D5 receptors in this area might be involved. Taken together, these data suggest that dopamine D1/5 receptors are more important for the action of dopamine in the so-called indirect pathway of the basal ganglia circuitry than what is recognized in current models of basal ganglia organization."

Sequence analysis indicated that the catalytically active 66-kDa protein comprised an N-terminally located oviductin protease and two CUB domains. The oviductin gene was transcribed as a part of 6-kb mRNA that was expressed specifically in the cells lining the bottom of epithelial folds in the oviductal pars recta, and this expression was highly accelerated when the pars recta fragments were cultured in the presence of hCG. Western blot analyses using antibodies against a protease domain revealed that the catalytically inactive 102-kDa proteins in the pars recta granules yield 66-kDa catalytically active and 82- and 59-kDa inactive molecules.

Both blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were significantly increased in rats exposed to HgCl(2) relative to control rats, indicating the induction of ARF resulting from HgCl(2) exposure. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that, in addition to necrosis of proximal tubule epithelial cells, necrosis of macula densa cells and swelling of glomerular epithelial cells were observed in the renal cortex of rats with HgCl(2)-induced ARF. Consequently, the number of pars maculata segments was decreased by 42% in rats with HgCl(2)-induced ARF compared to control rats. The primary sites of bNOS mRNA and protein expression were macula densa cells and glomerular epithelial cells in the renal cortex of control rats and rats with HgCl(2)-induced ARF. The abundance of the bNOS mRNA and protein was significantly decreased in rats with HgCl(2)-induced ARF relative to control rats. These observations suggest that the production of the vasodilator NO derived from bNOS is decreased at the glomerulus level in the HgCl(2)-induced ARF setting. Thus, the reduction in bNOS expression may in part contribute to the progression of HgCl(2)-induced ARF through the deterioration of glomerular hemodynamics. In addition, the decrease in bNOS expression may be primarily the result of cell injury caused by the cytotoxic effect of HgCl(2)."

Especially the dopaminergic cells, located in the pars compacta of SN (SNc), are of great neurologic interest, because the functional deficit and depletion of these cells are the correlate of Parkinson's disease. We used a combination of in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on sections of human postmortem mesencephalon to investigate the expression of GABA(A) receptor subunit messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and of the receptor protein in dopaminergic SN cells. Immunohistochemical detection of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the pivotal enzyme of dopamine synthesis, was used to define the boundaries of SN pars reticulata (SNr) and pars compacta subregions. In SNr, all neurons were labeled by subunit-specific oligonucleotide probes and the amount of GABA(A) receptor mRNA expression was quantified as alpha(1) = beta(2) &gt; gamma(2) &gt; alpha(3). In contrast, in SNc, only around 25% of neurons expressed mRNA transcripts of GABA(A) receptor subunits, quantified as alpha(1) = beta(2) &gt; gamma(2) &gt; alpha(3) &gt; alpha(4) = beta(3). In approximately the same percentage of neurons, which were labeled by alpha(1)-subunit-specific probe, the alpha(1)-subunit also was detected at the protein level by a specific monoclonal antibody. We, therefore, could demonstrate that a subset of dopaminergic neurons in human SNc receive inhibitory synaptic input by means of GABA(A) receptors mainly of the alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) subtype. This might represent a negative feedback loop between the striatum and the SNc and be a target of pharmacologic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease."

TH neurons have been localized by the use of two complementary techniques, immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization of TH messenger RNA. Results obtained from in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry were in agreement. TH cells were observed in many areas of the brain, with a higher density at the level of the olfactory bulbs where TH-positive neurons are abundant in the internal cell layer. In the telencephalon, two populations of TH neurons can be distinguished: one group is located in the area ventralis telencephali pars dorsalis, and the other group is located in the area ventralis telencephali pars ventralis and extends laterally in the area ventralis telencephali pars lateralis. Many labeled neurons are also seen in the preoptic area as well as in the hypothalamus, where several clusters of TH-positive cells are observed. Some of these neurons located in the paraventricular organ grow a short cytoplasmic extension directed to the ventricular wall and are known to be cerebrospinal fluid-contacting cells. The most caudal TH neurons are observed at the level of the locus caeruleus. At the level of the pituitary, TH-positive fibers are observed in the neurohypophysis. The TH-immunoreactive innervation at the level of the pituitary provides a neuroanatomic basis for the effects of dopamine and/or norepinephrine on the release of pituitary hormones in fish."

Although endothelial dysfunction and neutrophil activation have been demonstrated in women with preeclampsia (PE), the expression and regulation of PARs have not been defined in PE. In this study, we measured the expression of PARs in ECs and in neutrophils derived from normal and preeclamptic pregnancies. We also examined the effects of placental factors on PAR expression in these cells in vitro. ECs were isolated from umbilical cords (human umbilical vein ECs) from normal and preeclamptic pregnancies. Neutrophils were isolated from blood obtained from nonpregnant, uncomplicated pregnant, and preeclamptic women. Total RNA was extracted from the first-passage (P1) ECs (normal and PE) and from normal P1 ECs incubated with conditioned media derived from normal and preeclamptic placental cultures. The mRNA expression of thrombin receptor (PAR1), PAR2, and PAR3 was measured by ribonuclease protective assay. The expression of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control for each sample. We found that: 1) PAR1 expression was enhanced in ECs from PE, compared with ECs from normal pregnancies; 2) PAR2 expression was expressed in PE ECs but not in normal ECs; 3) neutrophils from nonpregnant women, normal, and preeclamptic pregnancies expressed PAR2, whereas only neutrophils from normal and preeclamptic pregnancies expressed PAR1; and 4) factors released from preeclamptic placenta up-regulated PAR1 and PAR2 expression in ECs but not in neutrophils. We conclude that mRNA expression of PAR1 and PAR2 is increased in ECs derived from preeclamptic pregnancies. Up-regulation of thrombin receptor expression in neutrophils may be a unique phenomenon during pregnancy but not apparently unique to PE. Factors released from the placenta are likely candidates in regulating PAR expression in ECs and may contribute to the platelet activation and vascular endothelial dysfunction in PE."

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme of the synthetic pathway of catecholamines, is a good marker to assess potential effects of Meth in catecholaminergic (particularly in dopaminergic) systems. In the rat, prolonged neonatal Meth exposure altered several dopaminergic markers (TH activity and gene expression) in substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) and in caudate-putamen (TH activity) when animals matured. However, it was never verified whether gestational exposure to Meth might compromise TH enzyme in the pups during the neonatal immature periods. The present study was designed to address this issue by analyzing TH gene expression, measured by in situ hybridization in SN and ventral tegmental area (VTA), dopaminergic areas that are well characterized as target areas for Meth, and in rats prenatally exposed to this psychostimulant. To this end, dated pregnant Wistar rat dams received 5 mg Meth hydrochloride/kg body weight/day. It was administered subcutaneously from gestational day 8 until 22. The control group was pair-fed and saline injected, using the same experimental protocol as for Meth-treated dams. On the day of birth (postnatal day 0, PND 0), litters were culled to 8 pups, sex-balanced whenever possible, and were followed until the day of sacrifice (PND 7, 14, or 30). Meth treatment differentially affected TH mRNA levels in VTA and SN, in an age- and gender-dependent manner. Thus, TH mRNA levels were decreased in the VTA of PND 7 and PND 14 females gestationally exposed to Meth; this effect was not evident in males or on PND 30. TH mRNA levels also tend to decrease in SN of PND 14 females gestationally exposed to Meth. Collectively, the present results indicated that gestational Meth exposure affects TH gene expression in the postnatal life, a phenomenon that appears to be transient, since it is no longer evident by the end of the first month of life in the rat."

In black-adapted animals, melanotrope cells produce and release alpha-melanophore-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). In white-adapted animals, the activity of melanotrope cells is inhibited by neuronal input. Using Western blotting and immunocytochemistry at the light and electron microscopical level, we have detected both the BDNF precursor and the mature BDNF protein in Xenopus melanotrope cells. In situ hybridization and RT-PCR revealed the presence of BDNF mRNA in the pituitary pars intermedia, indicating that BDNF is synthesized in the melanotropes. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that levels of BDNF mRNA in melanotrope cells are about 25 times higher in black- than in white-adapted animals. Although there is no difference in the amount of stored mature BDNF, the amount of BDNF precursor protein is 3.5 times higher in melanotropes of black-adapted animals than in those of white-adapted animals. These data indicate that BDNF mRNA expression and BDNF biosynthesis are up-regulated in active melanotrope cells. Because immunoelectron microscopy showed that BDNF is located in melanotrope secretory granules, BDNF is probably coreleased with alpha-MSH via the regulated secretory pathway. Superfusion and (3)H-amino acid incorporation studies demonstrated that BDNF stimulates the release of alpha-MSH and the biosynthesis of its precursor protein, POMC. Our results provide evidence that BDNF regulates the activity of Xenopus melanotrope cells in an autocrine fashion."

Long-term pharmaco-physiological effects of GDNF on developing dopaminergic (DA) neurons have not yet been explored because of technical difficulties in producing prolonged cell type-specific delivery of this neurotrophic factor in mammalian embryonic brain. The current studies used our previously characterized 9.0-kb tyrosine hydroxylase promoter to produce transgenic mice with neuronal cell type-specific expression of GDNF in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and locus coeruleus (LC). These mice were used to test the parsimonious hypothesis that increased developmental expression of GDNF in SNc and LC would significantly enhance the number of postmitotic adult neurons. To our surprise, adult transgenic mice carrying the TH9.0kb-GDNF hybrid gene showed dramatic reductions in both the numbers and the volumes of SNc-DA and LC-noradrenergic (NA) neurons by quantitative morphometric analysis. The decrease in the number of DA neurons was apparent as early as postnatal day 2, the period before the major naturally occurring apoptotic cell death in midbrain. Aged transgenic mice exhibited no further significant deficits in motor behaviors. These data suggest that continuous, early developmental GDNF expression exerts physiological effects on newly differentiated, immature dopamine neurons that differ from those observed on more mature and adult DA neurons. Further elucidation of the mechanisms underlying differential GDNF actions will greatly improve the pharmacological efficacy of GDNF in fetal neural transplantation as well as adult neuronal gene therapy in PD patients."

In the amphibian Xenopus laevis, the synthesis and release of alpha-melanophore-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) from these cells is a dynamic process dependent upon the colour of background. In animals on a black background, there is a higher level of synthesis and secretion of alpha-MSH than in animals on a white background, and, consequently, there is skin darkening in animals on a black background. The melanotropes are innervated by hypothalamic neurones that produce neuropeptide Y (NPY), a peptide that inhibits alpha-MSH secretion via the NPY Y1 receptor. The inhibitory neurones have a higher expression of NPY in animals adapted to a white background and both the size and the number of inhibitory synapses on the melanotrope cells are enhanced. The purpose of the present study was to determine if this presynaptic plasticity displayed by the inhibitory neurones is reciprocated by postsynaptic plasticity (i.e. if there is an enhanced expression of the Y1 receptor in melanotropes of animals adapted to a white background). For this purpose quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the level of Y1 receptor mRNA in melanotropes of animals undergoing the process of background adaptation. The results showed that there is a higher Y1 receptor mRNA expression in melanotropes of white-adapted animals. We conclude that the inhibitory neuroendocrine interface in the Xenopus pars intermedia displays postsynaptic plasticity in response to changes of background colour. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a physiological environmental change leading to changes in postsynaptic receptor expression in a fully identified vertebrate neuroendocrine reflex."

The central mechanisms mediating this response are unknown. The present study determined regional brain activity using semi-quantitative analysis of c-fos mRNA, after induction of nest-building behaviour by PGF(2alpha) in Large White pseudopregnant pigs. Oestradiol valerate injections (5 mg/day) were given on days 11-15 of the oestrous cycle to induce pseudopregnancy. The pigs were housed individually in pens (2.8 x 1.7 m) containing straw. On the test day (day 46 or 47 of pseudopregnancy) animals were injected with 3 ml saline (n=5) or 15 mg of PGF(2alpha) (Lutalyse, Upjohn; n=6) intramuscularly. Pigs treated with PGF(2alpha), but not saline, displayed bouts of rooting, pawing and gathering straw, which we interpret as nest building behaviour. The pigs were killed 65 min after treatment, which was 30 min after peak nest building activity, and the brain, uterus and ovaries removed for processing using in situ hybridisation. Saline-treated pigs had elevated levels of c-fos mRNA, compared to background, in the pituitary, corpus luteum and uterus, and a lower, but elevated, level of expression in cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb. PGF(2alpha)-treated pigs had significantly higher levels of c-fos mRNA expression than saline-treated pigs in the parvocellular and magnocellular regions of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus (including the pars dorso-medialis), the neural lobe of the pituitary gland and the cerebellum. PGF(2alpha)-treated pigs also had significantly higher c-fos induction in corpus luteum. These data show that the pattern of c-fos mRNA expression in specific brain areas is different between pigs that show PGF(2alpha)-induced nest building and saline-injected controls."

Expression of melatonin receptor (Mel(1c)) mRNA was demonstrated in the chick pars tuberalis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Northern blot analyses revealed that, after pinealectomy, common alpha-subunit mRNA levels were increased in the pars tuberalis of chicks kept under normal lighting (L:D=12 h:12 h), indicating that melatonin inhibits the synthesis of the alpha-subunit of PT-specific cells. Furthermore, alpha-subunit mRNA levels in the pars tuberalis were shown to display similar photoperiod-dependent changes in pinealectomized chicks as in intact animals. Levels of alpha-subunit mRNA in the pars tuberalis were decreased in both pinealectomized and control chicks kept under continuous light (L:D=24 h:0), whereas the levels were enhanced in pinealectomized chicks kept under extended darkness (L:D=1 h:23 h) and under normal lighting. Thus, pinealectomy did not affect the inhibition or stimulation of the alpha-subunit synthesis in the chicken pars tuberalis elicited by continuous light or extended darkness, respectively. Quantitative electron-microscopic analyses showed that, after exposure to continuous light for 30 days, many PT-specific cells were filled with enlarged secretory granules in both pinealectomized and control chicks. Exposure to extended darkness for 30 days caused an increase in the cytoplasmic and nuclear areas of the PT-specific cells. Secretory granules were however larger in pinealectomized than in intact control chicks. These results suggest that the activity of PT-specific cells is mainly regulated by photoperiod."

The number and position of cysteine and N-glycosylation in each of the beta subunits of FSH and LH, which are considered essential for assembly of the alpha subunit, are well conserved between the newt and other tetrapods. The high homology (41.6%) between the beta subunits of newt FSH and LH imply less specificity of FSH and LH in gonadal function. One cDNA encoding the common polypeptide chain alpha subunit of FSH and LH was also isolated from the newt pituitary gland. The mRNAs of FSHbeta, LHbeta, and the alpha subunit were expressed only in the pituitary gland among various newt tissues. Double-staining with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed coexpression of FSHbeta and LHbeta in the same newt pituitary cells. Ovariectomy induced a significant increase in FSHbeta mRNA levels, but there was no significant change in LHbeta or alpha subunit mRNA levels compared with those in control animals. Taken together, these data suggest that two kinds of gonadotropins, namely FSH and LH, are expressed in the same gonadotropin-producing cells in the pars distalis of the newt as well as in other tetrapods and that the expression of FSHbeta is negatively regulated by the ovaries."

Seven proteins were up-regulated (188.1-750% compared to control) in response to the lesion: amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2), kininogen, glucokinase, tropomyosin alpha chain, type brain-1 and calpactin I light chain; whilst four proteins, neural epidermal growth factor-like 2, minichromosome maintenance 6, and thyroid hormone receptor beta-2, were down-regulated (to between 36% and 59% of levels in sham-operated controls). Three proteins that did not match with available data in the SWISS-PROT protein database were also determined. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated colocalization of APLP2 and tyrosine hydroxylase in the nigral neurons. Moreover, reduction of APLP2-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta as well as the increases in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and in the striatum were observed. Furthermore, the conditioned medium of the Chinese hamster ovary cells over-expressing APLP2-751 (chondroitin sulphate-modified), but not APLP2-763 (nonchondroitin sulphate-modified), was able to increase the number of the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in fetal mesencephalic cultures. These results suggest that the expression of APLP2, a protein that has been thought to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, is up-regulated in the striatum following dopaminergic denervation. They also support the view that chondroitin sulphate-modified APLP2 protein may play an important role in the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system."

Intramuscular injection of the synthetic prostaglandin F2alpha (cloprostenol) also induces luteolysis but no nest-building behaviour is observed. The effects of PGF2alpha, but not cloprostenol, on nest-building behaviour may be mediated via peripheral PGF2alpha receptors (FP) or via direct action on central FP receptors. We have previously shown FP receptor mRNA to be localized in porcine paraventricular nucleus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SON) and pars dorso-medialis of the suproptic nucleus (SOD), suprachiasmatic nucleus, choroid plexus and anterior and intermediate pituitary lobes. In this experiment, we examined hypothalamic expression of the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun mRNA after treatment with PGF2alpha or cloprostenol. Twenty-one 8-month-old nulliparous female pigs (gilts) were injected intramuscularly with a luteolytic dose of PGF2alpha (15 mg), cloprostenol (175 microg) or saline control, their behaviour was recorded and they were killed 60 min later. Coronal hypothalamic sections and control ovarian tissues were incubated with 45-mer oligonucleotide probes complementary to porcine c-fos and c-jun genes using standard in situ hybridization histochemistry techniques. Significantly higher c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression was found in PGF2alpha-treated compared to saline or cloprostenol-treated pigs in the PVN, SON and SOD. Significantly higher c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression was found in corpus lutea of PGF2alphaand cloprostenol-treated pigs compared to saline controls. Treatment with PGF2alpha induced nest-building behaviour whereas treatment with cloprostenol and saline did not. This suggests that PGF2alpha, or one of its metabolites, and not cloprostenol, crosses the blood-brain barrier and acts directly on hypothalamic receptors to mediate its effect on nest-building behaviour."

We have recently demonstrated the occurrence of two somatostatin isoforms in the frog brain, namely somatostatin-14 (SS1) and [Pro(2),Met(13)]somatostatin-14 (SS2). In the present study, we demonstrate that the gene encoding the SS2 precursor (PSS2) is actively expressed in the intermediate lobe of the frog pituitary. High concentrations of PSS2 mRNA have been detected by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization in the frog pars intermedia but not in the pars distalis or pars nervosa. The distribution of PSS1- and PSS2-derived peptides has been investigated by immunohistochemistry using two antisera directed against SS1 and the sequence 54-66 of PSS2 (PSS2(54-66)), respectively. The SS1 antiserum stained only a network of fibers in the neural lobe and a few nerve processes in the intermediate lobe. In contrast, the PSS2(54-66) antiserum produced intense labeling of melanotrope cells in the pars intermedia. Biochemical characterization of the immunoreactive materials present in pituitary extracts was performed by combining high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and RIA detection. The SS1 RIA revealed the existence of two major immunoreactive peaks that exhibited the same retention times as synthetic SS1 and SS2. The PSS2(54-66) RIA detected a single peak that likely corresponds to the N-flanking peptide of SS2 (PSS2(1-66)). The present study reveals that melanotrope cells of the frog pituitary selectively express the PSS2 gene and fully process PSS2 to generate the mature somatostatin variant SS2. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence that the gene encoding a hypophysiotropic neuropeptide is intensely expressed in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary."

The primary signal transduction mechanism of the melatonin receptor in this tissue is an inhibition of cAMP signaling. However, nothing is known about the endocrine signals that activate cAMP synthesis in the cells of the PT, as previous studies relied on the pharmacological tool, forskolin, to stimulate cAMP synthesis. Here we show that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) activates cAMP synthesis in the cells of the PT. The pharmacology of cAMP activation by PACAP peptides suggests that cAMP activation is mediated by the type I PACAP receptor. PACAP treatment of PT cells results in cellular responses that are consistent with cAMP activation in these cells, including activation of MAPK and elevation of melatonin receptor mt1 mRNA expression. These responses can be inhibited by melatonin, demonstrating that activation of cAMP occurs within the melatonin-responsive cells. However, although PACAP activates cAMP in the cells of the PT, the effect of PACAP may not be direct, as colocalization in situ hybridization studies demonstrates that the type I PACAP receptor and the melatonin mt1 receptor do not colocalize on the cells of the PT."

Here, we studied the activity of endogenous RNA polymerase I upon partial and complete unraveling of nucleoli and FCs. The pattern of BrUTP incorporation in nuclei of hypotonically-treated cells was shown to be essentially the same as in the control untreated cells. Moreover, the sites of BrUTP incorporation, which revealed the active PNA polymerase I, were completely coincident with UBF-binding sites. These observations allow to conclude that structural integrity of FCs is not a prerequisite for maintenance of the active RNA polymerase I transcriptional complex. When the action of hypotonic shock was ceased and the cells were transferred to a complete cultural medium, the swollen nucleoli recovered to the control state. Therefore it is possible to conclude that none of the main morphological nucleolar counterparts, such as FCs, dense fibrillar component or the pars granulosa, is responsible for the maintenance of the nucleolar structural and functional integrity. A suggestion is made that this role may be played by the nucleolar matrix associated with the RNA polymerase I transcriptional complex."

Classically, this disease has been associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and locus ceruleus, without Lewy body pathology. We have sequenced the parkin gene of 38 patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease (&lt;41 years). Two probands with mutations were followed up. Clinical evaluation of their families was performed, blinded to both genetic and pathological findings. Chromosome 6q25.2-27 haplotype analysis was carried out independently of the trait; parkin gene expression was examined at both the RNA and protein levels. Haplotype analysis of these families revealed a common chromosome 6, with a novel 40 bp exon 3 deletion that cosegregated with disease. In the proband of the smaller kindred, an exon 7 R275W substitution was identified in addition to the exon 3 deletion; RNA analysis demonstrated that the mutations were on alternate transcripts. However, Lewy body pathology typical of idiopathic Parkinson's disease was found at autopsy in the proband from the smaller kindred. These data suggest that compound heterozygous parkin mutations and loss of parkin protein may lead to early-onset parkinsonism with Lewy body pathology, while a hemizygous mutation may confer increased susceptibility to typical Parkinson's disease."

In adult mice, there is an up-regulation of Bax in the SNpc after MPTP administration and a decrease in Bcl-2. These changes parallel MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. We also show that mutant mice lacking Bax are significantly more resistant to MPTP than their wild-type littermates. This study demonstrates that Bax plays a critical role in the MPTP neurotoxic process and suggests that targeting Bax may provide protective benefit in the treatment of Parkinson's disease."

Novel members of the relaxin peptide family.";"We have identified a novel human relaxin gene, designated H3 relaxin, and an equivalent relaxin gene in the mouse from the Celera Genomics data base. Both genes encode a putative prohormone sequence incorporating the classic two-chain, three cysteine-bonded structure of the relaxin/insulin family and, importantly, contain the RXXXRXX(I/V) motif in the B-chain that is essential for relaxin receptor binding. A peptide derived from the likely proteolytic processing of the H3 relaxin prohormone sequence was synthesized and found to possess relaxin activity in bioassays utilizing the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, that expresses the relaxin receptor. The expression of this novel relaxin gene was studied in mouse tissues using RT-PCR, where transcripts were identified with a pattern of expression distinct from that of the previously characterized mouse relaxin. The highest levels of expression were found in the brain, whereas significant expression was also observed in the spleen, thymus, lung, and ovary. Northern blotting demonstrated an approximately 1.2-kb transcript present in mouse brain poly(A) RNA but not in other tissues. These data, together with the localization of transcripts in the pars ventromedialis of the dorsal tegmental nucleus of C57BLK6J mouse brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry, suggest a new role for relaxin in neuropeptide signaling processes. Together, these studies describe a third member of the human relaxin family and its equivalent in the mouse."

However, their intracerebral targets and physiological functions are largely unknown. Here, we show that four distinct subtypes of protease-activated receptors (PARs) are abundantly expressed in the adult rat brain and in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. PAR-1 expression was significant in the hippocampus, cortex and amygdala. Highest densities of PAR-2 and PAR-3 were observed in hippocampus, cortex, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus and striatum. Apart from the striatum, a similar localization was found for PAR-4. Within the hippocampal formation, each PAR subtype was predominantly localized in the pyramidal cell layers. Additionally, we identified PAR-2 in mossy fibers between dentate gyrus and CA3, PAR-3 in the subiculum and PAR-4 in CA3 and in mossy fibres as well as in the stratum lacunosum moleculare. After exposing hippocampal slice cultures to a severe experimental ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation), the expression of PARs 1-3 was up-regulated with subtype-specific kinetics. The localization of PARs in brain regions particularly vulnerable to ischemic insults as well as distinct alterations in the expression pattern after experimental ischemia support the notion of an important role of extracellular serine proteases and PARs in cerebral ischemia."

Certain proteases are believed to be involved in development and repair processes and most likely regulate multiple functions of the CNS by activating PARs. Three members of this family (PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4) are considered thrombin receptors, whereas PAR-2 is activated by trypsin. In the present study, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunocytochemistry, and Ca(2+) mobilization studies, we demonstrate that PAR-1, PAR-2, PAR-3, and PAR-4 are functionally co-expressed in cultured rat astrocytes. Short-term stimulation of astrocytes with thrombin, trypsin, and peptides corresponding to the tethered ligand domains of PAR-1, PAR-2, PAR-3, and PAR-4 induced a transient rise of [Ca(2+)](i) in cultured astrocytes. In studying calcium signaling, based on receptor desensitization, and using an antagonist of thrombin receptor PAR-1, we provide evidence that the thrombin-induced [Ca(2+)](i) response in astrocytes in addition to PAR-1 stimulation, involves also stimulation of PAR-3 and PAR-4. Trypsin, in addition to PAR-2, can also activate PAR-1 and PAR-4. Furthermore we find that activation of PAR-1, and PAR-2 induces proliferation of astrocytes while PAR-4 activation exerts toxic effects. This study is the first to show that (1) cultured astrocytes functionally express PAR-3 and PAR-4 together with PAR-1 and PAR-2; (2) PAR-3-activating peptide (TFRGAP) is effective in eliciting Ca(2+) signaling; and (3) activation of different PARs leads to distinct downstream effects."

Group 2 guinea pigs were euthanized with no further manipulation. In male offspring, prenatal dexamethasone exposure resulted in a significant reduction in brain-to-body weight ratio. Dexamethasone-exposed male offspring exhibited reduced basal and activated plasma cortisol levels, which was associated with elevated hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) mRNA and increased plasma testosterone. In females exposed to glucocorticoids in utero, basal and stimulated plasma cortisol levels were higher in the follicular and early luteal phases of the cycle, but this effect was reversed in the late luteal phase, indicating a significant interaction of sex steroids. In female offspring (at estrus), glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels were lower in the paraventricular nucleus and pars distalis but higher in the hippocampus in animals exposed to dexamethasone in utero. Hippocampal MR mRNA levels were significantly lower (approximately 50%) than in controls. In conclusion, repeated antenatal glucocorticoid treatment programs HPA function in a sex-specific manner, and these changes are associated with modification of corticosteroid receptor expression in the adult brain and pituitary."

PARs are most likely involved in various biological responses, such as hemostasis and regulation of muscle tone; however, the roles of PARs in the functions of inflammatory and immune cells are poorly understood. Because eosinophils are most likely involved in allergic inflammation and are exposed to a variety of proteases derived from allergens and other inflammatory cells, we investigated whether PARs regulate effector functions of eosinophils. Human eosinophils constitutively transcribe mRNA for PAR2 and PAR3, but not those for PAR1 and PAR4. The expression of PAR2 protein was confirmed by flow cytometry. When trypsin, an agonist for PAR2, was incubated with eosinophils, it potently induced superoxide anion production and degranulation; 5 nM trypsin induced responses that were 50-70% of those induced by 100 nM platelet-activating factor, a positive control. In contrast, thrombin, an activator for PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4, showed minimal effects. The stimulatory effect of trypsin was dependent on its serine protease activity and was blocked 59% by anti-PAR2 Ab. Furthermore, a specific tethered peptide ligand for PAR2 potently induced superoxide production and degranulation; the effects of peptide ligands for PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 were negligible. These findings suggest that human eosinophils express functional PAR2, and serine proteases at the inflammation site may play important roles in regulating effector functions of human eosinophils. The expression and functional relevance of other PARs still need to be determined."

To date, only PAR1 has been reported to mediate relaxation of human arteries despite endothelial cell expression of both PAR1 and PAR2 in these tissues. Because inflammatory stimuli increase PAR2 expression in human endothelial cells in culture, the present study investigated the effect of similar stimuli on PARs in human isolated coronary arteries (HCAs). In HCA ring segments suspended for isometric tension measurements, the selective PAR1-activating peptide, TFLLR (0.01 to 10 micromol/L), caused endothelium-dependent relaxation of precontracted preparations. Little or no change in vascular tension was elicited by either the PAR2- or PAR4-activating peptides, SLIGKV and GYPGQV, respectively (up to 100 micromol/L). Exposure of HCAs to interleukin (IL)-1alpha (1 ng/mL, 12 hours) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (3 nmol/L, 12 hours) did not affect PAR1 expression but increased PAR2 and PAR4 mRNA levels by approximately 5- and 4-fold, respectively, as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Similar IL-1alpha treatment did not affect TFLLR-induced relaxations but revealed significant endothelium-dependent relaxations to SLIGKV (100 micromol/L, 61.4+/-6.7%) and GYPGQV (100 micromol/L, 34.8+/-6.4%). These studies are the first to demonstrate functional PAR2 and PAR4 in human arteries in situ. The selective upregulation of PAR2 and PAR4 expression and the increased vascular response in HCAs after exposure to inflammatory stimuli suggest a role for these endothelial receptors during inflammation."

GDNF binds with high affinity to the GDNF family receptor alpha-1 (GFRalpha-1), which is highly expressed in the midbrain. Using anatomical and lesion techniques, we demonstrated that GFRalpha-1 was expressed in DAergic and non-DAergic neurons in the rat midbrain. Immunohistochemical characterization of GFRalpha-1-expressing neurons indicated that most of the neurons that were immunopositive for the DAergic marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expressed GFRalpha-1 in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC). In contrast, fewer TH-containing neurons expressed GFRalpha-1 in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Depletion of GFRalpha-1/TH neurons was observed in the SNC following treatment with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA); however, GFRalpha-1 expression remained in some neurons located in the SNR. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic nature of GFRalpha-1-expressing neurons located in the SNR, which were resistant to (6-hydroxydopamine) 6-OHDA, was established by their expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD; the synthesizing enzyme for GABA). Further analysis indicated that coexpression of GFRalpha-1 and GAD varied in a rostrocaudal gradient in the SNR, substantia nigra pars lateralis (SNL), and VTA. Midbrain DAergic and GABAergic neurons have been previously classified according to their Ca(2+) binding protein (CaBP) content; thus, we also sought to investigate the proportion of midbrain GFRalpha-1-expressing neurons containing parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB), and calretinin (CR) in the midbrain. Although GFRalpha-1 expression was found mainly in CB- and CR-immunoreactive neurons, it was rarely observed in PV-immunolabeled neurons. Analysis of the proportion of GFRalpha-1-expressing neurons for each CaBP subpopulation indicated the coexistence of GFRalpha-1 with CR in the VTA and all subdivisions of the SN; double-labeled GFRalpha-1/CR neurons were distributed in the SNC, SNR, SNL, and VTA. GFRalpha-1/CB neurons were also detected in the SNC, SNL, and VTA. Expression of GFRalpha-1 in DAergic and non-DAergic neurons in the rat SN and VTA suggests that GDNF, via GFRalpha-1, might modulate DAergic and GABAergic functions in the nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and nigrothalamic circuits of the adult rat."

The plasminogen activator/plasmin and matrix degrading metalloproteinase (MMP) cascades act together in the remodeling of matrix and cell-matrix contacts. Previously we have shown that the formation of capillary structures by human foreskin microvascular endothelial cells (hMVECs) in a 3-dimensional fibrin matrix requires a functional urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR). Here we report on the unexpected finding that inhibition of hMVEC-derived MMP activity by BB94 (batimastat) increased the outgrowth of capillary structures in a fibrin matrix. BB94 prevented the release of the u-PA binding domain D1 of u-PAR and thereby increased the number of functional u-PARs on hMVECs without affecting the u-PAR messenger RNA levels. Comparison of various types of protease inhibitors pointed to the prime involvement of MMP activity. Using recombinant MMPs it was shown that MMP-12 activity was able to release the D1 domain of cellularly expressed u-PAR. In addition, the expression of MMP-12 in control and basic fibroblast growth factor/tumor necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated hMVECs was shown by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, suggesting that endothelial cell-derived MMP-12 may be involved in angiogenesis-related u-PAR shedding. This new mechanism of u-PAR cleavage provides new insights into the mutual interactions between the MMP and u-PA/plasmin systems. Moreover, it may be helpful in the interpretation of recent data on the use of specific MMP inhibitors in the treatment of several types of cancer."

Pregnant guinea pigs (n = 15) were deprived of food (water ad libitum) or fed normally (n = 13) on days 50 and 51 of gestation, after which they were all fed normally (birth = 68 days). Carotid artery and jugular vein catheters were implanted in adult guinea pig offspring (day 65). Animals were treated with corticotropin (ACTH(1-24); 0.5 microg/kg), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH; 0.5 microg/kg) and insulin (5 units/kg), and pituitary-adrenal responses were measured. Guinea pigs were then euthanized and pituitaries removed for analysis of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA levels. There was no effect of prenatal treatment on body weight, blood pressure or heart rate. In male offspring, both basal ACTH (p &lt; 0.007) and basal cortisol (p &lt; 0.05) levels were significantly reduced in animals whose mothers had been nutrient restricted (NR). In contrast, in female offspring, basal plasma ACTH was not different between offspring from NR mothers and controls; however, basal plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly (p &lt; 0.01) elevated at 13.00 h in females born to NR mothers. Responses to HPA challenge were different between offspring from NR mothers and control offspring, and these differences were consistent with alterations in basal adrenocortical function. There was no effect of prenatal treatment on POMC mRNA levels in the pars distalis or pars intermedia. However, GR mRNA levels were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced in adult female offspring born to NR mothers.

In the pars tuberalis (PT), we have shown that photoperiod modifies the amplitude of the clock gene Per1. The aim of this study was to test whether the endogenous melatonin signal is required for rhythmic expression of Per1 in the PT. Male Syrian hamsters housed in long days (LD, 16:8h light:dark) were pinealectomized and Per1 mRNA expression studied by in situ hybridization. Pinealectomy abolished the rhythm of Per1 expression in the PT, but had no effect on Per1 expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), or the ventromedial nucleus (VMH) of the hypothalamus. Interestingly, a single night-time injection of melatonin (25 microg), given to pinealectomized animals, failed to restore Per1 expression in the PT. These data demonstrate that Per1 expression in the PT is driven by melatonin, and that the features of the endogenous signal through which the Per1 expression is achieved cannot be reproduced by a single melatonin injection."

PAR2 activators, added to the basolateral membrane, caused a transient, Ca2+-dependent increase in short-circuit current (I(sc)), followed by a sustained inhibition of amiloride-sensitive I(sc). These phases corresponded with a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and then a transient increase, followed by decrease, in basolateral K+ permeability. After PAR2 activation and the addition of amiloride, the forskolin-stimulated increase in I(sc) was also attenuated. By contrast, PAR2 activators added to the apical surface of the epithelia or PAR1 activators added to both the apical and basolateral surfaces were without effect. PAR2 may, therefore, play a role in the airway, regulating Na+ absorption and anion secretion, processes that are central to the control of airway surface liquid volume and composition."

In parkinsonian brain, D(1) receptor mRNA was increased in the nucleus accumbens, while a decrease was detected in the substantia nigra pars compacta. No change in D(1) mRNA levels was found in the other brain areas examined. An increase in the density of specific [(3)H]-SCH23390 binding sites was found in the anterior putamen and a decrease in the external segment of the globus pallidus, no changes were detected elsewhere. This study demonstrates that regulation of D(1) receptor expression in the brain of patients dying with Parkinson's disease that were treated with L-DOPA is confined to small alterations in restricted brain regions."

Mint1 and mint2 are neuron-specific. We localized these isoforms in mouse brain. By in situ hybridization, mRNA encoding mint1 or mint2 was expressed in neurons throughout the brain. Mint1 mRNA expression was greatest in the limbic system including cingulate cortex, hippocampus, anterior thalamic nuclei, medial habenular nucleus, and mammillary body. Mint2 mRNA was rich in cerebral cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus, but less prominent in other limbic structures. Mint1 mRNA and mint2 mRNA were distributed among hippocampal pyramidal neurons, while mint2 mRNA was especially abundant in CA3. Mint1, but not Mint2 mRNA was abundant in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Immunohistochemistry visualized mint proteins in axon terminals and neuronal somata, generally following mRNA distribution. In the hippocampus, mint1 was rich in the entorhinal projections and mossy fibers of the dentate gyrus, while mint2 was rich in commisural fibers from the contralateral hippocampus and in CA1. Mint1 intensely stained catecholamine-containing neurons such as the substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral tegmental area, and locus ceruleus. Mint2 protein was ubiquitous in these regions. Mint1 and mint2 distribution also differed elsewhere in the brainstem and in the cerebellum. Central nervous system neurons, then, predominantly express either mint1 or mint2. Mints may be involved in synaptic vesicle transport toward the active zone, also participating in transport of certain membrane proteins toward the postsynaptic density. Mint1 and mint2 may divide roles either regionally or depending on neuronal functional characteristics."

Here, we showed, for the first time, that thrombin induced myometrial contraction. To determine the mechanism of thrombin-induced myometrial contraction, we simultaneously measured intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and tension of fura-PE3-loaded rat myometrium using front-surface fluorimetry. The expression of thrombin receptor mRNA in the rat myometrium were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT - PCR analysis). Thrombin (0.01 - 3 u ml(-1)) caused dose-dependent increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and tension in the rat myometrium, and this effect was greatly enhanced in the pregnant myometrium. PAR1-activating peptide mimicked the effects of thrombin. In Ca(2+)-free PSS, thrombin induced no increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and tension in the pregnant myometrium. Both diltiazem (10 microM) and SK-F 96365 (10 microM) significantly inhibited the thrombin-induced elevations of [Ca(2+)](i) and tension, and their effects were additive. RT - PCR analysis revealed an approximately 10 fold increase in the level of thrombin receptor mRNA in the pregnant myometrium compared to that obtained in the non-pregnant myometrium. In conclusion, the contractile response to thrombin was greatly enhanced in the pregnant myometrium, mainly due to the up-regulation of thrombin receptor. We propose that initiation of a post-parturitional myometrial contraction is one of the most important physiological roles of thrombin receptor."

By RT-PCR and DNA sequencing we identified the expression of rhodopsin and components linked to its deactivation, including rhodopsin kinase, recoverin, and visual arrestin. We also detected the expression of transducin (T-alpha), phosphodiesterase (PDE-alpha), and cGMP-gated channel alpha-subunits. Cultured NPE cells responded to treatment with phorbol ester by enhancing the expression of rhodopsin mRNA three- to fourfold. Indirect immunofluorescence of the intact ciliary epithelium with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against rhodopsin, rhodopsin kinase, and visual arrestin revealed labeling preferentially restricted to the NPE cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of whole lysates from the pars plicata region of the human ciliary epithelium with MAbs demonstrated immunochemical cross-reactivity with proteins of molecular mass similar to rhodopsin (36 kDa), rhodopsin kinase (64 to 66 kDa), and arrestin (48-52 kDa) from the human retina. These results provide the first molecular evidence that components of a non-visual phototransduction pathway are expressed in the human ocular NPE ciliary epithelium, which may be linked to circadian entrainment tasks."

The extent of the lesion was measured with striatal catecholamine content, striatal binding of (125)I-RTI-121 to dopamine transporter (DAT), and DAT expression in the SNpc. GABA(B) receptors in mice brain were evaluated using (3)H-CGP54626 and its expression was measured with oligonucleotides probes targeting the mRNAs of GABA(B(1a+b)), GABA(B(1a)), GABA(B(1b)), GABA(B(2)) subunits. In monkeys, (125)I-CGP64213 and selective probes for GABA(B(1a+b)) and GABA(B(2)) mRNAs were used. In mice, dopamine content, (125)I-RTI-121 binding, and DAT expression were reduced by 44%, 40%, and 39% after a dose of 40 mg/kg of MPTP and 74%, 70%, and 34% after 120 mg/kg of MPTP, respectively. In monkeys, dopamine content and DAT expression were decreased by more than 90% and 80%, respectively. In the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus, GABA(B) receptors were unchanged following MPTP in both species. In the SNpc of mice, MPTP (120 mg/kg) induced a significant decrease of (3)H-CGP54626 binding (-10%) and of the expression of GABA(B(1a+b)) mRNA (-13%). The decrease of the expression of GABA(B(1a+b)) mRNA was correlated with dopamine content, (125)I-RTI-121 binding and DAT expression. In MPTP-treated monkeys, (125)I-CGP64213 binding (-40%), GABA(B(1a+b)) mRNA (-69%) and GABA(B(2)) mRNA (-66%) were also significantly decreased in the SNpc. Our results suggest that MPTP-induced denervation is associated with a decrease of GABA(B) receptors restricted to the SNpc.

AptKv3.3 expression was brain specific, with the highest level of expression in the cerebellum and 56% relative expression in the ELL. In situ hybridization revealed that AptKv3.3 mRNA was present in virtually all cell classes in the ELL as well as in the cerebellar lobes eminentia granularis pars posterior (EGp) and corpus cerebellum (CCb). Immunocytochemistry indicated a distribution of AptKv3.3 channels over the entire soma-dendritic axis of ELL pyramidal, granule, and polymorphic cells and over the soma and at least proximal dendrites (100 microm) of multipolar cells and neurons of the ventral molecular layer. AptKv3.3 immunolabel was present at the soma of cerebellar granule, golgi, eurydendroid, and CCb Purkinje cells, with an equally intense label throughout the dendrites of CCb Purkinje cells and EGp eurydendroid cells. Immunolabel was virtually absent in afferent or efferent axon tracts of the ELL but was detected on climbing fiber axons and on the axons and putative terminal boutons of CCb Purkinje cells. These data reveal a prominent soma-dendritic distribution of AptKv3.3 K+ channels in both principal output and local circuit neurons, a pattern that is distinct from the soma-axonal distribution that characterizes all other Kv3 K+ channels examined to date. The widespread distribution of AptKv3.3 immunolabel in electrosensory cells implies an important role in several aspects of signal processing."

The 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced destruction of the nigrostriatal pathway resulted in contralateral rotation to apomorphine and a marked loss of specific [(3)H]mazindol binding in the striatum (93%; P&lt;0.05) and of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA in substantia nigra pars compacta (SC) (93%; P&lt;0.05) compared with control rats.

Lesioning with 6-OHDA had no effect on glutathione peroxidase mRNA levels in any region of basal ganglia examined. The significant changes in Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD mRNA indicate that SOD is primarily expressed by dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway, and that the Mn-SOD gene appears to be inducible in rat basal ganglia in response to both physical and chemical damage 5 weeks after 6-OHDA-lesioning. These findings may clarify the status of antioxidant enzymes, particularly Mn-SOD, in patients with Parkinson's disease and their relevance to disease pathogenesis."

The mechanism of trypsin-induced contraction in the rat myometrium was investigated using front-surface fluorimetry on fura-PE3-loaded strips. The expression of protease-activated receptors (PARs) in the rat myometrium was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT - PCR). 2. In non-pregnant rats, 10 microM trypsin developed a force of up to 30.5 +/- 5.1% of that obtained during the 40 mM K(+)-depolarization-induced contraction. In pregnant rats, the maximal level of the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and tension obtained with 3 microM trypsin was 143.2 +/- 6.0% and 63.2 +/- 7.9%, respectively. The depletion of the extracellular Ca2+ abolished the trypsin-induced contraction. 3. Trypsin-induced contraction was abolished by the pre-treatment of a serine protease inhibitor. PAR1-activating peptide (PAR1-AP) caused a potent contraction of the myometrium, while neither PAR2-AP nor PAR4-AP induced any contraction. 4. RT - PCR analysis detected the expression of PAR1 mRNA. However, neither PAR2 nor PAR4 mRNA was detected in the rat myometrium. 5. Once the strips were stimulated with thrombin, the subsequent application of thrombin failed to induce any contraction, while trypsin induced a contraction similar to that observed without the pre-stimulation with thrombin. Once the strip was stimulated with trypsin, neither trypsin nor thrombin induced any contraction. The response to PAR1-AP remained after the pre-stimulation with thrombin and trypsin. 6. In conclusion, PAR1 was the only known receptor for trypsin expressed in the rat myometrium, but it was suggested to be cleaved and inactivated by trypsin. Trypsin was thus suggested to contract the rat myometrium via a novel type of PAR, which might be upregulated during pregnancy."

We report the identification of CART gene expression in the GH3 pituitary cell line. We have used activators of the cAMP or protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction pathways to show that, in GH3 cells, CART is transcriptionally up-regulated by activators of the cAMP signal transduction pathway. We also identify CART gene expression in ovine pars tuberalis (PT) tissue and primary cell cultures. In PT cells in contrast to GH3 cells, CART gene expression is upregulated by activators of the PKC signal transduction pathway. Cultured cells have provided a valuable resource for the detailed analysis of specific regulatory mechanisms underlying transcriptional or translational regulation of genes, signal transduction events and many other cellular processes. GH3 and PT cells may therefore provide a resource for the further detailed molecular analysis of the events regulating CART gene expression and processing."

Hemizygous families have been described that may harbor mutations outside of the open reading frame. The parkin gene promoter has yet to be characterized, and therein, mutations in hemizygous families may plausibly be identified. To identify the promoter of the parkin gene, the transcription start site was defined by a combination of primer extension and 5' RACE. Five kilobases of DNA 5' to the parkin start codon were directly sequenced from a BAC containing parkin exon 1 and evaluated for promoter motifs. The parkin promoter lacks TATA or CAAT boxes and appears to share homology to the alpha-synuclein promoter. Deletion constructs demonstrated core promoter activity and tissue specific enhancing regions in HEK-293T and SH-SY5Y cells."

The present study examined the extent to which compensatory changes in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) gene and protein expression may underlie this behavioral recovery. In normal cats, TH and DAT protein levels were higher in the dorsal vs. ventral striatum. Expression of DAT and TH mRNA was higher in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) than in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). In symptomatic parkinsonian animals, DAT and TH protein levels were significantly decreased in all striatal areas studied. TH and DAT mRNA expression in residual SNc neurons were decreased a mean 32% and 38%, respectively. DAT gene expression in residual VTA neurons in symptomatic animals was decreased 30% whereas TH gene expression was unaffected. In spontaneously recovered cats, TH protein levels were significantly higher than the levels in symptomatic cats only in the ventral striatum, whereas no increase in DAT protein levels were observed in any striatal area. Residual neurons in most ventral mesencephalic regions of recovered cats had increased TH mRNA expression but not increased DAT gene expression, compared with symptomatic animals. Thus, increased TH protein and mRNA and suppression of DAT protein and mRNA expression in the striatum and ventral mesencephalon were associated with functional recovery from MPTP-induced parkinsonism."

The aim of this study was to analyse the nature of the photoperiodic regulation of prolactin gene expression, and to define the role of melatonin and the pars tuberalis of the anterior pituitary in this process. Pituitary prolactin gene expression, restricted to the pars distalis, was increased in hamsters maintained in long daylengths (16 h : 8 h, light : dark) compared to hamsters exposed to short daylengths (8 h : 16 h, light : dark) for 8-12 weeks. Analysis of single cells by in situ hybridization showed that photoperiod had no effect on the percentage of pars distalis cells expressing prolactin mRNA, but shifted the frequency distribution of prolactin mRNA expression per cell, such that in long photoperiods a greater proportion of cells were recruited to a higher expressing population. In vitro coculture of hamster pars tuberalis fragments increased prolactin promoter-driven luciferase activity in stably transfected GH3 cells in a dose- and duration-dependent manner. Conditioned medium from hamster and ovine pars tuberalis also activated the prolactin promoter. Furthermore, basal and forskolin-stimulated conditioned medium from hamster pars tuberalis increased prolactin mRNA expression in primary cultures of pars distalis cells. Melatonin attenuated the activity of pars tuberalis-conditioned medium but had no direct effect on either prolactin mRNA expression or secretion in pars distalis cell cultures. Finally, pars tuberalis fragments from long photoperiod hamsters stimulated prolactin gene promoter activity to a greater extent than those from short photoperiod hamsters. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence in a seasonal mammal that the synthesis of prolactin depends on photoperiodic modulation of a pars tuberalis-derived factor. Our data support further the hypothesis that seasonal modulation of prolactin gene expression depends upon a melatonin-dependent paracrine action of the pars tuberalis on pars distalis lactotrophic cells."
"21318776";"PARS";"PARS AND RNA";"Methods in molecular medicine";3;2001;"Dopamine transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter knockout mice : implications for Parkinson's disease.";"One of the most valuable methods for understanding the function of a particular protein is the generation of animals that have had the gene encoding for the protein of interest disrupted, commonly known as a &quot;quo;knockout&quot;quo; or null mutant. By incorporating a sequence of DNA (typically encoding antibiotic resistance to aid in the selection of the mutant gene) into embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination, the normal transcription of the gene is effectively blocked (Fig. 1). Since a particular protein is encoded by two copies of a gene, it is necessary to have the gene on both alleles &quot;quo;knocked out.&quot;quo; This is performed by cross-breeding animals with one affected allele (heterozygote) to generate offspring that have inherited two mutant alleles (homozygote). This procedure has been used to generate animals lacking either the plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT; Fig. 2) or the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2; Fig. 3). Both DAT and VMAT2 are essential for dopamine homeostasis and are thought to participate in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (1-5). Fig. 1. Maps of the targeting vector and the mock construct. The mouse genomic fragment (clone 11) was isolated from a Stratagene 129 SvJ library by standard colony hybridization using a PCR probe from the 5' end of rat cDNA. The restriction site abbreviations are as follows: H, HindIII; N, NotI; Sc, SacI; Sn, SnaI; X, XbaI; and Xh, XhoI. The region between HindIII and SnaI on clone 11 containing the coding sequence from transmembrane domains 3 and 4 of VMAT2 was deleted and replaced with PGK-neo. The 3' fragment of clone 11 was reserved as an external probe for Southern analysis. To facilitate PCR screening of embryonic stem cell clones, a mock construct containing the SnaI/XbaI fragment and part of the Neo cassette was generated as a positive control. pPNT and pGEM4Z were used to construct knockout and mock vectors, respectively.

(A) Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA.

(B) RT-PCR analysis of mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA. For each reverse transcription assay, 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was used. Equal volumes of cDNA templates were used for each PCR assay. The PCR primers used flank the neomycin cassette for the purpose of detecting potential readthrough of the neomycin DNA. The heterozygote has a reduced amount of transcripts compared with the wild-type littermate; the homozygote is devoid of VMAT2 transcripts. G3PDH was used as internal control. (C) Western blot analysis of wholebrain synaptic vesicles. Samples (25 μg) of vesicles were solubilized and separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-VMAT2-Ct (top) or anti-a-tubulin (bottom) antibodies, and developed with chemiluminescence. Molecular mass markers (kDa) are shown to the left. To confirm equal loading and transfer of proteins, the blots were stripped and reprobed with an antibody to α-tubulin. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 1). The importance of DAT in neuronal function is highlighted in animals in which DAT has been genetically deleted (DAT KO) (3). In the homozygote DAT KO mice, released dopamine remains in the extracellular space up to 300 times longer than normal. As expected, these animals display behaviors consistent with persistent activation of dopamine receptors, such as hyperlocomotion. Genetic deletion of VMAT2 reveals the essential role of vesicular storage and release of monoamines. Homozygote VMAT2 knockout mice survive for only a few days, whereas heterozygotes appear normal. Studies performed in homozygote pups and heterozygote adults clearly show that the level of VMAT2 expression calibrates the level of vesicular filling (1,2,bi4). With only 50% of normal VMAT2, heterozygote animals have reduced vesicular filling and release. These alterations in presynaptic monoamine function in the heterozygotes are thought to be responsible for the observed sensitization to the psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine and to ethanol (1). Knockout animals also appear to parallel the changes that occur in reserpinized animals, suggesting that the adverse actions of this drug are mediated by VMAT2."

Here we evaluate trkB (both full-length and truncated forms) and trkC expression in the striatum, cortex, and substantia nigra after intrastriatal injection of quinolinic acid (QUIN) at different stages of postnatal (P) development, by RNase protection assay and in situ hybridization. During normal development, a region-specific regulation of trkB and trkC was observed, showing the maximal mRNA levels at P5. Excitotoxic lesion did not modify striatal trkB mRNA levels at any age examined. However, trkC decreased after QUIN injection at P5 in the striatum (52 +/- 2% of control levels). On the other hand, regulation of trkB and trkC expression was observed in cortex and substantia nigra after striatal excitotoxic lesion. Both full-length and truncated receptor isoforms of trkB were enhanced in the cortex when striatal injury was produced at P21 (268 +/- 38 and 206 +/- 35%) or P30 (174 +/- 35 and 157 +/- 13%). In situ hybridization studies localized this increase in trkB expression in layers II/III and V along the cerebral cortex. Within the substantia nigra, striatal excitotoxicity at P5 selectively decreased the truncated form of trkB (70 +/- 7%), whereas the full-length form was up-regulated at P30 (130 +/- 2%). A biphasic increase in trkC mRNA levels was observed at P5 (151 +/- 3%) and P21 (168 +/- 4%). These changes were localized in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Triple-labeling studies disclosed that all these changes were mainly located in neurons. These results demonstrate that the endogenous response to excitotoxicity includes transneuronal regulation of neurotrophin receptors, which is specific for each nucleus and depends on the developmental stage."

On the basis of our previous studies, we proposed that this effect is sex-specific. Pregnant guinea pigs were treated with dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) or vehicle on d50-51 of gestation, and juvenile offspring were euthanized at rest or following isolation stress on postnatal day 18. Dexamethasone increased the length of gestation (1.5 days) and altered body and organ (brain, heart, adrenal) growth. Resting plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly elevated in young male, but not female guinea pigs exposed to dexamethasone as fetuses. In female offspring born to dexamethasone-treated mothers, cortisol responses to isolation stress were attenuated. In males, elevated basal cortisol levels were not increased further by isolation. In the brain, hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA levels were significantly lower (10-25%) in females exposed to dexamethasone in utero. In contrast, GR mRNA levels were elevated (10-20%) in males from this prenatal treatment group. Mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA in the limbic system and GR mRNA levels in the pars distalis were unaffected. Pro-opiomelanocortin mRNA was significantly lower (30%) in the male pars intermedia following dexamethasone exposure. In conclusion, prenatal glucocorticoid exposure affects growth and HPA function as well as limbic and hypothalamic GR expression in juvenile offspring, and these effects are highly sex-specific."

The commercial broiler chicken has been intensively selected over generations for increased body weight, achieved largely through increased FI. This has resulted in a contemporary animal that does not regulate FI to maintain energy balance, and represents a model for hyperphagia and obesity if allowed unrestricted access to feed. In the present study, the distribution of NPY mRNA was mapped in the brain of juvenile, broiler-strain chicken, and results interpreted in the context of previous data for strains that do not exhibit hyperphagia. NPY mRNA was widely distributed in the broiler brain, and highly expressed in the hippocampus, nucleus commissurae pallii, infundibular hypothalamic nucleus, nucleus pretectalis pars ventralis and neurons around the nucleus rotundus. Moderately labeled neurons were found in the lateral septal organ, nucleus periventricularis hypothalamus and nucleus paraventricularis magnocellularis. The pallium exhibited only sparse labeling. Generally, the distribution of cell groups expressing NPY mRNA was consistent with those regions exhibiting NPY immunoreactivity, and also matches the distribution of receptor binding sites reported in the literature for the chicken brain. This suggests that NPY may be involved in functions controlled by these regions. The observation of NPY gene expression in brain regions involved in appetite regulation is consistent with the recognized importance of NPY in FI regulation in a variety of species, and with the chronic hyperphagia, characteristic of the broiler."

The adult rats were unilaterally lesioned by the injection of 6-hydroxydopamine to their left medial forebrain bundles. At 5-10 weeks following the dopaminergic denervation, the levels of GABA(A)R in the left caudate-putamen and globus pallidus were about 20 and 16% lower than that of the right intact (control) sides, as shown by [3H]flunitrazepam binding autoradiography on the brain sections. However, the receptor density increased to around 132 and 130% of control levels in the entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata of the lesioned sides. Furthermore, in situ hybridization analysis exhibited parallel trends of changes in the levels of the GABA(A)R alpha1 and alpha2 subunit and mGluR5 mRNAs in the neurons of the brain regions with that of the proteins detected by the binding assay. A number of the rats 5 weeks postlesion were transplanted with the ventral mesencephalon of the embryonic rat into their left striata. Five weeks later, the changes in the [3H]flunitrazepam binding seemed to be recovered by approximately 50-63% on the grafted sides of the areas. Moreover, the transplantation appeared to produce a nearly complete reversal of the lesion-induced alterations in the levels of the mRNAs. Thus, the data indicate the mechanism of gene regulation for the modified expression of the receptors and could implicate the participation of the receptors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease."

Low levels of alpha7 transcript were detected within substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), substantia nigra pars reticularis (SNpr) and VTA.

A small number of immunoreactive prolactin cells appeared first on embryonic day 15 in control (injected with oil) pituitary glands, whereas they did not increase in number until postnatal day 2. In diethylstilbestrol-treated mice (5 mg/kg body weight, 24 h before killing), a small number of immunoreactive prolactin cells were detectable as early as embryonic day 14, but not on day 13. They increased in number on embryonic days 15 and 16, and decreased markedly on days 17 and 18, followed by a rapid increase after birth. This transient reduction in the response to diethylstilbestrol was partially restored by treatment with metyrapone, a specific inhibitor of corticosteroid production. These results suggest that in the mouse: (1) differentiation of prolactin cells occurs between embryonic days 13 and 14, (2) prolactin gene expression is suppressed in the nascent prolactin cells presumably due to the presence of high levels of estrogen-binding protein, alpha-fetoprotein, and (3) prolactin gene expression is also suppressed by elevation of circulating glucocorticoids during the perinatal period. The present results suggest that, in the mouse, at least a proportion of prolactin cells are not derived from growth hormone cells, because the diethylstilbestrol-induced prolactin cells appear earlier than growth hormone gene expression."

Recently, a family of protease-activated receptors (PARs) has been described and four members of the family characterised and cloned, including the previously recognised thrombin receptor. This study investigated whether PARs mediate the action of trypsin on aldosterone secretion. Using intact rat adrenal capsular tissue, thrombin was found to increase aldosterone secretion, and the effects of trypsin on aldosterone secretion were confirmed. Both trypsin and thrombin were shown to activate phospholipase C, as measured by an increase in inositol triphosphate turnover by adrenal capsular tissue. It was also shown that U73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, attenuated the aldosterone response to trypsin. These effects were consistent with the activation of a PAR. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of mRNA encoding PAR-1, but not PARs-2, -3 or -4 in the adrenal capsule/zona glomerulosa. Messenger RNA encoding PAR-1 was increased by dietary sodium depletion, consistent with previous reports of an increased response to trypsin after sodium depletion. These data suggest that the actions of trypsin on aldosterone secretion are mediated by PAR-1."

Detection of POMC mRNA, and of ACTH and alpha-MSH immunoreactivity was first noted at Day 40 of gestation in the pars intermedia (PI) and the pars distalis (PD). After Day 70, alpha-MSH immunoreactivity was confined to the PI whereas POMC mRNA and ACTH immunostaining remained in both the PI and the PD. Increases (P &lt; 0.05) of POMC mRNA expression were observed in the PI between Days 50-70 and levels then remained constant to Day 141 (term, 145 days). In the basal region of the PD, POMC mRNA expression was high at Day 40, declined (P &lt; 0.01) by Day 50 and then increased progressively to Day 141 of gestation. The proportion of ACTH-immunopositive cells in the PD also fell from 14% at Day 40 to 11.4% at Day 70 and then increased to 15.3% by Day 141. In contrast, neither the level of POMC mRNA expression nor the percentage of corticotrophs changed in the region of the PD immediately adjacent to the PI. These data provide evidence for differential processing of POMC in a tissue-specific manner during early fetal pituitary development."

Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the effects of cortisol on the fetal HPA axis in the presence and absence of increased placental estradiol production. We obtained fetal plasma samples and pituitary tissue from animals that had received an infusion of either cortisol, cortisol and 4-hydroxyandrostenedione (40HA, an aromatase inhibitor), saline, or saline + 40HA controls. Cortisol significantly decreased plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations, and in the presence of 40HA reduced pituitary proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA levels in the pars distalis. There was no effect of any treatment on the expression of the key POMC processing enzymes, prohormone convertase-1 or -2 in the fetal pituitary. Conversely, levels of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA in the pituitary were increased with cortisol treatment in the absence of increased estradiol. We suggest that in the late-gestation sheep fetus, cortisol and estradiol have opposite effects on pituitary POMC and GR mRNA expression, and interact to regulate these key components of the fetal HPA axis."

Animals were placed in one of three different photoperiod regimens: (1) normal control (light:dark = 12 h:12 h), (2) continuous light (L:D = 24 h:0), and (3) extended darkness (L:D = 1 h:23 h). The levels of common alpha-subunit mRNA in the pars tuberalis were examined by Northern blot analysis and compared with those in the pars distalis. In chicks exposed to continuous light for 1 week, alpha-subunit mRNA level in the pars tuberalis was decreased, although the level in the pars distalis was increased. Exposure to continuous light for 30 days also induced a decrease in alpha-subunit mRNA level in the pars tuberalis. On the other hand, in chicks exposed to extended darkness for 1 week, the alpha-subunit mRNA level of the pars tuberalis was markedly increased. In situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled common alpha-subunit cRNA probe also showed that the hybridization signals for alpha-subunit mRNA in the pars tuberalis cells become weak under continuous light for 30 days but they are very intense under extended darkness. Thus, the synthesis of alpha-subunits in the chick pars tuberalis was inhibited by continuous light but stimulated by extended darkness. These results were confirmed by semiquantitative electron-microscopic analyses. After exposure to continuous light for 30 days, many pars tuberalis (PT)-specific cells were filled with enlarged secretory granules, showing the reduction of secretory activity. On the contrary, extended darkness for 30 days induced hypertrophy of the PT-specific cells; the areas of cytoplasm and nucleus were significantly increased. In addition, secretory granules became small in size and exocytotic features were more frequent. Mitochondria and lysosomes were also increased in number. Thus, the synthetic and secretory activities of the PT-specific cells were increased under extended darkness. The data indicate that the specific cells of the pars tuberalis are responsive to photoperiodic changes in the chick."

Pt-specific cells possess melatonin receptors and reveal morphological changes dependent on the duration of the photoperiod. Furthermore, in hamsters the transmission of photoperiodic stimuli to the endocrine system is influenced by melatonin, an effect which is likely to be mediated by Pt-specific cells. In monkeys, however, only little is known about this cell type. Therefore, we studied the ultrastructural differentiation of Pt-specific cells and describe the expression of different hormones and their mRNA by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Apparently the Pt consists of (1) cells similar to gonadotropic cells of the Pd, (2) folliculostellate cells and (3) a cell population which is morphologically and functionally clearly distinct from all other cell types found in the Pd. Morphologically they resemble the Pt-specific cells found in other species. Regarding the expression of secretory products there is evidence that they transcribe and translate the beta-TSH subunit. Although there is a strong signal for the mRNA of the common alpha-chain, protein staining is much weaker. POMC mRNA is expressed in the Pt while there is no evidence for PRL mRNA. The present results lead to the conclusion that the Pt of the monkey contains Pt-specific cells which express different hormonal subunits as was already shown for other species. In context with previous findings of melatonin receptors in the monkey Pt further investigations are necessary to establish the possible role of Pt-specific cells in the photoperiod-dependent generation of endocrine rhythms."

After grafting, the number of rotations was decreased and hybridization signals overlying cells in the grafted striatum were detected. Mean grain densities overlying labeled neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of grafted rats were compared to those of shamgrafted rats and revealed differential expression of dopamine transporter mRNA, whereas synaptic vesicular monoamine transporter mRNA and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression showed no difference.

In addition, the effect of aODN on the specific binding of the NMDA receptor ligand [(3)H]MK-801 was also examined in various brain areas, including the midbrain. Antisense ODN against the NR1 mRNA, the corresponding sense ODN (sODN) or saline was continuously administered into the right ventricle of rats by osmotic minipumps for 7 days (20 nmol/day). Autoradiographic binding studies indicated that aODN significantly reduced the density of [(3)H]MK-801 binding by an average of 20-30% in several forebrain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate putamen, and nucleus accumbens. However, [(3)H]MK-801 binding was not significantly altered in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC). Subsequently, using the technique of extracellular single-unit recording, the number, as well as the firing pattern, of spontaneously active DA neurons was determined in the VTA and SNC. The administration of aODN did not significantly alter the number of spontaneously active VTA and SNC DA neurons compared to saline- of sODN-treated animals. Furthermore, the firing pattern of spontaneously active SNC DA neurons was not significantly altered. However, for spontaneously active VTA DA neurons, the administration of aODN significantly decreased the percent events in bursts, number of bursts, and percentage of DA neurons exhibiting a bursting pattern compared to saline- and sODN-treated animals, i.e., neurons show less bursting activity. The present results suggest that subchronic aODN treatment against the mRNA for the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptors can reduce NMDA receptor number and can result in an altered activity of spontaneously active VTA DA neurons in anesthetized rats."

These observations suggest a pathogenic role for alpha-synuclein in PD. Thus far, however, little is known about the importance of alpha-synuclein in the nigral dopaminergic pathway in either normal or pathological situations. Herein, we studied this question by assessing the expression of synuclein-1, the rodent homologue of human alpha-synuclein, in both normal and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mice. In normal mice, detectable levels of synuclein mRNA and protein were seen in all brain regions studied and especially in ventral midbrain. In the latter, there was a dense synuclein-positive nerve fiber network, which predominated over the substantia nigra, and only few scattered synuclein-positive neurons. After a regimen of MPTP that kills dopaminergic neurons by apoptosis, synuclein mRNA and protein levels were increased significantly in midbrain extracts; the time course of these changes paralleled that of MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. In these MPTP-injected mice, there was also a dramatic increase in the number of synuclein-immunoreactive neurons exclusively in the substantia nigra pars compacta; all synuclein-positive neurons were tyrosine hydroxylase-positive, but none coexpressed apoptotic features. These data indicate that synuclein is highly expressed in the nigrostriatal pathway of normal mice and that it is up-regulated following MPTP-induced injury. In light of the synuclein alterations, it can be suggested that, by targeting this protein, one may modulate MPTP neurotoxicity and, consequently, open new therapeutic avenues for PD."

In situ hybridization revealed that BDNF mRNA is strongly expressed by dopaminergic neurons in control substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). In clinically and neuropathologically typical PD, SNpc BDNF mRNA expression is reduced by 70% (P = 0.001). This reduction is due, in part, to loss of dopaminergic neurons which express BDNF. However, surviving dopaminergic neurons in the PD SNpc also expressed less BDNF mRNA (20%, P = 0.02) than their normal counterparts. Moreover, while 15% of control neurons had BDNF mRNA expression &gt;1 SD below the control mean, twice as many (28%) of the surviving PD SNpc dopaminergic neurons had BDNF mRNA expression below this value. This 13% difference in proportions (95% CI 8-17%, P &lt; or = 0.000001) indicates the presence of a subset of neurons in PD with particularly low BDNF mRNA expression. Moreover, both control and PD neurons displayed a direct relationship between the density of BDNF mRNA expression per square micrometer of cell surface and neuronal size (r(2) = 0.93, P &lt;/= 0.00001) which was lost only in PD neurons expressing the lowest levels of BDNF mRNA. If BDNF is an autocrine/paracrine factor for SNpc dopaminergic neurons, loss of BDNF-expressing neurons may compromise the well-being of their surviving neighbors. Moreover, neurons expressing particularly low levels of BDNF mRNA may be those at greatest risk of injury in PD and possibly the trigger for the degeneration itself."

At present, it is unclear how these signals influence phenotype. To elucidate this, we have used cDNA microarray technology to examine changes in transcriptional program in human fibroblasts in response to exposure to FVIIa. cDNA microarrays revealed that FVIIa binding to TF up-regulated the expression of Cyr61 and CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), the genes that encode extracellular matrix signaling proteins Cyr61 and CTGF, respectively. Northern blot analysis confirmed that FVIIa binding to TF markedly increased the expression of Cyr61 and CTGF in a time- and dose-dependent manner. FVIIa catalytic activity is required for the gene induction. In addition to FVIIa, thrombin also induced the expression of Cyr61 and CTGF. Hirudin abolished the thrombin-induced expression of these mRNAs but not the FVIIa-induced expression. FVIIa-induced expression of Cyr61 appears not to involve the currently known protease-activated receptors (PARs), whereas thrombin-induced expression involves the activation of PAR1 and possibly an additional PAR. Various intracellular signaling pathway inhibitors exhibited different inhibitory pattern on FVIIa and thrombin-induced up-regulation of Cyr61. Cyr61 and CTGF could act as downstream mediators of FVIIa x TF in affecting various biological processes."

The cRNA sense and antisense probes were hybridised to cryostat sections containing structures extending from the rostral hypothalamus to its caudal limit as defined by the mammillary bodies. The pituitary gland and areas adjacent to the hypothalamus were also analyzed. For comparative purposes, sections from five adult rats containing these structures were hybridised with the same probes. The results point to a widespread distribution of Growth Hormone Secretagogue-Receptor mRNA in the hypothalamus, hippocampal formation, and cerebellar cortex of both lemurs and rats. As in the rat, specific hybridisation was particularly dense in the arcuate nucleus. Significant species differences were observed in the periventricular nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus, the lateral hypothalamic area, and the pituitary gland. In contrast to the rat, the lemur exhibited marked labelling in the infundibular nucleus, the periventricular nucleus and the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland, whereas no labeling was detectable in the ventromedial nucleus and the lateral hypothalamic area. These results are discussed in terms of difference between the control of growth hormone secretion, feeding behaviour and seasonal rhythmicity among murine species and primates."

The loss of cannabinoid receptor binding is thought to occur early in or prior to the development of Huntington's disease neuropathology. We wish to determine whether cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA levels were altered in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Transgenic mice hemizygous for the promoter sequence and exon 1 of the human Huntington's disease gene exhibit a progressive neurological phenotype with many of the features of Huntington's disease. This neurological phenotype develops in the absence of neural degeneration making these mice a model system to dissociate changes related to cell dysfunction from changes related to cell loss. We examine the steady-state levels and cellular distribution of the brain-specific cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA by northern blot and in situ hybridization. The cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA was expressed throughout the striatum, cortex and hippocampus of wild-type mice. At four and five weeks of age, there was no difference in the distribution of the cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA between the wild-type and transgenic Huntington's disease mice. At six, seven, eight and 10 weeks of age, however, the Huntington's disease mice exhibit reduced levels of cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA in the lateral striatum compared to age-matched controls. The Huntington's disease mice also showed a loss of cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA within a subset of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus. We did not observe any difference in the expression of cannabinoid receptor between the wild-type and Huntington's disease mice throughout Ammon's horn of the hippocampus or in the medial striatum. The decrease in cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA levels preceded the development of the Huntington's disease phenotype and neuronal degeneration and, therefore, these transgenic mice model early cellular changes observed in human patients. Our results demonstrate that the single copy cannabinoid receptor gene is subjected to cell-specific and time-dependent regulation of the steady-state level of its gene product as a result of the expression of the Huntington's disease gene. As the endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, anandimide, has been shown to modulate dopamine neurotransmission within the basal ganglia, the loss of cannabinoid receptors may contribute to the development of motor symptoms or cognitive decline or both seen in Huntington's disease patients."

Using double in situ hybridization techniques, we show that D3 receptor mRNA induction after repeated administration of levodopa took place mainly in dynorphin/substance P-expressing neurons of the direct striatonigral pathway. In agreement, induction of D3 receptor binding sites was evidenced, using 7-[3H]hydroxy-N,N-di-propyl-2-aminotetralin ([3H]7-OH-DPAT), in substantia nigra pars reticulata, the projection area of the direct nigrostriatonigral pathway. Changes in D3 receptor binding and behavioural sensitization during intermittent administration of levodopa paralleled changes in prodynorphin/preprotachykinin rather than preproenkephalin/prodynorphin and preproenkephalin/preprotachykinin mRNA ratios. Behavioural sensitization, induction of D3 receptor binding and changes in prodynorphin/preprotachykinin ratio were all prevented together when levodopa was continuously delivered or intermittently delivered in combination with R-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (SCH 23390), a selective D1 receptor antagonist.

Secretion (amylase) by rat parotid gland slices in vitro was also stimulated by PAR-2-APs and trypsin, but not by activation of other PARs. PAR-2-APs, administered to rats in vivo, caused a prompt effect on pancreatic exocrine secretion. PAR-2 mRNA, known to be present in pancreatic tissue, was also detected in parotid tissue.

However, resequencing of the region revealed two small downstream genes, parB and orf-84, of which only parB was found to be essential for partitioning in A. tumefaciens. Purified ParA exhibited a weak ATPase activity that was modestly increased by nonspecific DNA. ParB bound in vitro to repeated sequences present in a region, parS, that possesses centromere and operator functions and within which we identified the primary transcription start site by primer extension. In certain respects the Par proteins behave normally in the foreign host Escherichia coli. In E. coli, as in A. tumefaciens, ParB repressed the partition operon; ParA, inactive alone, augmented this repression. Functional similarities between the partition system of pTAR and those of other plasmids and bacteria are prominent, despite differences in size, organization, and amino acid sequence."

Since the level of CB(1) receptor messenger RNA is very low in the pars reticulata, most of the receptors are probably localized on terminals of afferent axons. The hypothesis was tested that terminals of glutamatergic afferents of substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons possess CB(1) cannnabinoid receptors, the activation of which presynaptically modulates neurotransmission. Rat midbrain slices were superfused and the electrophysiological properties of substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons were studied with the patch-clamp technique. Focal electrical stimulation in the presence of bicuculline evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)/kainate glutamate receptors. The excitatory postsynaptic currents were reduced by the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist (+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (trans-ACPD; 10(-4)M). The mixed CB(1)/CB(2) cannabinoid receptor agonists R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2, 3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-yl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone (WIN55212-2; 10(-8)-10(-5)M) and (-)-cis-3-[2-hydroxy-4-(1, 1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexanol (CP55940; 10(-6)M) also produced inhibition. The maximal inhibition by WIN55212-2 was 54+/-6%. The CB(1) cannabinoid antagonist N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-pyrazole-carboxamide (SR141716A; 10(-6)M) prevented the effect of WIN55212-2, but had no effect when superfused alone. WIN55212-2 (10(-6)M) increased the amplitude ratio of two excitatory postsynaptic currents evoked with an interstimulus interval of 100ms. Currents evoked by short ejection of glutamate on to the surface of the slices were not changed by WIN55212-2. The results show that activation of CB(1) cannabinoid receptors inhibits glutamatergic synaptic transmission between afferent axons and neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The lack of effect of the cannabinoids on glutamate-evoked currents and the increase of the paired-pulse ratio indicate that the mechanism of action is presynaptic inhibition of transmitter release."

In Parkinson's disease, the loss of dopaminergic neurons induces a cascade of functional changes in the basal ganglia circuitry including a hyperactivity of the subthalamic nucleus. This hyperactivity is thought to be due to a diminution of the inhibitory pallidal influence. However, recent studies have suggested that other cerebral structures are involved in the subthalamic neuronal hyperactivity. This study was undertaken to identify these cerebral structures. Neurons projecting to the subthalamic nucleus were identified by retrograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, injected into the subthalamic nucleus of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine unilateral lesion of the substantia nigra pars compacta and sham-lesioned animals. Metabolic activity was determined in the same neurons using in situ hybridization for the first subunit of cytochrome oxidase messenger RNA, a metabolic marker, and image analysis. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled neurons were found in the globus pallidus, parafascicular and pedunculopontine nucleus and sometimes in raphe nuclei and the substantia nigra pars compacta. Measurement of metabolic activity was performed for the globus pallidus, the pedunculopontine and parafascicular nuclei. The expression level of the first subunit of cytochrome oxidase messenger RNA in neurons projecting to the subthalamic nucleus was 62% higher in parafascicular neurons and 123% higher in pedunculopontine neurons in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, compared to sham-lesioned animals. An increase was also observed in the globus pallidus, but did not reach significance. Our results suggest that hyperactivity of subthalamic neurons could be due, at least in part, to an increase of excitatory input arising from the pedunculopontine and parafascicular nuclei. These data also suggest that the latter structures may play an important role in the physiopathology of Parkinson's disease."

Because reelin structurally resembles extracellular matrix proteins, and because many of these proteins are expressed in blood, we hypothesized that reelin also might be detectable in the circulation. Reelin (420 kDa) and two reelin-like immunoreactive bands (310 and 160 kDa) are expressed in serum and platelet-poor plasma of rats, mice, and humans, but these three bands were not detectable in serum of homozygous reeler (rl/rl) mice. Reelin plasma levels in heterozygous (rl/+) mice were half of those in wild-type littermates. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry using antireelin mAbs indicated that reelin-like immunoreactivity was expressed in a subset of chromaffin cells within the rat adrenal medulla and in a subset of cells coexpressing alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone within the pituitary pars intermedia. However, surgical removal of adrenal or pituitary failed to decrease the amount of reelin (420-kDa band) expressed in serum. Adult liver expressed one-third of the reelin mRNA concentration expressed in adult mouse cerebral cortex. Full-length reelin protein was detectable in liver extracts in situ; acutely isolated liver cells also secreted full-length reelin in vitro. Liver appears to be a prime candidate to produce and maintain the circulating reelin pool. It now becomes relevant to ask whether circulating reelin has a physiologic role on one or more peripheral target tissues."

The TMEFF2 gene is predominantly expressed in the brain. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that TMEFF2 is widely expressed in the brain, including hippocampal cornu ammonis, dentate gyrus, and substantia nigra pars compacta. We evaluated the survival effect of TMEFF2 using primary cultured neurons from several regions of fetal rat brain following treatment with a recombinant TMEFF2 protein fragment consisting of the putative extracellular domain. TMEFF2 increased survival of neurons from the hippocampus and midbrain, but not from the cerebral cortex, indicating that the survival effects of TMEFF2 are specific to certain cell types. Recombinant TMEFF2 also promoted survival of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. Together, these findings suggest that TMEFF2 may be a novel survival factor for hippocampal and mesencephalic, but not for cortical, neurons."

To characterize this estrogenic activity, we studied the effects of 17beta- and 17alpha-estradiol treatment (1 microg twice daily 5 days before, during the day of four MPTP (15 mg/kg) injections, and for the following 5 days) on dopamine striatal toxicity induced by the neurotoxin MPTP in retired breeder male C57BL/6 mice. Striatal dopamine concentrations and its metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid measured by HPLC in MPTP mice that received 17beta-estradiol were comparable to control animals, whereas MPTP mice treated with saline or 17alpha-estradiol showed important decreases of dopamine and its metabolites. Striatal serotonin and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations remained unchanged after MPTP and treatments with steroids. Striatal [(3)H]GBR 12935 binding autoradiography to the dopamine transporter was as extensively decreased and correlated with dopamine depletion in MPTP mice, whereas this transporter mRNA decrease in the substantia nigra pars compacta was less pronounced. Treatment with steroids did not significantly change [(3)H]GBR 12935 binding, whereas dopamine transporter mRNA levels were not significantly different from controls. Under the present paradigm in retired breeder male mice, our results show dopaminergic and stereospecificity of estradiol to augment dopamine levels in MPTP-lesioned mice without protecting against the extensive loss of dopamine terminals and moderate cell body loss."

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of rho 2 mRNA in adult rat brain was approximately eight times higher than mRNA in the rat brain at embryonic day 16, while that of rho 3 in the embryonic brain was approximately six times higher than in the adult brain. In the adult rat brain the rho 3 mRNA was present in the mesencephalon, hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus and basal ganglia. In situ hybridization has been used to demonstrate the presence of rho 2 mRNA in the hippocampal CA1 region of the 8-day-old rat, and in the CAl region of the hippocampus, lateral geniculate nucleus, superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus and the pars compacta of the substantia nigra of the adult rat.

In the Syrian hamster the duration of photoperiod affects the amplitude of gene expression in the PT, and melatonin administered before lights-on suppressed the peak of Per1/ICER expression; these effects were not seen in the SCN. It was speculated that the inefficacy of melatonin was due to the low density of melatonin receptors in the SCN of this species. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this phenomenon also occurs in the Siberian hamster, which expresses a higher density of melatonin receptors in the SCN. Male Siberian hamsters were housed in long days (16 h light : 8 h dark) or short days (8 h light : 16 h dark) and expression of Per1 and ICER mRNA was studied by in situ hybridization. The expression of Per1 and ICER mRNA in the PT peaked 3 h following lights-on (ZT3) under both photoperiods. The amplitudes of these peaks were greatly attenuated under short photoperiod. In the SCN, the duration of Per1 gene expression was proportional to the length of the light phase, but only a modest amplitude effect was observed. Injections of melatonin (25 microg) 1 h before lights-on significantly reduced the expression of both genes in the PT at ZT3, but had no effect in the SCN. These data demonstrate that photoperiod-dependent amplitude modulation of Per1 and ICER gene expression in the PT is conserved across species, and reinforce the argument that this phenomenon is driven by melatonin."

We used autoradiography following retrograde axonal transport of [(3)H]-NA to identify selectively whether noradrenergic neurons innervating the vBNST originate in the medulla oblongata and/or the locus coeruleus. In combination with this technique, non-isotopic in situ hybridization for the NMDA-NR1 receptor subunit mRNA was used to examine, on the same brain sections, its expression in noradrenergic neurons that innervate the vBNST. The results showed that 60 +/- 6% and 35 +/- 7% of the total number of radiolabeled cells detected after injection of [(3)H]-NA in the vBNST were located in brainstems A1 and A2 noradrenergic cell groups, respectively. In addition, 18.5 +/- 4.2% of radiolabeled cells in A1 and 15.7 +/- 5% in A2 also expressed the mRNA for the NMDA-NR1 receptor subunit. In contrast, only 4 +/- 3% of the radiolabeled cells were present in the locus coeruleus, and none of these cells was positive to NMDA-NR1 receptor subunit mRNA. The present results provide evidence that BNST noradrenergic fibers and terminals originate predominantly from A1 and A2 noradrenergic cell groups, and that a significant number of these noradrenergic neurons also express the mRNA for the NMDA-NR1 receptor subunit. The observation that brainstem noradrenergic neurons innervating the vBNST express NMDA receptor mRNA gives anatomical support to the regulation of NA release by NMDA presynaptic receptors."

GABA(A)ergic drug (agonist or antagonist) infusions into the SNR have age-specific and site-specific effects on flurothyl-induced seizures. Developmental and cell-specific regulation of GABA(A) receptor subunit expression may be responsible for these specific effects. To test this hypothesis, in situ hybridization was used to examine regional expression of alpha1 and gamma2L GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNAs in the SNR during development. Distinct temporal and spatial patterns of expression were observed. In rats at postnatal days (PN) 21-60, fewer neurons were labeled with probes directed to alpha1 and gamma2L subunits in SNRanterior compared with SNRposterior. In addition, neurons in SNRanterior contained higher amounts of hybridization grains than in SNRposterior. In PN 15 rats, the labeling of neurons was relatively diffuse throughout the anterior and posterior SNR regions with moderate amounts of hybridization grains for both subunits. The finding of age-related differential distribution of alpha1 and gamma2L subunit mRNAs in the SNR suggests that GABA(A) receptor heterogeneity may play a role in the age-specific and site-specific effects of GABA(A)ergic agents on seizures in the SNR."

This study examined whether changes in expression of the genes encoding known GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha(1-4), beta(1-3), gamma(1-3) and delta) could account for this receptor plasticity using a rodent model of Parkinson's disease with a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced nigrostriatal lesion. Analysis of autoradiograms of the basal ganglia and thalamus revealed changes in expression of only four of the 11 subunits studied. Expression of alpha1 and beta2 subunit genes was altered in a parallel manner following a 6-hydroxydopamine lesion; messenger RNA levels for both were significantly increased in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (11 +/- 4% and 17 +/- 1%, respectively), and significantly reduced in the globus pallidus (18 +/- 3% and 16 +/- 3%, respectively) and parafascicular nucleus (19 +/- 3% and 16 +/- 5%, respectively). Smaller changes in the messenger RNA levels encoding the alpha1 subunit in the lateral amygdala (8 +/- 1% decrease) and the alpha4 and gamma2 subunits in the striatum (10 +/- 2% and 6 +/- 1% increase, respectively) were also observed. No changes in expression were noted for any other subunits in any region studied. Clearly, both region- and subunit-specific regulation of GABA(A) receptor subunit gene expression occurs following a nigrostriatal tract lesion. The changes in expression of the alpha1 and beta2 subunit genes probably contribute to the documented changes in GABA(A) receptor binding following striatal dopamine depletion. Moreover, they provide a molecular basis by which the pathological changes in GABAergic activity in Parkinson's disease may be partially compensated."

In dogs GLO detected by microscopy may represent several Helicobacter species or subspecies. Therefore we investigated which Helicobacter spp. are present in stomachs of swine and their possible association with ulcerative lesions of the pars oesophagea. The presence of Helicobacter spp. in the antrum and pars oesophagea in 122 stomachs of slaughter swine was determined by microscopy (n = 122), by culture on selective and nonselective media (n = 112), and by a genus-specific 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) PCR (n = 80). GLO could not be cultured. Phylogenetic analysis of 43 16S rDNA fragments (out of 54 PCR-positive biopsy specimens) revealed the presence of Helicobacter heilmannii type 1 in 42 of them. This correlated with the presence of bacteria with GLO morphology. Helicobacter bilis 16S rDNA was amplified directly from one sample harboring bacteria with H. bilis morphology. The association between Helicobacter spp. and gastric lesions was investigated with a second group of 41 pigs with (n = 21 cases) or without (n = 20 controls) gastric lesions. Fifteen of the 21 cases were positive by PCR or microscopy, compared to 7 of 20 of the controls (P = 0.03). 16S rDNA sequence analysis of 7 of 14 PCR-positive cases revealed the presence of H. heilmannii type 1. Microscopy showed bacteria with GLO morphology. One sample (cases) was culture negative but PCR positive for Helicobacter pullorum-related 16S rDNA. In conclusion, our findings indicate that H. heilmannii type 1 is the predominant Helicobacter spp. in the stomachs of pigs and that its presence is associated with ulcerative lesions in the pars oesophagea."

No change in adenosine A(2A) receptor mRNA levels was seen in any other brain region examined. This study demonstrates that A(2A) receptor mRNA expression is altered in the basal ganglia of patients who died with Parkinson's disease and who were receiving treatment with dopaminergic drugs. The adenosine A(2A) receptor appears subject to regulation by dopaminergic systems in human brain, though these data do not permit a distinction to be made between the effects of neuronal degeneration or drug treatment.

Recently, haem oxygenase-1 levels were reported to be elevated in PD brains. Because this enzyme is involved in the response to oxidative stress and is critical for cellular haem and iron homeostasis, it could play a role in the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, we investigated the expression of haem oxygenase isoform 1 (HO-1) in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. MPTP triggered a relatively rapid and persistent increase in HO-1 mRNA exclusively in the mouse striatum. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed HO-1 to be localized to striatal astrocytes. The induction of HO-1 by MPTP was blocked by selegiline and GBR-12909, indicating the protoxin had to be metabolized by monoamine oxidase B and taken up by dopaminergic neurons to exert its action in astrocytes. MPTP did not alter the expression of other enzymes of haem synthesis or degradation nor were the levels of mRNA for haem or iron-binding proteins changed. Thus, expression of HO-1 was not part of a cellular program involving haem biosynthesis or homeostasis. In addition, heat shock proteins were not induced by MPTP. Thus, MPTP elicited a selective transcriptional response in striatal astrocytes. This response appears to be mediated by molecules released from affected dopaminergic nerve terminals in the striatum acting upon neighbouring astrocytes. This signalling pathway and its potential relevance to PD are discussed."

Arterial blood was sampled at predetermined times for blood gases and pH, plasma ACTH, and cortisol. Pituitary proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA also were localized and quantified by in situ hybridization.RESULTS: During umbilical cord occlusions fetal arterial oxygen pressure (approximately 17 mmHg) and pH (approximately 0.05) decreased, and carbon dioxide pressure increased (approximately 8 mmHg) as measured on days 1 and 4, but with no cumulative blood gas or pH change over successive occlusions for any of the 4 study days. Plasma ACTH increased, as measured after cord occlusion and over the course of successive cord occlusions on days 1 and 4, and returned to control values by the next day. The cumulative increase in ACTH was much less on day 4 than day 1 (15 +/- 3 compared with 101 +/- 25 pg/mL, P &lt;.05). Plasma cortisol increased, as measured after cord occlusion and over the course of successive cord occlusions on day 4 only (2.7 +/- 0.4 to 4. 7 +/- 0.3 ng/mL, P &lt;.05).

We have previously shown that melatonin autoregulates the density of its own receptors in the PT. However, whether melatonin regulation includes mRNA expression in vivo is unclear. In the present study we have used quantitative in situ hybridization to (1) follow the daily profile of mt(1) mRNA expression in the rat PT and (2) investigate whether mt(1) mRNA expression could be regulated in vivo by melatonin. We found clear diurnal variations of mt(1) mRNA expression that persist in constant darkness. We also showed, on pinealectomized animals, that the rhythmic pineal melatonin secretion is necessary for the expression of these daily variations. In a second step, we studied the effect of an acute suppression of endogenous melatonin synthesis on mt(1) melatonin receptors by applying a 1-hour light pulse during the night. We found that light induced a dramatic increase in mt(1) mRNA which was totally prevented by a melatonin injection showing that the acute effect of melatonin on the receptor mRNA is strongly inhibitory. A light pulse applied to animals with a chronic absence of melatonin was ineffective showing that light only affects melatonin receptors via the light-induced plasma melatonin suppression. Altogether our results show that melatonin regulates mt(1) melatonin receptor mRNA expression. However, this regulation seems to be complex: acute changes in plasma melatonin concentration regulate negatively the gene transcription, even if the daily endogenous nocturnal melatonin peak seems a prerequisite for variations in its receptor expression."

We have previously shown that night applied light pulse induced an increase in mt1 mRNA expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of this species, independently of the endogenous melatonin. Here, we report the photic regulation of melatonin receptor density and mRNA expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and pars tuberalis of pinealectomized Siberian hamsters and the implication in this control of either the circadian clock or the intergeniculate leaflet. The results show that: (1) A 1-h light pulse, delivered during the night, induces a transitory increase in mt1 mRNA expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and pars tuberalis. After 3 h this increase has totally disappeared (suprachiasmatic nuclei) or is greatly reduced (pars tuberalis). (2) The melatonin receptor density, in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, is not affected by 1 or 3 h of light, while it is strongly increased in the pars tuberalis. (3) In hamsters kept in constant darkness, the mt1 mRNA rise is gated to the subjective night in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and pars tuberalis. In contrast, the light-induced increase in melatonin binding is also observed in the subjective day in the pars tuberalis. (4) intergeniculate leaflet lesion totally inhibits the mt1 mRNA expression rise in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, while it has no effect on the light-induced increase in mt1 mRNA in the pars tuberalis. However, the light-induced increase in melatonin receptor density is totally prevented by the intergeniculate leaflet lesion in the pars tuberalis. These results show that: (1) the photic regulations of mt1 mRNA expression and receptor density are independent of each other in both the suprachiasmatic nuclei and pars tuberalis; and (2) the circadian clock and the intergeniculate leaflet are implicated in the photic regulation of melatonin receptors but their level of action differs totally between the suprachiasmatic nuclei and pars tuberalis."

To determine the molecular basis for this susceptibility we have used immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR, and electrophysiology to profile AMPARs on embryonic day 14.5 rat motoneurons. Motoneurons show detectable AMPAR-mediated calcium permeability in vitro and in vivo as determined by cobalt uptake and electrophysiology. Motoneurons express all four AMPAR subunit mRNAs, with glutamate receptor (GluR) 2 being the most abundant (63.9+/-4.8%). GluR2 is present almost exclusively in the edited form, and electrophysiology confirms that most AMPARs present are calcium-impermeant. However, the kainate current in motoneurons was blocked an average of 32.0% by Joro spider toxin, indicating that a subset of the AM PARs is Ca2+-permeable. Therefore, heterogeneity of AMPARs, rather than the absence of GluR2 or the presence of unedited GluR2, explains AMPAR-mediated Ca2+ permeability. The relative levels of flip/flop isoforms of each subunit were also examined by semiquantitative PCR. Both isoforms were present, but the relative proportion varied for each subunit, and the flip isoform predominated. Thus, our data show that despite high levels of edited GluR2 mRNA, some AMPARs are Ca2+-permeable, and this subset of AMPARs can account for the AMPAR-mediated Ca2+ inflow inferred from cobalt uptake and electrophysiology studies."

In the case of rainbow trout, this intracellular carboxy-terminal tail consists of 58 residues.

Consequently, we investigated the expression of Nurr1 mRNA in genetically modified mice lacking both functional copies of the D2 dopamine receptor gene and in their congenic siblings. Quantitative in situ hybridization demonstrated a significant increased expression of Nurr1 mRNA in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area of D2 dopamine receptor -/- mice. No change in Nurr1 expression was detected in other brain regions, such as the habenular nuclei and temporal cortex. Among the cell groups studied, mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons are unique in that they express both Nurr1 and the D2 dopamine receptor, and synthesize dopamine. Thus, it seems plausible that the selective increase in Nurr1 expression observed in D2 receptor-deficient mice is the consequence of an impaired dopamine autoreceptor function."

Since exogenous IGF-I has been shown to stimulate luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, it is postulated that endogenous IGF-I may act as a stimulatory metabolic signal to the pubertal ovine hypothalamo-pituitary axis, yet its site of action is unknown. Using coronal hypothalamic and pituitary sections from pubertal ewe lambs, in vitro autoradiography was used to localise 125I-labelled IGF-I binding, and gene expression for components of the IGF system was localised by in situ hybridisation using oligonucleotide probes. High concentrations of 125I-IGF-I binding were seen in the pars tuberalis (PT) and pars distalis (PD) of the pituitary, and relatively little in the hypothalamus; binding in the PT but not the PD was displaced by excess unlabelled IGF-I. Large amounts of mRNA were detected for the type-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and for IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-5, localised to the PT and PD, and less intense specific hybridisation signals were obtained with mRNAs for IGF-II, type-2 receptor (IGF-2R) and IGFBP-3. There was some evidence for specific hybridisation to IGFBP-4 mRNA in the PT. IGF-I, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 mRNAs were not detected in PT and PD. None of the genes were expressed in hypothalamic tissue. Western-ligand binding on PD extracts from male castrates revealed by their molecular weights the likely presence of IGFBPs-2, -3, and -5. Finally, cultured PD cells from abattoir-killed sheep were challenged with IGF-I (0.1, 1, 10 or 30 nM) or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH, 10 nM) alone, or both together. Basal LH output was stimulated by 10 nM IGF-I (120+/-11.2%, P&gt;0.05), 30 nM IGF-I (148+/-12.8%, P&lt;0.01), and LHRH alone (200+/-16.1%, P&lt;0.001); there was no additive or subtractive effect of LHRH and IGF-I given together. Thus, an intrapituitary IGF system exists in sheep and the present results are consistent with an endocrine role for IGF-I in nutritional modulation of LH secretion at the level of the pituitary gland."

The dopamine transporter may also contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. Dopamine transporter expression correlates well with susceptibility to neuronal degeneration in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism. Recent studies have implicated the dopamine transporter in the uptake of both this neurotoxin and its metabolite, MPP(+), as well as another experimental neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine. In these studies we examined the role of the dopamine transporter in the neurotoxicity of both MPP(+) and 6-hydroxydopamine in the rat brain using in vivo administration of phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides targeting dopamine transporter mRNA. Infusion of dopamine transporter antisense (1 nmol/day, 7 days) into the left substantia nigra pars compacta resulted in reduced (3)H-WIN 35-428 binding in the left striatum and significant levodopa and amphetamine-induced contralateral rotations. Unilateral pretreatment with dopamine transporter antisense prior to bilateral intrastriatal infusion of either MPP(+) or 6-hydroxydopamine resulted in asymmetrical striatal (3)H-WIN 35-428 binding and dopamine content as well as significant apomorphine-induced ipsilateral rotations, suggesting neuroprotection of nigrostriatal neurons on the antisense-treated side. Thus, the dopamine transporter appears to play a critical role in determining susceptibility to the experimental neurotoxins MPP(+) and 6-hydroxydopamine. In light of this, the dopamine transporter may prove useful, both as a marker for susceptibility to Parkinson's disease and as a target for therapeutic intervention."

Thrombin, the PAR-1 agonist SFLLR-NH2 or the PAR-2 agonist SLIGRL-NH2 failed to induce histamine release from PMC. Surprisingly, the PAR-2-inactive control peptide LSIGRL-NH2 triggered histamine release from PMC. Thus, PAR-1, but not PAR-2, are expressed in PMC, whereas neither PAR-1 nor PAR-2 are considered to be involved in degranulation of PMC. LSIGRL-NH2 does not appear to be appropriate as a control peptide for PAR-2 in inflammation studies."

Thrombomodulin could then stabilize the astroglial scar through its adhesive properties. Here, we studied the in vivo injury response of astrocytes in the anterior medullary velum of adult rat by immunostaining and in situ hybridization of thrombomodulin. Thrombomodulin was poorly expressed on astrocytes in normal tissue, increased up to 2 d after injury, and was still highly expressed at 6 d. To check that thrombin had a direct effect on thrombomodulin expression by astrocytes, we used brain cortical astrocyte primary cultures treated with either thrombin or the agonist peptide thrombin receptor-activating peptide-6, known to activate directly the thrombin G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). Modification of thrombomodulin expression was studied by Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. There was a dose-dependent increase in thrombomodulin after 48 hr of treatment, with gene expression peaking at 24 hr but falling to control levels by 48 hr. Together, these results show the following: (1) injury increases astrocyte thrombomodulin expression; (2) thrombin might mediate thrombomodulin expression via the specific receptor PAR-1; and (3) serine proteases, their inhibitors, and the new family of GPCR, PARs, are active on astrogliosis."

BDNF mRNA levels were transiently induced in the substantia nigra pars compacta at 1 day postaxotomy. The disposition of BDNF mRNA expressing cells at this postlesion time in substantia nigra mimicked that of the dopaminergic neurons expressing the mRNA for the dopamine transporter. TrkB mRNA levels remained unaltered in the ventral mesencephalon at the different postlesion times examined-1 to 14 days. In contrast, trkB mRNA levels were significantly induced in the striatum at the longer postlesion time examined-14 days-when all neurodegenerative events are completed. It is becoming apparent that nigral BDNF mRNA levels are anterogradely transported to its target tissue in striatum. However, following axotomy, the lesion site represents a second potential target for BDNF action. Consequently, we also analyzed the pattern of mRNA expression for BDNF and trkB at the lesion site where dopaminergic axons are disconnected. There, we found notable inductions of both BDNF mRNA and trkB mRNA levels at 4 days postaxotomy. BDNF mRNA expressing cells were confined at the site of axotomy, which coincided precisely to that showing induction of trkB mRNA. Altogether, our results anticipate promising trophic roles of BNDF in the injured nigrostriatal system."

Since the dopaminergic neurons possess a relatively large amount of GAP-43 protein and mRNA, the dopaminergic neurons must be endowed with specific functions related to those of GAP-43. In this study, dopaminergic axon terminals were partially destroyed by intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Rats were decapitated 3, 14, and 56 days following treatment. Levels of GAP-43 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the striatum were detected by immunoblotting and quantified. The number of GAP-43 mRNA-positive neurons and that of TH mRNA-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) were detected by in situ hybridization using alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-labeled probes. Levels of GAP-43 in the striatum showed no significant alteration during the period of the experiment, although levels of TH were gradually restored. The number of GAP-43 mRNA-positive neurons as well as that of TH mRNA-positive neurons in the SNc decreased. These results suggests that dopaminergic neurons restore their axon terminals with little change in GAP-43, and that transcription and/or stability of GAP-43 mRNA in the dopaminergic neurons are susceptible to the toxin, although the dopaminergic neurons can maintain the translational product in the terminals. This feature may be related with a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease."

In the case of monkey brain, we combined this technique with receptor ligand autoradiography to compare the distribution of mRNA and receptor binding sites. [(125)I]Iodoaminopotentidine ([(125)I]-APT), a reversible, high specific activity antagonist with high affinity and selectivity for the H(2) receptor, was used for receptor autoradiography. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides derived from the human mRNA sequence encoding this receptor were used as hybridization probes. The highest density of the H(2) receptor mRNA in human and monkey brain was found in caudate and putamen nuclei and external layers of cerebral cortex. Moderate levels were seen in the hippocampal formation and lower densities in the dentate nucleus of cerebellum. Areas such as globus pallidus, amygdaloid complex, cerebellar cortex, and substantia nigra were devoid of hybridization signal. The distribution of H(2) receptor mRNA in monkey brain is generally in good agreement with that of the corresponding binding sites: prominent in caudate, putamen, accumbens nuclei, and cortical areas. The hippocampus showed lower densities of receptors and low levels were detected in the globus pallidus pars lateralis. No binding sites were seen in amygdaloid complex and substantia nigra. The distribution of histaminergic innervation is in good correlation with the areas of high density for H(2) receptors: caudate, putamen, and external layers of cerebral cortex in monkey and human brain. The presence of mRNA in caudate and putamen nuclei, together with its absence from substantia nigra, suggests that the H(2) receptors found in the striatum are synthesized by intrinsic cells and not by nigral dopaminergic cells. These striatal H(2) receptors may be located on short circuit striatal interneurons or somatodendritically on striatal projection neurons which project to the globus pallidus pars lateralis. In conclusion, the present results, which constitute, to our knowledge, the first report of the regional distribution of mRNA encoding H(2) receptors detected by in situ hybridization, define the sites of synthesis of H(2) receptors and are the basis for future, more detailed studies that should result in a better understanding of H(2) receptor function."

The sensitized response of PT cells may be an important aspect of the interpretation of the melatonin signal to initiate appropriate seasonal physiological responses. The aim of this study is to add to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the sensitization of PT cells by melatonin. We demonstrate that sensitization of PT cells by melatonin is mediated via a G(i)-coupled melatonin receptor. The sensitized cAMP response is not only obtained with the pharmacological tool forskolin, but also with cholera toxin, an activator of G(salpha). Changes in the level of G(salpha) or G(ialpha) G-protein subunits are ruled out as part of the sensitization mechanism. However, changes in tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved as tyrosine kinase inhibitors sensitize ovine PT cells and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors significantly blunt adenylate cyclase activity, including the sensitized response to melatonin. The adenylate cyclase isoforms mediating the sensitized response may be broad as 7 of the 9 isoforms of adenylate cyclase are expressed in the PT."

These acute events can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying long-term adaptations to nigrostriatal lesions. The present experiments examined the basal ganglia immediate-early gene response to infusions of the catecholamine neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine into the nigrostriatal pathway in rats. Following 6-hydroxydopamine infusions into the medial forebrain bundle in awake, behaving rats, there was a rapid and transient induction of striatal c-fos and zif/268 messenger RNAs. Both immediate-early genes were maximally induced by 45min post-infusion, and returned to control levels by 1.5h (c-fos) or 3h (zif/268) post-infusion. Double-labeling experiments revealed that striatal c-fos expression occurred preferentially in preproenkephalin-expressing neurons. 6-Hydroxydopamine-induced c-fos messenger RNA was also observed in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and entopeduncular nucleus, but not the globus pallidus, 45 min after medial forebrain bundle 6-hydroxydopamine infusions. Finally, the role of ionotropic striatal glutamate receptors in nigrostriatal injury-induced striatal c-fos was examined by combining medial forebrain bundle 6-hydroxydopamine infusions with intrastriatal glutamate antagonist infusions. Both the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, (+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid, and the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione, blocked striatal induction of c-fos messenger RNA following 6-hydroxydopamine infusions into the medial forebrain bundle. These results provide evidence of rapidly developing, glutamate-dependent molecular responses in the basal ganglia which may contribute to some of the well-described long-term adaptations of this system to nigrostriatal injury."

As a comparison with the expression of alpha-subunit mRNA, the onset of luteinizing hormone (LH) immunoreactivity was examined by immunohistochemical staining with a chicken LH antiserum. Both alpha-subunit mRNA and LH immunoreactivity began to appear in the basal-posterior region of the Rathke's pouch at embryonic day (E) 3.5. At E4.5 when the cephalic and caudal lobes of the pars distalis could be distinguished in the Rathke's pouch, intense signal for alpha-subunit mRNA was restricted to the cephalic lobe, consisting of a high columnar epithelium. At E6, gonadotrophs that were ovoid in shape, expressed intense signal for alpha-subunit mRNA, and revealed intense immunoreactivity for LH, were first detected in the cephalic lobe. At this stage, alpha-subunit mRNA expression became weak in the undifferentiated columnar cells of the cephalic lobe. At E8, the pars tuberalis primordium located close to the median eminence was formed at the lateral-apical end of the cephalic lobe. The primordium expressed intense signal for alpha-subunit mRNA. Gonadotrophs showing immunoreactivity for LH were densely distributed throughout the cephalic and caudal lobes in 8-day-old embryos. The pars tuberalis primordium expressing alpha-subunit mRNA progressively extended along the median eminence with embryonal age and reached the rostoral end by E14. Thus, both primordia of the pars distalis and pars tuberalis expressed intense signal for the common alpha-subunit mRNA. This subunit may play a role in the cytodifferentiation of the adenohypophysis."

The DA-induced lesions produce significant bilateral reductions in the expression of GluR1 and NMDAR1 subunit mRNA in the medio-lateral striatum, whereas the expression of striatal GluR2 receptors was not changed.

We obtained pituitary tissue from fetal sheep during late pregnancy (d 100-d 145, term) and at precise times during the process of labor and used in situ hybridization to localize and quantify mRNA levels. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA was regionally distributed (pars intermedia &gt; inferior pars distalis &gt; superior pars distalis) and increased within the pars distalis during late pregnancy and with labor. At term, levels of PC-1 and PC-2 mRNA were higher in the pars intermedia than pars distalis; PC-1 but not PC-2 in the pars distalis increased with gestational age, although it did not change further at labor. GR mRNA levels in the pars distalis increased between d 135 and term, then decreased during labor. We suggest that the concomitant rise in plasma ACTH and cortisol of fetal sheep during late gestation may be attributable, in part, to increased expression of PC-1 leading to increased POMC processing. Furthermore, the negative feedback effects of cortisol on pituitary POMC synthesis and/or ACTH release during active parturition may be lessened by downregulation of anterior pituitary GR."

Earlier studies have shown differential effects of the lesion of the SNpr on seizure genesis that demonstrated a regional difference in the anterior and posterior parts of the SNpr in preconvulsive behavior induced by unilateral reticulata injection of dopamine (DA). This study was aimed to investigate some of the underlying mechanisms of the preconvulsive behavior elicited by unilateral SNpr DA injection by the study of changes in the gene expression of glutamate receptor subunits (GluR1, GluR2 and NMDAR1) and of changes in animal behavior following coinfusion of DA and a DA D1 antagonist SCH 23390 into the SNpr. Unilateral injection of exogenous DA into the anterior region of the SNpr induced rapid and short lasting preconvulsive behavior up to wet dog shakes stage and a significant reduction of gene expression for GluR1, GluR2 and NMDAR1 subunits in rat hippocampal subfields including CA1 through CA4 and dentate gyrus (DG) at 1 day after nigral DA injection. The effect was long lasting and persisted for at least 3 weeks. Both preconvulsive behavior and downregulation of glutamate receptor subunit genes were completely blocked by simultaneous coinfusion of DA and SCH 23390. The results suggest, for the first time, that DA D1 receptor in the SNpr may mediate the nigral-involved seizure development. Glutamate desensitization, and/or selective early neuronal damage might be responsible for the downregulation of glutamate receptor subunits by transient preconvulsive activity."
