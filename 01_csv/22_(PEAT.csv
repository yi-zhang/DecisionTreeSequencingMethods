They so densely populate the genomes of many eukaryotic species that they are often the major constituents. With the rapid generation of many plant genome sequencing projects over the past few decades, there is an urgent need for improved TE annotation as a prerequisite for genome-wide studies. Analogous to the use of RNA-seq for gene annotation, we propose a new method for de novo TE annotation that uses as a guide 24 nt-siRNAs that are a part of TE silencing pathways. We use this new approach, called TASR (for Transposon Annotation using Small RNAs), for de novo annotation of TEs in Arabidopsis, rice and soybean and demonstrate that this strategy can be successfully applied for de novo TE annotation in plants.Executable PERL is available for download from: http://tasr-pipeline.sourceforge.net/."

However, the impact of these nutrients on the soil microbiome is not known. Using next generation sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic DNA, we compared the structure and the potential functions of bacterial community in forest soils to deforested soils in the Amazon region and related the differences to soil chemical factors. Deforestation decreased soil organic matter content and factors linked to soil acidity and raised soil pH, base saturation and exchangeable bases. Concomitant to expected changes in soil chemical factors, we observed an increase in the alpha diversity of the bacterial microbiota and relative abundances of putative copiotrophic bacteria such as Actinomycetales and a decrease in the relative abundances of bacterial taxa such as Chlamydiae, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia in the deforested soils. We did not observe an increase in genes related to microbial nutrient metabolism in deforested soils. However, we did observe changes in community functions such as increases in DNA repair, protein processing, modification, degradation and folding functions, and these functions might reflect adaptation to changes in soil characteristics due to forest clear-cutting and burning. In addition, there were changes in the composition of the bacterial groups associated with metabolism-related functions. Co-occurrence microbial network analysis identified distinct phylogenetic patterns for forest and deforested soils and suggested relationships between Planctomycetes and aluminium content, and Actinobacteria and nitrogen sources in Amazon soils. The results support taxonomic and functional adaptations in the soil bacterial community following deforestation. We hypothesize that these microbial adaptations may serve as a buffer to drastic changes in soil fertility after slash-and-burning deforestation in the Amazon region."

Although some understanding of plant defense mechanisms against V. dahliae infection has been gained for incompatible interactions, including identification of inducible resistant genes and defense signaling pathways, the genes and signaling pathways involved in the compatible interaction remain unclear. To investigate the molecular basis of the compatible interaction between tomato and V. dahliae, transcriptomes of V. dahliae infected tomatoes were compared to those of a control group. A total of approximately 25 million high-quality reads were generated by means of the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) method. The sequence reads were aligned to the tomato reference genome and analyzed to measure gene expression levels, and to identify alternative splicing events. Comparative analysis between the two samples revealed 1,953 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 1,281 up-regulated and 672 down-regulated genes. The RNA-Seq output was confirmed using RT-qPCR for 10 selected genes. The Nr, Swiss-Prot, Gene Ontology (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were used to annotate DEG functions. Of the 1,953 DEGs identified, 1,953, 1,579, 1,739, 862, and 380 were assigned by Nr, Swiss-Prot, GO, COG, and KEGG, respectively. The important functional groups identified via GO and COG enrichment were those responsible for fundamental biological regulation, secondary metabolism, and signal transduction. Of DEGs assigned to 87 KEGG pathways, most were associated with phenylpropanoid metabolism and plant-pathogen interaction pathways. Most of the DEGs involved in these two pathways were up-regulated, and may be involved in regulating the tomato-V. dahliae compatible interaction. The results will help to identify key susceptible genes and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of tomato susceptible response to V. dahliae."

Here, we review transcriptome analysis methods and technologies that have been used to conduct whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing or whole transcriptome tag/target sequencing analyses. We focus on how adaptors/linkers are added to both 5' and 3' ends of mRNA molecules for cloning or PCR amplification before sequencing. Challenges and potential solutions are also discussed. In brief, next generation sequencing platforms have accelerated releases of the large amounts of gene expression data. It is now time for the genome research community to assemble whole transcriptomes of all species and collect signature targets for each gene/transcript, and thus use known genes/transcripts to determine known transcriptomes directly in the near future."

MiRNAs lead to broader changes in gene expression after plants are exposed to stress. High-throughput sequencing is an effective method to identify and profile small RNA populations in non-model plants under salt stresses, significantly improving our knowledge regarding miRNA functions in salt tolerance. Cucurbits are sensitive to soil salinity, and the Cucurbita genus is used as the rootstock of other cucurbits to enhance salt tolerance. Several cucurbit crops have been used for miRNA sequencing but salt stress-related miRNAs in cucurbit species have not been reported. In this study, we subjected two Cucurbita germplasm, namely, N12 (Cucurbita. maxima Duch.) and N15 (Cucurbita. moschata Duch.), with different sodium accumulation patterns, to Illumina sequencing to determine small RNA populations in root tissues after 4 h of salt treatment and control. A total of 21,548,326 and 19,394,108 reads were generated from the control and salt-treated N12 root tissues, respectively. By contrast, 19,108,240 and 20,546,052 reads were obtained from the control and salt-treated N15 root tissues, respectively. Fifty-eight conserved miRNA families and 33 novel miRNAs were identified in the two Cucurbita germplasm. Seven miRNAs (six conserved miRNAs and one novel miRNAs) were up-regulated in salt-treated N12 and N15 samples. Most target genes of differentially expressed novel miRNAs were transcription factors and salt stress-responsive proteins, including dehydration-induced protein, cation/H+ antiporter 18, and CBL-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase. The differential expression of miRNAs between the two Cucurbita germplasm under salt stress conditions and their target genes demonstrated that novel miRNAs play an important role in the response of the two Cucurbita germplasm to salt stress. The present study initially explored small RNAs in the response of pumpkin to salt stress, and provided valuable information on novel miRNAs and their target genes in Cucurbita."

After separation and purification, we obtained DNA. On the basis of 16S rRNA' s general primer we carried out PCR amplification, conducted blast gene similarity and analyzed phylogenetic information.RESULTS: The isolated bacterial strains distributed to 4 phyla, 40 genera of bacteria, 179 isolates from the samples of healthy Panax notoginseng rhizosphere soil belong to 30 genera and Burkholderia, Arthrobacter, Streptomyces and Bacillus are the dominant microflora. Additionally, 117 isolates from the samples of root rot Panax notoginseng rhizosphere soil belong to 29 genera and Ralstonia, Sphingomonas, Stenotrophomonas as the dominant microflora. Among them, Flavobacterium and Enterobacter were only isolated from the samples of root rot Panax notoginseng rhizosphere soil. At least 5 isolates are novel species; the ions concentration and electrical conductivity value show distinct discrepancy between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05); the microbial amount of dominant species in the healthy soil samples present negative correlation with electrical conductivity value, the concentration of NO3-, SO4(2-), CO3(2-), K+ and total salt (P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: In addition to pathogen infection, the physical and chemical characteristics, microbial community structure and the proportion of dominant species are also closely related to notoginseng continuous cropping soil borne disease.

This study proposes a more comprehensive approach. The side effects of pesticides may appear as changes in the expression of specific microbial genes or as changes in diversity. To assess the impact of pesticides on gene expression, we focused on the amoA gene, which is involved in ammonia oxidation. We prepared soil microcosms and exposed them to dazomet, mancozeb or no pesticide. We hypothesized that the amount of amoA transcript decreases upon pesticide application, and to test this hypothesis, we used reverse-transcription qPCR. We also hypothesized that bacterial diversity is affected by pesticides. This hypothesis was investigated via 454 sequencing and diversity analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA and RNA genes, representing the active and total soil bacterial communities, respectively.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Treatment with dazomet reduced both the bacterial and archaeal amoA transcript numbers by more than two log units and produced long-term effects for more than 28 days. Mancozeb also inhibited the numbers of amoA transcripts, but only transiently. The bacterial and archaeal amoA transcripts were both sensitive bioindicators of pesticide side effects. Additionally, the numbers of bacterial amoA transcripts correlated with nitrate production in N-amended microcosms. Dazomet reduced the total bacterial numbers by one log unit, but the population size was restored after twelve days. The diversity of the active soil bacteria also seemed to be re-established after twelve days. However, the total bacterial diversity as reflected in the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences was largely dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria at day twelve, likely reflecting a halt in the growth of early opportunists and the re-establishment of a more diverse population. We observed no effects of mancozeb on diversity."

However, the genetic basis of Ggt pathogenicity remains unclear. In this study, transcriptome sequencing for Ggt in axenic culture and Ggt-infected wheat roots was performed using Illumina paired-end sequencing. Approximately 2.62 and 7.76 Gb of clean reads were obtained, and 87% and 63% of the total reads were mapped to the Ggt genome for RNA extracted from Ggt in culture and infected roots, respectively. A total of 3,258 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with 2,107 (65%) being 2-fold up-regulated and 1,151 (35%) being 2-fold down-regulated between Ggt in culture and Ggt in infected wheat roots. Annotation of these DEGs revealed that many were associated with possible Ggt pathogenicity factors, such as genes for guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha-2 subunit, cellulase, pectinase, xylanase, glucosidase, aspartic protease and gentisate 1, 2-dioxygenase. Twelve DEGs were analyzed for expression by qRT-PCR, and could be generally divided into those with high expression only early in infection, only late in infection and those that gradually increasing expression over time as root rot developed. This indicates that these possible pathogenicity factors may play roles during different stages of the interaction, such as signaling, plant cell wall degradation and responses to plant defense compounds. This is the first study to compare the transcriptomes of Ggt growing saprophytically in axenic cultures to it growing parasitically in infected wheat roots. As a result, new candidate pathogenicity factors have been identified, which can be further examined by gene knock-outs and other methods to assess their true role in the ability of Ggt to infect roots."

Complex soil matrixes can support a vast number of organisms that can provide a site-specific signal for use in forensic soil discrimination. Previous DNA fingerprinting techniques rely on variations in fragment length to distinguish between soil profiles and focus solely on microbial communities. However, the recent development of high throughput sequencing (HTS) has the potential to provide a more detailed picture of the soil community by accessing non-culturable microorganisms and by identifying specific bacteria, fungi, and plants within soil. To demonstrate the application of HTS to forensic soil analysis, 18S ribosomal RNA profiles of six forensic mock crime scene samples were compared to those collected from seven reference locations across South Australia. Our results demonstrate the utility of non-bacterial DNA to discriminate between different sites, and were able to link a soil to a particular location. In addition, HTS complemented traditional Mid Infrared (MIR) spectroscopy soil profiling, but was able to provide statistically stronger discriminatory power at a finer scale. Through the design of an experimental case scenario, we highlight the considerations and potential limitations of this method in forensic casework. We show that HTS analysis of soil eukaryotes was robust to environmental variation, e.g. rainfall and temperature, transfer effects, storage effects and spatial variation. In addition, this study utilises novel analytical methodologies to interpret results for investigative purposes and provides prediction statistics to support soil DNA analysis for evidential stages of a case."

The labor-intensive and time-consuming 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing and/or multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of conserved genes so far remain the favored molecular tools to characterize symbiotic bacteria. With the development of mass spectrometry (MS) as an alternative method to rapidly identify bacterial isolates, we recently showed that matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) can accurately characterize RNB found inside plant nodules or grown in cultures. Here, we report on the development of a MALDI-TOF RNB-specific spectral database built on whole cell MS fingerprints of 116 strains representing the major rhizobial genera. In addition to this RNB-specific module, which was successfully tested on unknown field isolates, a subset of 13 ribosomal proteins extracted from genome data was found to be sufficient for the reliable identification of nodule isolates to rhizobial species as shown in the putatively ascribed ribosomal protein masses (PARPM) database. These results reveal that data gathered from genome sequences can be used to expand spectral libraries to aid the accurate identification of bacterial species by MALDI-TOF MS."

Amplificon was used to construct 16S rRNA genes clone library. The estimation of species richness, diversity indices, and rarefaction curve of the 16S rRNA genes library were determined based on representative phylotypes (OTUs).RESULTS: Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences allowed grouping of 101 clones into 12 phylotypes (OTUs) using a cut-off of 97% identity. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of sequences affiliated to the order Oscillatoriales and Chroococcales except that three were unclassified. The clone library was dominated by representatives of the order Oscillatoriales (81% of the total clones), and the most abundant organisms within this order were in the genus Phormidium (68 clones) including clones grouping into four phylotypes. The only clone of Chroococcales was closely related to the genus Chamaesiphon with 97% similarity. In addition, comparison of soil chemical properties between different habitats indicated that supraglacial cryoconite supported significantly higher the content of available phosphorus and potassium, nitrate nitrogen and organic matter compared with the forefield of the Glacier No. 1.CONCLUSION: The diversity index of cyanobacteria were relatively high in supraglacial cryoconite of the Glacier No. 1 in the Tianshan Mountains.

In this study, 10 bacterial isolates were isolated from soil samples of a sugar industry, located at Peshawar, Pakistan. Morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of these isolates were observed. Sequence analysis (16S ribosomal RNA) revealed that isolated strains were closely related to the species belonging to the genera Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Exiguobacterium, Citrobacter, and Enterobacter. Bacterial isolates were resistant with a minimum inhibitory concentration (500-900 ppm) to lead ion (Pb(2+)), (500-600 ppm) nickel ion (Ni(2+)), (500-800 ppm) copper ion (Cu(2+)), and (600-800 ppm) chromium ion (Cr(3+)) in solid media. Furthermore, biosorption of metals proved considerable removal of heavy metals by isolated metal-resistant strains. Pseudomonas sp. reduced 37% (Pb(2+)), 32% (Ni(2+)), 29% (Cu(2+)), and 32% (Cr(3+)) and was thus found to be most effective, whereas Enterobacter sp. reduced 19% (Pb(2+)), 7% (Ni(2+)), 14% (Cu(2+)), and 21% (Cr(3+)) and was found to be least effective. While average reduction of Pb(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), and Cr(3+) by Citrobacter sp. was found to be 24%, 18%, 23%, and 27%, respectively, among recognized species. This study revealed that Pseudomonas sp. may provide a new microbial community that can be used for enhanced remediation of contaminated environment."

PEAT requires no a priori adaptor sequence, which is convenient for large-scale meta-analyses. We assessed the performance of PEAT with many adapter trimmers in both simulated and real life paired-end sequencing libraries. The importance of adapter trimming was exemplified by the influence of the downstream analyses on RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and MNase-seq. Several useful guidelines of applying adapter trimmers with aligners were suggested.CONCLUSIONS: PEAT can be easily included in the routine paired-end sequencing pipeline.

DNA can be remarkably stable in some environments, so its presence does not indicate live bacteria, but extracted ribosomal RNA (rRNA) has previously been viewed as an indicator of active cells. Stable isotope probing (SIP) involves the incorporation of heavy isotopes into newly synthesized nucleic acids, and can be used to separate newly synthesized from existing DNA or rRNA. H2 (18) O is currently the only potential universal bacterial substrate suitable for SIP of entire bacterial communities. The aim of our work was to compare soil bacterial community composition as revealed by total versus SIP-labeled DNA and rRNA. Soil was supplemented with H2 (18) O and after 38 days the DNA and RNA were co-extracted. Heavy nucleic acids were separated out by CsCl and CsTFA density centrifugation. The 16S rRNA gene pools were characterized by DGGE and pyrosequencing, and the sequence results analyzed using mothur. The majority of DNA (~60%) and RNA (~75%) from the microcosms incubated with H2 (18) O were labeled by the isotope. The analysis indicated that total and active members of the same type of nucleic acid represented similar community structures, which suggested that most dominant OTUs in the total nucleic acid extracts contained active members. It also supported that H2 (18) O was an effective universal label for SIP for both DNA and RNA. DNA and RNA-derived diversity was dissimilar. RNA from this soil more comprehensively recovered bacterial richness than DNA because the most abundant OTUs were less numerous in RNA than DNA-derived community data, and dominant OTU pools didn't mask rare OTUs as much in RNA."

The impact of different commercially available DNA extraction kits upon bacterial community structures has received relatively little attention. The aim of this study was to analyze bacterial communities in volunteer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient fecal samples extracted using widely used DNA extraction kits in established gastrointestinal research laboratories.METHODS: Fecal samples from two healthy volunteers (H3 and H4) and two relapsing IBD patients (I1 and I2) were investigated. DNA extraction was undertaken using MoBio Powersoil and MP Biomedicals FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil DNA extraction kits. PCR amplification for pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was performed in both laboratories on all samples. Hierarchical clustering of sequencing data was done using the Yue and Clayton similarity coefficient.RESULTS: DNA extracted using the FastDNA kit and the MoBio kit gave median DNA concentrations of 475 (interquartile range 228-561) and 22 (IQR 9-36) ng/µL respectively (p&lt;0.0001). Hierarchical clustering of sequence data by Yue and Clayton coefficient revealed four clusters. Samples from individuals H3 and I2 clustered by patient; however, samples from patient I1 extracted with the MoBio kit clustered with samples from patient H4 rather than the other I1 samples. Linear modelling on relative abundance of common bacterial families revealed significant differences between kits; samples extracted with MoBio Powersoil showed significantly increased Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Porphyromonadaceae, and lower Enterobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae (p&lt;0.05).CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates significant differences in DNA yield and bacterial DNA composition when comparing DNA extracted from the same fecal sample with different extraction kits.

We aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and related pathways by comprehensive analysis of transcriptomes of both root and leaf tissues of the tolerant genotype grown under saline and control conditions in hydroponic system. We have generated a total of 158 million high-quality reads which were assembled into 83,774 all-unigenes with a mean length of 813 bp and N50 of 1,449 bp. Among the all-unigenes, 58,171 were assigned with Nr annotations after homology analyses.

Validation of the RNA-seq quantifications (RPKM values) was performed by qRT-PCR (Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR) analyses. Enrichment analyses of DEGs based on GO and KEGG databases have shown that both leaf and root tissues regulate energy metabolism, transmembrane transport activity, and secondary metabolites to cope with salinity. A total of 2,678 putative common bean transcription factors were identified and classified under 59 transcription factor families; among them 441 were salt responsive.

Technological advances in next generation sequencing technologies are fuelling a rapid growth in the number and scope of projects aiming to analyze complex microbial environments such as marine, soil or the gut. Recent improvements in longer read lengths and paired-sequencing allow better resolution in profiling microbial communities. While both 454 sequencing and Illumina sequencing have been used in numerous metagenomic studies, SOLiD sequencing is not commonly used in this area, as it is believed to be more suitable in the context of reference-guided projects.RESULTS: To investigate the performance of SOLiD sequencing in a metagenomic context, we compared taxonomic profiles of SOLiD mate-pair sequencing reads with Sanger paired reads and 454 single reads. All sequences were obtained from the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, which was amplified from microbial DNA extracted from a human fecal sample. Additionally, from the same fecal sample, complete genomic microbial DNA was extracted and shotgun sequenced using SOLiD sequencing to study the composition of the intestinal microbiota and the existing microbial metabolism. We found that the microbiota composition of 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained using Sanger, 454 and SOLiD sequencing provide results comparable to the result based on shotgun sequencing. Moreover, with SOLiD sequences we obtained more resolution down to the species level. In addition, the shotgun data allowed us to determine a functional profile using the databases SEED and KEGG.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that SOLiD mate-pair sequencing is a viable and cost-efficient option for analyzing a complex microbiome.

It has been observed in mammals and marsupials, but not in birds. Until now, only a few genes orthologous to mammalian imprinted ones have been analyzed in chicken and did not demonstrate any evidence of imprinting in this species. However, several published observations such as imprinted-like QTL in poultry or reciprocal effects keep the question open. Our main objective was thus to screen the entire chicken genome for parental-allele-specific differential expression on whole embryonic transcriptomes, using high-throughput sequencing. To identify the parental origin of each observed haplotype, two chicken experimental populations were used, as inbred and as genetically distant as possible. Two families were produced from two reciprocal crosses. Transcripts from 20 embryos were sequenced using NGS technology, producing ∼200 Gb of sequences. This allowed the detection of 79 potentially imprinted SNPs, through an analysis method that we validated by detecting imprinting from mouse data already published. However, out of 23 candidates tested by pyrosequencing, none could be confirmed. These results come together, without a priori, with previous statements and phylogenetic considerations assessing the absence of genomic imprinting in chicken."

Our data set is produced using the paired-end analysis of transcription start sites (PEAT) protocol, providing millions of TSS locations from wild-type Columbia-0 Arabidopsis thaliana whole root samples.

We then designed a machine learning model that predicts the presence of TSS tag clusters with outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all three initiation patterns. We used this model to analyze the transcription factor binding site content of promoters exhibiting these initiation patterns. In contrast to the canonical notions of TATA-containing and more broad &quot;TATA-less&quot; promoters, the model shows that, in plants, the vast majority of transcription start sites are TATA free and are defined by a large compendium of known DNA sequence binding elements.

The whole-genomes of AG8, the rice pathogen AG1-IA and the potato pathogen AG3 were observed to be syntenic and co-linear. Genes and functions putatively relevant to pathogenicity were highlighted by comparing AG8 to known pathogenicity genes, orthology databases spanning 197 phytopathogenic taxa and AG1-IA. We also observed SNP-level &quot;hypermutation&quot; of CpG dinucleotides to TpG between AG8 nuclei, with similarities to repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). Interestingly, gene-coding regions were widely affected along with repetitive DNA, which has not been previously observed for RIP in mononuclear fungi of the Pezizomycotina. The rate of heterozygous SNP mutations within this single isolate of AG8 was observed to be higher than SNP mutation rates observed across populations of most fungal species compared. Comparative analyses were combined to predict biological processes relevant to AG8 and 308 proteins with effector-like characteristics, forming a valuable resource for further study of this pathosystem. Predicted effector-like proteins had elevated levels of non-synonymous point mutations relative to synonymous mutations (dN/dS), suggesting that they may be under diversifying selection pressures. In addition, the distant relationship to sequenced necrotrophs of the Ascomycota suggests the R. solani genome sequence may prove to be a useful resource in future comparative analysis of plant pathogens."

Next generation high throughput sequencing technologies offer an efficient and economic choice for characterizing non-model organism transcriptomes with little or no prior molecular information available.RESULTS: In this study, we employed next generation, high-throughput, Illumina RNA-Seq to analyze the poly-(A) + mRNA from hydrated, dehydrating and desiccated S. caninervis gametophores. Approximately 58.0 million paired-end short reads were obtained and 92,240 unigenes were assembled with an average size of 493 bp, N50 value of 662 bp and a total size of 45.48 Mbp. Sequence similarity searches against five public databases (NR, Swiss-Prot, COSMOSS, KEGG and COG) found 54,125 unigenes (58.7%) with significant similarity to an existing sequence (E-value ≤ 1e-5) and could be annotated. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation assigned 24,183 unigenes to the three GO terms: Biological Process, Cellular Component or Molecular Function. GO comparison between P. patens and S. caninervis demonstrated similar sequence enrichment across all three GO categories. 29,370 deduced polypeptide sequences were assigned Pfam domain information and categorized into 4,212 Pfam domains/families. Using the PlantTFDB, 778 unigenes were predicted to be involved in the regulation of transcription and were classified into 49 transcription factor families. Annotated unigenes were mapped to the KEGG pathways and further annotated using MapMan. Comparative genomics revealed that 44% of protein families are shared in common by S. caninervis, P. patens and Arabidopsis thaliana and that 80% are shared by both moss species.CONCLUSIONS: This study is one of the first comprehensive transcriptome analyses of the moss S. caninervis. Our data extends our knowledge of bryophyte transcriptomes, provides an insight to plants adapted to the arid regions of central Asia, and continues the development of S. caninervis as a model for understanding the molecular aspects of desiccation-tolerance."

Molecular analyses of peat soils, ecosystems important to the global carbon balance, are still challenging due to the presence of coextracted substances that inhibit enzymes used in downstream applications. We sampled layers at different depths from two high-Arctic peat soils in Svalbard for metatranscriptome preparation. Here we show that enzyme inhibition in the preparation of metatranscriptomic libraries can be circumvented by linear amplification of diluted template RNA. A comparative analysis of mRNA-enriched and nonenriched metatranscriptomes showed that mRNA enrichment resulted in a 2-fold increase in the relative abundance of mRNA but biased the relative distribution of mRNA. The relative abundance of transcripts for cellulose degradation decreased with depth, while the transcripts for hemicellulose debranching increased, indicating that the polysaccharide composition of the peat was different in the deeper and older layers. Taxonomic annotation revealed that Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominating polysaccharide decomposers. The relative abundances of 16S rRNA and mRNA transcripts of methanogenic Archaea increased substantially with depth. Acetoclastic methanogenesis was the dominating pathway, followed by methanogenesis from formate. The relative abundances of 16S rRNA and mRNA assigned to the methanotrophic Methylococcaceae, primarily Methylobacter, increased with depth. In conclusion, linear amplification of total RNA and deep sequencing constituted the preferred method for metatranscriptomic preparation to enable high-resolution functional and taxonomic analyses of the active microbiota in Arctic peat soil."

Rhizobacterial communities of tobacco and wheat sampled in 2 years from four farmers' fields of contrasted suppressiveness status were compared. The 64 previously identified indicator probes correctly classified 72% of 29 field samples, with nine probes for Azospirillum, Gluconacetobacter, Sphingomonadaceae, Planctomycetes, Mycoplasma, Lactobacillus crispatus and Thermodesulforhabdus providing the best prediction. The whole probe set (1033 probes) revealed strong effects of plant, field location and year on rhizobacterial community composition, and a smaller (7% variance) but significant effect of soil suppressiveness status. Seventeen additional probes correlating with suppressiveness status in the field (noticeably for Agrobacterium, Methylobacterium, Ochrobactrum) were selected, and combined with the nine others, they improved correct sample classification from 72% to 79% (100% tobacco and 63% wheat samples). Pseudomonas probes were not informative in the field, even those targeting biocontrol pseudomonads producing 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, nor was quantitative polymerase chain reaction for 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol-synthesis gene phlD.

Little is known about the structure and diversity of the terrestrial bacterial communities in ice-free areas in northern Greenland. These soils are generally poorly developed and usually carbon- and nitrogen-limited. Our goal was to provide the first insights into the soil bacterial communities from five different sites in Northeast Greenland using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. The comparison of environmental and biological data showed that the soil bacterial communities are diverse and significantly pH-dependent. The most frequently detected OTUs belonged to the phyla Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes and (Alpha-, Beta-, Delta-) Proteobacteria. Low pH together with higher nitrogen and carbon concentrations seemed to support the occurrence of (Alpha-, Beta-, Delta-) Proteobacteria (at the expense of Acidobacteria), whereas Bacteroidetes were predominant at higher values of soil pH. Our study indicates that pH is the main factor for shaping bacterial community, but carbon and nitrogen concentrations as well may become important, especially for selecting oligotrophic microorganisms."

Here we assessed how forest management regimes and a change in forest type affect the richness and community structure of wood-inhabiting fungi across Germany. We used molecular methods based on the length polymorphism of the internal transcribed spacers and the 5.8S rRNA gene to assess fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A cloning/sequencing approach was used to identify taxonomic affinities of the fungal OTUs. Overall, 20-24% and 25-27% of native fungal OTUs from forest reserves and semi-natural forests became undetectable or were lost in managed and converted forests, respectively. Fungal richness was significantly reduced during a regeneration phase in age-class beech forests with a high level of wood extraction (P = 0.017), whereas fungal community structures were not significantly affected. Conversion of forests from native, deciduous to coniferous species caused significant changes in the fungal community structure (R = 0.64-0.66, P = 0.0001) and could reduce fungal richness (P &lt; 0.05) which may depend on which coniferous species was introduced. Our results showed that Ascocoryne cylichnium, Armillaria sp., Exophiala moniliae, Hyphodontia subalutacea and Fomes fomentarius, all known for wood-decaying abilities were strongly reduced in their abundances when forests were converted from beech to coniferous. We conclude that changes within a single land-use category can be regarded as a major threat to fungal diversity in temperate forest ecosystems."

This study employed next-generation sequencing to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind these complex adaptive responses at the transcriptome level. We compared different stages of CR development, including pre-emergent (PE), juvenile (JU) and the mature (MA) stages. The results confirmed that the primary metabolism underwent significant modifications during CR maturation, promoting the biosynthesis of organic acids, as had been deduced from physiological studies. Citrate catabolism was downregulated, associated with citrate accumulation in MA clusters. Upregulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway reflected the accumulation of phenolics. Specific transcript expression of ALMT and MATE transporter genes correlated with the exudation of citrate and flavonoids. The expression of transcripts related to nucleotide degradation and APases in MA clusters coincided with the re-mobilization and hydrolysis of organic phosphate resources. Most interestingly, hormone-related gene expression suggested a central role of ethylene during CR maturation. This was associated with the upregulation of the iron (Fe)-deficiency regulated network that mediates ethylene-induced expression of Fe-deficiency responses in other species. Finally, transcripts related to abscisic acid and jasmonic acid were upregulated in MA clusters, while auxin- and brassinosteroid-related genes and cytokinin receptors were most strongly expressed during CR initiation. Key regulations proposed by the RNA-seq data were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and some physiological analyses. A model for the gene network regulating CR development and function is presented."

They affect soil properties and nutrient cycling, thus shaping plant community composition and aboveground food webs. Some lumbricids are also model organisms in ecology and toxicology. Despite the intense research efforts dedicated to lumbricids over the last 130years, the evolutionary relationships and taxonomic classification of these organisms are still subject to great debate. Resolution of their systematics is hampered by the structural simplicity of the earthworm body plan and the existence of cryptic species. We sampled 160 earthworm specimens belonging to 84 lumbricid species (28 genera) and 22 Lumbricoidea outgroups, sequenced two nuclear genes, four mitochondrial genes and seven mitochondrial tRNAs and examined 22 morphological characters. We then applied a combination of phylogenetic methods to generate the first robust genus-level phylogeny of the Lumbricidae. Our results show that the current Lumbricidae classification and the underlying hypotheses of character evolution must be revised. Our chronogram suggests that lumbricids emerged in the Lower Cretaceous in the holarctic region and that their diversification has been driven by tectonic processes (e.g. Laurasia split) and geographical isolation. Our chronogram and character reconstruction analysis reveal that spermathecae number does not follow a gradual pattern of reduction and that parthenogenesis arose from sexual relatives multiple times in the group; the same analysis also indicates that both epigeic and anecic earthworms evolved from endogeic ancestors. These findings emphasize the strong and multiple changes to which morphological and ecological characters are subjected, challenging the hypothesis of character stasis in Lumbricidae."

The increasing use of massive sequencing technologies in biodiversity investigations has now raised the question of the advantages of such technologies over the fingerprinting approach for elucidation of the determinism of soil microbial community assembly in broad-scale biogeographic studies. Our objectives in this study were to compare DNA fingerprinting and meta-barcoding approaches for evaluating soil bacterial TAR and the determinism of soil bacterial community assembly on a broad scale. This comparison was performed on 392 soil samples from four French geographic regions with different levels of environmental heterogeneity. Both molecular approaches demonstrated a TAR with a significant slope but, because of its more sensitive description of soil bacterial community richness, meta-barcoding provided significantly higher and more accurate estimates of turnover rates. Both approaches were useful in evidencing the processes shaping bacterial diversity variations on a broad scale. When different taxonomic resolutions were considered for meta-barcoding data, they significantly influenced the estimation of turnover rates but not the relative importance of each component process. Altogether, DNA meta-barcoding provides a more accurate evaluation of the TAR and may lead to re-examination of the processes shaping soil bacterial community assembly. This should provide new insights into soil microbial ecology in the context of sustainable use of soil resources."

However, none of the methods used in environmental genomics allow for a rapid isolation of numerous functional genes from eukaryotic microbial communities. We developed an original adaptation of the solution hybrid selection (SHS) for an efficient recovery of functional complementary DNAs (cDNAs) synthesized from soil-extracted polyadenylated mRNAs.

Winogradsky columns have been used extensively to demonstrate microbial nutrient cycling and metabolic diversity in undergraduate microbiology labs. In this study, we used high-throughput 16s rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the microbial diversity of Winogradsky columns. Specifically, we tested the impact of sediment source, supplemental cellulose source, and depth within the column, on microbial community structure. We found that the Winogradsky columns were highly diverse communities but are dominated by three phyla: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. The community is structured by a founding population dependent on the source of sediment used to prepare the columns and is differentiated by depth within the column. Numerous biomarkers were identified distinguishing sample depth, including Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria as biomarkers of the soil-water interface, and Clostridia as a biomarker of the deepest depth. Supplemental cellulose source impacted community structure but less strongly than depth and sediment source. In columns dominated by Firmicutes, the family Peptococcaceae was the most abundant sulfate reducer, while in columns abundant in Proteobacteria, several Deltaproteobacteria families, including Desulfobacteraceae, were found, showing that different taxonomic groups carry out sulfur cycling in different columns.

Meanwhile, on genus level, higher abundances compared to other treatments were observed for Gemmatimonas and Gp4. Correlation and redundancy analysis showed that the abundance of Gemmatimonas and Sphingomonas and the soil total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen content were higher after BIO application, and they were all positively correlated with disease suppression.

Plants often produce increased fine root biomass in response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ), but the responses of soil microbial communities are variable and uncertain, particularly in terms of species diversity. In this study, we describe the responses of the soil fungal community to free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) in a semiarid chaparral shrubland in Southern California (dominated by Adenomstoma fasciculatum) using large subunit rRNA gene sequencing. Community composition varied greatly over the landscape and responses to FACE were subtle, involving a few specific groups. Increased frequency of Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes, the latter including the Helotiales, a group that includes many dark septate endophytes known to associate positively with roots, was observed in the FACE plots. Fungal diversity, both in terms of richness and evenness, increased consistently in the FACE treatment, and was relatively high compared to other studies that used similar methods. Increases in diversity were observed across multiple phylogenetic levels, from genus to class, and were distributed broadly across fungal lineages. Diversity was also higher in samples collected close to (5 cm) plants compared to samples in canopy gaps (30 cm away from plants). Fungal biomass correlated well with soil organic matter (SOM) content, but patterns of diversity were correlated with fine root production rather than SOM. We conclude that the fungal community in this ecosystem is tightly linked to plant fine root production, and that future changes in the fungal community in response to elevated CO2 and other climatic changes will be primarily driven by changes in plant belowground allocation. Potential feedbacks mediated by soil fungi, such as soil C sequestration, nutrient cycling, and pathogenesis, are discussed."

The water layer was kept at 1-2 cm in the water-saving (WS) irrigation treatment and at 6 cm in the continuous flooding (CF) irrigation treatment. WS irrigation decreased CH(4) emissions by 78 % and increased N(2)O emissions by 533 %, resulting in 78 % reduction of global warming potential compared to the CF irrigation. WS irrigation did not affect the abundance or phylogenetic distribution of bacterial/archaeal 16S rRNA genes and the abundance of bacterial/archaeal 16S rRNAs. The transcript abundance of CH(4) emission-related genes generally followed CH(4) emission patterns, but the difference in abundance between mcrA transcripts and amoA/pmoA transcripts best described the differences in CH(4) emissions between the two irrigation practices. WS irrigation increased the relative abundance of 16S rRNAs and functional gene transcripts associated with Anaeromyxobacter and Methylocystis spp., suggesting that their activities might be important in emissions of the greenhouse gases. The N(2)O emission patterns were not reflected in the abundance of N(2)O emission-related genes and transcripts. We showed that the alternative irrigation practice was effective for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from rice fields and that it did not affect the overall size and structure of the soil prokaryotic community but did affect the activity of some groups."

The cost of nucleotide sequence analysis, including requisite computational and bioinformatic steps, however, takes up a large part of many research budgets. High-resolution melt (HRM) analysis is the study of the melt behavior of specific PCR products. Here we describe a novel high-throughput approach in which we used HRM analysis targeting the 16S rRNA gene to rapidly screen multiple complex samples for differences in bacterial community composition. We hypothesized that HRM analysis of amplified 16S rRNA genes from a soil ecosystem could be used as a screening tool to identify changes in bacterial community structure. This hypothesis was tested using a soil microcosm setup exposed to a total of six treatments representing different combinations of pesticide and fertilization treatments. The HRM analysis identified a shift in the bacterial community composition in two of the treatments, both including the soil fumigant Basamid GR. These results were confirmed with both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis and 454-based 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. HRM analysis was shown to be a fast, high-throughput technique that can serve as an effective alternative to gel-based screening methods to monitor microbial community composition."

Many of the bacterial clone sequences and the 27 isolates were related to known xenobiotic degraders. An archaeal clone library from a non-hydrolyzed sample showed the presence of three main clusters, two representing methanogens and one representing marine aerobic ammonia oxidizers. Isolation of alkalitolerant bacterial pure cultures from the hydrolyzed soil confirmed that although alkaline hydrolysis severely reduces microbial community diversity and size certain bacteria survive a prolonged alkaline hydrolysis process. Some of the isolates from the hydrolyzed soil were capable of growing at high pH (pH 10.0) in synthetic media indicating that they could become active in in situ biodegradation upon hydrolysis."

Fungal saprotrophic communities play an essential role in this process by producing hydrolytic enzymes active on the main components of plant organic matter. Open questions in this field regard the diversity of the species involved, the major biochemical pathways implicated and how these are affected by external factors such as litter quality or climate changes. This can be tackled by environmental genomic approaches involving the systematic sequencing of key enzyme-coding gene families using soil-extracted RNA as material. Such an approach necessitates the design and evaluation of gene family-specific PCR primers producing sequence fragments compatible with high-throughput sequencing approaches. In the present study, we developed and evaluated PCR primers for the specific amplification of fungal CAZy Glycoside Hydrolase gene families GH5 (subfamily 5) and GH11 encoding endo-β-1,4-glucanases and endo-β-1,4-xylanases respectively as well as Basidiomycota class II peroxidases, corresponding to the CAZy Auxiliary Activity family 2 (AA2), active on lignin. These primers were experimentally validated using DNA extracted from a wide range of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota species including 27 with sequenced genomes. Along with the published primers for Glycoside Hydrolase GH7 encoding enzymes active on cellulose, the newly design primers were shown to be compatible with the Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology. Sequences obtained from RNA extracted from beech or spruce forest soils showed a high diversity and were uniformly distributed in gene trees featuring the global diversity of these gene families. This high-throughput sequencing approach using several degenerate primers constitutes a robust method, which allows the simultaneous characterization of the diversity of different fungal transcripts involved in plant organic matter degradation and may lead to the discovery of complex patterns in gene expression of soil fungal communities."

[METHODS] Flooded soil microcosms were incubated in the laboratory for two weeks, then total RNA were extracted from the soil for transcriptome sequencing. Resulting fastq files were uploaded to the Metagenomics Analysis Server (MG-RAST) for taxonomic analysis, gene annotation and function classification. [RESULTS] Transcripts from diverse active microorganism, including bacteria ( &gt; 95% ) , archaea, eukaryotes and viruses, were detected in both flooded paddy soils of CK and NPK treatments. Most of the transcripts (active genes) of bacteria and archaea were derived from Proteobacteria (more than 50% of total bacterial transcripts) and Thaumarchaaeota (about 70% of total archaeal transcripts ) respectively in both treatments. Transcriptional activity of Acidobacteria in NPK treatment paddy soil was significantly higher than that in CK treatment paddy soil. As for other phyla of bacteria and archaea, there were no significant differences of transcriptional activity of them between CK and NPK treatment paddy soils. The highest expressed gene in both CK and NPK treatment paddy soils is ABC transporter encoding gene which related to the transmembrane transport of substances. Based on gene function category of COG (Clusters of Orthologous Genes), Subsystem and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database, we found that the main metabolic activities of microorganisms in both CK and NPK treatment paddy soils were related to energy production and conversion, carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism and amino acid metabolism, and the dominant KEGG pathways were oxidative phosphorylation and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. [ CONCLUSION] Composition of active microorganism in CK and NPK treatment paddy soils was generally similar, except Acidobacteria whose transcriptional activity was significantly different between these two treatment paddy soils. It was also very similar between CK and NPK treatment paddy soils considering the metabolic activities of microorganisms in them, for dominant metabolic processes in these two soils were both related to energy obtaining and protein metabolism.

Such additive purple colour was not detected by deficiencies of other major- and micronutrients or stresses of salt, drought and cold. There was an extremely high correlation between P concentration and anthocyanin accumulation in the transgenic tobacco leaves.

The experiments were performed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and grayscale intensity image analysis using Gel-Pro analyzer software. Strain XJ-1 was identified as Rhodobacter (R.) capsulatus based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and physiological characteristics. Strain XJ-1 was able to grow when exposed to arsenite [As(III)] and arsenate [As(V)] under anaerobic-light conditions. The median effective concentrations (EC50) of As(III) and As(V) were 0.61 mM and 2.03 mM, respectively. Strain XJ-1 could reduce As(V) to As(III), but As(III) could not be transformed back to As(V) or other organic As compounds. Accumulation of bacteriochlorophylls and carotenoids in strain XJ-1 varied in the presence of 0.2-1.2 mM As(III) and 0-2.5 mM As(V). As exposure resulted in pronounced variation in compositions and contents of photosynthetic pigments, especially hydroxyspheroidene, bacteriophaeophytin, the ratio of tetrahydrogeranylgeranyl to phytylated BChl a, and the ratio of spheroidene to spheroidenone. This research highlights the adaptative response of R. capsulatus strain XJ-1 photosystems to environmental As, and demonstrates the potential of utilizing the sensitivity of its photosynthetic pigments to As(III) and As(V) for the biodetection of As in the environment."

In this study, microbial communities from green waste compost (GWC) and grape pomace compost (GPC) were cultured on switchgrass and eucalyptus to observe the impact of inoculation on feedstock decomposition and microbial community structure.METHODS AND RESULTS: Respiration was monitored as a measure of microbial activity, and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was used to characterize microbial community structure. The enriched community structure and respiration were influenced by the choice of feedstock, compost type, and application of thermophilic, high-solids conditions. However, the effect of compost source was significantly less than the effects of the other culture variables.CONCLUSIONS: Although there are subtle differences in potentially lignocellulolytic taxa between GPC- and GWC-derived communities, these differences do not affect the decomposition rates for these communities on switchgrass or eucalyptus.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results are useful for designing future experiments to discover lignocellulolytic micro-organisms from compost. They suggest that such work may be better served by deemphasizing screening of compost sources and instead focusing on how compost-derived communities adapt to the feedstocks and process conditions relevant to biofuel production."

Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was used as a fungicide from 1945, leaving behind many contaminated sites. Very few studies have examined the biodegradation of HCB or the fate of HCB-derived carbon. Here we report that certain bacterial populations are capable of deriving carbon from HCB in contaminated soil under aerobic conditions. These populations are primarily Proteobacteria, including Methylobacterium and Pseudomonas, which predominated as detected by stable isotope probing (SIP) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing. Due to the nature of SIP, which can be used as a functional method solely for assimilatory processes, it is not possible to elucidate whether these populations metabolized directly HCB or intermediates of its metabolism produced by different populations. The possibility exists that HCB is degraded via the formation of pentachlorophenol (PCP), which is further mineralized. With this in mind, we designed primers to amplify PCP 4-monooxygenase-coding sequences based on the available pcpB gene sequence from Methylobacterium radiotolerans JCM 2831. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, organisms closely related to this strain were detected in (13)C-labeled DNA. Using the designed primers, we were able to amplify pcpB genes in both total community DNA and (13)C-DNA. This indicates that HCB might be transformed into PCP before it gets assimilated. In summary, this study is the first report on which bacterial populations benefit from carbon originating in the pesticide HCB in a contaminated soil."

Multiple sequence alignments of each orthologous intron group were obtained using the Mafft algorithm. The number of conserved regions in plant introns appeared to be hundreds of times fewer than that in mammals or vertebrates. Approximately three quarters of conserved intronic regions among angiosperms and dicots, in particular, correspond to alternatively-spliced exonic sequences. We registered only a handful of conserved intronic ncRNAs of flowering plants. However, the most evolutionarily conserved intronic region, which is ubiquitous for all plants examined in this study, including moss, possessed multiple structural features of tRNAs, which caused us to classify it as a putative tRNA-like ncRNA. Intronic sequences encoding tRNA-like structures are not unique to plants. Bioinformatics examination of the presence of tRNA inside introns revealed an unusually long-term association of four glycine tRNAs inside the Vac14 gene of fish, amniotes, and mammals."

Phytophthora species can infect most crops and plants from natural ecosystems. Despite their tremendous economic and ecologic importance, few effective methods exist for limiting the damage caused by these species. New solutions are required, and their development will require improvements in our understanding of the molecular events governing infection by these pathogens. In this study, we characterized the genetic program activated during penetration of the plant by the soil-borne pathogen Phytophthora parasitica.RESULTS: Using all the P. parasitica sequences available in public databases, we generated a custom oligo-array and performed a transcriptomic analysis of the early events of Arabidopsis thaliana infection. We characterized biological stages, ranging from the appressorium-mediated penetration of the pathogen into the roots to the occurrence of first dead cells in the plant. We identified a series of sequences that were transiently modulated during host penetration. Surprisingly, we observed an overall down regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in lipid and sugar metabolism, and an upregulation of functions controlling the transport of amino acids. We also showed that different groups of genes were expressed by P. parasitica during host penetration and the subsequent necrotrophic phase. Differential expression patterns were particularly marked for cell wall-degrading enzymes and other proteins involved in pathogenicity, including RXLR effectors. By transforming P. parasitica with a transcriptional fusion with GFP, we showed that an RXLR-ecoding gene was expressed in the appressorium and infectious hyphae during infection of the first plant cell.CONCLUSION: We have characterized the genetic program activated during the initial invasion of plant cells by P. parasitica. We showed that a specific set of proteins, including effectors, was mobilized for penetration and to facilitate infection. Our detection of the expression of an RXLR encoding gene by the appressorium and infection hyphae highlights a role of this structure in the manipulation of the host cells."

The statistical analyses (rarefaction curves as well as Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices) showed that bacterial diversity was slightly higher in Dongdo than Seodo. From results of a BLASTN search against the EzTaxon-e database, the validated reads (obtained after sequence preprocessing) were almost all classified at the phylum level. From the phylum level down to the species level, the number of classified reads considerably decreased due to the absence of information concerning unculturable or unidentified bacteria to date. Among the 36 phyla identified, three phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria) accounted for around 74.64%. The taxonomic composition was similar at the higher ranks (family and above) between Dongdo and Seodo, but a little different at the genus level. There were also various differences in the relative abundance of taxonomic ranks between Dongdo and Seodo.

Previous studies have suggested the utility of cassette-electrode (CE) MFCs for wastewater treatment, in which rice paddy-field soil was used as the inoculum. The present study attempted to convert an activated-sludge (AS) reactor to CE-MFC and use aerobic sludge in the tank as the source of microbes. We used laboratory-scale (1 L in capacity) reactors that were initially operated in an AS mode to treat synthetic wastewater, containing starch, yeast extract, peptone, plant oil, and detergents. After the organics removal became stable, the aeration was terminated, and CEs were inserted to initiate an MFC-mode operation. It was demonstrated that the MFC-mode operation treated the wastewater at similar efficiencies to those observed in the AS-mode operation with COD-removal efficiencies of 75-80%, maximum power densities of 150-200 mW m(-2) and Coulombic efficiencies of 20-30%. These values were similar to those of CE-MFC inoculated with the soil. Anode microbial communities were analyzed by pyrotag sequencing of 16S rRNA gene PCR amplicons. Comparative analyses revealed that anode communities enriched from the aerobic sludge were largely different from those from the soil, suggesting that similar reactor performances can be supported by different community structures.

For more accurate bacterial diversity analyses, the influences of soil heterogeneity and sequence resolution on bacterial diversity estimates were investigated using pyrosequencing data of oak and pine forest soils with focus on the bacterial 16SrRNA gene. Soil bacterial community sets were phylogenetically clustered into two separate groups by forest type. Rarefaction curves showed that bacterial communities sequenced from the DNA mixtures and the DNAs of the soil mixtures had midsize richness compared with other samples. Richness and diversity estimates were highly variable depending on the sequence read numbers. Bacterial richness estimates (ACE, Chao 1 and Jack) of the forest soils had positive linear relationships with the sequence read number. Bacterial diversity estimates (NPShannon, Shannon and the inverse Simpson) of the forest soils were also positively correlated with the sequence read number.

We examined impacts of elevated N and P availability on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a group of obligate biotrophic plant symbionts with an important role in soil nutrient cycles. We tested the hypothesis that increased nutrient availability will reduce AMF abundance, reduce species richness and shift the AMF community toward lineages previously shown to be favored by fertilized conditions. NUMEX was designed as a full factorial randomized block design. Soil cores were taken after 2 years of nutrient additions in plots located at 2000 m above sea level. Roots were extracted and intraradical AMF abundance determined microscopically; the AMF community was analyzed by 454-pyrosequencing targeting the large subunit rDNA. We identified 74 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a large proportion of Diversisporales. N additions provoked a significant decrease in intraradical abundance, whereas AMF richness was reduced significantly by N and P additions, with the strongest effect in the combined treatment (39% fewer OTUs), mainly influencing rare species. We identified a differential effect on phylogenetic groups, with Diversisporales richness mainly reduced by N additions in contrast to Glomerales highly significantly affected solely by P. Regarding AMF community structure, we observed a compositional shift when analyzing presence/absence data following P additions. In conclusion, N and P additions in this ecosystem affect AMF abundance, but especially AMF species richness; these changes might influence plant community composition and productivity and by that various ecosystem processes."

A patented method was applied to red clay in order to change its chemical composition and mineral bioavailability. The resulting product was designated processed red clay. This study evaluates the novel use of red clay and processed red clay as biostimulation agents in diesel-contaminated soils. Diesel biodegradation was enhanced in the presence of red clay and processed red clay by 4.9- and 6.7-fold, respectively, and the number of culturable bacterial cells was correlated with the amount of diesel biodegradation. The growth of Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, and Cupriavidus necator was promoted by both types of red clays. Culture-independent community analysis determined via barcoded pyrosequencing indicated that Nocardioidaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Caulobacteraceae were enriched by diesel contamination.

Plant miRNA precursors are quite variable in their size and shape. Still, the miRNA processing machinery, consisting of DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) and accessory proteins recognize structural features on the precursors to cleave them at specific places releasing the mature miRNAs. The identification of miRNA processing intermediates in plants has mostly relied on a modified 5' RACE method, designed to detect the 5' end of uncapped RNAs. However, this method is time consuming and is, therefore, only practical for the analysis of a handful miRNAs. Here, we present a modification of this approach in order to perform genome-wide analysis of miRNA processing intermediates. Briefly, a reverse transcription is performed with a mixture of specific primers designed against all known miRNA precursors. miRNA processing intermediates are then specifically amplified to generate a library and subjected to deep sequencing. This method, called SPARE (Specific Parallel Amplification of 5' RNA Ends) allows the identification of processing intermediates for most of the Arabidopsis miRNAs. The results enable the determination of the DCL1 processing direction and the cleavage sites introduced by miRNA processing machinery in the precursors.

Among these isolated bacteria, four strains show higher activity in pH-Stat method at 55 °C. These strains were identified by PCR amplification of 16s rRNA genes using universal primers. Fermentation increased the activity up to 50%. The growth medium, designed for lipase production, increased the activity up to 4.55 folds. The crude supernatant of ZR-5 after fermentation and separation the cells, was lyophilized and the activity was measured. Total activity of this strain was 12 kU/g that shows its potential for industrial uses. Further study is required for purification of enzyme and calculation its specific activity.

Clinicians are using metagenomics to determine the role played by collection of microbial organisms within human body with respect to human health wellness and disease.RESULTS: We have developed an efficient and scalable, species richness estimation algorithm that uses locality sensitive hashing (LSH).

We also compute different species diversity/richness metrics by utilizing OTU assignment results to further extend our analysis.CONCLUSION: The algorithm is evaluated on synthetic samples and eight targeted 16S rRNA metagenome samples taken from seawater. We compare the performance of our algorithm with several competing diversity estimation algorithms. We show the benefits of our approach with respect to computational runtime and meaningful OTU assignments.

Pyrosequencing reads containing ambiguous bases (Ns) are generally discarded based on the assumptions of their non-sequence-dependent formation and high error rates. However, taxonomic composition differed by removal of reads with Ns. We determined whether Ns from pyrosequencing occur in a sequence-dependent manner. Our reads and the corresponding flow value data revealed occurrence of sequence-specific N errors with a common sequential pattern (a homopolymer + a few nucleotides with bases other than the homopolymer + N) and revealed that the nucleotide base of the homopolymer is the true base for the following N. Using an algorithm reflecting this sequence-dependent pattern, we corrected the Ns in the 16S (86.54%), bphD (81.37%) and nifH (81.55%) amplicon reads from a mock community with high precisions of 95.4, 96.9 and 100%, respectively.

MicroRNA is implicated in many developmental processes and in responses to various abiotic stresses, playing pivotal roles in plant adaptation. Deep sequencing technology was chosen to determine the small RNA transcriptome of Saccharum sp cultivars grown on saline conditions. We constructed four small RNAs libraries prepared from plants grown on hydroponic culture submitted to 170 mM NaCl and harvested after 1 h, 6 hs and 24 hs. Each library was sequenced individually and together generated more than 50 million short reads. Ninety-eight conserved miRNAs and 33 miRNAs* were identified by bioinformatics. Several of the microRNA showed considerable differences of expression in the four libraries. To confirm the results of the bioinformatics-based analysis, we studied the expression of the 10 most abundant miRNAs and 1 miRNA* in plants treated with 170 mM NaCl and in plants with a severe treatment of 340 mM NaCl. The results showed that 11 selected miRNAs had higher expression in samples treated with severe salt treatment compared to the mild one. We also investigated the regulation of the same miRNAs in shoots of four cultivars grown on soil treated with 170 mM NaCl. Cultivars could be grouped according to miRNAs expression in response to salt stress. Furthermore, the majority of the predicted target genes had an inverse regulation with their correspondent microRNAs. The targets encode a wide range of proteins, including transcription factors, metabolic enzymes and genes involved in hormone signaling, probably assisting the plants to develop tolerance to salinity.

Many of the bacterial genera included known opportunistic pathogens, and many were skin-associated (e.g., Propionibacterium). In one NICU, we also detected fecal coliform bacteria (Enterobacteriales) in a high proportion of the surface samples. Comparison of these NICU-derived sequences to previously published high-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon studies of other indoor environments (offices, restrooms and healthcare facilities), as well as human- and soil-associated environments, found the majority of the NICU samples to be similar to typical building surface and air samples, with the notable exception of the IHEs which were dominated by Enterobacteriaceae. Our findings provide evidence that NICU IHEs harbor a high diversity of human-associated bacteria and demonstrate the potential utility of molecular methods for identifying and tracking bacterial diversity in NICUs."

An important data gap however, that remains poorly studied is the baseline description of microflora that may be associated with plant anatomy either endemically or in response to environmental pressures. Specific anatomical niches of plants may contribute to persistence of human pathogens in agricultural environments in ways we have yet to describe. Tomatoes have been implicated in outbreaks of Salmonella at least 17 times during the years spanning 1990 to 2010. Our research seeks to provide a baseline description of the tomato microbiome and possibly identify whether or not there is something distinctive about tomatoes or their growing ecology that contributes to persistence of Salmonella in this important food crop.RESULTS: DNA was recovered from washes of epiphytic surfaces of tomato anatomical organs; leaves, stems, roots, flowers and fruits of Solanum lycopersicum (BHN602), grown at a site in close proximity to commercial farms previously implicated in tomato-Salmonella outbreaks. DNA was amplified for targeted 16S and 18S rRNA genes and sheared for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Amplicons and metagenomes were used to describe &quot;native&quot; bacterial microflora for diverse anatomical parts of Virginia-grown tomatoes.CONCLUSIONS: Distinct groupings of microbial communities were associated with different tomato plant organs and a gradient of compositional similarity could be correlated to the distance of a given plant part from the soil. Unique bacterial phylotypes (at 95% identity) were associated with fruits and flowers of tomato plants. These include Microvirga, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Brachybacterium, Rhizobiales, Paracocccus, Chryseomonas and Microbacterium. The most frequently observed bacterial taxa across aerial plant regions were Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas. Dominant fungal taxa that could be identified to genus with 18S amplicons included Hypocrea, Aureobasidium and Cryptococcus. No definitive presence of Salmonella could be confirmed in any of the plant samples, although 16S sequences suggested that closely related genera were present on leaves, fruits and roots."

The FastDNA(®) SPIN (FDS) Kit provided the highest gDNA yields and 16S rRNA gene concentrations, followed by MoBio PowerSoil(®) (PS) and MoBio PowerLyzer™ (PL) kits. The lowest gDNA yields and 16S rRNA gene concentrations were from the Meta-G-Nome™ (MGN) DNA Isolation Kit. Bacterial phyla identified in all DNA extracts were similar to that found in other soils and were dominated by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria. Weighted UniFrac and statistical analyses indicated that bacterial community compositions derived from FDS, PS, and PL extracts were similar to each other. However, the bacterial community structure from the MGN extracts differed from other kits exhibiting higher proportions of easily lysed β- and γ-Proteobacteria and lower proportions of Actinobacteria and Methylocystaceae important in carbon cycling. These results indicate that gDNA yields differ between the extraction kits, but reproducible bacterial community structure analysis may be accomplished using gDNAs from the three bead-beating lysis extraction kits."

In particular, studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have discovered variation in a number of key physiological traits involved in plant-water relations that may underlie evolved drought stress responses among accessions. Despite this abundant variation, we still know little about the complex genetic architecture of drought tolerance or its role in constraining evolution. Unfortunately, few natural allelic variants have been cloned for drought related traits--progress cloning QTL, the use of RNA-sequencing methods for evaluating gene expression responses to soil drying, and improved methodology for exploring complex multivariate data all hold promise for moving the field forward.

Here, we assess the impact of different soil storage conditions on microbial community composition using Illumina-based 16S rRNA V4 amplicon sequencing. Both storage time and temperature affected bacterial community composition and structure. Frozen samples maintained the highest alpha diversity and differed least in beta diversity, suggesting the utility of cold storage for maintaining consistent communities. Samples stored for intermediate times (three and seven days) had both the highest alpha diversity and the largest differences in overall beta diversity, showing the degree of community change after sample collection. These divergences notwithstanding, differences in neither storage time nor storage temperature substantially altered overall communities relative to more than 500 previously examined soil samples. These results systematically support previous studies and stress the importance of methodological consistency for accurate characterization and comparison of soil microbiological assemblages."

A 16S rRNA gene study from samples spanning the entire salinity range of the Baltic Sea indicated that, in the pelagic brackish water, a phylotype of the Spartobacteria is one of the dominating bacteria during summer. Phylogenetic analyses of related 16S rRNA genes indicate that a purely aquatic lineage within the Spartobacteria exists. Since no aquatic representative from the Spartobacteria has been cultured or sequenced, the metabolic capacity and ecological role of this lineage are yet unknown. In this study, we reconstructed the genome and metabolic potential of the abundant Baltic Sea Spartobacteria phylotype by metagenomics. Binning of genome fragments by nucleotide composition and a self-organizing map recovered the near-complete genome of the organism, the gene content of which suggests an aerobic heterotrophic metabolism. Notably, we found 23 glycoside hydrolases that likely allow the use of a variety of carbohydrates, like cellulose, mannan, xylan, chitin, and starch, as carbon sources. In addition, a complete pathway for sulfate utilization was found, indicating catabolic processing of sulfated polysaccharides, commonly found in aquatic phytoplankton. The high frequency of glycoside hydrolase genes implies an important role of this organism in the aquatic carbon cycle. Spatiotemporal data of the phylotype's distribution within the Baltic Sea indicate a connection to Cyanobacteria that may be the main source of the polysaccharide substrates."

The terrestrial landscape is dominated by oligotrophic mineral soils and extensive exposed rocky surfaces where biota are largely restricted to microbial communities, although their ability to perform the majority of geobiological processes has remained largely uncharacterized. Here, we identified functional traits that drive microbial survival and community assembly, using a metagenomic approach with GeoChip-based functional gene arrays to establish metabolic capabilities in communities inhabiting soil and rock surface niches in McKelvey Valley. Major pathways in primary metabolism were identified, indicating significant plasticity in autotrophic, heterotrophic, and diazotrophic strategies supporting microbial communities. This represents a major advance beyond biodiversity surveys in that we have now identified how putative functional ecology drives microbial community assembly. Significant differences were apparent between open soil, hypolithic, chasmoendolithic, and cryptoendolithic communities. A suite of previously unappreciated Antarctic microbial stress response pathways, thermal, osmotic, and nutrient limitation responses were identified and related to environmental stressors, offering tangible clues to the mechanisms behind the enduring success of microorganisms in this seemingly inhospitable terrain. Rocky substrates exposed to larger fluctuations in environmental stress supported greater functional diversity in stress-response pathways than soils. Soils comprised a unique reservoir of genes involved in transformation of organic hydrocarbons and lignin-like degradative pathways. This has major implications for the evolutionary origin of the organisms, turnover of recalcitrant substrates in Antarctic soils, and predicting future responses to anthropogenic pollution."

In this work, we identified Hfq to be a virulence regulator in the Gram-negative fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Deletion of hfq in E. amylovora Ea1189 significantly reduced bacterial virulence in both immature pear fruits and apple shoots. Analysis of virulence determinants in strain Ea1189Δhfq showed that Hfq exerts pleiotropic regulation of amylovoran exopolysaccharide production, biofilm formation, motility, and the type III secretion system (T3SS). Further characterization of biofilm regulation by Hfq demonstrated that Hfq limits bacterial attachment to solid surfaces while promoting biofilm maturation. Characterization of T3SS regulation by Hfq revealed that Hfq positively regulates the translocation and secretion of the major type III effector DspE and negatively controls the secretion of the putative translocator HrpK and the type III effector Eop1. Lastly, 10 Hfq-regulated sRNAs were identified using a computational method, and two of these sRNAs, RprA and RyhA, were found to be required for the full virulence of E. amylovora."

A total of 77,212 unigenes were obtained, and the unigenes were subjected to BLAST searching and annotated using the GO and KO databases. Six sets of digital gene expression data were mapped to the reference transcriptome. The gene expression profiles of cotton infected with Verticillium dahliae were compared to those of uninfected cotton; 44 differentially expressed genes were identified. Regarding genes involved in the phenylalanine metabolism pathway, the hydroxycinnamoyl transferase gene (HCT) was upregulated in upland cotton whereas PAL, 4CL, CAD, CCoAOMT, and COMT were upregulated in sea-island cotton. Almost no differentially expressed genes in this pathway were identified in sea-island cotton and upland cotton when they were infected with V. dahliae V991 and V. dahliae D07038, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive gene expression data at the transcription level will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the cotton defence response to V. dahliae.

In regions where it is endemic, H. capsulatum grows in the soil and causes respiratory and systemic disease when inhaled by humans. An interesting aspect of H. capsulatum biology is that it adopts specialized developmental programs in response to its environment. In the soil, it grows as filamentous chains of cells (mycelia) that produce asexual spores (conidia). When the soil is disrupted, conidia aerosolize and are inhaled by mammalian hosts. Inside a host, conidia germinate into yeast-form cells that colonize immune cells and cause disease. Despite the ability of conidia to initiate infection and disease, they have not been explored on a molecular level. We developed methods to purify H. capsulatum conidia, and we show here that these cells germinate into filaments at room temperature and into yeast-form cells at 37°C. Conidia internalized by macrophages germinate into the yeast form and proliferate within macrophages, ultimately lysing the host cells. Similarly, infection of mice with purified conidia is sufficient to establish infection and yield viable yeast-form cells in vivo. To characterize conidia on a molecular level, we performed whole-genome expression profiling of conidia, yeast, and mycelia from two highly divergent H. capsulatum strains. In parallel, we used homology and protein domain analysis to manually annotate the predicted genes of both strains. Analyses of the resultant data defined sets of transcripts that reflect the unique molecular states of H. capsulatum conidia, yeast, and mycelia."

It was shown that a total of 69% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were shared between environments. Overall, forest and grassland samples presented the same diversity and the clustering analysis did not show the occurrence of very distinctive bacterial communities between environments. However, 11 OTUs were detected in statistically significant higher abundance in the forest samples but in lower abundance in the grassland samples, whereas 12 OTUs occurred in statistically significant higher abundance in the grassland samples but in lower abundance in the forest samples. The results suggested the prevalence of a resilient core microbial community that did not suffer any change related to land use, soil type or edaphic conditions.

In addition, human and animal manure have been identified as a significant source of antibiotic resistance genes thereby serving as a disseminator of resistance to soil and waterways. Therefore, identifying methods to remediate human and animal waste is critical in developing strategies to improve food safety and minimize the dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In this study, we sought to determine whether withdrawing antibiotic growth promoters or using alternatives to antibiotics would reduce the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes or prevalence of pathogens in poultry litter. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) paired with high throughput sequencing was used to evaluate the bacterial community composition of litter from broiler chickens that were treated with streptogramin growth-promoting antibiotics, probiotics, or prebiotics. The prevalence of resistance genes and pathogens was determined from sequencing results or PCR screens of litter community DNA. Streptogramin antibiotic usage did not elicit statistically significant differences in Shannon diversity indices or correlation coefficients among the flocks. However, T-RFLP revealed that there were inter-farm differences in the litter composition that was independent of antibiotic usage. The litter from all farms, regardless of antibiotic usage, contained streptogramin resistance genes (vatA, vatB, and vatE), macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance genes (ermA and ermB), the tetracycline resistance gene tetM and class 1 integrons. There was inter-farm variability in the distribution of vatA and vatE with no statistically significant differences with regards to usage. Bacterial diversity was higher in litter when probiotics or prebiotics were administered to flocks but as the litter aged, diversity decreased. No statistically significant differences were detected in the abundance of class 1 integrons where 3%-5% of the community was estimated to harbor a copy. Abundance of pathogenic Clostridium species increased in aging litter despite the treatment while the abundance of tetracycline-resistant coliforms was unaffected by treatment.

We used paired-end Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, V3 region, to compare the bacterial communities in primary, once-logged, and twice-logged forest and land converted to oil palm plantations. Bacteria were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97% similarity level, and OTU richness and local-scale α-diversity showed no difference between the various forest types and oil palm plantations. Focusing on the turnover of bacteria across space, true β-diversity was higher in oil palm plantation soil than in forest soil, whereas community dissimilarity-based metrics of β-diversity were only marginally different between habitats, suggesting that at large scales, oil palm plantation soil could have higher overall γ-diversity than forest soil, driven by a slightly more heterogeneous community across space. Clearance of primary and logged forest for oil palm plantations did, however, significantly impact the composition of soil bacterial communities, reflecting in part the loss of some forest bacteria, whereas primary and logged forests did not differ in composition.

They only grew on cellulose (both filter paper and crystalline cellulose) and cellobiose and produced yellow pigment, without growing on other substrates including glucose. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, CS7 and CS8 are closely related (99% sequence identity) to Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405. However, they had significantly higher specific cellulase activities and ethanol/acetate ratios than Cl. thermocellum ATCC 27405.CONCLUSIONS: CS7 and CS8 are two new highly cellulolytic and ethanologenic Cl. thermocellum strains.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: First report of applying the cloning-RFLP-sequencing approach for purity confirmation of the isolates beside conventional methods.

Over a 13-month sampling period, RNA viruses (astroviruses and enteroviruses) were more frequently detected compared to DNA viruses (adenoviruses, particularly type 41 and BK polyomavirus). Overall, many more viruses were shed during the winter months (December-February) compared to the summer months. Exploration of the multiple types of enteric viruses particularly in winter months identified much more significant prevalence of key viral pathogens associated with sewage pollution of the water environment than previously realized and seasonal disinfection used in some parts of the world may lead to a seeding of ambient waters. Molecular characterization of pathogenic viruses in community wastewater will improve the understanding of the potential risk of waterborne disease transmission of viral pathogens."

Compared to solitary insects, social insects have evolved multi-level immunity that includes immune responses common to holometabolous insects, and social immunity, which is exclusive to social taxa. This suggests that social insects may be subject to high pathogen pressure, yet relatively little is known about the range of symbiotic and pathogenic microbial communities that associate with social insects. In this study we examined transcriptome data generated from the ant Formica exsecta for sequences identifying as microbes (or other organisms potentially of non-ant origin). Sequences showing homology to two viruses and several other potentially or obligate intracellular organisms, such as Wolbachia, Arsenophonus, Entomoplasmatales and Microsporidia, were present in the transcriptome data. These homologous sequence matches correspond to genera/species that have previously been associated with a variety of insects, including social insects. There were also sequences with identity to several other microbes such as common moulds and soil bacteria. We conclude that this sequence data provides a starting point for a deeper understanding of the biological interactions between a species of ant and the micro- and macrobiotic communities that it potentially encounters."

The soil commensal bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 has been proposed as a model system for molecular and genetic studies, whereas in a clinical environment, Acinetobacter spp. are of increasing importance due to their propensity to cause serious and intractable systemic infections. Clinically, a major factor in the success of Acinetobacter spp. as opportunistic pathogens can be attributed to their ability to rapidly evolve resistance to common antimicrobial compounds. Whole genome sequencing of clinical and environmental Acinetobacter spp. isolates has revealed the presence of numerous multidrug transporters within the core and accessory genomes, suggesting that efflux is an important host defense response in this genus. In this work, we used the drug-susceptible organism A. baylyi ADP1 as a model for studies into the evolution of efflux mediated resistance in genus Acinetobacter, due to the high level of conservation of efflux determinants across four diverse Acinetobacter strains, including clinical isolates. A single exposure of therapeutic concentrations of chloramphenicol to populations of A. baylyi ADP1 cells produced five individual colonies displaying multidrug resistance. The major facilitator superfamily pump craA was upregulated in one mutant strain, whereas the resistance nodulation division pump adeJ was upregulated in the remaining four. Within the adeJ upregulated population, two different levels of adeJ mRNA transcription were observed, suggesting at least three separate mutations were selected after single-step exposure to chloramphenicol. In the craA upregulated strain, a T to G substitution 12 nt upstream of the craA translation initiation codon was observed.

Although the majority of these sequences represent authentic gene copies, there is evidence of DNA artifacts in these databases as well. These include lab artifacts, such as PCR chimeras, and biological artifacts such as pseudogenes or other paralogous sequences. Sequences that fall in basal positions in phylogenetic trees and appear distant from known sequences are particularly suspect. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that a novel sequence type (NS1) found in two boreal forest soil clone libraries belongs to the fungal kingdom but does not fall unambiguously within any known phylum. We have evaluated this sequence type using an array of secondary-structure analyses. To our knowledge, such analyses have never been used on environmental ribosomal sequences. Ribosomal secondary structure was modeled for four rRNA loci (ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, 5' LSU). These models were analyzed for the presence of conserved domains, conserved nucleotide motifs, and compensatory base changes. Minimal free energy (MFE) foldings and GC contents of sequences representing the major fungal clades, as well as NS1, were also compared. NS1 displays secondary rRNA structures consistent with other fungi and many, but not all, conserved nucleotide motifs found across eukaryotes. However, our analyses show that many other authentic sequences from basal fungi lack more of these conserved motifs than does NS1. Together our findings suggest that NS1 represents an authentic gene copy. The methods described here can be used on any rRNA-coding sequence, not just environmental fungal sequences. As new-generation sequencing methods that yield shorter sequences become more widely implemented, methods that evaluate sequence authenticity should also be more widely implemented. For fungi, the adjacent 5.8S and ITS2 loci should be prioritized. This region is not only suited to distinguishing between closely related species, but it is also more informative in terms of expected secondary structure."

Mycorrhizae were identified using molecular methods following DNA extraction from field and pot culture samples. The extracted DNA was amplified using Glomeromycota specific primers, and identification of AMF was based on phylogenetic analysis of sequences from the large subunit-D2 rDNA region. The phylogenetic analyses revealed seven phylotypes, two within the Claroideoglomeraceae and five within the Glomeraceae. Four phylotypes clustered with known species including Claroideoglomus claroideum, Rhizophagus irregularis, Glomus microaggregatum, and Funneliformis mosseae. The other three phylotypes were similar to several published sequences not included in the phylogenetic analysis, but all of these were from uncultured and unnamed glomeromycetes. Pairwise distance analysis revealed some phylotypes with high genetic variation. The most diverse was the phylotype that included R. irregularis, which contained sequences showing pairwise differences up to 12 %. Most of the diversity in AMF sequences occurred within sites. The smaller genetic differentiation detected among sites was correlated with differences in soil texture. In addition, multiplication in pot cultures led to differentiation of AMF communities. Comparison of sequences obtained from the soil with those from A. tridentata roots revealed no significant differences between the AMF present in these samples.

Because the availability of many of these nutrients in the soil is compromised by several factors, such as soil pH, cation presence, and microbial activity, crop plants depend directly on nutrients applied as fertilizers to achieve high yields. However, the excessive use of fertilizers is a major environmental concern due to nutrient leaching that causes water eutrophication and promotes toxic algae blooms. This situation generates the urgent need for crop plants with increased nutrient use efficiency and better-designed fertilization schemes. The plant biology revolution triggered by the development of efficient gene transfer systems for plant cells together with the more recent development of next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing and other omics platforms have advanced considerably our understanding on the molecular basis of plant nutrition and how plants respond to nutritional stress. To date, genes encoding sensors, transcription factors, transporters, and metabolic enzymes have been identified as potential candidates to improve nutrient use efficiency. In addition, the study of other genetic resources, such as bacteria and fungi, allows the identification of alternative mechanisms of nutrient assimilation, which are potentially applicable in plants. Although significant progress in this respect has been achieved by conventional breeding, in this review we focus on the biotechnological approaches reported to date aimed at boosting the use of the three most limiting nutrients in the majority of arable lands: nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron."

The assessment of such species' diet can be conducted using molecular methods that target prey DNA remaining in predators' guts and faeces. These techniques do not require high taxonomic expertise, are applicable to soft-bodied prey and allow for identification at the species level. However, for generalist predators, the presence of mixed prey DNA in guts and faeces can be a major impediment as it requires development of specific primers for each potential prey species for standard (Sanger) sequencing. Therefore, next generation sequencing methods have recently been applied to such situations. In this study, we used 454-pyrosequencing to analyse the diet of Powelliphantaaugusta, a carnivorous landsnail endemic to New Zealand and critically endangered after most of its natural habitat has been lost to opencast mining. This species was suspected to feed mainly on earthworms. Although earthworm tissue was not detectable in snail faeces, earthworm DNA was still present in sufficient quantity to conduct molecular analyses. Based on faecal samples collected from 46 landsnails, our analysis provided a complete map of the earthworm-based diet of P. augusta. Predated species appear to be earthworms that live in the leaf litter or earthworms that come to the soil surface at night to feed on the leaf litter. This indicates that P. augusta may not be selective and probably predates any earthworm encountered in the leaf litter. These findings are crucial for selecting future translocation areas for this highly endangered species.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of mRNA polyadenylation owing to the advent of the next generation DNA sequencing technologies. The high-throughput sequencing capabilities have resulted in the direct experimental determinations of large numbers of polyadenylation sites, analysis of which has revealed a vast potential for the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. These collections have been generated using specialized sequencing methods that are targeted to the junction of 3'-UTR and the poly(A) tail. Here we present three variations of such a protocol that has been used for the analysis of alternative polyadenylation in plants. While all these methods use oligo-dT as an anchor to the 3'-end, they differ in the means of generating an anchor for the 5'-end in order to produce PCR products suitable for effective Illumina sequencing; the use of different methods to append 5' adapters expands the possible utility of these approaches. These methods are versatile, reproducible, and may be used for gene expression analysis as well as global determinations of poly(A) site choice."

Isolated strains produced a diverse amount of auxin in BG11 media supplemented with different concentrations of L-tryptophan. The amount of auxin detected with colorimetric methods was higher as compared to GC-MS analysis. Auxin production by cyanobacterial strains in BG 11 medium supplemented with 250 µg ml(-1) L-tryptophan ranged from 0.20 to 1.63 µg ml(-1) IAA as revealed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis. In a hydroponic growth system, the vegetative growth of wheat was stimulated appreciably by inoculation with cyanobacterial strains. The endogenous auxin content of wheat was significantly correlated with the exogenous auxin production of the cyanobacterial strains. It was observed that cyanobacterial strains produced more endogenous and exogenous auxin in the presence of a plant, showing that plants might be releasing some signals responsible for higher auxin production by cyanobacterial cultures. It was concluded that the auxin producing potential of cyanobacterial strains can be exploited for the promotion of wheat growth."

New methods need to be developed for isolating previously unknown actinomycetes from soil. The objective of this experiment was to study microwave irradiation of soil as a means for isolating previously unknown actinomycetes. Soil samples were collected at ten elevations between 800 and 3670 m on Taibai Mountain, Shaanxi Province, China. Moistened soil samples were irradiated at 120 W heating power (2450 MHz) for 3 min using a household microwave oven. Irradiation increased total actinomycete, streptomycete, and antagonistic actinomycete counts on three types of culture media. Irradiation also increased the number of culturable actinomycete isolates. Some actinomycete isolates were culturable only after the soil was irradiated, whereas other isolates could not be cultured after irradiation. Irradiation of soil from elevations &gt; 3000 m increased actinomycete counts significantly but had little effect on the number of culturable actinomycete isolates. In contrast, irradiation of samples from elevations &lt; 3000 m had relatively little effect on actinomycete counts, but significantly increased the number of culturable actinomycete isolates. We used 16S rDNA sequence analysis to identify 14 actinomycete isolates that were only culturable after irradiation. Microwave irradiation of soil was helpful for isolating Streptomyces spp., Nocardia spp., Streptosporangium spp., and Lentzea spp. Slightly more than 90% of the identified actinomycete species were biologically active. In conclusion, microwave irradiation is a useful tool for isolating biologically active actinomycetes from soil."

For this reason, the first parts of this study included the quantification of microbial generic groups and of the main functional groups of C and N cycle during composting of agro-industrial refuse. After a generalized decrease observed during the initial phases, a new bacterial growth was observed in the final phase of the process. Ammonifiers and (N2)-fixing aerobic groups predominated outside of the piles whereas, nitrate-reducing group increased inside the piles during the first 23days of composting. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), showed an opposite trend of growth since ammonia oxidation decreased with the increase of the nitrite oxidation activity. Pectinolytics, amylolytics and aerobic cellulolytic were present in greater quantities and showed an upward trend in both the internal and external part of the heaps.

However, a comprehensive understanding of their relative importance remains elusive, mainly because traditional methods, such as soil incubation and environmental surveys, have a limited ability to differentiate between the combined effects of climate and soil. Here, we performed a large-scale reciprocal soil transplantation experiment, whereby microbial communities associated with straw decomposition were examined in three initially identical soils placed in parallel in three climate regions of China (red soil, Chao soil, and black soil, located in midsubtropical, warm-temperate, and cold-temperate zones). Maize straws buried in mesh bags were sampled at 0.5, 1, and 2 years after the burial and subjected to chemical, physical, and microbiological analyses, e.g., phospholipid fatty acid analysis for microbial abundance, community-level physiological profiling, and 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, respectively, for functional and phylogenic diversity. Results of aggregated boosted tree analysis show that location rather soil is the primary determining factor for the rate of straw decomposition and structures of the associated microbial communities. Principal component analysis indicates that the straw communities are primarily grouped by location at any of the three time points. In contrast, microbial communities in bulk soil remained closely related to one another for each soil. Together, our data suggest that climate (specifically, geographic location) has stronger effects than soil on straw decomposition; moreover, the successive process of microbial communities in soils is slower than those in straw residues in response to climate changes."

To obtain a large spectrum of isolates, liquid subcultivation was combined with a matrix-assisted enrichment (Teflon membranes, litter). Elevated cell numbers of alkane degraders were detected by most probable number counting indicating enhanced alkane degradation potential in soil in response to litter treatment. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 395 isolates revealed forty different phylogenetic groups [operational taxonomic units (OTUs)] and spatio-temporal shifts in community composition. Ten OTUs comprised so far unknown alkane degraders, and five OTUs represented putative new bacterial genera. The combination of enrichment methods yielded a higher diversity of isolates than liquid subcultivation alone. Comparison of 16S rRNA gene T-RFLP profiles indicated that many alkane degraders present in the enrichments were not detectable in the DNA extracts from soil microcosms. These possibly rare specialists might represent a seed bank for the alkane degradation capacity in uncontaminated soil. This relevant ecosystem function can be fostered by the formation of the soil-litter interface."

The obtained data showed the following: firstly, the isolates ACTA1383 and ACTA1557 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity, and therefore, they were selected for in vivo experiments using bean seeds as target; secondly, in solid and liquid culture experiments under optimum antagonistic conditions, the medium extracts from the isolates OL80, ACTA1523, ACTA1551 and ACTA1522 suppressed the growth of the fungal mycelium, while extracts from ACTA 1383 and ACTA1557 did not show any activity.CONCLUSIONS: These results corresponded important indications for the utility of two Greek indigenous Streptomyces isolates (ACTA1557 and ACTA1383) for the protection of the bean crops from R. solani damping-off symptoms, while four of them (isolates OL80, ACTA1523, ACTA1551 and ACTA1522) seem to be promising producers of antifungal metabolites.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first study on the biocontrol of R. solani using multiactive Streptomyces isolates originated from ecophysiologically special Greek habitats.

Using an M13 RAPD fingerprinting technique, 19 distinct RAPD profiles were identified. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA and the housekeeping genes glnII, recA and atpD showed a high diversity of native Bradyrhizobium strains that were able to establish symbiosis with Lmj. All the strains grouped in a clade unrelated to strains of the B. canariense and B. japonicum lineages that establish symbioses with lupines in acid soils of the Mediterranean area. The phylogenetic tree based on concatenated glnII, recA and atpD gene sequences grouped the Lmj isolates in six different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 93% similarity level. These OTUs were not associated to any specific geographical location, and their observed divergence predicted the existence of different Bradyrhizobium genomic species. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of symbiotic genes based on nodC and nodA gene sequences, defined only two distinct clusters among the Lmj strains. These two Lmj nod gene types were largely distinct from nod genes of bradyrhizobia nodulating other Old World lupine species.

Among the Firmicutes, at least 17 species from the single genus Bacillus were the most abundant inhabitants of the landfill.

Culture-independent analysis of two 16S rRNA gene libraries also revealed that the phylum Firmicutes was the predominant group in this community. The diversity of Archaea was found to be limited mainly to members of two orders: Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales of the phylum Euryarchaeota. When these results were compared to those reported earlier on similar studies, it was found that irrespective of differences in composition of municipal solid waste (especially compostable organic matter and paper) and climate, the members of bacterial and archaeal communities in landfills of many countries remained broadly similar."

Antimicrobial susceptibility test was done by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Colonies were identified by colony morphology and biochemical characterization and also compared with MTCC 121 strain. Further identification was done by 16S rRNA sequencing. Inhibitory activities of partially purified bacteriocin on all the DFU isolates were done by agar well diffusion method. The strain was identified to produce bacteriocin by stab overlay assay. Bacteriocin was extracted by organic solvent extraction using chloroform, further purified by HPLC and physical, and chemical characterization was performed.RESULTS: The four isolates showed high level of resistance to amoxyclav and sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. HPLC purification revealed that the extracts are bacteriocin. The phylogenetic tree analysis results showed that the isolate was 99% related to B. subtilis BSF01. The results reveled activity to all the four isolates and high level of activity was seen in case of Klebsiella sp.CONCLUSIONS: Partially purified bacteriocin was found to have antimicrobial activity against the four diabetic foot ulcer bacterial pathogens, which can thus be applied as a better drug molecule on further studies. The strain B. subtilis are found to be safe for use and these antimicrobial peptides can be used as an antimicrobial in humans to treat DFU bacterial pathogens."

In this study, different volumes of Al₂(SO₄)₃ were added to rhizosphere soil samples to precipitate humic substances, which interfere with most procedures of RNA and DNA analyses. After humic substances were precipitated, cells of soil microorganisms were broken by vortexing with glass beads, and then DNA and RNA were recovered using Tris-HCl buffer with LiCl, SDS, and EDTA. The crude extract was precipitated and dissolved in RNAse-free water, and then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. We determined the optimum volume of Al₂(SO₄)₃ for treating rhizosphere soil of rice, tobacco, sugarcane, Rehmannia glutinosa, and Pseudostellaria heterophylla. The crude nucleic acids extract from rice soil was treated with DNase I and then RNA was purified using a gel filtration column. The purified RNA was reverse-transcribed into single-strand cDNA and then ligated with an adaptor at each end before amplifying ds cDNA. The ds cDNA was sub-cloned for subsequent gene sequence analysis. We conducted qPCR to amplify 16S ribosomal DNA and observed highly efficient amplification. These results show that the extraction method can be optimized to isolate and obtain high-quality nucleic acids from microbes in different rhizosphere soils, suitable for genomic and post-genomic analyses."

The diversity and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria were also analyzed based on archaeal and bacterial ammonia monooxygenase subunit A encoding (amoA) and anammox bacterial 16S rRNA genes, respectively. DGGE profiles of archaeal and bacterial amoA and anammox bacterial 16S rRNA genes showed a similar pattern among all five repetitively extracted DNA fractions from both MP and RP, except the anammox bacteria in RP, indicating a more diverse anammox community retrieved in the second to the fifth fractions than the first one. Both soil and marine group AOA were detected while soil and coastal group AOB and Scalindua-anammox bacteria were dominant in MP. Soil group AOA and marine group AOB were dominant in RP, while both Scalindua and Kuenenia species were detected in RP. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the abundance of archaeal and bacterial amoA and anammox bacterial 16S rRNA genes was significantly correlated with the DNA concentrations of the five DNA fractions from MP, but not from RP (except the archaeal amoA gene).

We detected no significant differences in soil fungal diversity and community structure associated with different plant cultivars. However, DNA-based analyses yielded lower fungal OTU richness as compared to RNA-based analyses. Clear differences in fungal community structure were also observed in relation to sampling time and the nucleic acid pool targeted (DNA versus RNA). The most abundant soil fungi, as recovered by DNA-based methods, did not necessary represent the most &quot;active&quot; fungi (as recovered via RNA). Interestingly, RNA-derived community compositions at t1 were highly similar to DNA-derived communities at t2, based on presence/absence measures of OTUs. We recovered large proportions of fungal sequences belonging to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Basidiomycota, especially at the RNA level, suggesting that these important and potentially beneficial fungi are not affected by the plant cultivars nor by GM traits (Bt toxin production). Our results suggest that even though DNA- and RNA-derived soil fungal communities can be very different at a given time, RNA composition may have a predictive power of fungal community development through time."

Here, we present a strategy to select for organisms that may have a propensity to result in new antistaphylococcal agents by using S. aureus as a bait organism, and selecting organisms that have a natural lytic activity towards it. We have isolated over 80 environmental isolates and typed these organisms using 16S rDNA sequence comparison and deployed bioinformatics to assess the secondary metabolic potential of the isolated antistaphylococcal bacteria using genomic sequences. Bioinformatic analysis highlights the enriched and unique suite of potential antibiotic polyketides and nonribosomal peptides and lantibiotic gene clusters from these organisms.

Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA andl6S rRNA gene at the whole microbial community levels were performed over the course of aerobic methane oxidation in soil microcosms. 13C-DNA and 13C-RNA were obtained through ultracentrifugation of the total soil DNA and RNA extracts, respectively. Clone library of pmoA genes in 13C-DNA and 16S rRNA genes in 13C-RNA were constructed.RESULTS: Pyrosequencing of the total microbial communities revealed significant increase in the relative abundance of aerobic methanotrophs in soil microcosms upon the completion of aerobic methane consumption. The proportional increase of aerobic methanotrophs was significantly higher at RNA than DNA levels. Type I and II aerobic methanotrophs significantly increased in Gushi soil, while the significant increase of type II aerobic methanotrophs was observed in Taoyuan soil. In the meantime, type I aerobic methanotrophs appeared to be stimulated exclusively in Leizhou soil. Sequencing analysis of the 13C-labeled pmoA genes and 16S rRNA further demonstrate that phylogenetically distinct methanotrophs dominated aerobic methane oxidation activity in paddy soils of Gushi (Type I and II), Taoyuan (Type II) and Leizhou (Type I).CONCLUSION: High-throughput pyrosequencing at the whole community level of 16S rRNA genes provides an almost unbiased profiling stragety for measuring characteristic changes in relative proportions of aerobic methanotrophs responsible for aerobic methane oxidation activity in red paddy soils, and higher sensitivity was observed at RNA than DNA levels.

In evaluating the OTN approach we reanalyzed a dataset consisting of triplicate GS FLX titanium pyrosequencing runs for each of two experimental soil samples, in addition to analyses of the Greengenes core dataset. The conclusion from these comparisons was that the OTN approach was superior to traditional alignments both with respect to speed and accuracy.

Efficient methods are required to isolate and degrade them. Microorganisms associated with rhizosphere soil are considered efficient agents to remediate hydrocarbon contamination. In this study, we obtained a stabilized bacterial consortium from the rhizosphere soil of Cyperus sp. grown in a petroleum-contaminated field in Southern Mexico. This consortium was able to completely degrade BTX in 14 days. Bacteria isolated from the consortium were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis as Ralstonia insidiosa, Cellulomonas hominis, Burkholderia kururiensis, and Serratia marcescens. The BTX-degradation capacity of the bacterial consortium was confirmed by the detection of genes pheA, todC1, and xylM, which encoded phenol hydroxylase, toluene 1,2-dioxygenase, and xylene monooxygenase, respectively.

Sequence independent techniques like single strand confirmation polymorphism (SSCP) was attempted in the present study to resolve AOB using ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (hao) gene fragments, unique to AOB. Variation in hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) enzyme zymogram of isolates observed in the study was also explored as an additional sequence independent method to substantiate the observations. Nitrosomonas europaea (standard strain) and 12 isolates, obtained by enriching environmental samples, were differentiated into six and four groups by SSCP analyses of amoA and hao gene fragments, respectively, whereas they could be resolved into six distinct groups through activity staining of HAO enzyme. amoA gene fragment was therefore found to be better than hao gene fragment in resolving the studied AOB based on richness and evenness with Simpson's index of diversity - 0.85. However, the ensembled use of these molecular methods (SSCP of amoA and hao gene fragments) and HAO enzyme zymogram in fingerprinting AOB provide better resolution and evenness, contributing significantly in AOB diversity studies.

The most recent technology that can result in a highly efficient means of selection and still be done at a low cost is through plant selection directed by simple sequence repeats (SSRs or microsatellites). The molecular markers are used to select for certain desirable plant traits without relying on ambiguous phenotypic data. The best way to detect these is the use of gel electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis is a common technique in laboratory settings which is used to separate deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) by size. Loading DNA and RNA onto gels allows for visualization of the size of fragments through the separation of DNA and RNA fragments. This is achieved through the use of the charge in the particles. As the fragments separate, they form into distinct bands at set sizes. We describe the ability to visualize SSRs on slab gels of agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."

In this study, we optimized the conditions of a wet-heat method for the selective isolation of Micromonospora from estuarine sediments. Sediments were collected from the Arakawa River (estuarine sediments) and Tokyo Bay (marine sediments). Sediment samples were wet-heated at 45, 55, or 65 °C for 30 min and then incubated at 27 °C for 3 weeks. After incubation, most of the actinomycete colonies were macroscopically determined to be of the genus Micromonospora or Streptomyces. In contrast to the treatment at 55 °C, treatment at 65 °C drastically reduced the number of Streptomyces colonies but increased the number of Micromonospora colonies from the estuarine sediments. This procedure allowed us to grow cultures that were composed of more than 90 % Micromonospora. In addition, treatment at 65 °C did not affect the diversity of Micromonospora species compared with treatment at 55 °C.

Knowledge about the molecular events important for fungal adaptation and survival in the host remains limited. The development of high-throughput analytic tools such as RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has potential to provide novel insight on fungal pathogenesis especially if applied in vivo during infection. However, in vivo transcriptional profiling is hindered by the low abundance of fungal cells relative to mammalian tissue and difficulty in isolating fungal cells from the tissues they infect. For the purpose of obtaining B. dermatitidis RNA for in vivo transcriptional analysis by RNA-Seq, we developed a simple technique for isolating yeast from murine lung tissue. Using a two-step approach of filtration and centrifugation following lysis of murine lung cells, 91% of yeast cells causing infection were isolated from lung tissue. B. dermatitidis recovered from the lung yielded high-quality RNA with minimal murine contamination and was suitable for RNA-Seq. Approximately 87% of the sequencing reads obtained from the recovered yeast aligned with the B. dermatitidis genome. This was similar to 93% alignment for yeast grown in vitro. The use of near-freezing temperature along with short ex vivo time minimized transcriptional changes that would have otherwise occurred with higher temperature or longer processing time.

The biofilter was operated for a period of 33 days under laboratory conditions, and several parameters were monitored. The results showed a significant improvement in the quality of treated effluent.

This could lead to aberrant gene expression quantification. This is why a rigorous treatment of bacterial RNA with DNase I is usually required to remove any traces of carryover gDNA. As bacterial RNA is known to be extremely labile, any procedure that affects RNA yield, such as DNase I treatment, can be logically assumed to also influence detection and quantification of gene transcripts, leading to either an underestimation or no detection at all. To address such problems, we have developed a novel and versatile TaqMan RT-qPCR compliant anchor sequence (MYT4) for quantifying bacterial gene transcripts without the need for DNase I treatment.RESULTS: A non-genomic anchor sequence, henceforth referred to as MYT4 was designed using a synthetic DNA sequence called myIC, previously shown to share no significant homology to any known accession in the GenBank database. The sequence characteristic of MYT4 was kept within the design parameters required for the TaqMan RT-qPCR platform. The specificity and robustness of the novel MYT4 sequence was validated on RNA extracted from the bacterium Pseudomonas sp. LBUM300, grown under liquid culture and spiked soil conditions. Two transcripts, namely hcnC and phlD, were quantified from these two experimental systems. Using the MYT4 anchor, no RT-qPCR signal was detected from non-DNase I treated RNA, while strong signals were obtained using conventional reverse primers and RT-qPCR, indicating the presence of carryover gDNA in the RNA, extracted from either liquid culture or soil. Serial treatment of the RNA samples with DNase I (required to achieve absolute gDNA elimination) resulted in 50-70% loss of RNA which, when submitted to conventional RT-qPCR, significantly altered the transcript numbers detected when compared to the MYT4-based approach.CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the versatile approach described in this study, which can be &quot;retrofitted&quot; to any existing TaqMan RT-qPCR system, should contribute to reducing the time and lowering the costs required to perform adequate bacterial RNA purification for downstream quantification of gene transcripts."

In contrast, we have only just begun exploring similar questions for soil microbial communities despite soil microbes being the dominant engines of biogeochemical cycles and a major pool of living biomass in terrestrial ecosystems. We used metagenomic sequencing to compare the composition and functional attributes of 16 soil microbial communities collected from cold deserts, hot deserts, forests, grasslands, and tundra. Those communities found in plant-free cold desert soils typically had the lowest levels of functional diversity (diversity of protein-coding gene categories) and the lowest levels of phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity. Across all soils, functional beta diversity was strongly correlated with taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity; the desert microbial communities were clearly distinct from the nondesert communities regardless of the metric used. The desert communities had higher relative abundances of genes associated with osmoregulation and dormancy, but lower relative abundances of genes associated with nutrient cycling and the catabolism of plant-derived organic compounds. Antibiotic resistance genes were consistently threefold less abundant in the desert soils than in the nondesert soils, suggesting that abiotic conditions, not competitive interactions, are more important in shaping the desert microbial communities. As the most comprehensive survey of soil taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity to date, this study demonstrates that metagenomic approaches can be used to build a predictive understanding of how microbial diversity and function vary across terrestrial biomes."

The tomato immune receptor Ve1 governs resistance to race 1 strains of the soil-borne vascular wilt fungi Verticillium dahliae and Verticillium albo-atrum, but the corresponding Verticillium effector remained unknown thus far. By high-throughput population genome sequencing, a single 50-Kb sequence stretch was identified that only occurs in race 1 strains, and subsequent transcriptome sequencing of Verticillium-infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants revealed only a single highly expressed ORF in this region, designated Ave1 (for Avirulence on Ve1 tomato). Functional analyses confirmed that Ave1 activates Ve1-mediated resistance and demonstrated that Ave1 markedly contributes to fungal virulence, not only on tomato but also on Arabidopsis. Interestingly, Ave1 is homologous to a widespread family of plant natriuretic peptides. Besides plants, homologous proteins were only found in the bacterial plant pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis and the plant pathogenic fungi Colletotrichum higginsianum, Cercospora beticola, and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. The distribution of Ave1 homologs, coincident with the presence of Ave1 within a flexible genomic region, strongly suggests that Verticillium acquired Ave1 from plants through horizontal gene transfer. Remarkably, by transient expression we show that also the Ave1 homologs from F. oxysporum and C. beticola can activate Ve1-mediated resistance. In line with this observation, Ve1 was found to mediate resistance toward F. oxysporum in tomato, showing that this immune receptor is involved in resistance against multiple fungal pathogens."

We compared the 16S rRNA marker with the single-copy, protein-coding rpoB marker by amplifying and sequencing both from a single soil sample. Because the higher genetic resolution of the rpoB gene prohibits its use as a universal marker, we employed consensus-degenerate primers targeting the Proteobacteria.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Pyrosequencing can be problematic because of the poor resolution of homopolymer runs. As these erroneous runs disrupt the reading frame of protein-coding sequences, removal of sequences containing nonsense mutations was found to be a valuable filter in addition to flowgram-based denoising. Although both markers gave similar estimates of total diversity, the rpoB marker revealed more species, requiring an order of magnitude fewer reads to obtain 90% of the true diversity. The application of population genetic methods was demonstrated on a particularly abundant sequence cluster.SIGNIFICANCE: The rpoB marker can be a complement to the 16S rRNA marker for high throughput microbial diversity studies focusing on specific taxonomic groups.

Using an in silico approach, the performance of each V region was compared with the complete 16S rRNA gene stretch. We assessed related properties of the soil derived bacterial sequence collection of the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) database and concomitantly performed simulations based on published datasets. Results indicate that overall the most prominent V region for soil bacterial diversity studies was V3, even though it was outperformed in some of the tests. Despite its high performance during most tests, V4 was less conserved along flanking sites, thus reducing its ability for bacterial diversity coverage.

Although, the highly conserved flanking sequence regions of V6 provide the ability to amplify partial 16S rRNA gene sequences from very diverse owners, it was demonstrated that V6 was the least informative compared to the rest examined V regions.

However, ionic liquids are often toxic to the microorganisms used subsequently for biomass saccharification and fermentation. We previously isolated Enterobacter lignolyticus strain SCF1, a lignocellulolytic bacterium from tropical rain forest soil, and report here that it can grow in the presence of 0.5 M 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, a commonly used ionic liquid. We investigated molecular mechanisms of SCF1 ionic liquid tolerance using a combination of phenotypic growth assays, phospholipid fatty acid analysis, and RNA sequencing technologies. Potential modes of resistance to 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride include an increase in cyclopropane fatty acids in the cell membrane, scavenging of compatible solutes, up-regulation of osmoprotectant transporters and drug efflux pumps, and down-regulation of membrane porins. These findings represent an important first step in understanding mechanisms of ionic liquid resistance in bacteria and provide a basis for engineering microbial tolerance."

On the basis of thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, chlorohydroquinone (CHQ) and hydroquinone (HQ) were identified as major metabolites of the degradation pathway of 2C4NP.

Here we report the first direct experimental evidence that soil microbial communities undergo rapid and lasting changes in response to contemporary environmental conditions. Mummified seals, curious natural artifacts found scattered throughout Dry Valleys, alter their underlying soil environment by stabilizing temperatures, elevating relative humidity and reducing ultraviolet exposure. In a unique, multi-year mummified seal transplantation experiment, we found that endemic Dry Valley microbial communities responded to these changes within 3 years, resulting in a sevenfold increase in CO(2) flux and a significant reduction in biodiversity. These findings challenge prevailing ideas about Antarctic Dry Valley ecosystems and indicate that current and future environmental conditions may strongly influence the ecology of the dominant biota in the Dry Valleys."

However, their individual functions and interactions with higher taxa in soil are still unknown. Here, potential effects of land use, soil properties, plant diversity, and soil nanofauna on acidobacterial community composition were studied by cultivation-independent methods in grassland and forest soils from three different regions in Germany. The analysis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries representing all studied soils revealed that grassland soils were dominated by subgroup Gp6 and forest soils by subgroup Gp1 Acidobacteria. The analysis of a large number of sites (n = 57) by 16S rRNA gene fingerprinting methods (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism [T-RFLP] and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [DGGE]) showed that Acidobacteria diversities differed between grassland and forest soils but also among the three different regions. Edaphic properties, such as pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, phosphorus, nitrate, ammonium, soil moisture, soil temperature, and soil respiration, had an impact on community composition as assessed by fingerprinting. However, interrelations with environmental parameters among subgroup terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) differed significantly, e.g., different Gp1 T-RFs correlated positively or negatively with nitrogen content.

PCR-amplified soil DNA for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene targeting the V1-V3 region was pyrosequenced using the 454 Roche machine. We found that land use in itself has a weak but significant effect on the bacterial community composition. However, bacterial community composition and diversity was strongly correlated with soil properties, especially soil pH, total carbon, and C/N ratio. Soil pH was the best predictor of bacterial community composition and diversity across the various land use types, with the highest diversity close to neutral pH values. In addition, variation in phylogenetic structure of dominant lineages (Alphaproteobacteria, Beta/Gammaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria) is also significantly correlated with soil pH. Together, these results confirm the importance of soil pH in structuring soil bacterial communities in Southeast Asia. Our results also suggest that unlike the general diversity pattern found for larger organisms, primary tropical forest is no richer in operational taxonomic units of soil bacteria than logged forest, and agricultural land (crop and pasture) is actually richer than primary forest, partly due to selection of more fertile soils that have higher pH for agriculture and the effects of soil liming raising pH."

However, defining the network structure in a microbial community is very challenging due to their extremely high diversity and as-yet uncultivated status. Although recent advance of metagenomic technologies, such as high throughout sequencing and functional gene arrays, provide revolutionary tools for analyzing microbial community structure, it is still difficult to examine network interactions in a microbial community based on high-throughput metagenomics data.RESULTS: Here, we describe a novel mathematical and bioinformatics framework to construct ecological association networks named molecular ecological networks (MENs) through Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based methods. Compared to other network construction methods, this approach is remarkable in that the network is automatically defined and robust to noise, thus providing excellent solutions to several common issues associated with high-throughput metagenomics data. We applied it to determine the network structure of microbial communities subjected to long-term experimental warming based on pyrosequencing data of 16 S rRNA genes. We showed that the constructed MENs under both warming and unwarming conditions exhibited topological features of scale free, small world and modularity, which were consistent with previously described molecular ecological networks. Eigengene analysis indicated that the eigengenes represented the module profiles relatively well. In consistency with many other studies, several major environmental traits including temperature and soil pH were found to be important in determining network interactions in the microbial communities examined. To facilitate its application by the scientific community, all these methods and statistical tools have been integrated into a comprehensive Molecular Ecological Network Analysis Pipeline (MENAP), which is open-accessible now (http://ieg2.ou.edu/MENA).CONCLUSIONS: The RMT-based molecular ecological network analysis provides powerful tools to elucidate network interactions in microbial communities and their responses to environmental changes, which are fundamentally important for research in microbial ecology and environmental microbiology."

To date, cultivation experiments are commonly used to gain insight into the microbial diversity. Nowadays, molecular techniques for the identification of microorganisms provide efficient methods that can be applied in this field. The efficiency of DNA extraction is decisive in order to perform a reliable and reproducible quantification of the microorganisms by qPCR or to characterize the structure of the microbial community. In this study we tested thirteen DNA extraction methods and evaluated their efficiency for identifying (1) the quantity of DNA, (2) the quality and purity of DNA and (3) the ability of the DNA to be amplified in a PCR reaction using three universal primer sets for the ITS region of fungi as well as one primer pair targeting the 16S rRNA of bacteria with three typical building materials - common plaster, red brick and gypsum cardboard. DNA concentration measurements showed strong variations among the tested methods and materials. Measurement of the DNA yield showed up to three orders of magnitude variation from the same samples, whereas A260/A280 ratios often prognosticated biases in the PCR amplifications. Visualization of the crude DNA extracts and the comparison of DGGE fingerprints showed additional drawbacks of some methods.

In this study, we used culture dependent and independent methods to assess the community structure and diversity of chemolithoautotrophs in agricultural and coastal barren saline soils (low and high salinity). We studied the composition and distribution of chemolithoautotrophs by means of functional marker gene cbbL encoding large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and a phylogenetic marker 16S rRNA gene. The cbbL form IA and IC genes associated with carbon fixation were analyzed to gain insight into metabolic potential of chemolithoautotrophs in three soil types of coastal ecosystems which had a very different salt load and sulphur content.RESULTS: In cbbL libraries, the cbbL form IA was retrieved only from high saline soil whereas form IC was found in all three soil types. The form IC cbbL was also amplified from bacterial isolates obtained from all soil types. A number of novel monophyletic lineages affiliated with form IA and IC phylogenetic trees were found. These were distantly related to the known cbbL sequences from agroecosystem, volcanic ashes and marine environments. In 16S rRNA clone libraries, the agricultural soil was dominated by chemolithoautotrophs (Betaproteobacteria) whereas photoautotrophic Chloroflexi and sulphide oxidizers dominated saline ecosystems. Environmental specificity was apparently visible at both higher taxonomic levels (phylum) and lower taxonomic levels (genus and species). The differentiation in community structure and diversity in three soil ecosystems was supported by LIBSHUFF (P = 0.001) and UniFrac.CONCLUSION: This study may provide fundamentally new insights into the role of chemolithoautotrophic and photoautotrophic bacterial diversity in biochemical carbon cycling in barren saline soils. The bacterial communities varied greatly among the three sites, probably because of differences in salinity, carbon and sulphur contents. The cbbL form IA-containing sulphide-oxidizing chemolithotrophs were found only in high saline soil clone library, thus giving the indication of sulphide availability in this soil ecosystem. This is the first comparative study of the community structure and diversity of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria in coastal agricultural and saline barren soils using functional (cbbL) and phylogenetic (16S rDNA) marker genes."

We studied microbial dynamics in the roots of cucumber seedlings following transplantation into WR-amended or nonamended soil, as influenced by inoculation with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-cucumerinum. Disease symptoms initiated in nonamended soil 6 days after inoculation, compared with 14 days in WR-amended soil. Root infection by F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-cucumerinum was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Target numbers were similar 3 days after inoculation for both WR-amended and nonamended soils, and were significantly lower (66%) 6 days after inoculation and transplanting into the suppressive (WR-amended) soil. This decrease in root colonization was correlated with a reduction in disease (60%) 21 days after inoculation and transplanting into the suppressive soil. Fungal community composition on cucumber roots was assessed using mass sequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer gene fragments. Sequences related to F. oxysporum, Fusarium sp. 14005, Chaetomium sp. 15003, and an unclassified Ascomycota composed 96% of the total fungal sequences in all samples. The relative abundances of these major groups were highly affected by root inoculation with F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-cucumerinum, with a 10-fold increase in F. oxysporum sequences, but were not affected by the WR amendment. Quantitative analysis and mass-sequencing methods indicated a qualitative shift in the root's bacterial community composition in suppressive soil, rather than a change in bacterial numbers. A sharp reduction in the size and root dominance of the Massilia population in suppressive soil was accompanied by a significant increase in the relative abundance of specific populations; namely, Rhizobium, Bacillus, Paenibacillus, and Streptomyces spp. Composition of the Streptomyces community shifted significantly, as determined by PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, resulting in an increase in the dominance of a specific population in suppressive soils after only 3 days. This shift was related mainly to the increase in Streptomyces humidus, a group previously described as antagonistic to phytopathogenic fungi. Thus, suitable soil amendment resulted in a shift in the root's bacterial communities, and infection by a virulent pathogen was contained by the root microbiome, leading to a reduced disease rate."

When species richness estimates were compared for the tested samples, the cutoff values of Q27(15%), Q30(10%), and Q32(15%) for V1V2, V4, and V6, respectively, estimated similar values as obtained with clone libraries and Sanger sequencing.

Our analyses showed combined genome sizes of about log 11 nucleotides for each of the soil micro-ecosystems, as estimated from qPCR determined copy numbers of random DNA fragments. This corresponds to more than 20000 unique bacterial genomes in each sample. There seemed, however, to be a bacterial subpopulation in the earthworm soil, not being present in the nonearthworm soil. To describe the structure of the metagenomes, both total DNA and amplified 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries were generated with 454-sequencing.

A neutrality test indicated that rare species have a competitive advantage over abundant species in both micro-ecosystems providing a potential explanation for the large metagenome sizes.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that the soil metagenome is very large and that the large size is probably a consequence of top-down selection of the dominant bacterial species.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Estimates of metagenome size from low coverage NGS data will be important for guiding future NGS set-ups."

Approaches based on sequence-similarity scores must deal with the confounding effects that inheritance and functional pressures exert on the relation between scores and phylogenetic distance, while approaches based on sequence alignment and tree-building are typically limited to a small fraction of gene families. We describe an approach based on finding one or more exact matches between a read and a precomputed set of peptide 10-mers.RESULTS: At even the largest phylogenetic distances, thousands of 10-mer peptide exact matches can be found between pairs of bacterial genomes. Genes that share one or more peptide 10-mers typically have high reciprocal BLAST scores. Among a set of 403 representative bacterial genomes, some 20 million 10-mer peptides were found to be shared. We assign each of these peptides as a signature of a particular node in a phylogenetic reference tree based on the RNA polymerase genes. We classify the phylogeny of a genomic fragment (e.g., read) at the most specific node on the reference tree that is consistent with the phylogeny of observed signature peptides it contains. Using both synthetic data from four newly-sequenced soil-bacterium genomes and ten real soil metagenomics data sets, we demonstrate a sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of the MEGAN metagenomics analysis package using BLASTX against the NR database. Phylogenetic and functional similarity metrics applied to real metagenomics data indicates a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 400 for distinguishing among environments. Our method assigns ~6.6 Gbp/hr on a single CPU, compared with 25 kbp/hr for methods based on BLASTX against the NR database.CONCLUSIONS: Classification by exact matching against a precomputed list of signature peptides provides comparable results to existing techniques for reads longer than about 300 bp and does not degrade severely with shorter reads. Orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, the approach is suitable now for inclusion in analysis pipelines and appears to be extensible in several different directions."

A total of 33,684 Acidobacteria 16S rRNA gene sequences were used for assay design. Following 1 week of computation on a 376-core cluster, 83 assays were obtained. We validated the specificity of the top three assays, collectively predicted to detect 42% of the Acidobacteria Group 1 sequences, by PCR amplification and sequencing of DNA from soil. Based on previous analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, Acidobacteria Group 1 species were expected to decrease in response to elevated atmospheric CO(2). Quantitative PCR results, using the Acidobacteria Group 1-specific PCR assays, confirmed the expected decrease and provided higher statistical confidence than the 16S rRNA gene-sequencing data. These results demonstrate a powerful capacity to address previously intractable assay design challenges."

Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing of barcode-gene amplicons ('metabarcoding') have made it possible to survey biodiversity in a robust and efficient way. However, one obstacle to the widespread adoption of this technique is the need to choose amongst many candidates for bioinformatic processing of the raw sequencing data. We compare three candidate pipelines for the processing of 18S small subunit rDNA metabarcode data from solid substrates: (i) USEARCH/CROP, (ii) Denoiser/UCLUST, and (iii) OCTUPUS. The three pipelines produced reassuringly similar and highly correlated assessments of community composition that are dominated by taxa known to characterize the sampled environments. However, OCTUPUS appears to inflate phylogenetic diversity, because of higher sequence noise. We therefore recommend either the USEARCH/CROP or Denoiser/UCLUST pipelines, both of which can be run within the QIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) environment."

Major issues are that the commonly adopted cultivation-based approaches are suitable for taxa which grow readily under laboratory conditions, while the DNA-based approaches provide more reliable estimates, but do not indicate whether taxa are metabolically active. In this study, we have evaluated these approaches to estimate the fungal diversity in soil and freshwater samples from a subtropical forest, and compared these to RNA-based culture-independent approach intended to indicate the metabolically active fungal assemblage. In both soil and freshwater samples, the dominant taxon recovered by all three approaches was the same (Anguillospora furtiva). This taxon was cultivable from all samples and comprised 85-86 % DNA libraries and 90-91 % RNA libraries. The remaining taxa were phylogenetically diverse and spanned the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Fungi incertae sedis. Their recovery was not consistent among the three approaches used and suggests that less abundant members of the assemblage may be subjected to greater bias when diversity estimates employ a single approach."

Origanum vulgare is a perennial medicinal aromatic plant rich in phenolic antioxidants. Present study investigates the diversity of culturable root-associated bacteria from this plant in Palampur, India, which constitutes a unique ecosystem due to high rain fall, wide temperature fluctuations and acidic soil. Both root endophytes and rhizospheric soil bacteria were isolated, which resulted in a total of 120 morphologically different isolates. They were found to group into 21 phylotypes based on restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Growth medium composition had significant effect on the diversity of the isolated bacterial populations. The isolates were characterized for various metabolic, plant growth promoting (PGP) and other biotechnologically useful activities, based on which they were clustered into groups by principal component analysis. Majority of the isolates belonged to γ-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas were the most dominant species and together constituted 27.5 % of the total isolates. Many isolates, especially γ-Proteobacteria, showed very high PGP activities. Few isolates exhibited very high antioxidant activity, which may find potential applications in food and health industries.

To study how maize plants influence soil microbes we have examined microbial communities that colonize maize plants grown in carbonate-rich soil (pH 8.5) using culture-independent, PCR-based methods. We observed a low proportion of unclassified bacteria in this soil whether it was planted or unplanted. Our results indicate that a higher complexity of the bacterial community is present in bulk soil with microbes from nine phyla, while in the rhizosphere microbes from only six phyla were found. The predominant microbes in bulk soil were bacteria of the phyla Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, while Gammaproteobacteria of the genera Pseudomonas and Lysobacter were the predominant in the rhizosphere. As Gammaproteobacteria respond chemotactically to exudates and are efficient in the utilization of plants exudate products, microbial communities associated to the rhizosphere seem to be plant-driven.

In New Zealand, larvae of the grass grub, Costelytrae zealandica (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), and manuka beetles, Pyronota spp. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), have been collected from field populations showing loss of vigour and a whitened appearance. Diagnosis indicated an intracellular infection of fat body tissues by Rickettsiella-like micro-organisms. Rickettsiella bacteria are under evaluation as a possible new source of insect bio-control agents for important agricultural pests as, e.g. scarabaeid and elaterid larvae. The present study aimed at the unequivocal molecular taxonomic identification and comparison of the bacteria associated with Costelytra and Pyronota.METHODS AND RESULTS: Electron microscopy and phylogenetic reconstruction using a multilocus sequence analysis approach based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene together with four protein-encoding markers (ftsY, gidA, rpsA, and sucB) demonstrated that both bacteria from New Zealand are phylogenetically closely related, but not identical, and belong to the taxonomic genus Rickettsiella.CONCLUSIONS: The bacteria under study should be referred to as pathotypes 'Rickettsiella costelytrae' and 'Rickettsiella pyronotae', respectively. Moreover, on the basis of the currently accepted systematic organization of the genus Rickettsiella, both pathotypes should be considered synonyms of the nomenclatural type species, Rickettsiella popilliae.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study demonstrates that Rickettsiella bacteria are geographically widespread pathogens of scarabaeid larvae.

Bacterial communities in eyelash samples from subjects with blepharitis were less diverse than those from healthy controls, while the bacterial communities of tear subjects with blepharitis were more diverse than those of healthy subjects. Statistical analyses using UniFrac and a principle coordinate analysis showed that the bacterial communities of tear samples from subjects with blepharitis were well clustered, regardless of individual, while the bacterial communities of all eyelash samples and healthy tear samples were not well clustered due to high interpersonal variability. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptophyta, Corynebacterium, and Enhydrobacter were the common ocular bacteria. An increase of Staphylococcus, Streptophyta, Corynebacterium, and Enhydrobacter, and a decrease of Propionibacterium were observed from blepharitis subjects, in terms of the relative abundances.CONCLUSIONS: Higher abundances of Streptophyta, Corynebacterium, and Enhydrobacter in blepharitis subjects suggested that human blepharitis might be induced by the infestations of pollens, dusts, and soil particles.

Fruit body initiation in Agaricus bisporus is a phase change from the vegetative to the reproductive stage which depends on the presence of a casing layer with particular physical, chemical and microbiological properties. The phase change is achieved practically by environmental manipulation and the presence of naturally occurring bacteria such as Pseuodomonas putida. In this study, 274 individual bacterial isolates were collected by screening the casing layer of 14 edible mushroom farms. The isolates were analysed with respect to biochemical properties, organic and inorganic phosphate solubilization, production of siderophore and growth in the presence of volatile compound of 1-octen-3-ol. It was found that approximately 97% of the strains were able to grow in the presence of 1-octen-3-ol and 36% were able to solubilize phosphorus. Among the isolates, 23 strains were selected as potent mushroom growth promoting bacteria (MGPB) for inoculation of the casing layer. Field experiments using these strains showed various promoting effects on production of mushroom.

High ethylene plant hormone secretion in the culture medium was detected in 22% of the bacteria. This is the first report of ethylene secretion in Paenibacillaceae isolates. Indole-3-acetic acid production was found in a Brevibacillus genus isolate. It was reported for the first time the presence of Cohnella genus strain on sugarcane rhizosphere bearing plant growth promoting traits. The sugarcane isolate Brevibacillus B65 was identified as a plant growth inoculant because it showed wider spectra of plant stimulation capabilities, including an antifungal effect, extracellular hydrolases secretion, inorganic phosphate solubilisation and plant hormone liberation.

However, studies of bacterial communities associated with tropical rainforest tree root surfaces, or rhizoplane, are lacking. Here, we analyzed the bacterial community of root surfaces of four species of native trees, Agathis borneensis, Dipterocarpus kerrii, Dyera costulata, and Gnetum gnemon, and nearby bulk soils, in a rainforest arboretum in Malaysia, using 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The rhizoplane bacterial communities for each of the four tree species sampled clustered separately from one another on an ordination, suggesting that these assemblages are linked to chemical and biological characteristics of the host or possibly to the mycorrhizal fungi present. Bacterial communities of the rhizoplane had various similarities to surrounding bulk soils. Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria were dominant in rhizoplane communities and in bulk soils from the same depth (0-10 cm). In contrast, the relative abundance of certain bacterial lineages on the rhizoplane was different from that in bulk soils: Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria, which are known as copiotrophs, were much more abundant in the rhizoplane in comparison to bulk soil. At the genus level, Burkholderia, Acidobacterium, Dyella, and Edaphobacter were more abundant in the rhizoplane. Burkholderia, which are known as both pathogens and mutualists of plants, were especially abundant on the rhizoplane of all tree species sampled. The Burkholderia species present included known mutualists of tropical crops and also known N fixers.

Pyrosequencing was used for direct analysis of the PCR product and applied as a specificity measurement of the primers. The Pseudomonas primers showed a 99% primer specificity, which covered 200 different Pseudomonas sequence clusters in 0.5 g of soil. In contrast to that the same approach using the genus-specific Burkholderia primers showed only 8% primer specificity. This discrepancy in primer specificity between the normal procedures compared with pyrosequencing illustrates that the common validation procedures for quantitative PCR primers may be misleading. Our results exemplify the fact that current 16S RNA gene sequence databases might lack resolution within many taxonomic groups and emphasize the necessity for a standardized and functional primer validation protocol.

None of the 17 isolates was capable of producing ACCD or chitinase. However, polymerase chain reaction amplification of the ACCD coding genes, by the use of the gene-specific primers, indicated that not all contain the ACCD gene.

To date, earthworm diversity has been investigated through conventional extraction methods such as handsorting, soil washing or the application of a mustard solution. Such techniques are time consuming and often difficult to apply. We showed that combining DNA metabarcoding and next-generation sequencing facilitates the identification of earthworm species from soil samples. The first step of our experiments was to create a reference database of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 16S gene for 14 earthworm species found in the French Alps. Using this database, we designed two new primer pairs targeting very short and informative DNA sequences (about 30 and 70 bp) that allow unambiguous species identification. Finally, we analysed extracellular DNA taken from soil samples in two localities (two plots per locality and eight samples per plot). The two short metabarcode regions led to the identification of a total of eight earthworm species. The earthworm communities identified by the DNA-based approach appeared to be well differentiated between the two localities and are consistent with results derived from inventories collected using the handsorting method. The possibility of assessing earthworm communities from hundreds or even thousands of localities through the use of extracellular soil DNA will undoubtedly stimulate further ecological research on these organisms. Using the same DNA extracts, our study also illustrates the potential of environmental DNA as a tool to assess the diversity of other soil-dwelling animal taxa."

Its efficacy as a biocontrol agent is thought to be associated with its production of chitinase enzymes, including N-acetyl-ß-D-glucosaminidases, chitobiosidases and endochitinases. We used targeted gene deletion and RNA-dependent gene silencing strategies to disrupt N-acetyl-ß-D-glucosaminidase and endochitinase activities of the fungus, and to determine their roles in the biocontrol of soil-borne plant pathogens. The loss of N-acetyl-ß-D-glucosaminidase activities was dispensable for biocontrol of the plurivorous damping-off pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and of the sugarcane pathogen Ceratocystis paradoxa, the causal agent of pineapple disease. Similarly, suppression of endochitinase activities had no effect on R. solani and S. sclerotiorum disease control, but had a pronounced effect on the ability of T. virens 223 to control pineapple disease.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of chitosan is a recognized method allowing control of its molecular size, making possible its optimization for a given application. During the industrial hydrolysis process of chitosan, viscosity is a major problem; which can be circumvented by raising the temperature of the chitosan solution. A thermostable chitosanase is compatible with enzymatic hydrolysis at higher temperatures thus allowing chitosan to be dissolved at higher concentrations. Following an extensive micro-plate screening of microbial isolates from various batches of shrimp shells compost, the strain 1794 was characterized and shown to produce a thermostable chitosanase. The isolate was identified as a novel member of the genus Paenibacillus, based on partial 16S rDNA and rpoB gene sequences. Using the chitosanase (Csn1794) produced by this strain, a linear time course of chitosan hydrolysis has been observed for at least 6 h at 70 °C. Csn1794 was purified and its molecular weight was estimated at 40 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Optimum pH was about 4.8, the apparent Km and the catalytic constant kcat were 0.042 mg/ml and 7,588 min⁻¹, respectively. The half-life of Csn1794 at 70 °C in the presence of chitosan substrate was &gt;20 h. The activity of chitosanase 1794 varied little with the degree of N-acetylation of chitosan. The enzyme also hydrolyzed carboxymethylcellulose but not chitin. Chitosan or cellulose-derived hexasaccharides were cleaved preferentially in a symmetrical way (&quot;3+3&quot;) but hydrolysis rate was much faster for (GlcN)₆ than (Glc)₆. Gene cloning and sequencing revealed that Csn1794 belongs to family 8 of glycoside hydrolases. The enzyme should be useful in biotechnological applications of chitosan hydrolysis, dealing with concentrated chitosan solutions at high temperatures."

A better understanding of microbial communities associated with guts and eggs of the WCR is required in order to develop new pest control strategies, and to assess the potential role of the WCR in the dissemination of microorganisms, e.g., mycotoxin-producing fungi.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Total community (TC) DNA was extracted from maize rhizosphere, WCR eggs, and guts of larvae feeding on maize roots grown in three different soil types. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and ITS fragments, PCR-amplified from TC DNA, were used to investigate the fungal and bacterial communities, respectively. Microorganisms in the WCR gut were not influenced by the soil type. Dominant fungal populations in the gut were affiliated to Fusarium spp., while Wolbachia was the most abundant bacterial genus. Identical ribosomal sequences from gut and egg samples confirmed a transovarial transmission of Wolbachia sp. Betaproteobacterial DGGE indicated a stable association of Herbaspirillum sp. with the WCR gut. Dominant egg-associated microorganisms were the bacterium Wolbachia sp. and the fungus Mortierella gamsii.SIGNIFICANCE: The soil type-independent composition of the microbial communities in the WCR gut and the dominance of only a few microbial populations suggested either a highly selective environment in the gut lumen or a high abundance of intracellular microorganisms in the gut epithelium. The dominance of Fusarium species in the guts indicated WCR larvae as vectors of mycotoxin-producing fungi. The stable association of Herbaspirillum sp. with WCR gut systems and the absence of corresponding sequences in WCR eggs suggested that this bacterium was postnatally acquired from the environment. The present study provided new insights into the microbial communities associated with larval guts and eggs of the WCR. However, their biological role remains to be explored."

Changes in the ciliate community can affect the composition and population of microfauna and microflora in ecosystems. To investigate the structure of ciliate communities, we developed a nested PCR-DGGE method, which combines a universal eukaryotic-specific primer set in the first PCR step with a ciliate-specific primer set in the second PCR step, to amplify 18S rRNA genes from ciliates. The 300 bp DGGE fragments generated more bands on the gel than the 600 bp DGGE fragments. Prior to bead beating, DNA extraction of ciliates from soil samples was optimized with a combination of freeze-thaw cycles and ultrasonication. We applied this nested PCR-DGGE method to agricultural soils amended with 0, 120, 300, and 600 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ of livestock slurry. The results from the DGGE profiles and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the supplement of slurry to soils influenced the ciliate communities. From phylogenetic analysis, 108 DGGE bands were assigned to six classes, which included Spirotrichea and Colpodea, of the subphylum Intramacronucleata, and one class of the subphylum Postciliodesmatophora. These results indicated that a wide variety of taxonomic groups were detected by DGGE profiling. Thus, the nested PCR-DGGE method described here could clearly differentiate between ciliate communities within soil samples and allowed for the phylogenetic identification of these ciliates at the class level."

Both ionizing and non-ionizing rays are routinely employed to select upon the radiation resistant deinococcal population and isolate them from the majority of radiation sensitive population. There are no studies on the development of molecular tools for the rapid detection and identification of deinococci from a mixed population without causing the bias of radiation enrichment. Here we present a Deinococcus specific two-step hemi-nested PCR for the rapid detection of deinococci from environmental samples. The method is sensitive and specific to detect deinococci without radiation exposure of the sample. The new protocol was successfully employed to detect deinococci from several soil samples from different geographical regions of India. The PCR method could be adapted to a three-step protocol to study the diversity of the environmental deinococcal population by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Sequence analysis of the DGGE bands revealed that the samples harbor diverse populations of deinococci, many of which were not recovered by culturing and may represent novel clades. We demonstrate that the genus specific primers are also suitable for the rapid identification of the bacterial isolates that are obtained from a typical radiation enrichment isolation technique.

Both nymphs and adults are often found aggregated on mesquite trees (Prosopis spp.: Fabaceae) feeding on seedpods and plant sap. We characterized the indigenous bacterial populations of nymphs and adults of this species by using molecular and phylogenetic techniques and culturing methods. Results show that this insect's bacterial gut community has a limited diversity dominated by Burkholderia associates. Phylogenetic analysis by using 16s rRNA sequences suggests that these β-Proteobacteria are closely related to those symbionts obtained from other heteropteran midgut microbial communities but not to Burkholderia symbionts associated with other insect orders. These bacteria were absent from the eggs and were not found in all younger nymphs, suggesting that they are acquired after the insects have hatched. Rearing experiments of nymphs with potentially Burkholderia contaminated soil suggested that if this symbiont is not acquired, giant mesquite bugs experience higher mortality. Egg, whole-body DNA extractions of younger nymphs, and midgut DNA extractions of fifth-instar nymphs and adults also revealed the presence of α-Proteobacteria from the Wolbachia genus. However, this bacterium was also present in reproductive organs of adults, indicating that this symbiont is not specific to the gut."

However the isolation and assessment of such bacteria is often a lengthy and expensive procedure. The aim of this study was to identify potential isolates for use in the remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated sites using a combination of selective isolation plating, the Biolog system and subsequent multivariate analyses. The use of weathered oil as the main C source restricted the number of isolates growing to 5×10(2)CFUg soil(-1). Isolates (n=96) were then assessed individually using Biolog MT2 plates with seven different hydrocarbons (dodecane, tridecane, hexadecane, octadecane, eicosane, naphthalene and phenanthrene). The results indicated that all isolates were able to grow on at least one hydrocarbon from the seven chosen. This confirmed that the isolation media developed was selective in isolating hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria only. Cluster analysis of Biolog data separated the isolates into two discrete clusters with cluster 2 identifying hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria that are effective in degrading a variety of contaminants. Further study on the isolates from cluster 2 was carried out based on their phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of 28 bacterial isolates from cluster 2 based on the 1500bp sequences from 16S rDNA genes using MRBAYES confirmed all isolates as being hydrocarbonoclastic, providing supportive evidence that isolates from cluster 2 have a potential use in bioremediation. This approach could improve both the speed and efficiency of the commercial bioremediation process."

The recent utilization of molecular methods such as internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing of ribosomal RNA genes has provided improved insight into the diversity of fungal bioaerosols in indoor, outdoor and occupational environments. However, ITS analyses may also be confounded by a number of methodological limitations. In this study, we have optimized this technology for use in occupational or environmental studies. Three commonly used DNA extraction methodologies (UltraClean Soil kit, High Pure PCR Template kit, and EluQuik/DNeasy kit) were compared in terms of sensitivity and susceptibility to PCR inhibitors in dust for three common fungal bioaerosols, Aspergillus versicolor, Rhizopus microsporus and Wallemia sebi. Environmental dust samples were then studied using each extraction methodology and results were compared to viable culture data. The extraction methods differed in terms of their ability to efficiently extract DNA from particular species of fungi (e.g. Aspergillus versicolor). In addition, the ability to remove PCR inhibitors from dust samples was most effective using the soil DNA extraction kit. The species composition varied greatly between ITS clone libraries generated with the different DNA extraction kits. However, compared to viable culture data, ITS clone libraries included additional fungal species that are incapable of growth on solid culture medium. Collectively, our data indicated that DNA extraction methodologies used in ITS sequencing studies of occupational or environmental dust samples can greatly influence the fungal species that are detected."

SOD (superoxide dismutase) and CAT (catalase) mRNA expression levels were measured after 28 days. of AHTN and HHCB exposure. The analysis results of both sequence alignment and melting curve demonstrated that the selected primers were suitable for mRNA quantification. The liner correlation coefficients of SOD and CAT standard curves were 0.997 and 0.994, respectively, and the PCR amplification efficiencies were both close to 100%. Therefore, relative quantification method could be applied to analyze the gene expression levels. The significant elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels indicated that the reactive oxygen species-induced cellular oxidative injury might be one of the main toxic effects of AHTN and HHCB. Besides, a significant positive correlation was observed between the up-regulation of SOD, CAT mRNA and the MDA levels, suggesting that possible changes in the transcript expression of antioxidant enzyme genes were associated with the oxidative stress. Furthermore, the dose-response correlation between SOD, CAT mRNA levels and the exposure concentrations was also found. The overall results indicated that SOD and CAT genes might be potential molecular biomarkers for the evaluation of the pollution stress and toxicological effects of synthetic musks in the environment."

In this study, the effects of inoculated bacterial endophytes isolated from healthy adult cacao plants on seedlings, and aspects related to inoculation methods, colonization patterns, and photosynthesis were investigated. Sequencing of 16S rRNA, hsp-60, and rpo-B genes placed the wild-type isolates within the species Enterobacter cloacae (isolates 341 and 344) and Bacillus subtilis (isolate 629). Spontaneous rifampicin-resistant (rif(R)) variants for 344 were also produced and tested. Endophytic application was either by immersion of surface sterilized seeds in bacterial suspensions or direct inoculation into soil, 20 days after planting non-inoculated seeds into pots. Results from in vitro recovery of inoculated isolates showed that the wild-type endophytes and rif(R) variants systemically colonized the entire cacao seedlings in 15-20 days, regardless of the inoculation method. Some endophytic treatments showed significant increases in seedlings' height, number of leaves, and dry matter. Inoculation methods affected the combined application of endophytes, which maintained the growth-promotion effects, but not in the same manner as in single applications. Interestingly, the 344-3.2 rif(R) variant showed improved performance in relation to both the wild type and another related variant. Photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance increased significantly for some endophytic treatments, being partially associated with effects on growth and affected by the inoculation method. The results suggest that E. cloacae and B. subtilis endophytes from healthy adult plants (not transmitted by seeds) were able to promote vegetative growth on cacao seedlings. The development of products for large-scale use in seedlings/plantlets production systems was discussed."

A yeast strain isolated from sorghum cultivation field was able to use lindane as carbon and energy source under aerobic conditions. With molecular techniques, it was identified and named as Rhodotorula strain VITJzN03. The effects of nutritional and environmental factors on yeast growth and the biodegradation of lindane was investigated. The maximum production of yeast biomass along with 100 % lindane mineralization was noted at an initial lindane concentration of 600 mg l(-1) within a period of 10 days. Lindane concentration above 600 mg l(-1) inhibited the growth of yeast in liquid medium. A positive relationship was noted between the release of chloride ions and the increase of yeast biomass as well as degradation of lindane. The calculated degradation rate and half life of lindane were found to be 0.416 day(-1) and 1.66 days, respectively. The analysis of the metabolites using GC-MS identified the formation of seven intermediates including γ-pentachlorocyclohexane(γ-PCCH), 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-1,4-cyclohexadiene(1,4-TCCHdiene), 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4 TCB), 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4 DCB), chloro-cis-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexadiene (CDCHdiene), 3-chlorocatechol (3-CC) and maleylacetate (MA) derivatives indicating that lindane degradation follows successive dechlorination and oxido-reduction. Based on the results of the present study, the possible pathway for lindane degradation by Rhodotorula sp. VITJzN03 has been proposed.

These bacteria possess peculiar biochemical characteristics such as inability to reduce nitrates, and the capacity to ferment only a limited number of carbohydrates. Heterorhabditis nematodes vector the bacteria from one insect host to another and also provide shelter to the bacteria from soil stressors and antagonists. Once inside the insect host, the bacterial symbionts are released and produce toxins and secondary metabolites and broad-spectrum antibiotics, which kill the host by septicemia within 48 h. At present, three Photorhabdus spp. have been identified: P. luminescens, P. temperata, and P. asymbiotica, and many subspecies have also been described.

To obtain RNA from these challenging soils to study the bacteria involved in nitrification, we developed a soil RNA extraction method for gene expression analysis. Autoclaved casein was added to an RNA extraction buffer to recover RNA from soil, and high-quality RNA was successfully extracted from eight types of agricultural soils that were significantly different in their physicochemical characteristics.

The majority of isolates were belonging to the typical spoilage bacterial population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Enterococcaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae. Several additional isolates were identified as Staphylococcus spp. and Bacillus spp. originating from human and animal skin and other environmental niches including plants, soil, and water. Carnobacterium divergens, a LAB contributing to the spoilage of raw meat even at refrigeration temperature, was the most frequently isolated species in our study (5/10) with a bacterial load of 10(3) - 10(7) CFU mL(-1). In several of the analyzed pork meat juice samples, two bacterial faecal indicators, Serratia grimesii and Serratia proteamaculans, were identified together with another opportunistic food-borne pathogen, Staphylococcus equorum. Our data reveal a high bacterial load of fresh pork meat supporting the potential health risk of meat juice for the end consumer even under refrigerated conditions."

The evolution of CO(2) production in all crude oil-contaminated microcosms showed potential for mineralization.

Principal component analysis showed divergence of the non-contaminated samples from the 5% crude oil-contaminated sediment. A Venn diagram generated from the banding pattern of PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to look for operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in common. Eight OTUs were found in non-contaminated sediments and in samples contaminated with 0.5, 1, or 2% crude oil. A Jaccard similarity index of 50% was found for samples contaminated with 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2% crude oil.

To test if the effect of herbicides on the rhizobacterial communities of genetically modified NK603 glyphosate-tolerant maize varies according to different soil locations, a comparison was made between the effects of glyphosate (Roundup Plus), a post-emergence applied herbicide, and a pre-emergence applied herbicide (GTZ) versus untreated soil. The potential effect was monitored by direct amplification, cloning, and sequencing of the soil DNA encoding 16S rRNA, and high-throughput DNA pyrosequencing of the bacterial DNA coding for the 16S rRNA hypervariable V6 region. The results obtained using three different methods to analyze the herbicide effect on the rhizobacterial communities of genetically modified NK603 maize were comparable to those previously obtained when glyphosate-tolerant maize was grown in soil with different characteristics. Both herbicides decreased the bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere, with Actinobacteria being the taxonomic group most affected.

However, many soil fungi can metabolize those of pollutants, although they rarely complete mineralization. In this paper, we investigated the dynamic relationship between fungi and bacteria associated with degradation of HMW-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Artificial fungal-bacterial mixed cultures were constructed to simulate the environment of actual polluted sites. Four bacterial strains and seven fungal strains were isolated that related to the removal of phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene in the soil. Furthermore, these strains were used to create mixed culture of bacteria (Bact-mix), mixed culture of fungi (Fung-mix), fungal-bacterial co-cultures (Fung-Bact), respectively. The maximal pyrene removal rate (67%, 28days) was observed in the Fung-Bact, compared with cultures of Fung-mix (39%) and Bact-mix (56%). The same tendency was also indicated in the degradation of phenanthrene and fluoranthene.

Results would enhance our understanding on the interaction between nematodes and soil microorganisms and potentially enhance the biocontrol efficiency when combined the attractants with nemacides.METHODS: Bacteria producing volatiles with functions of nematode-attracting activities were isolated from 187 agricultural soil samples collected in 26 provinces of China with the method of double-Petri dishes. The phylogenetic diversity of these bacteria was characterized by RFLP-16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The nematode-attracting volatiles of bacteria were detected using the SPME-GC/MS, and volatile compounds with attractive activity were determined by confirming with individual commercial compounds.RESULTS: Among the 3800 bacteria isolated from the 187 soil samples, 196 isolates(5.16% of the total) showed attractive activity (AN)more than 30% to Panagrellus redivivus. Of the 196 isolates, 66 (1.74%) showed AN &gt; or = 70%, 62 isolates (1.63%) showed AN between 50% and 70%, and 68 isolates (1.79%) showed AN less than 50%.

Microscopy has also been used to identify their relative abundance in roots, but only at low resolution, usually the genus level. We evaluated the robustness of using nested PCR amplicons of ribosomal RNA genes to estimate the relative abundance of undefined AM fungi in uniformly aged roots in comparison to visual estimates. The relative abundance of AM fungi was assessed as per cent root length colonised by morphotypes and relative sequence type abundance in clone libraries. Plants were grown in coastal soil to obtain assemblages of unknown AM fungi at two times (spring and autumn). Relative abundance of dominant genera of AM fungi in roots (Archaeospora and Glomus) based on an analysis of ribosomal RNA genes did not consistently correspond with relative abundance of morphotypes. This microscopic vs. molecular genetic comparison supports previous conclusions that there can be limitations in using nested PCR amplicons for quantifying the relative abundance of AM fungi in roots, with a sampling bias likely to be of significance. Both molecular genetic and morphological methods are used to estimate relative abundance of AM fungi as a precursor to understanding mycorrhizal function in field soils, but they are rarely verified using alternative approaches although this may be necessary."

The resulting classification depends on the reference sequences and taxonomic hierarchy used to train the model; although the influence of primer sets and classification algorithms have been explored in detail, the influence of training set has not been characterized. We compared classification results obtained using three different publicly available databases as training sets, applied to five different bacterial 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing data sets generated (from human body, mouse gut, python gut, soil and anaerobic digester samples). We observed numerous advantages to using the largest, most diverse training set available, that we constructed from the Greengenes (GG) bacterial/archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequence database and the latest GG taxonomy. Phylogenetic clusters of previously unclassified experimental sequences were identified with notable improvements (for example, 50% reduction in reads unclassified at the phylum level in mouse gut, soil and anaerobic digester samples), especially for phylotypes belonging to specific phyla (Tenericutes, Chloroflexi, Synergistetes and Candidate phyla TM6, TM7). Trimming the reference sequences to the primer region resulted in systematic improvements in classification depth, and greatest gains at higher confidence thresholds. Phylotypes unclassified at the genus level represented a greater proportion of the total community variation than classified operational taxonomic units in mouse gut and anaerobic digester samples, underscoring the need for greater diversity in existing reference databases."

Genomic DNA obtained from each community was used to amplify 16S rRNA genes with two or three barcode tags as technical replicates in the presence of a small quantity (0.1% wt/wt) of genomic DNA from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 as the control. The technical reproducibility of the amplicon sequencing-based detection approach is quite low, with an average operational taxonomic unit (OTU) overlap of 17.2%±2.3% between two technical replicates, and 8.2%±2.3% among three technical replicates, which is most likely due to problems associated with random sampling processes. Such variations in technical replicates could have substantial effects on estimating β-diversity but less on α-diversity. A high variation was also observed in the control across different samples (for example, 66.7-fold for the forward primer), suggesting that the amplicon sequencing-based detection approach could not be quantitative. In addition, various strategies were examined to improve the comparability of amplicon sequencing data, such as increasing biological replicates, and removing singleton sequences and less-representative OTUs across biological replicates. Finally, as expected, various statistical analyses with preprocessed experimental data revealed clear differences in the composition and structure of microbial communities between warming and non-warming, or between clipping and non-clipping. Taken together, these results suggest that amplicon sequencing-based detection is useful in analyzing microbial community structure even though it is not reproducible and quantitative. However, great caution should be taken in experimental design and data interpretation when the amplicon sequencing-based detection approach is used for quantitative analysis of the β-diversity of microbial communities."

The rhizospheres of six cultivars denoted Aveka, Aventra, Karnico, Modena, Premiere and Desiree, at three growth stages (young, flowering and senescence) were examined, in addition to corresponding bulk soils. Around 350,000 sequences were obtained (5,700 to 38,000 per sample). Across all samples, rank abundance distributions best fitted the power law model, which indicates a community composed of a few highly dominant species next to numerous rare species. Grouping of the sequences showed that members of the Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, next to as-yet-unclassified bacteria, dominated. Other groups that were consistently found, albeit at lower abundance, were Beta-, Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria. Principal components analyses revealed that rhizosphere samples were significantly different from corresponding bulk soil in each growth stage. Furthermore, cultivar effects were found in the young plant stage, whereas these became insignificant in the flowering and senescence stages. Besides, an effect of time of season was observed for both rhizosphere and bulk soils. The analyzed rhizosphere samples of the potato cultivars were grouped into two groups, in accordance with the allocation of carbon to starch in their tubers, i.e. Aveka, Aventra and Karnico (high) versus Premiere and Desiree (low) and thus replicates per group were established.CONCLUSIONS: Across all potato cultivars, the young plant stages revealed cultivar-dependent bacterial community structures, which disappeared in the flowering and senescence stages.

Temperate freshwater lakes such as Lake Lanier are underrepresented among the growing number of environmental metagenomic data sets, and little is known about how functional gene content in freshwater communities relates to that of other ecosystems. To better characterize the gene content and variability of this freshwater planktonic microbial community, we sequenced several samples obtained around a strong summer storm event and during the fall water mixing using a random whole-genome shotgun (WGS) approach. Comparative metagenomics revealed that the gene content was relatively stable over time and more related to that of another freshwater lake and the surface ocean than to soil. However, the phylogenetic diversity of Lake Lanier communities was distinct from that of soil and marine communities. We identified several important genomic adaptations that account for these findings, such as the use of potassium (as opposed to sodium) osmoregulators by freshwater organisms and differences in the community average genome size.

Using a polyphasic methodological approach to analyse microbial communities in soil as well as associated with cultivated plants, drastic effects caused by 30 years of agriculture were detected. Analysing bacterial fingerprints, we found statistically significant differences between agricultural and native desert soil of about 60%. A pyrosequencing-based analysis of the 16S rRNA gene regions showed higher diversity in agricultural than in desert soil (Shannon diversity indices: 11.21/7.90), and displayed structural differences. The proportion of Firmicutes in field soil was significantly higher (37%) than in the desert (11%). Bacillus and Paenibacillus play the key role: they represented 96% of the antagonists towards phytopathogens, and identical 16S rRNA sequences in the amplicon library and for isolates were detected. The proportion of antagonistic strains was doubled in field in comparison to desert soil (21.6%/12.4%); disease-suppressive bacteria were especially enriched in plant roots. On the opposite, several extremophilic bacterial groups, e.g., Acidimicrobium, Rubellimicrobium and Deinococcus-Thermus, disappeared from soil after agricultural use. The N-fixing Herbaspirillum group only occurred in desert soil. Soil bacterial communities were strongly driven by the a-biotic factors water supply and pH.SIGNIFICANCE: After long-term farming, a drastic shift in the bacterial communities in desert soil was observed. Bacterial communities in agricultural soil showed a higher diversity and a better ecosystem function for plant health but a loss of extremophilic bacteria.

At representative locations, subsurface sediment was also examined from two boreholes, one sampled from the most heavily contaminated area of the site and another from an area with low contamination. A suite of DNA- and RNA-based molecular tools were employed for community characterization, including quantitative PCR of rRNA and nitrite reductase genes, community composition fingerprinting analysis, and high-throughput pyrotag sequencing of rRNA genes.

The relative abundance of bacteria from this genus was positively correlated with lower-pH conditions, and these bacteria were abundant and active in the most highly contaminated areas. Other factors, such as the concentration of nitrogen species, oxygen level, and sampling season, did not appear to strongly influence the distribution of Rhodanobacter bacteria.

In eucalyptus plantations, water availability is a key factor limiting productivity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of eucalyptus to water shortage remain unclear. In this study, we compared the molecular responses of two commercial eucalyptus hybrids during the dry season. Both hybrids differ in productivity when grown under water deficit.RESULTS: Pyrosequencing of RNA extracted from shoot apices provided extensive transcriptome coverage - a catalog of 129,993 unigenes (49,748 contigs and 80,245 singletons) was generated from 398 million base pairs, or 1.14 million reads. The pyrosequencing data enriched considerably existing Eucalyptus EST collections, adding 36,985 unigenes not previously represented. Digital analysis of read abundance in 14,460 contigs identified 1,280 that were differentially expressed between the two genotypes, 155 contigs showing differential expression between treatments (irrigated vs. non irrigated conditions during the dry season), and 274 contigs with significant genotype-by-treatment interaction. The more productive genotype displayed a larger set of genes responding to water stress. Moreover, stress signal transduction seemed to involve different pathways in the two genotypes, suggesting that water shortage induces distinct cellular stress cascades. Similarly, the response of functional proteins also varied widely between genotypes: the most productive genotype decreased expression of genes related to photosystem, transport and secondary metabolism, whereas genes related to primary metabolism and cell organisation were over-expressed.CONCLUSIONS: For the most productive genotype, the ability to express a broader set of genes in response to water availability appears to be a key characteristic in the maintenance of biomass growth during the dry season. Its strategy may involve a decrease of photosynthetic activity during the dry season associated with resources reallocation through major changes in the expression of primary metabolism associated genes. Further efforts will be needed to assess the adaptive nature of the genes highlighted in this study."

Nitrogen is often added to contaminated soil in situ to stimulate the existing microbial community, but little is known about how the added nutrients are used by these microorganisms. Microbes vary widely in their ability to metabolize petroleum hydrocarbons, so the question becomes: which hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms most effectively use this added nitrogen for growth? Using [(15)N]DNA-based stable isotope probing, we determined which taxonomic groups most readily incorporated nitrogen from the monoammonium phosphate added to contaminated and uncontaminated soil in Canadian Forces Station-Alert, Nunavut, Canada. Fractions from each sample were amplified with bacterial 16S rRNA and alkane monooxygenase B (alkB) gene-specific primers and then sequenced using large-scale parallel-pyrosequencing. Sequence data was combined with 16S rRNA and alkB gene C quantitative PCR data to measure the presence of various phylogenetic groups in fractions at different buoyant densities. Several families of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria that are directly involved in petroleum degradation incorporated the added nitrogen in contaminated soils, but it was the DNA of Sphingomonadaceae that was most enriched in (15)N.

Recent evidence suggests, however, that a single extraction of a soil sample may not lead to representative recovery of DNA from all of the organisms in the sample. To determine whether multiple DNA extractions would affect the DNA yield, the eubacterial 16S rRNA gene copy number, or the identification of anthracene-degrading bacteria, we performed seven successive DNA extractions on the same aliquot of contaminated soil either untreated or enriched with [U-(13)C]anthracene. Multiple extractions were necessary to maximize the DNA yield and 16S rRNA gene copy number from both untreated and anthracene-enriched soil samples. Sequences within the order Sphingomonadales, but unrelated to any previously described genus, dominated the 16S rRNA gene clone libraries derived from (13)C-enriched DNA and were designated &quot;anthracene group 1.&quot; Sequences clustering with Variovorax spp., which were also highly represented, and sequences related to the genus Pigmentiphaga were newly associated with anthracene degradation. The bacterial groups collectively identified across all seven extracts were all recovered in the first extract, although quantitative PCR analysis of SIP-identified groups revealed quantitative differences in extraction patterns. These results suggest that performing multiple DNA extractions on soil samples improves the extractable DNA yield and the number of quantifiable eubacterial 16S rRNA gene copies but have little qualitative effect on the identification of the bacterial groups associated with the degradation of a given carbon source by SIP."

We examined 17,516 environmental 18S rRNA gene sequences representing 20 phyla of soil animals sampled from 11 locations covering a range of biomes and latitudes around the world. No globally cosmopolitan taxa were found and only 14 of 2,259 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found were common to four or more locations. Half of those were circumpolar and may reflect higher connectivity among circumpolar locations compared with other locations in the study. Even when OTU assembly criteria were relaxed to approximate the family taxonomic level, only 34 OTUs were common to four or more locations. A comparison of our diversity and community structure data to environmental factors suggests that below-ground animal diversity may be inversely related to above-ground biodiversity. Our data suggest that greater soil inorganic N and lower pH could explain the low below-ground biodiversity found at locations of high above-ground biodiversity. Our locations could also be characterized as being dominated by microarthropods or dominated by nematodes. Locations dominated by arthropods were primarily forests with lower soil pH, root biomass, mean annual temperature, low soil inorganic N and higher C:N, litter and moisture compared with nematode-dominated locations, which were mostly grasslands. Overall, our data indicate that small soil animals have distinct biogeographical distributions and provide unique evidence of the link between above-ground and below-ground biodiversity at a global scale."

However, the extent to which such 'dirt' DNA reflects taxonomic richness and structural diversity remains contentious. Here, we couple second generation high-throughput sequencing with 16S mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) meta-barcoding, to explore the accuracy and sensitivity of 'dirt' DNA as an indicator of vertebrate diversity, from soil sampled at safari parks, zoological gardens and farms with known species compositions. PCR amplification was successful in the full pH range of the investigated soils (6.2 ± 0.2 to 8.3 ± 0.2), but inhibition was detected in extracts from soil of high organic content. DNA movement (leaching) through strata was evident in some sporadic cases and is influenced by soil texture and structure. We find that DNA from the soil surface reflects overall taxonomic richness and relative biomass of individual species. However, one species that was recently introduced was not detected. Furthermore, animal behaviour was shown to influence DNA deposition rates. The approach potentially provides a quick methodological alternative to classical ecological surveys of biodiversity, and most reliable results are obtained with spatial sample replicates, while relative amounts of soil processed per site is of less importance."

However, the effect of using genetically modified organisms for phytoremediation is a poorly researched topic in terms of microbial community structures, despite the important role of microorganisms in the health of soil. In this study, a comparative analysis of the bacterial and archaeal communities found in the rhizosphere of genetically modified (GM) versus wild-type (WT) poplar was conducted on trees at different growth stages (i.e., the rhizospheres of 1.5-, 2.5-, and 3-year-old poplars) that were cultivated on contaminated soils together with nonplanted control soil. Based on the results of DNA pyrosequencing, poplar type and growth stages were associated with directional changes in the structure of the microbial community. The rate of change was faster in GM poplars than in WT poplars, but the microbial communities were identical in the 3-year-old poplars. This phenomenon may arise because of a higher rate and greater extent of metal accumulation in GM poplars than in naturally occurring plants, which resulted in greater changes in soil environments and hence the microbial habitat."

However, characterization and knowledge of fungal communities is hampered because few primer sets are available to quantify fungal abundance by real-time quantitative PCR (real-time Q-PCR). The aim in this study was to quantify fungal abundance in soils by incorporating, into a real-time Q-PCR using the SYBRGreen® method, a primer set already used to study the genetic structure of soil fungal communities. To satisfy the real-time Q-PCR requirements to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of the detection technique, this study focused on the 18S rRNA gene conserved regions. These regions are little affected by length polymorphism and may provide sufficiently small targets, a crucial criterion for enhancing accuracy and reproducibility of the detection technique. An in silico analysis of 33 primer sets targeting the 18S rRNA gene was performed to select the primer set with the best potential for real-time Q-PCR: short amplicon length; good fungal specificity and coverage. The best consensus between specificity, coverage and amplicon length among the 33 sets tested was the primer set FR1/FF390. This in silico analysis of the specificity of FR1/FF390 also provided additional information to the previously published analysis on this primer set. The specificity of the primer set FR1/FF390 for Fungi was validated in vitro by cloning--sequencing the amplicons obtained from a real time Q-PCR assay performed on five independent soil samples. This assay was also used to evaluate the sensitivity and reproducibility of the method. Finally, fungal abundance in samples from 24 soils with contrasting physico-chemical and environmental characteristics was examined and ranked to determine the importance of soil texture, organic carbon content, C∶N ratio and land use in determining fungal abundance in soils."

OTU 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while OTUs 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. Targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight OTUs revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related to Lactobacillus spp., Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidales, Clostridiales/Lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. Where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the Firmicutes, with Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria also identified.

Large-scale expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated, curated, and analyzed to identify major genetic determinants responsible for stress-adaptive responses. Although roots serve as the first site of perception and/or injury for many types of abiotic stress, EST sequencing in root tissues of wine grape exposed to abiotic stresses has been extremely limited to date. To overcome this limitation, large-scale EST sequencing was conducted from root tissues exposed to multiple abiotic stresses.RESULTS: A total of 62,236 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated from leaf, berry, and root tissues from vines subjected to abiotic stresses and compared with 32,286 ESTs sequenced from 20 public cDNA libraries. Curation to correct annotation errors, clustering and assembly of the berry and leaf ESTs with currently available V. vinifera full-length transcripts and ESTs yielded a total of 13,278 unique sequences, with 2302 singletons and 10,976 mapped to V. vinifera gene models. Of these, 739 transcripts were found to have significant differential expression in stressed leaves and berries including 250 genes not described previously as being abiotic stress responsive. In a second analysis of 16,452 ESTs from a normalized root cDNA library derived from roots exposed to multiple, short-term, abiotic stresses, 135 genes with root-enriched expression patterns were identified on the basis of their relative EST abundance in roots relative to other tissues.CONCLUSIONS: The large-scale analysis of relative EST frequency counts among a diverse collection of 23 different cDNA libraries from leaf, berry, and root tissues of wine grape exposed to a variety of abiotic stress conditions revealed distinct, tissue-specific expression patterns, previously unrecognized stress-induced genes, and many novel genes with root-enriched mRNA expression for improving our understanding of root biology and manipulation of rootstock traits in wine grape. mRNA abundance estimates based on EST library-enriched expression patterns showed only modest correlations between microarray and quantitative, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) methods highlighting the need for deep-sequencing expression profiling methods."

Contamination may originate from animal waste, insects, soil or water. Current guidelines for fresh tomato production recommend the use of potable water for applications coming in direct contact with the fruit, but due to high demand, water from other sources is frequently used. We sought to describe the overall bacterial diversity on the surface of tomato fruit and the effect of two different water sources (ground and surface water) when used for direct crop applications by generating a 454-pyrosequencing 16S rRNA dataset of these different environments. This study represents the first in depth characterization of bacterial communities in the tomato fruit surface and the water sources commonly used in commercial vegetable production.RESULTS: The two water sources tested had a significantly different bacterial composition. Proteobacteria was predominant in groundwater samples, whereas in the significantly more diverse surface water, abundant phyla also included Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The fruit surface bacterial communities on tomatoes sprayed with both water sources could not be differentiated using various statistical methods. Both fruit surface environments had a high representation of Gammaproteobacteria, and within this class the genera Pantoea and Enterobacter were the most abundant.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the major differences observed in the bacterial composition of ground and surface water, the season long use of these very different water sources did not have a significant impact on the bacterial composition of the tomato fruit surface. This study has provided the first next-generation sequencing database describing the bacterial communities living in the fruit surface of a tomato crop under two different spray water regimes, and therefore represents an important step forward towards the development of science-based metrics for Good Agricultural Practices."

We compared dirRNA and dscDNA communities to PCR-amplified DNA communities using a mock community of eight taxa, as well as experiments derived from three environmental sample types: chromium-contaminated aquifer groundwater, tropical forest soil, and secondary sewage in seawater. Community profiles by both direct hybridization methods showed differences that were expected based on accompanying data but that were missing in PCR-amplified communities. Taxon richness decreased in RNA compared to that in DNA communities, suggesting a subset of 20% in soil and 60% in groundwater that is active; secondary sewage showed no difference between active and inactive populations.

Taxonomic characterization of Streptomyces strains has been a challenge due to the large number of described species, greater than any other microbial genus, resulting from academic and industrial activities.

The present phylogenetic study examines almost all described species (615 taxa) within the family Streptomycetaceae based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and illustrates the species diversity within this family, which is observed to contain 130 statistically supported clades, as well as many unsupported and single member clusters.

Biosurfactant production was assessed with an atomized oil assay for a large number of bacterial isolates and compared with a commonly used drop collapse assay from broth and plate cultures. The atomized oil assay detected every strain that produced a biosurfactant detectable by the drop collapse test, and also identified additional strains that were not detected with the drop collapse assay because they produced low levels of surfactant or hydrophobic (low water solubility) surfactants such as pumilacidins. Not all strains that produced a biosurfactant detectable by the drop collapse when cultured on agar surfaces produced surfactants detectable by drop collapse when cultured in broth, and vice versa. Many bacterial strains exhibited preferential production of surfactants when grown on an agar surface compared with broth cultures, and such surface enhancement of production could also be stimulated by increasing the viscosity of liquid culture media. Surface induction of surfactant production in the epiphyte Pseudomonas syringae was regulated at the transcriptional level."

Analysis based on categorization of differentially expressed genes against 3CB revealed new findings about the cellular responses of the bacteria to 3CB. Genes specifically involved in the transport of 3CB were upregulated, including a K(+)/H(+) antiporter complex, a universal stress protein, two cytochrome P450 proteins and an efflux transporter.

Methylococcus, like pmoA gene sequences, were also retrieved and showed low similarity to those from Methylococcus spp. and thus indicates the existence of novel methanotrophs in the Zoige wetland. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were used to measure the abundance of methantrophs and detected 10(7) to 10(8) of total pmoA gene copies per gram dry weight of soil in the three marshes. Group-specific qPCR and reverse transcriptase qPCR results found that the Methylobacter genus dominates the wetland, and Methylocystis methanotrophs were less abundant, although this group of methanotrophs was estimated to be more active according to mRNA/DNA ratio.

A duplex real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) PCR merged with melting curve analysis was developed for the rapid detection of O. viverrini and S. stercoralis in human fecal samples. Duplex real-time FRET PCR is based on fluorescence melting curve analysis of a hybrid of amplicons generated from two genera of DNA elements: the 162 bp pOV-A6 DNA sequence specific to O. viverrini and the 244 bp 18S rRNA sequence specific to S. stercoralis, and two pairs of specific fluorophore-labeled probes. Both O. viverrini and S. stercoralis can be differentially detected in infected human fecal samples by this process through their different fluorescence channels and melting temperatures. Detection limit of the method was as little as two O. viverrini eggs and four S. stercoralis larvae in 100 mg of fecal sample. The assay could distinguish the DNA of both parasites from the DNA of negative fecal samples and fecal samples with other parasite materials, as well as from the DNA of human leukocytes and other control parasites. The technique showed 100% sensitivity and specificity. The introduced duplex real-time FRET PCR can reduce labor time and reagent costs and is not prone to carry over contamination.

Many statistical methods have been developed to quantify beta diversity, and among them, UniFrac and weighted-UniFrac (W-UniFrac) are widely used. The W-UniFrac is a weighted sum of branch lengths in a phylogenetic tree of the sequences from the communities. However, W-UniFrac does not consider the variation of the weights under random sampling resulting in less power detecting the differences between communities.RESULTS: We develop a new statistic termed variance adjusted weighted UniFrac (VAW-UniFrac) to compare two communities based on the phylogenetic relationships of the individuals. The VAW-UniFrac is used to test if the two communities are different. To test the power of VAW-UniFrac, we first ran a series of simulations which revealed that it always outperforms W-UniFrac, as well as UniFrac when the individuals are not uniformly distributed. Next, all three methods were applied to analyze three large 16S rRNA sequence collections, including human skin bacteria, mouse gut microbial communities, microbial communities from hypersaline soil and sediments, and a tropical forest census data. Both simulations and applications to real data show that VAW-UniFrac can satisfactorily measure differences between communities, considering not only the species composition but also abundance information.CONCLUSIONS: VAW-UniFrac can recover biological insights that cannot be revealed by other beta diversity measures, and it provides a novel alternative for comparing communities."

EAA is caused by the inhalation of high amounts of airborne spores that can be found for example in environments of agricultural production, compost facilities, mushroom cultivation rooms, or rooms with technical air moistening. Because of the medical relevance of S. rectivirgula, a reliable detection system is needed. Therefore, a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) primer system was designed, targeting the 16S rRNA gene of the type strain S. rectivirgula DSM 43747(T) and six other S. rectivirgula reference strains. Our investigation showed that S. rectivirgula presumably own four operons of the 16S rRNA gene, which has to be considered for estimation of cell equivalents. Furthermore, the DNA recovery efficiency from these strains was tested in combination with bioaerosol or material sample as well as the influence of non-target DNA to the recovery rate. Results showed a recovery DNA efficiency of 7-55%. The recovery rate of DNA in a mixture with non-target DNA resulted in ∼87%. In summary, a high amplification efficiency using real-time PCR was found, for which estimated concentrations revealed cell numbers of 2.7 × 10(5) cells m(-3) in bioaerosol and 2.8 × 10(6) cells g(-1) fw(-1) in material samples from a duck house. The specificity of the new developed quantification system was shown by generation of two clone libraries from bioarosol samples, from a duck house, and from a composting plant.

Here, we describe the development and field validation of qPCR markers (i.e. primers with associated hydrolysis probes), targeting taxon-specific motifs in the nuclear large ribosomal subunit RNA genes. Design of such markers is complicated by the multinuclear and multigenomic cellular organization of these fungi and the high DNA sequence diversity within the smallest biologically relevant units (i.e. single-spore isolates). These limitations are further compounded by inefficient biomass production of these fungi, resulting in limited availability of pure genomic DNA (gDNA) of well-defined isolates for cross-specificity testing of the markers. Here we demonstrate, using a number of AMF isolates, the possibility to establish stringent qPCR running conditions allowing quantification of phylogenetically disjunctive AMF taxa. Further, we show that these markers can more generally be used to quantify abundance (i.e. number of target gene copies or amount of gDNA) of what is usually considered the level of AMF species, regardless of the isolate identities. We also illustrate the range of variation within qPCR signal strength across different AMF taxa with respect to the detected number of gene copies per unit amount of gDNA. This information is paramount for interpretation of the qPCR analyses of field samples. Finally, the field validation of these markers confirmed their potential to assess composition of field AMF communities and monitor the changes owing to agricultural practices such as soil tillage."

All samples were processed within 4 h of collection. Total nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon, ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen content of samples were measured by Kjeldahl determination, sulphuric acid-perchloric acid digestion and molybdenum blue colorimetry, potassium dichromate titration, Nessler's reagent colorimetric and the phenol disulphonic acid colorimetric method, respectively. Seasonal and temporal diversity of sediment bacterial communities at six stations in Lake Dongping were investigated using molecular approaches (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and 16S rDNA clone libraries). Noticeable seasonal and temporal variations were observed in bacterial diversity and composition at all six stations. Sediment bacterial communities in Lake Dongping belonged to 16 phyla: Proteobacteria (including α-Proteobacteria, β-Proteobacteria, δ-Proteobacteria, ε-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria), Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, Nitrospira, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Chlorobi, Cyanobacteria, Deferribacteres, Actinobacteria, OP8, Spirochaetes and OP11. Members of β-, δ- and γ-Proteobacterial sequences were predominant in 11 of 12 clone libraries derived from sediment samples. Sediment samples collected at stations 1 and 4 in July had the greatest bacterial diversity while those collected at station 2 in October had the least diversity. TP concentration was significantly correlated with the distribution of bacterial communities.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that different environmental nutrient inputs contribute to seasonal and temporal variations of chemical features and bacterial communities in sediments of Lake Dongping.

The aim of the current work was to isolate the gossypol-degrading fungus from a soil microcosm and investigate the proteins involved in gossypol degradation.RESULTS: A fungal strain, AN-1, that uses gossypol as its sole carbon source was isolated and identified as Aspergillus niger. A large number of intracellular proteins were detected using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but no significant difference was observed between the glucose-containing and gossypol-containing mycelium extracts. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis results showed that the protein spots were concentrated in the 25.0-66.2 kDa range and distributed in different pI gradients. PDQuest software showed that 51 protein spots in the gels were differentially expressed. Of these, 20 differential protein spots, including six special spots expressed in gossypol, were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.CONCLUSION: The fungus AN-1 biodegraded gossypol and the proteomic analysis results indicate that some proteins were involved in the gossypol biodegradation during fungus survival, using gossypol as its sole carbon source."

The pPROBE-pTet(r) plasmids expressed the gfp reporter gene and were stably maintained in 16SH cells without antibiotic selection in free-living state and in planta. Confocal microscopy on intact roots of micropropagated sugarcane plantlets showed that gfp-tagged 16SH cells formed biofilms on root maturation and elongation zones but not on root meristem zones and root caps, and colonized in intercellular spaces of root cortices. Inoculation of 16SH significantly increased biomass and nitrogen content of micropropagated sugarcane seedlings grown with a nitrogen fertilization of 6.3 mg N/kg soil. ¹⁵N isotope dilution assays demonstrated that biological nitrogen fixation contributed to this plant growth promotion.

However, some isolates had to be identified by 16S rRNA gene analyses if MALDI Biotyper-based identification was at the level of probable or not reliable identification, usually due to a lack of reference spectra included in the database. Overall, this study shows the possibility of using MALDI-TOF MS and MALDI Biotyper for the fast and relatively nonlaborious identification/classification of soil isolates. At the same time, it demonstrates the dominant role of employing 16S rRNA gene analyses for the identification of recently isolated strains that can later fill the gaps in the protein-based identification databases."

The fungi contribute phosphorous, nitrogen and mobilized nutrients from organic matter in the soil and in return the fungus receives photosynthetically-derived carbohydrates. This union of plant and fungal metabolisms is the mycorrhizal metabolome. Understanding this symbiotic relationship at a molecular level provides important contributions to the understanding of forest ecosystems and global carbon cycling.RESULTS: We generated next generation short-read transcriptomic sequencing data from fully-formed ectomycorrhizae between Laccaria bicolor and aspen (Populus tremuloides) roots. The transcriptomic data was used to identify statistically significantly expressed gene models using a bootstrap-style approach, and these expressed genes were mapped to specific metabolic pathways. Integration of expressed genes that code for metabolic enzymes and the set of expressed membrane transporters generates a predictive model of the ectomycorrhizal metabolome. The generated model of mycorrhizal metabolome predicts that the specific compounds glycine, glutamate, and allantoin are synthesized by L. bicolor and that these compounds or their metabolites may be used for the benefit of aspen in exchange for the photosynthetically-derived sugars fructose and glucose.CONCLUSIONS: The analysis illustrates an approach to generate testable biological hypotheses to investigate the complex molecular interactions that drive ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. These models are consistent with experimental environmental data and provide insight into the molecular exchange processes for organisms in this complex ecosystem. The method used here for predicting metabolomic models of mycorrhizal systems from deep RNA sequencing data can be generalized and is broadly applicable to transcriptomic data derived from complex systems."

Spatial autocorrelations of the different N-cycling communities ranged between 1.4 and 7.6 m for ammonia oxidizers and from 0.3 m for nosZ-type denitrifiers to scales &gt;14 m for nirK-type denitrifiers. The spatial heterogeneity of ammonia oxidizers and nirS-type denitrifiers increased in high LUI, but decreased for biogeochemical properties, suggesting that biotic and/or abiotic factors other than those measured are driving the spatial distribution of these microorganisms at the plot scale.

Based on morphological and physiochemical properties and sequence of 16S rDNA, the isolate was identified as Pseudomonas sp., designated as CS3. The optimal culture conditions of strain CS3 for nicotine degradation were 30°C and pH 7·0. However, the strain showed broad pH adaptability with high nicotine-degrading activity between pH 6·0 and 10·0. Strain CS3 could decompose nicotine nearly completely within 24 h in liquid culture (1000 mg L(-1) nicotine) or within 72 h in soil (1000-2500 mg kg(-1) nicotine) and could endure up to 4000 mg L(-1) nicotine in liquid media and 5000 mg kg(-1) nicotine in soil. Degradation tests in flask revealed that the strain had excellent stability and high degradation activity during the repetitive degradation processes. Additionally, three intermediates, 3-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl) pyridine, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridyl) pyrrolidine-2-ol and cotinine, were identified by GC/MS and NMR analyses.CONCLUSIONS: The isolate CS3 showed outstanding nicotine-degrading characteristics such as high degradation efficiency, strong substrate endurance, broad pH adaptability, and stability and persistence in repetitive degradation processes and may serve as an excellent candidate for applications in the bioaugmentation process to treat nicotine-contaminated water and soil. Also, detection of nicotine metabolites suggests that strain CS3 might decompose nicotine via a unique nicotine-degradation pathway.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The advantage of applying the isolated strain lies in broad pH adaptability and stability and persistence in repetitive use, the properties previously less focused in other nicotine-degrading micro-organisms. The strain might decompose nicotine via a nicotine-degradation pathway different from those of other nicotine-utilizing Pseudomonas bacteria reported earlier, another highlight in this study."

The latter multiplex PCR identified all isolates tested in this study, whatever be their origin.CONCLUSIONS: Isolation on VIA medium and confirmation of Sten. maltophilia species membership by smeD PCR is proposed to identify environmental and clinical isolates of Sten. maltophilia.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The proposed approach enables isolation and identification of Sten. maltophilia from different environments in an easy and rapid way. This approach will be useful to accurately manage studies on the abundance and distribution of Sten. maltophilia in hospital and nonhospital environments."

Adding pesticide-primed soil has been shown to be beneficial for the establishment of pesticide-degrading populations in BPS. However, no data exist on the response of pesticide-degrading microbiota, either endogenous or introduced with pesticide-primed soil, when BPS are exposed to expected less favorable environmental conditions like cold periods, drought periods, and periods without a pesticide supply. Therefore, the response of microbiota mineralizing the herbicide linuron in BPS microcosm setups inoculated either with a linuron-primed soil or a nonprimed soil to a sequence of such less favorable conditions was examined. A period without linuron supply or a drought period reduced the size of the linuron-mineralizing community in both setups. The most severe effect was recorded for the setup containing nonprimed soil, in which stopping the linuron supply decreased the linuron degradation capacity to nondetectable levels. In both systems, linuron mineralization rapidly reestablished after conventional operation conditions were restored. A cold period and feeding with a pesticide mixture did not affect linuron mineralization. The changes in the linuron-mineralizing capacity in microcosms containing primed soil were associated with the dynamics of a particular Variovorax phylotype that previously had been associated with linuron mineralization. This study suggests that the pesticide-mineralizing community in BPS is robust in stress situations imposed by changes in environmental conditions expected to occur on farms. Moreover, it suggests that, in cases where effects do occur, recovery is rapid after restoring conventional operation conditions."

After quantification of toluene degradation rates in soil, DNA was extracted from soil incubated with H(2)(18)O, H(2)(16)O, H(2)(16)O and 48 ppm toluene, or H(2)(18)O and 48 ppm toluene. A single DNA band formed along a cesium chloride gradient after isopycnic centrifugation of extracts from soils incubated with H(2)(16)O. With extracts from soils to which only H(2)(18)O was added, two distinct DNA bands formed, while three bands formed when DNA extracted from soil incubated with both H(2)(18)O and toluene was analyzed. We suggest that this third band formed because toluene does not contain any oxygen atoms and toluene-degrading organisms had to transfer oxygen atoms from H(2)(18)O into metabolic intermediates to form nucleic acids de novo. We extracted the third DNA band and amplified a large fraction of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Direct sequencing of the PCR product obtained from the labeled DNA, as well as cloned 16S rRNA amplicons, identified a known toluene degrader, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. A toluene-degrading bacterial strain was subsequently isolated from soil and shown to be Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the abundance of the 16S rRNA gene of Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 increased in soil after toluene exposure but not in soils from which toluene was withheld. This study indicates that H(2)(18)O DNA-SIP can be a useful method for identifying pollutant-degrading bacteria in soil."

Bacillus species were firstly isolated from the composting. Based on temperature changes, the temporal-spatial characteristics of total culturable Bacillus were remarkable that the number of the culturable Bacillus detected at the high-temperature stage was the highest in each layer of the pile and that detected in the middle layer was the lowest at each stage of composting respectively. The diversity of cultivated Bacillus species isolated from different composting stages was low. A total of 540 isolates were classified by the RFLP method and partial 16S rDNA sequences. They affiliated to eight species including Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus circulans. The predominant species was B. subtilis, and the diversity of culturable Bacillus isolated in the middle-level samples at temperature rising and cooling stages was the highest. The DGGE profile and clone library analysis revealed that the temporal-spatial distribution of Bacillus community was not obvious, species belonging to the Bacillus were dominant (67%) with unculturable bacteria and B. cereus was the second major culturable Bacillus species. This study indicated that a combination of culture and culture-independent approaches could be very useful for monitoring the diversity and temporal-spatial distribution of Bacillus community during the composting process."

The 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences of the VN-actinomycetes were analyzed using BLAST searches. The results showed that these isolates belonged to 53 genera distributed among 21 families. Approximately 90% of these strains were members of three families: Streptomycetaceae (1087 strains, 58%); Micromonosporaceae (516 strains, 27%); and Streptosporangiaceae (89 strains, 5%). Motile actinomycetes of the genera Actinoplanes, Kineosporia and Cryptosporangium, which have quite common morphological characteristics, were frequently isolated from leaf-litter samples using the RC method. It is possible that these three genera acquired common properties during a process of convergent evolution. By contrast, strains belonging to the suborder Streptosporangineae were exclusively isolated from soils. A comparison of the sampling sites revealed no significant difference in taxonomic diversity between these sites. Among the non-streptomycetes, 156 strains (19%) were considered as new taxa distributed into 21 genera belonging to 12 families.

Constitutive or transient RNAi effects in plants have been achieved via generating stable transformants expressing dsRNAs or artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) in planta or by viral-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Although these tools provide outstanding resources for functional genomics, they require generation of vectors expressing dsRNAs or amiRNAs against targeted genes, transformation and propagation of transformed plants, or maintenance of multiple VIGS lines and thus impose time, labor, and space requirements. As we showed recently, these limitations can be circumvented by inducing RNAi effects in protoplasts via transfecting them with in vitro-synthesized dsRNAs.

Here, we describe a comparative analysis of microbial communities from three adjacent agricultural fields: one-century-old paddy field (OP) and two vegetable fields (new vegetable field (NV) and old vegetable field (OV)) that were established on traditional paddy fields 10 and 100 years ago, respectively. Soil chemical and physical analysis showed that both vegetable fields were more nutrient rich than the paddy field in terms of organic C, total N, total P, and available K. The vegetable fields possessed relatively higher abundance of culturable bacteria, fungi, and specific groups of bacteria (Actinomyces, nitrifying bacteria, and cellulose-decomposing bacteria) but lower levels of microbial biomass C and N. Notably, the decrease of biomass was further confirmed by analysis of seven additional soils in chronosequence sampled from the same area. Next we examined the metabolic diversity of the microbial community using the EcoPlate(TM) system from Biolog Inc. (Hayward, CA, USA). The utilization patterns of 31 unique C substrates (i.e., community-level physiological profile) showed that microorganisms in vegetable soil and paddy soil prefer to use different C substrates (polymeric compounds for NV and OV soils, phenolic acids for OP soil). Principal component analysis and the average well color development data showed that the NV is metabolically more distinct from the OV and OP. The effect was likely attributable to the elevated soil pH in NV soil. Furthermore, we assessed the diversity of soil bacterial populations using the cultivation-independent technology of amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Results showed that levels of bacterial diversity in OP and NV soils were similar (Shannon's diversity index H = 4.83 and 4.79, respectively), whereas bacteria in OV soil have the lowest score of diversity (H = 3.48). The low level of bacterial diversity in OV soil was supported by sequencing of ten randomly selected 16S rDNA clones from each of the three rDNA libraries. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the ten OV clones belonged to Proteobacteria with eight in the gamma-subdivision and two in the alpha-subdivision. In contrast, the ten clones from NV and OP soils were classified into four and eight bacterial classes or unclassified groups, respectively. Taken together, our data suggest that land-use change from rice to vegetables resulted in a decrease of bacterial diversity and soil biomass despite an increase in the abundance of culturable microorganisms and, moreover, the decrease of bacterial diversity occurred during long-term rather than short-term vegetable cultivation."

The objective was to identify changes in microbial assemblages in response to cropping sequences that can play a role in managing soilborne plant pathogens in peanut. Four peanut-cropping sequences were sampled at the Wiregrass Research Station, Headland, AL in 2006 and 2007, including continuous peanut, 4 years of bahiagrass followed by peanut, peanut-cotton, and peanut-corn-cotton. Soil sampling was done at early and mid-season and at harvest. Bacterial community structure was assessed using ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA) combined with 16S rRNA cloning and sequencing. RISA results indicated &gt;70% dissimilarities among different cropping sequences. However, 90% similarities were noticed among replicated plots of the same cropping sequences. Cropping sequences and time of soil sampling had considerable effect on soil microbial community structure. Bahiagrass rotation with peanut was found to have the highest bacterial diversity, as indicated by a high Shannon Weaver Diversity index. Overall, higher bacterial diversity was observed with bahiagrass and corn rotations compared with continuous peanut. The bacterial divisions Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinomycetes were the predominant bacterial phyla found in all peanut-cropping sequences. The Proteobacteria taxa in these soils were negatively correlated with the abundance of members of division Firmicutes but, conversely, had a significant positive correlation with Gemmatimonadetes taxa. The prevalence of the division Actinomycetes was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of members of division Verrucomicrobia.

Typically, the two layers are seeded with individual mycelial inoculants representing a single genotype of A. bisporus. Studies aimed at examining the potential of this fungal species as a heterologous protein expression system have revealed unexpected contributions of the mycelial inoculants in the morphogenesis of the fruiting body. These contributions were elucidated using a dual-inoculant method whereby the two layers were differientially inoculated with transgenic β-glucuronidase (GUS) and wild-type (WT) lines. Surprisingly, use of a transgenic GUS line in the lower substrate and a WT line in the upper substrate yielded fruiting bodies expressing GUS activity while lacking the GUS transgene. Results of PCR and RT-PCR analyses for the GUS transgene and RNA transcript, respectively, suggested translocation of the GUS protein from the transgenic mycelium colonizing the lower layer into the fruiting body that developed exclusively from WT mycelium colonizing the upper layer. Effective translocation of the GUS protein depended on the use of a transgenic line in the lower layer in which the GUS gene was controlled by a vegetative mycelium-active promoter (laccase 2 and β-actin), rather than a fruiting body-active promoter (hydrophobin A). GUS-expressing fruiting bodies lacking the GUS gene had a bonafide WT genotype, confirmed by the absence of stably inherited GUS and hygromycin phosphotransferase selectable marker activities in their derived basidiospores and mycelial tissue cultures. Differientially inoculating the two substrate layers with individual lines carrying the GUS gene controlled by different tissue-preferred promoters resulted in up to a ∼3.5-fold increase in GUS activity over that obtained with a single inoculant. Our findings support the existence of a previously undescribed phenomenon of long-distance protein translocation in A. bisporus that has potential application in recombinant protein expression and biotechnological approaches for crop improvement."

This method combines well-controlled amplification with TRFLP analysis to quantify relative taxon abundance in amplicon pools of FAM-labeled PCR products, using the intercalating dye EvaGreen to monitor amplification. Method accuracy was evaluated using mixtures of cloned 16S rRNA genes, DNA extracted from low- and high-G+C bacterial isolates (Escherichia coli, Rhodococcus, Variovorax, and Microbacterium), and DNA from soil microcosms amended with known amounts of genomic DNA from bacterial isolates.

Effects of CTC on the quantities of bacteria, with a comparison to the traditional composting (TC) method, were explored by plate count with incubation at 30, 40 and 50°C, respectively, and by quantitative PCR targeting the universal bacterial 16S rRNA genes and the Bacillus 16S rRNA genes. The comparison of cultivatable or uncultivatable bacterial numbers indicated that CTC might have increased the biomass of bacteria, especially Bacillus spp., during the composting. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis was employed to investigate the effects of CTC on bacterial diversity, and a community dominated by fewer species was detected in a typical CTC run. The analysis of sequence and phylogeny based on DGGE indicated that the continuously high temperature had changed the structure of bacterial community and strengthened the mainstay role of the thermophilic and spore-forming Bacillus spp. in CTC run."

However, how beneficial soil microbes, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in particular, respond to the PFM practice is not known. Here, a field experiment was performed to study the effects of a 3-month short-term PFM practice on AM fungi in plots planted with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Dingxi-2) in the Loess Plateau. AM colonization, spore density, wheat spike weight, and grain phosphorus (P) content were significantly increased in the PFM treatments, and these changes were mainly attributable to changes in soil properties such as available P and soil moisture. Alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly higher in PFM soils, but levels of AM fungal-related glomalin were similar between treatments. A total of nine AM fungal phylotypes were detected in root samples based on AM fungal SSU rDNA analyses, with six and five phylotypes in PFM and no-PFM plots, respectively. Although AM fungal phylotype richness was not statistically different between treatments, the community compositions were different, with four and three specific phylotypes in the PFM and no-PFM plots, respectively. A significant and rapid change in AM fungal, wheat, and soil variables following PFM suggested that the functioning of the AM symbiosis had been changed in the wheat field under PFM. Future studies are needed to investigate whether PFM applied over a longer term has a similar effect on the AM fungal community and their functioning in an agricultural ecosystem."

In addition, changes in the bacterial communities were related to the different phases of hydrocarbon degradation, and the removal efficiency of PAH was similar in both switching and permanent oxic conditions. This methodology could be useful for an alternative solution of oil sludge treatment with a low-cost processing, as its efficiency is similar to that of a permanent oxic incubation which is more expensive in oxygen supply."

In silico and pure culture studies showed that the primers matched perfectly with target sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of representatives of the genus Verrucosispora. The primers, designated S-G-Verr-0195-a-S-20 and S-G-Verr-1152-a-A-18, amplified an ≈960 bp stretch of the 16S rRNA genes of Verrucosispora strains but not those of representatives of other genera classified in the family Micromonosporaceae.

Phylogenetic analysis of over 40% of clones derived from five of the samples indicated they belonged to novel Verrucosispora species. The primers were also used to confirm the identity of Verrucosispora-like strains isolated from two of the environmental samples. The primers can be used to facilitate the isolation of novel Verrucosispora strains by allowing prescreening of environmental samples and the subsequent identification of verrucosisporae on selective isolation plates.

These include numerous ecologically and economically relevant species and the participating fungal symbionts are predominantly filamentous basidiomycetes. In natural ecosystems the plant nutrient uptake from soil takes place via the extraradical mycelia of these ECM mycosimbionts as a trade for plant photosyntates. The symbiotic phase in the life cycle of ECM basidiomycetes is the dikaryotic hyphae. Therefore, studies on symbiotic relevant gene functions require the inactivation of both gene copies in these dikaryotic fungi. RNA silencing is a eukaryotic sequence homology-dependent degradation of target RNAs which is believed to have evolved as a protection mechanism against invading nucleic acids. In different eukaryotic organisms, including fungi, the RNA silencing pathway can be artificially triggered to target and degrade gene transcripts of interest, resulting in gene knock-down. Most importantly, RNA silencing can act at the cytosolic level affecting mRNAs originating from several gene copies and different nuclei thus offering an efficient means of altering gene expression in dikaryotic organisms. Therefore, the pHg/pSILBAγ silencing vector was constructed for efficient RNA silencing triggering in the model mycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor. This cloning vector carries the Agaricus bisporus gpdII-promoter, two multiple cloning sites separated by a L. bicolor nitrate reductase intron and the Aspergillus nidulans trpC terminator. pSILBAγ allows an easy two-step PCR-cloning of hairpin sequences to be expressed in basidiomycetes. With one further cloning step into pHg, a pCAMBIA1300-based binary vector carrying a hygromycin resistance cassette, makes the pHg/pSILBAγ plasmid compatible with Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The pHg/pSILBAγ-system results in predominantly single integrations of RNA silencing triggering T-DNAs in the fungal genome and the integration sites of the transgenes can be resolved by plasmid rescue. Besides the optimized use in L. bicolor, general consideration was taken to build a vector system with maximum compatibility with other homobasidiomycetes and different transformation techniques."

(J Appl Microbiol, 108, 2010, 25). Among the primer pairs assessed, the Az16S-A pair designed on the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed the highest genus specificity: it successfully yielded a single amplicon of the expected size in all the 12 Azospirillum strains and for a close relative, Rhodocista centenaria. The PCR with the Az16S-A primers generated a detectable amount of the amplicon from ≥10³ CFU ml⁻¹ of Azospirillum cell suspensions even in the presence of contaminants and accurately discriminated Azospirillum and non-Azospirillum species in both 35 Azospirillum-like and 70 unknown isolates from plant roots and rhizosphere soils.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a rapid and simple PCR method for detecting and identifying Azospirillum isolates within populations of rhizosphere bacteria.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The method developed would serve as a useful tool for isolating a variety of indigenous Azospirillum bacteria from agricultural samples."

Because of its wide applications and relative stability in the natural environment TBP poses the problem of pollution and health hazards. In the present study, fifteen potent bacterial strains capable of using tributyl phosphate (TBP) as sole carbon and phosphorus source were isolated from enrichment cultures. These isolates were identified on the basis of biochemical and morphological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that two isolates belonged to class Bacilli and thirteen to β and γ-Proteobacteria. All these isolates were found to be members of genera Alcaligenes, Providencia, Delftia, Ralstonia, and Bacillus. These isolates were able to tolerate and degrade up to 5 mM TBP, the highest concentration reported to date. The GC-MS method was developed to monitor TBP degradation. Two strains, Providencia sp. BGW4 and Delftia sp. BGW1 showed respectively, 61.0 ± 2.8% and 57.0 ± 2.0% TBP degradation within 4 days. The degradation rate constants, calculated by first order kinetic model were between 0.0024 and 0.0099 h(-1).

Therefore, efforts to prevent the overgrowth of fast-growing species are necessary to isolate novel cellulase-producing strains. In this study, we developed a simple culture method for isolating hitherto-uncultured microbes that possess cellulase activity, particularly exocellulase. In this method, the microbial source (a forest soil) was suspended in sterilized water and inoculated onto a mineral salts agar medium, which was then overlaid with filter paper to sandwich the microbial suspension between the agar surface and paper. The filter paper fibers served to immobilize the microbial cells and were the dominant carbon source. Following cultivation at 30°C for 2 weeks, emerging colonies were isolated based on their morphology and were then subjected to phylogenetic and enzyme analyses. Using this method, 2,150 CFUs/g dry soil were obtained, and the ratio of fungal to bacterial isolates was approximately 4:1. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that most fungal and bacterial isolates belong to ten and two genera, respectively. Notably, all isolates possessed exocellulase activity, and several strains showed strong activity that was comparable to Trichoderma cellulase. Many isolates also exhibited cellulase and xylanase activity, and several strains possessed laccase activity.

In this method, the sole substrate naphthalene is dosed passively via gaseous phase to liquid medium and the detection of growth is based on the automated measurement of turbidity using an absorbance reader. The performance of the new method was evaluated by comparison with a recently introduced method in which the substrate is dissolved in inert silicone oil and added individually to each well, and the results are scored visually using a respiration indicator dye. Oil-contaminated industrial soil showed slightly but significantly higher MPN estimate with our method than with the reference method. This suggests that gaseous naphthalene was dissolved in an adequate concentration to support the growth of naphthalene degraders without being too toxic. The dosing of substrate via gaseous phase notably reduced the work load and risk of contamination. The result scoring by absorbance measurement was objective and more reliable than measurement with indicator dye, and it also enabled further analysis of cultures. Several bacterial genera were identified by cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from the MPN wells incubated in the presence of gaseous naphthalene. In addition, the applicability of the simplified MPN method was demonstrated by a significant positive correlation between the level of oil contamination and the number of naphthalene degraders detected in soil."

The DI101 strain was able to completely degrade 50 mg/l diazinon in MSM within 11 days with a degradation rate of 0.226 day-1. The inoculation of sterilized soil treated with 100 mg/kg of diazinon with 10(6) CFU/g DI101 resulted in a faster degradation rate than was recorded in non-sterilized soil.

Most analyses of soil biodiversity and function assume that the DNA extracted represents the microbial community in the soil, but subsequent interpretations are limited by the DNA recovered from the soil. Unfortunately, extraction methods do not provide a uniform and unbiased subsample of metagenomic DNA, and as a consequence, accurate species distributions cannot be determined. Moreover, any bias will propagate errors in estimations of overall microbial diversity and may exclude some microbial classes from study and exploitation. To improve metagenomic approaches, investigate DNA extraction biases, and provide tools for assessing the relative abundances of different groups, we explored the biodiversity of the accessible community DNA by fractioning the metagenomic DNA as a function of (i) vertical soil sampling, (ii) density gradients (cell separation), (iii) cell lysis stringency, and (iv) DNA fragment size distribution. Each fraction had a unique genetic diversity, with different predominant and rare species (based on ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis [RISA] fingerprinting and phylochips). All fractions contributed to the number of bacterial groups uncovered in the metagenome, thus increasing the DNA pool for further applications. Indeed, we were able to access a more genetically diverse proportion of the metagenome (a gain of more than 80% compared to the best single extraction method), limit the predominance of a few genomes, and increase the species richness per sequencing effort.

Based on the differences found in the marker gene sequences and the whole genomes of these strains, we propose two novel subspecies, designated B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum subsp. nov., with the type strain FZB42(T) ( = DSM 23117(T) = BGSC 10A6(T)), and B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. amyloliquefaciens subsp. nov., with the type strain DSM 7(T)( = ATCC 23350(T) = Fukumoto Strain F(T)), for plant-associated and non-plant-associated representatives, respecitvely. This is in agreement with results of DDH and M-CGH tests and the MALDI-TOF MS of cellular components, all of which suggested that the ecovars represent two different subspecies."

Two regions of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene were considered as molecular target. The pyrosequencing produced a total of 10924 sequences: 6799 from the first and 4125 from the second target region. Among these sequences, 3189 and 1003 were selected to generate operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and to evaluate the AMF community richness and similarity: 117 (37 of which were singletons) and 28 (nine of which were singletons) unique AMF OTUs were detected respectively. Within the Glomeromycota OTUs, those belonging to the Glomerales order were dominant in all the soils. Diversisporales OTUs were always detected, even though less frequently, while Archaeosporales and Paraglomerales OTUs were exclusive of the pasture soil. Eleven OTUs were shared by all the soils, but each of the five AMF communities showed particular features, suggesting a meaningful dissimilarity among the Glomeromycota populations. The environments with low inputs (pasture and covered vineyard) showed a higher AMF biodiversity than those subjected to human input (managed meadow and tilled vineyard). A reduction in AMF was found in the cork-oak formation because other mycorrhizal fungal species, more likely associated to trees and shrubs, were detected. These findings reinforce the view that AMF biodiversity is influenced by both human input and ecological traits, illustrating a gradient of AMF communities which mirror the land-use gradient. The high number of sequences obtained by the pyrosequencing strategy has provided detailed information on the soil AMF assemblages, thus offering a source of light to shine on this crucial soil microbial group."

Prior to this study, only two other Paenibacillus species (Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 and Paenibacillus larvae) have been sequenced. However, no genomic data is available on the Paenibacillus species with pattern-forming and complex social motility. Here we report the de novo genome sequence of this Gram-positive, soil-dwelling, sporulating bacterium.RESULTS: The complete P. vortex genome was sequenced by a hybrid approach using 454 Life Sciences and Illumina, achieving a total of 289× coverage, with 99.8% sequence identity between the two methods. The sequencing results were validated using a custom designed Agilent microarray expression chip which represented the coding and the non-coding regions. Analysis of the P. vortex genome revealed 6,437 open reading frames (ORFs) and 73 non-coding RNA genes. Comparative genomic analysis with 500 complete bacterial genomes revealed exceptionally high number of two-component system (TCS) genes, transcription factors (TFs), transport and defense related genes. Additionally, we have identified genes involved in the production of antimicrobial compounds and extracellular degrading enzymes.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that P. vortex has advanced faculties to perceive and react to a wide range of signaling molecules and environmental conditions, which could be associated with its ability to reconfigure and replicate complex colony architectures. Additionally, P. vortex is likely to serve as a rich source of genes important for agricultural, medical and industrial applications and it has the potential to advance the study of social microbiology within Gram-positive bacteria."

The present study determined the effects of polymerase, template dilution and PCR cycle number using the Solexa platform.RESULTS: The PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Stratagene) with higher fidelity showed lower amount of PCR artifacts and determined lower taxa richness than the Ex Taq (Takara). More importantly, the two polymerases showed different efficiencies for amplifying some of very abundant sequences, and determined significantly different community structures. As expected, the dilution of the DNA template resulted in a reduced estimation of taxa richness, particularly at the 200 fold dilution level, but the community structures were similar for all dilution levels. The 30 cycle group increased the PCR artifacts while comparing to the 25 cycle group, but the determined taxa richness was lower than that of the 25 cycle group. The PCR cycle number did not changed the microbial community structure significantly.CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the PCR conditions, particularly the polymerase, have significant effect on the analysis of microbial diversity with next generation sequencing methods."

The &quot;uncultivable&quot; microbial majority arguably represents our planet's largest unexplored pool of biological and chemical novelty. Previously we showed that species from this pool could be grown inside diffusion chambers incubated in situ, likely because diffusion provides microorganisms with their naturally occurring growth factors. Here we utilize this approach and develop a novel high-throughput platform for parallel cultivation and isolation of previously uncultivated microbial species from a variety of environments. We have designed and tested an isolation chip (ichip) composed of several hundred miniature diffusion chambers, each inoculated with a single environmental cell. We show that microbial recovery in the ichip exceeds manyfold that afforded by standard cultivation, and the grown species are of significant phylogenetic novelty.

Transmission of pathogenic Leptospira to humans mostly occurs through abraded skin or mucosal surfaces after direct or indirect contact with infected animals or contaminated soil or water. The spirochete then spreads hematogenously, resulting in multi-organ failure and death in severe cases. Previous DNA microarray studies have identified differentially expressed genes required for adaptation to temperature and osmolarity conditions inside the host compared to those of the environment.RESULTS: In order to identify genes involved in survival in the early spirochetemic phase of infection, we performed a transcriptional analysis of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni upon exposure to serum in comparison with EMJH medium. One hundred and sixty-eight genes were found to be differentially expressed, of which 55 were up-regulated and 113 were down-regulated. Genes of known or predicted function accounted for 54.5 and 45.1% of up- and down-regulated genes, respectively. Most of the differentially expressed genes were predicted to be involved in transcriptional regulation, translational process, two-component signal transduction systems, cell or membrane biogenesis, and metabolic pathways.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed global transcriptional changes of pathogenic Leptospira upon exposure to serum, representing a specific host environmental cue present in the bloodstream. The presence of serum led to a distinct pattern of gene expression in comparison to those of previous single-stimulus microarray studies on the effect of temperature and osmolarity upshift. The results provide insights into the pathogenesis of leptospirosis during the early bacteremic phase of infection."

Although these studies have advanced knowledge on human intestinal microflora, it is imperative that new methods are applied to facilitate scientific progress. Culture-independent molecular fingerprinting method of Polymerase Chain Reaction and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) has been used to study microbial communities in a variety of environmental samples. However, these protocols must be optimized prior to their application in order to enhance the quality and accuracy of downstream analyses. In this study, the relative efficacy of four commercial DNA extraction kits (Mobio Ultra Clean(R) Fecal DNA Isolation Kit, M; QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit, Q; FastDNA SPIN Kit, FSp; FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil, FSo) were evaluated. Further, PCR-DGGE technique was also assessed for its feasibility in detecting differences in human intestinal bacterial fingerprint profiles.METHOD: Total DNA was extracted from varying weights of human fecal specimens using four different kits, followed by PCR amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, and DGGE separation of the amplicons.RESULTS: Regardless of kit, maximum DNA yield was obtained using 10 to 50 mg (wet wt) of fecal specimens and similar DGGE profiles were obtained. However, kits FSp and FSo extracted significantly larger amounts of DNA per g dry fecal specimens and produced more bands on their DGGE profiles than kits M and Q due to their use of bead-containing lysing matrix and vigorous shaking step. DGGE of 16S rRNA gene PCR products was suitable for capturing the profiles of human intestinal microbial community and enabled rapid comparative assessment of inter- and intra-subject differences.CONCLUSION: We conclude that extraction kits that incorporated bead-containing lysing matrix and vigorous shaking produced high quality DNA from human fecal specimens (10 to 50 mg, wet wt) that can be resolved as bacterial community fingerprints using PCR-DGGE technique. Subsequently, PCR-DGGE technique can be applied for studying variations in human intestinal microbial communities."

Although the bacteria of cattle feces have been well characterized using culture-based and culture-independent methods, techniques have been lacking to correlate total community composition with community function. We used high throughput sequencing of total DNA extracted from fecal material to characterize general community composition and examine the repertoire of microbial genes present in beef cattle feces, including genes associated with antibiotic resistance and bacterial virulence. Results suggest that traditional 16S sequencing using &quot;universal&quot; primers to generate full-length sequence may under represent Acitinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Over eight percent (8.4%) of the sequences from our beef cattle fecal pool sample could be categorized as virulence genes, including a suite of genes associated with resistance to antibiotic and toxic compounds (RATC). This is a higher proportion of virulence genes found in Sargasso sea, chicken cecum, and cow rumen samples, but comparable to the proportion found in Antarctic marine derived lake, human fecal, and farm soil samples. The quantitative nature of metagenomic data, combined with the large number of RATC classes represented in samples from widely different habitats indicates that metagenomic data can be used to track relative amounts of antibiotic resistance genes in individual animals over time. Consequently, these data can be used to generate sample-specific and temporal antibiotic resistance gene profiles to facilitate an understanding of the ecology of the microbial communities in each habitat as well as the epidemiology of antibiotic resistant gene transport between and among habitats."

In the past few years, a growing number of regulatory RNA elements have been predicted by computational methods, mostly in well-studied gamma-proteobacteria but lately in several alpha-proteobacteria as well. Here, we have compared an extensive compilation of these non-coding RNA predictions to intergenic expression data of a whole-genome high-resolution tiling array in the soil-dwelling alpha-proteobacterium Rhizobium etli.RESULTS: Expression of 89 candidate ncRNAs was detected, both on the chromosome and on the six megaplasmids encompassing the R. etli genome. Of these, 11 correspond to functionally well characterized ncRNAs, 12 were previously identified in other alpha-proteobacteria but are as yet uncharacterized and 66 were computationally predicted earlier but had not been experimentally identified and were therefore classified as novel ncRNAs. The latter comprise 17 putative sRNAs and 49 putative cis-regulatory ncRNAs. A selection of these candidate ncRNAs was validated by RT-qPCR, Northern blotting and 5' RACE, confirming the existence of 4 ncRNAs. Interestingly, individual transcript levels of numerous ncRNAs varied during free-living growth and during interaction with the eukaryotic host plant, pointing to possible ncRNA-dependent regulation of these specialized processes.CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the practical value of previous ncRNA prediction algorithms and significantly expand the list of candidate ncRNAs encoded in the intergenic regions of R. etli and, by extension, of alpha-proteobacteria. Moreover, we show high-resolution tiling arrays to be suitable tools for studying intergenic ncRNA transcription profiles across the genome. The differential expression levels of some of these ncRNAs may indicate a role in adaptation to changing environmental conditions."

These bacteria appear to thrive in anoxic environments, such as marine sediments, hypersaline deep sea, freshwater lakes, aquifers, flooded paddy soils and methanogenic bioreactors. The 16S rRNA phylogeny suggests that OP3 belongs to the Planctomycetes/Verrucomicrobia/Chlamydiae (PVC) superphylum. Metagenomic fosmid libraries were constructed from flooded paddy soil and screened for 16S rRNA gene-containing fragments affiliated with the PVC superphylum. The screening of 63 000 clones resulted in 23 assay-positive fosmids, of which three clones were affiliated with OP3. The 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence between the fragments OP3/1, OP3/2 and OP3/3 ranges from 18% to 25%, indicating that they belong to different OP3 subdivisions. The 23S rRNA phylogeny confirmed the membership of OP3 in the PVC superphylum. Sequencing the OP3 fragments resulted in a total of 105 kb of genomic information and 90 ORFs, of which 47 could be assigned a putative function and 11 were conserved hypothetical. Using BLASTP searches, a high proportion of ORFs had best matches to homologues from Deltaproteobacteria, rather than to those of members of the PVC superphylum. On the fragment OP3/3, a cluster of nine ORFs was predicted to encode the bacterial NADH dehydrogenase I. Given the high proportion of homologues present in deltaproteobacteria and anoxic conditions in the natural environment of OP3 bacteria, the detection of NADH dehydrogenase I may suggest an anaerobic respiration mode. Oligonucleotide frequencies calculated for OP3/1, OP3/2 and OP/3 show high intraphylum correlations. This novel sequence information could therefore be used to identify OP3-related fragments in large metagenomic data sets using marker gene-independent procedures in the future. In addition to the OP3 fragments, a single metagenomic fragment affiliated with the candidate division BRC1 was obtained and analysed."

Secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, have been isolated from different Streptomyces species. The production of these metabolites depends on the culture conditions. Therefore, the development of a new culture method can facilitate the discovery of new natural products. Here, we show that mycolic acid-containing bacteria can influence the biosynthesis of cryptic natural products in Streptomyces species. The production of red pigment by Streptomyces lividans TK23 was induced by coculture with Tsukamurella pulmonis TP-B0596, which is a mycolic acid-containing bacterium. Only living cells induced this pigment production, which was not mediated by any substances. T. pulmonis could induce natural-product synthesis in other Streptomyces strains too: it altered natural-product biosynthesis in 88.4% of the Streptomyces strains isolated from soil. The other mycolic acid-containing bacteria, Rhodococcus erythropolis and Corynebacterium glutamicum, altered biosynthesis in 87.5 and 90.2% of the Streptomyces strains, respectively. The coculture broth of T. pulmonis and Streptomyces endus S-522 contained a novel antibiotic, which we named alchivemycin A. We concluded that the mycolic acid localized in the outer cell layer of the inducer bacterium influences secondary metabolism in Streptomyces, and this activity is a result of the direct interaction between the mycolic acid-containing bacteria and Streptomyces. We used these results to develop a new coculture method, called the combined-culture method, which facilitates the screening of natural products."

Paired oral swabs were taken from six adults of Guahibo ethnicity living in the community of Platanillal, Amazonas State, Venezuela. Replicate swabs were preserved in liquid nitrogen and in Aware Messenger fluid (Calypte). Buccal DNA was extracted, and the V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and pyrosequenced. A total of 17 214 oral bacterial sequences were obtained from the six subjects; these were binned into 1034 OTUs from 10 phyla, 30 families and 51 genera. The oral mucosa was highly dominated by four phyla: Firmicutes (mostly the genera Streptococcus and Veillonella), Proteobacteria (mostly Neisseria), Bacterioidetes (Prevotella) and Actinobacteria (Micrococcineae).

Here, we characterized bacterial diversity along two approximately parallel chronosequences in an Arctic glacier forefield that span six time points following glacier retreat. We assessed changes in phylotype richness, evenness and turnover rate through the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from 52 samples taken from surface layers along the chronosequences. An average of 4500 sequences was obtained from each sample by 454 pyrosequencing. Using parametric methods, it was estimated that bacterial phylotype richness was high, and that it increased significantly from an average of 4000 (at a threshold of 97% sequence similarity) at locations exposed for 5 years to an average of 7050 phylotypes per 0.5 g of soil at sites that had been exposed for 150 years. Phylotype evenness also increased over time, with an evenness of 0.74 for 150 years since glacier retreat reflecting large proportions of rare phylotypes. The bacterial species turnover rate was especially high between sites exposed for 5 and 19 years. The level of bacterial diversity present in this High Arctic glacier foreland was comparable with that found in temperate and tropical soils, raising the question whether global patterns of bacterial species diversity parallel that of plants and animals, which have been found to form a latitudinal gradient and be lower in polar regions compared with the tropics."

Remediation was achieved with a hydraulic flow control consisting of an inner loop, where ethanol was injected, and an outer loop for flow-field protection. This strategy reduced uranium concentrations in groundwater to levels below 0.126 μM and created geochemical gradients in electron donors from the inner-loop injection well toward the outer loop and downgradient flow path. Our analysis with 15 sediment samples from the entire test area found significant indicator species that showed a high degree of adaptation to the three different hydrochemical-created conditions.

Composting is also a method to produce fertilizer or soil conditioner. Tightened EU legislation now requires treatment of the continuously growing quantities of organic municipal waste before final disposal. However, some full-scale composting plants experience difficulties with the efficiency of biowaste degradation and with the emission of noxious odours. In this study we examine the bacterial species richness and community structure of an optimally working pilot-scale compost plant, as well as a full-scale composting plant experiencing typical problems. Bacterial species composition was determined by isolating total DNA followed by amplifying and sequencing the gene encoding the 16S ribosomal RNA.RESULTS: Over 1500 almost full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences were analysed and of these, over 500 were present only as singletons. Most of the sequences observed in either one or both of the composting processes studied here were similar to the bacterial species reported earlier in composts, including bacteria from the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus. In addition, a number of previously undetected bacterial phylotypes were observed. Statistical calculations estimated a total bacterial diversity of over 2000 different phylotypes in the studied composts.CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, locally enriched or evolved bacterial variants of familiar compost species were observed in both composts. A detailed comparison of the bacterial diversity revealed a large difference in composts at the species and strain level from the different composting plants. However, at the genus level, the difference was much smaller and illustrated a delay of the composting process in the full-scale, sub-optimally performing plants."

The dominant organisms were dark-septate (melanized fungi) ascomycetes belonging to Pleosporales. Effects of N enrichment on fungi were not evident at the community level; however the abundance of unique sequences, sampling intensity and temporal variations may be uncovering the effect of N in composition and diversity of fungal communities.

As DEPTHX descended, it generated a 3-D map based on the processing of range data from 54 onboard sonars. The vehicle collected water column samples and wall biomat samples throughout the depth profile of the cenote. Post-expedition sample analysis via comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed a wealth of microbial diversity. Traditional Sanger gene sequencing combined with a barcoded-amplicon pyrosequencing approach revealed novel, phylum-level lineages from the domains Bacteria and Archaea; in addition, several novel subphylum lineages were also identified. Overall, DEPTHX successfully navigated and mapped Zacatón, and collected biological samples based on an autonomous decision, which revealed novel microbial diversity in a previously unexplored environment."

The goal of this study is to monitor the survival of injected bacteria and reveal the response of microbial communities in field trial of microbial plugging through injection of selected microbial culture broth and nutrients. Culture-dependent enrichment and culture-independent 16S rDNA clone library methods were used. The results show that it was easy to activate targeted biopolymer-producing bacteria in a laboratory environment, and it was difficult for injected exogenous bacteria to survive. In addition, microbial communities in the oil reservoir also changed before and after the field trial. However, microbial communities, activated by fermentative medium for biopolymer-producing bacteria, appeared to show greater differences in the laboratory than in the natural reservoir.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of different forms of tillage and residue management on soil bacterial communities by using phylogenetic and multivariate analyses. Treatments involving zero tillage (ZT) and conventional tillage (CT) with their respective combinations of residue management, i.e., removed residue (-R) and kept residue (+R), and maize/wheat rotation, were selected from a long-term field trial started in 1991. Analysis of bacterial diversity showed that soils under zero tillage and crop residue retention (ZT/+R) had the highest levels of diversity and richness. Multivariate analysis showed that beneficial bacterial groups such as fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. and Burkholderiales were favored by residue retention (ZT/+R and CT/+R) and negatively affected by residue removal (ZT/-R). Zero-tillage treatments (ZT/+R and ZT/-R) had a positive effect on the Rhizobiales group, with its main representatives related to Methylosinus spp. known as methane-oxidizing bacteria. It can be concluded that practices that include reduced tillage and crop residue retention can be adopted as safer agricultural practices to preserve and improve the diversity of soil bacterial communities."

Molecular analysis (16S rRNA sequencing, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and a multiplex PCR method) established the genetic diversity of the isolates (n = 7), while physiological methods determined the metabolic capability and environmental fitness of the isolates, relative to those of laboratory strains, under the conditions tested. Genotypic analysis indicated that the leached isolates do not form a single genetic grouping but that multiple genotypic groups are capable of surviving and proliferating in this environment. In physiological studies, environmental isolates grew well across a broad range of temperatures and media, in comparison with the growth of laboratory strains. These findings suggest that certain E. coli strains may have the ability to colonize and adapt to soil conditions.

While the remediation effort has returned the site to within federal safety standards, it is unclear if this effort is sufficient to restore floral and faunal communities. Intrinsic to ecosystem and organism health is the biodiversity and composition of microbial communities. We have taken advantage of recent advances in sequencing technology and surveyed the bacterial community of remediated and reference soils as well as the intestinal microbial community of two ubiquitous rodent species to provide insight on the impacts of residual heavy metal contamination on the ecosystem. Rodents found on the remediated site had reduced body mass, smaller body size and lower body fat than animals on reference sites. Using bar-coded, massively parallel sequencing, we found that bacterial communities in both the soil and Peromyscus spp. gastrointestinal tracts had no difference in diversity between reference and remediated sites but assemblages differed in response to contamination. These results suggest that niche voids left by microbial taxa that were unable to deal with the remnant levels of heavy metals on remediated sites were replaced by taxa that could persist in this environment.

Overall, B, and to a lesser extent BM, stimulated microbial activity and biomass. The diminished effect of BM compared to B was particularly evident in fungi and Gram-negative bacteria and was attributed to rapid ITC release following the myrosinase treatment. PITC did not have a significant effect, whereas an inhibitory effect was observed in the MS-treated soil. DGGE analysis showed that the ASC community was temporarily altered by BIOF treatments and more persistently by the MS treatment, while the structure of the AOB community was not affected by the treatments. Cloning of the ASC community showed that MS application had a deleterious effect on potential plant pathogens like Fusarium, Nectria, and Cladosporium compared to BIOF treatments which did not appear to inhibit them.

ATR has been associated with defects in sexual development in animals, but studies on mammalian systems have failed to clearly identify a cellular target.OBJECTIVES: Our goal in this study was to identify a ligand-binding receptor for ATR in pituitary cells that may explain the mechanism of action at the gene expression level.METHODS: We used pituitary cells from postnatal day 7 male rats and pituitary cell lines to study the effect of ATR on gene expression of growth hormone (GH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (PRL) at RNA and protein levels. 14C-ATR was used to determine its specific binding to the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR). The effect of ATR on structural proteins was visualized using immunofluorescent in situ staining.RESULTS: The treatment of rat pituitary cells with ATR, at environmentally relevant concentrations (1 ppb and 1 ppm), resulted in a reduction of GH expression. This effect appeared to result from the inhibition of GH gene transcription due to ATR binding to the GHRHR of the pituitary cells.CONCLUSIONS: Identification of GHRHR as the target of ATR is consistent with the myriad effects previously reported for ATR in mammalian systems.

The electrokinetic process changes basic soil properties, but little is known about the impact of this remediation technology on indigenous soil microbial activities. This study reports on the effects of electrokinetic remediation on indigenous microbial activity and community within diesel contaminated soil. The main removal mechanism of diesel was electroosmosis and most of the bacteria were transported by electroosmosis. After 25 days of electrokinetic remediation (0.63 mA cm(-2)), soil pH developed from pH 3.5 near the anode to pH 10.8 near the cathode. The soil pH change by electrokinetics reduced microbial cell number and microbial diversity. Especially the number of culturable bacteria decreased significantly and only Bacillus and strains in Bacillales were found as culturable bacteria. The use of EDTA as an electrolyte seemed to have detrimental effects on the soil microbial activity, particularly in the soil near the cathode. On the other hand, the soil dehydrogenase activity was enhanced close to the anode and the analysis of microbial community structure showed the increase of several microbial populations after electrokinetics. It is thought that the main causes of changes in microbial activities were soil pH and direct electric current. The results described here suggest that the application of electrokinetics can be a promising soil remediation technology if soil parameters, electric current, and electrolyte are suitably controlled based on the understanding of interaction between electrokinetics, contaminants, and indigenous microbial community."

DNA and RNA were coextracted, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) was used to report changes in bacterial communities in response to the presence of the chlorophenol. The phylogenetic composition of the soil during degradation was determined by creating a clone library of amplified 16S rRNA sequences from both DNA and reverse-transcribed RNA from exposed soil. Resulting clones were sequenced, and putative identities were assigned.CONCLUSIONS: A significant difference between active (RNA-based) and total (DNA-based) bacterial community structure was observed for both T-RFLP and phylogenetic analyses in response to 2,4-DCP, with more pronounced changes seen in RNA-based communities. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the dominance of Proteobacteria in both profiles.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study describes the response of soil bacterial communities to the addition of the xenobiotic compound 2,4-DCP, and highlights the importance of including RNA-based 16S rRNA analysis to complement any molecular study in a perturbed soil."

To understand how the soil microbial community is influenced by the presence of cellulosic waste products, multiple soil samples were obtained from a nonradioactive model low-level-waste test pit at the Idaho National Laboratory. Samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and 16S rRNA gene microarray (PhyloChip) analyses. Both methods revealed changes in the bacterial community structure with depth. In all samples, the PhyloChip detected significantly more operational taxonomic units, and therefore relative diversity, than the clone libraries. Diversity indices suggest that diversity is lowest in the fill and fill-waste interface (FW) layers and greater in the wood waste and waste-clay interface layers. Principal-coordinate analysis and lineage-specific analysis determined that the Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria phyla account for most of the significant differences observed between the layers. The decreased diversity in the FW layer and increased members of families containing known cellulose-degrading microorganisms suggest that the FW layer is an enrichment environment for these organisms. These results suggest that the presence of the cellulosic material significantly influences the bacterial community structure in a stratified soil system."

In the bulk, rhizosphere, and rhizoplane fractions of the soil, the qualitative picture obtained by FISH analysis of the main phylogenetic bacterial groups was similar and was predominantly comprised of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. The arsenic-resistant isolates belonged to 13 genera, the most abundant being those of Bacillus, Achromobacter, Brevundimonas, Microbacterium, and Ochrobactrum. Most bacteria grew in the presence of high arsenic concentrations (over 100mM arsenate and 10mM arsenite). Most strains possessed the ArsC, ArsB and ACR3 genes homologous to arsenate reductase and to the two classes of arsenite efflux pumps, respectively, peculiar to the ars operon of the arsenic detoxification system. ArsB and ACR3 were present simultaneously in highly resistant strains. An inconsistency between 16S rRNA phylogenetic affiliations and the arsenate reductase sequences of the strains was observed, indicating possible horizontal transfer of arsenic resistance genes in the soil bacterial community. Several isolates were able to reduce arsenate and to oxidise arsenite. In particular, Ancylobacter dichloromethanicum strain As3-1b possessed both characteristics, and arsenite oxidation occurred in the strain also under chemoautotrophic conditions. Some rhizobacteria produced siderophores, indole acetic acid and 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase, thus possessing potential plant growth-promoting traits."

The soil bacteria communities were consistently different along the depth; however, Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes were predominant and methanotrophs were minor in both bacteria libraries (DGS1 and DGS2). Secondly, the numbers of methane-oxidizing bacteria, quantified using a culture-dependent procedure and culture-independent group-specific real-time PCR (RT-PCR), respectively, were inconsistent with a quantify variance of one or two orders of magnitude.

Finally, the diversity and distribution of methanotrophic communities in the soil samples were analyzed by constructing clone libraries of functional gene. All 508-bp inserts in clones phylogenetically belonged to the methanotrophic pmoA gene with similarities from 83% to 100%. However, most of the similarities were below 96%.

The accumulation of toxic NAs in tailings pond water (TPW) is of significant environmental concern, and phytoremediation using constructed wetlands is one remediation option being assessed. Since root-associated microorganisms are an important factor during phytoremediation of organic compounds, this study investigated the impact of NAs on the microbial communities associated with the macrophyte Typha latifolia (cattail). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that the impact of NAs on microbial communities was niche dependent, with endophytic communities being the most stable and bulk water communities being the least stable. The type of NA used was significant to microbial response, with commercial NAs causing greater adverse changes than TPW NAs. In general, plant beneficial bacteria such as diazotrophs were favoured in cattails grown in TPW NAs, while potentially deleterious bacteria such as denitrifying Dechlorospirillum species increased in commercial NA treatments. These findings suggest that NAs may affect plant health by impacting root-associated microbial communities. A better understanding of these impacts may allow researchers to optimize those microbial communities that support plant health, and thus further optimize wetland treatment systems."

This study examined the suitability of several cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent methods to assess potential microbial activities (sulfidogenesis and nitrate reduction) and the impact of nitrate amendment on oil field microbiota. Microcosms containing produced waters from two Western Canadian oil fields exhibited sulfidogenesis that was inhibited by nitrate amendment. Most probable number (MPN) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses of uncultivated produced waters showed low cell numbers (≤10(3) MPN/ml) dominated by SRB (&gt;95% relative abundance). MPN analysis also detected nitrate-reducing sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (NRSOB) and heterotrophic nitrate-reducing bacteria (HNRB) at numbers too low to be detected by FISH or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). In microcosms containing produced water fortified with sulfate, near-stoichiometric concentrations of sulfide were produced. FISH analyses of the microcosms after 55 days of incubation revealed that Gammaproteobacteria increased from undetectable levels to 5-20% abundance, resulting in a decreased proportion of Deltaproteobacteria (50-60% abundance). DGGE analysis confirmed the presence of Delta- and Gammaproteobacteria and also detected Bacteroidetes. When sulfate-fortified produced waters were amended with nitrate, sulfidogenesis was inhibited and Deltaproteobacteria decreased to levels undetectable by FISH, with a concomitant increase in Gammaproteobacteria from below detection to 50-60% abundance. DGGE analysis of these microcosms yielded sequences of Gamma- and Epsilonproteobacteria related to presumptive HNRB and NRSOB (Halomonas, Marinobacterium, Marinobacter, Pseudomonas and Arcobacter), thus supporting chemical data indicating that nitrate-reducing bacteria out-compete SRB when nitrate is added."

In general, their distribution was found to be unrelated to biogeographical location, although agricultural practice increased the overall diversity of Fusarium. Phylogenetic analyses were successfully used to identify morphologically similar isolates belonging to the F. avenaceum/F. acuminatum/F. tricinctum species complex and to resolve previously undetermined relationships amongst these species. Fifty-eight isolates classified as either F. avenaceum, F. acuminatum, or other closely related species as well as several well-characterised isolates from international culture collections were examined using DNA sequence data for β-tubulin (βTUB), translation elongation factor 1α (EF1α), and mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal RNA (mtSSU). Analyses of DNA sequence data from both βTUB and EF1α discriminated among isolates of F. avenaceum, F. acuminatum, and F. tricinctum and determined that these three distinct sequence groups formed a single clade. By contrast, mtSSU was unable to differentiate F. avenaceum from F. acuminatum and other closely related species believed to be F. tricinctum.

Chlorimuron-ethyl had a higher accumulation in test soils, and the accumulation decreased the CFU of soil bacteria and increased the CFU of soil fungi significantly. The CFU of soil actinomycetes only had a significant decrease in the plot having been received chlorimuron-ethyl for 10 years.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Under the long-term stress of chlorimuron-ethyl, the diversity and evenness of soil microbial community decreased, and more importantly, some bacterial and fungal species that possibly benefited soybean's growth, e.g., Acidobacteria, γ-proteobacteria, Cortinarius violaceu, Acarospora smaragdula, and Xerocomus chrysenteron decreased or demised, while some species that could induce the obstacle of soybean's continuous cropping, e.g., Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Phytophthora sojae, increased or appeared. Some actinomycetes were inhibited having negative effects on the antagonism between soil microbes. It is considered that due to the longer half-life of chlorimuron-ethyl in soil and the resistance and resilience of soil microbes to short-term environmental stress, long-term in situ investigation rather than laboratory microcosm test or short-term field experiment would be more appropriate to the accurate assessment of the ecological risk of long-term chlorimuron-ethyl application. Further studies should be made on the application mode and duration of chlorimuron-ethyl to reduce the possible ecological risk of applying this herbicide on continuously cropped soybean field."

The aim of this study was to isolate fungal antagonists, characterize their phylogenetic positions, determine their antagonistic activities against potato scab pathogens, and highlight their potential use as control agents under lower pH conditions. Fifteen fungal stains isolated from potato field soils were found to have antagonistic activity against three well-known potato scab pathogens: Streptomyces scabiei, Streptomyces acidiscabiei, and Streptomyces turgidiscabiei. These 15 fungal strains were phylogenetically classified into at least six orders and nine genera based on 18S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. These fungal isolates were related to members of the genera Penicillium, Eupenicillium, Chaetomium, Fusarium, Cladosporium, Mortierella, Kionochaeta, Pseudogymnoascus, and Lecythophora. The antagonistic activities of most of the fungal isolates were highly strengthened under the lower pH conditions, suggesting the advantage of combining their use with a traditional method such as soil acidification. This is the first report to demonstrate that phylogenetically diverse fungi show antagonistic activity against major potato scab pathogens.

The packing materials were sampled from two different depths at 3 sites. Estimated K(m) values were similar among depths at same sampling sites, while V(max) differed in the mid-point sample. The lower depth of this site had the highest V(max). A correspondence analysis showed the DGGE profile of ammonia-oxidizing bacterial amoA of the lower depth of the mid-point sample to be distinguishable from the others. Banding patterns at other sites were similar among depths. Banding patterns of ammonia-oxidizing archaeal amoA of the mid-point sample were also similar among depths. The results suggested an association between the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community's composition and ammonium oxidation kinetics in samples. Sequence analysis indicated that the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community mainly belonged to the Nitrosomonas europaea lineage and Nitrosospira cluster 3. The ammonia-oxidizing archaeal amoA-like sequences were related to those belonging to soil and sediment groups, including one with 84% nucleotide similarity with Nitrosopumilus maritimus."

The patient had no history of a recent tick-bite but displayed a positive serology for an advanced stage of Lyme borreliosis, which stood in contrast to the clinical manifestation of erythema migrans as a symptom of early Lyme disease. Three skin swabs and soil samples, collected in the area where the patient possibly acquired the infection, were examined by bacterial and fungal culture methods. Microorganisms were identified by using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics. The patient and soil isolates were compared by employing RAPD analysis. The serum samples of the patient were examined by immunoblotting. Arthrobacter mysorens, a soil bacterium, was isolated from the collected skin and soil samples. The identity of both isolates was determined by molecular fingerprinting methods. A. mysorens was proven to be causative for the erythema by direct isolation from the affected skin and a positive serology, thus explaining the atypical appearance of the erythema compared to erythema migrans caused by Borrelia infection.CONCLUSIONS: Infections with A. mysorens might be underreported and microbiological diagnostic techniques should be applied in cases of patients with unclear erythemas, resembling erythema migrans, without a history of tick bites."

Sialidase was produced when Oerskovia xanthineolytica YZ-2 was exposed to polysialogangliosides. The sialidase of Oerskovia xanthineolytica YZ-2 hydrolyzed sialic acid linkages in polysialogangliosides, and released monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1). The sialidase had the capability of product specificity because it did not attack the sialic acid linkage in GM1. Therefore, Oerskovia xanthineolytica YZ-2 was used for GM1 production from polysialogangliosides. In flasks cultivation phase, it was proved that Oerskovia xanthineolytica YZ-2 could convert polysialogangliosides to GM1 efficiently. Scaling-up the bioprocess with 8% crude ganglioside, polysialogangliosides was converted to GM1 by Oerskovia xanthineolytica YZ-2 in 30 L bioreactor after 18 h. The relative content of GM1 increased from 16.3% in crude ganglioside to 83.7% after Oerskovia xanthineolytica YZ-2 conversion. Therefore, a simple, large-scale conversion process for GM1 production from polysialogangliosides was achieved using Oerskovia xanthineolytica YZ-2 as a biocatalyst."

Sacc. is a main disease in citrus production. To develop an effective biocontrol measure against citrus postharvest anthracnose, we screened antagonistic microbes and obtained a bacterial strain 1404 from the rhizospheric soil of chili plants in Nanning city, Guangxi, China. The objectives of the present study were to: (1) identify and characterize the antagonistic bacterium; and (2) to evaluate the efficacy of the antagonistic strain in controlling citrus postharvest anthracnose disease.METHODS: Strain 1404 was identified by comparing its 16S rDNA sequence with related bacteria from GenBank database, as well as analyzing its morphological, physiological and biochemical characters. The antagonistic stability of the strain 1404 was determined by continuously transferring it on artificial media. The effect of the strain on suppressing citrus anthracnose at postharvest stage was tested by stab inoculation method.RESULTS: The 16S rDNA of strain 1404 was amplified with primers PF1 (5'-AGAGTTTGATCATGGCTCAG-3') and PR1 (5'-TACGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3') and its sequence submitted to GenBank (accession number: GU361113). Strain 1404 clustered with the GenBank-derived Brevibacillus brevis strains in the 16S-rDNA-sequence-based phylogenetic tree at 100% bootstrap level. The morphological traits, physiological and biochemical characters of strain 1404 agreed with that of Brevibacillus brevis. Less change in the suppressive ability of antagonist against growth of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was observed during four continuous transfers on artificial media.

Viral diseases are potentially significant threats to these crops. Therefore, identification of viruses infecting these bioenergy crops is important for quarantine purposes, virus resistance breeding, and production of virus-free planting materials. The application is described of sequence-independent amplification, for the identification of RNA viruses in bioenergy crops. The method involves virus partial purification from a small amount of infected leaf tissue (miniprep), extraction of viral RNA, amplification of randomly primed cDNAs, cloning, sequencing, and BLAST searches for sequence homology in the GenBank. This method has distinct advantage over other virus characterization techniques in that it does not require reagent specific to target viruses. Using this method, a possible new species was identified in the genus Marafivirus in switchgrass related to Maize rayado fino virus, its closest relative currently in GenBank. Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV), genus Potyvirus, was identified in M.xgiganteus, energycane, corn (Zea mays), and switchgrass.

The atrazine metabolites were detected after 20 days and were significantly higher in soils amended with the slurry at both 20 and 40 days after application of the herbicide. Respiration rates were elevated after 10 days in all soils with atrazine addition. Both the atrazine and slurry amendments altered the bacterial community structures, indicated by the appearance of specific bands in the DGGE gels after 10 days. Cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes from the DGGE gels showed that the bands represented various genera of beta-proteobacteria that appeared in response to atrazine. According to our results, further field studies are required to explain the lower effectiveness of atrazine in weed control. These studies may include the effect of dissolved organic carbon on the atrazine mobility."

Screening of EPS-producing yeasts and studies on the optimal culture composition are the main purpose of this study.METHODS: Yeasts were obtained by screening from natural samples using spread-plate method, Yield of EPS synthesized by yeasts was estimated by phenolsulfate acid method, Based on 5.8S rDNA sequence determination, three strains were identified and selected for the optimization of fermentative medium.RESULTS: 132 yeast strains were isolated from grapes, preserves and topsoil. Three yeast strains were proved to be as high exopolysaccharide-producing yeasts. The results of 5.8S rDNA sequence determination showed that similarities of two yeasts isolated from &quot;Zuoyouhong&quot; grape (Z14 and Z20) were over 99% compared with Issatchenkia orientalis, meanwhile another yeast L25 isolated from topsoil of Larix gmelini was identified as Cryptococcus humicolus, with the similarity of 98.8%. The optimal medium for strain Z20 for producing EPS was as followed: 8% glucose, 0.2% (NH4)SO4, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.1% yeast extract powder and 0.01% CaCl2. Under the condition of initial pH 6.0, 28 degrees C and 160 r/min for 4 d, yield of EPS could reach to 2.046 g/L, which was 79.9% higher than the control (1.137 g/L).CONCLUSION: Reports that yeasts belong to some genera possessed the abilities to synthesize EPS could be seen in some related references, according to the study, we could get the conclusion that yeasts belong to Issatchenkia can synthesize EPS and EPS yield of stain Z20 could be increased by changing culture composition."

So, for obtaining this fibrinolytic enzyme, we isolated fibrinolytic strains from frozen soil in the Tibetan Plateau.METHODS: We screened microbes hydrolyzing blood powder by blood powder (bovine) - agar plate, followed by detection of thrombolysis effect through thrombolytic test in vitro. After that, we detected and measured the fibrinolytic activity of those microbes screened above with fibrin plates. Finally, we classified and identified the fibrinolytic microbes by combining physiological and biochemical test and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis.RESULTS: We isolated a strain DR-536 from frozen soil at 4300 m altitude in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province. We found that the strain DR-536 not only hydrolyzed blood powder in the blood-agar plate, but also completely dissolved thrombus in vitro. We also found that strain DR-536 could hydrolyze fibrin, and the fibrinolytic activity was 51.80 IU/ml (with Urokinase as a standard).

Here, we used RNA-seq to comprehensively and quantitatively assess the transcriptional response of the bacterial opportunistic cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogen and endemic soil dweller, Burkholderia cenocepacia, in conditions mimicking these 2 environments. By sequencing 762 million bases of cDNA from 2 closely related B. cenocepacia strains (one isolated from a CF patient and one from soil), we identified a number of potential virulence factors expressed under CF-like conditions, whereas genes whose protein products are involved in nitrogen scavenging and 2-component sensing were among those induced under soil-like conditions. Interestingly, 13 new putative noncoding RNAs were discovered using this technique, 12 of which are preferentially induced in the soil environment, suggesting that ncRNAs play an important role in survival in the soil. In addition, we detected a surprisingly large number of regulatory differences between the 2 strains, which may represent specific adaptations to the niches from which each strain was isolated, despite their high degree of DNA sequence similarity. Compared with the CF strain, the soil strain shows a stronger global gene expression response to its environment, which is consistent with the need for a more dynamic reaction to the heterogeneous conditions of soil."

However, it is not yet clear how the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and, hence, species richness estimates determined using shorter fragments at different taxonomic cutoffs correlates with the number of OTUs assigned using longer, nearly complete 16S rRNA gene fragments. We constructed a 16S rRNA clone library from an undisturbed tallgrass prairie soil (1,132 clones) and used it to compare species richness estimates obtained using eight pyrosequencing candidate fragments (99 to 361 bp in length) and the nearly full-length fragment. Fragments encompassing the V1 and V2 (V1+V2) region and the V6 region (generated using primer pairs 8F-338R and 967F-1046R) overestimated species richness; fragments encompassing the V3, V7, and V7+V8 hypervariable regions (generated using primer pairs 338F-530R, 1046F-1220R, and 1046F-1392R) underestimated species richness; and fragments encompassing the V4, V5+V6, and V6+V7 regions (generated using primer pairs 530F-805R, 805F-1046R, and 967F-1220R) provided estimates comparable to those obtained with the nearly full-length fragment. These patterns were observed regardless of the alignment method utilized or the parameter used to gauge comparative levels of species richness (number of OTUs observed, slope of scatter plots of pairwise distance values for short and nearly complete fragments, and nonparametric and parametric species richness estimates). Similar results were obtained when analyzing three other datasets derived from soil, adult Zebrafish gut, and basaltic formations in the East Pacific Rise. Regression analysis indicated that these observed discrepancies in species richness estimates within various regions could readily be explained by the proportions of hypervariable, variable, and conserved base pairs within an examined fragment."

The ecology, epidemiology and pathology of most species are not yet well established. Lack of practical and accurate methods limits routine identification of clinical isolates and thus hampers precise identification of those of the Acb complex and other Acinetobacter species of possible clinical significance. We previously identified a 350 bp highly variable zone on the rpoB gene which appeared to be a promising target for rapid molecular identification. In the present study, we validated this method for accuracy on a collection of reference strains belonging to A. calcoaceticus (5 strains), Acinetobacter gen. sp. 3 (29 strains), A. gen. sp. 13TU (18 strains), A. baumannii (30 strains) and one strain each of A. radioresistens, A. gen. sp. 15TU, A. gen. sp. 10, A. gen. sp. 11, A. gen. sp.

Three were provisionally identified as A. gen. sp. 9. This is the first work to identify all specimens of a set of clinical Acinetobacter isolates at species level using rpoB sequence analysis. Our data emphasize the recognition of A. schindleri as an emerging cause of Acinetobacter-related infection and confirm that A. gen. sp. 3 is the second most commonly isolated Acinetobacter species after A. baumannii in patients."

The benzimidazole (BZ) drugs, albendazole (ALB) and mebendazole (MBZ), are commonly used for mass treatment for STH. Unfortunately, there is concern that increased use of anthelmintics could select for resistant populations of these human parasites. In veterinary parasites, and lately in filarial nematodes, a single amino acid substitution from phenylalanine to tyrosine, known to be associated with benzimidazole resistance, has been found in parasite beta-tubulin at position 200. We have developed pyrosequencer assays for codon 200 (TTC or TAC) in A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura to screen for this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).METHOD AND FINDINGS: Pyrosequencing assays were developed and evaluated for detecting the TTC or TAC SNP at codon 200 in beta-tubulin in A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. Genomic DNA from individual worms, eggs isolated from individual adult worms or from fecal samples with known treatment history and origin, were sequenced at beta-tubulin by pyrosequencing, and genotypes were confirmed by conventional sequencing. The assays were applied to adult worms from a benzimidazole-naïve population in Kenya. Following this, these assays were applied to individual worms and pooled eggs from people in East Africa (Uganda and Zanzibar) and Central America (Panama) where mass anthelmintic drug programs had been implemented. All A. lumbricoides samples were TTC. However, we found 0.4% homozygous TAC/TAC in T. trichiura worms from non-treated people in Kenya, and 63% of T. trichiura egg pools from treated people in Panama contained only TAC.CONCLUSION: Although the codon 200 TAC SNP was not found in any of the A. lumbricoides samples analyzed, a rapid genotyping assay has been developed that can be used to examine larger populations of this parasite and to monitor for possible benzimidazole resistance development. The TAC SNP at codon 200, associated with benzimidazole resistance in other nematodes, does occur in T. trichiura, and a rapid assay has been developed to allow populations of this parasite to be monitored for the frequency of this SNP. Sample sizes were small, anthelmintic efficacy was not assessed, and treated and non-treated samples were from different locations, so these frequencies cannot be extrapolated to other populations of T. trichiura or to a conclusion about resistance to treatment. The occurrence of the TAC SNP at codon 200 of beta-tubulin in T. trichiura may explain why benzimidazole anthelmintics are not always highly effective against this species of STH. These assays will be useful in assessing appropriate treatment in areas of high T. trichiura prevalence and in monitoring for possible resistance development in these STH."

Previous work identified beach sands as reservoirs of enterococci which can be transported from the sand to the sea, where they may instigate beach advisories. The present study establishes that naturally occurring enterococci can replicate in beach sands under environmentally relevant conditions. In unseeded, nonsterile microcosm experiments, it was shown that intermittent wetting of sands by seawater, like that which would occur at the high tide line, stimulates the transient replication of enterococci at rates of 0.20 to 0.63 per day (equivalent to doubling times of 1.1 to 3.5 days). Replication was not observed in control microcosms that were not subjected to wetting. Enterococci were enumerated using both culture-dependent (membrane filtration and mEI media) and culture-independent (quantitative PCR [QPCR], 23S rRNA gene based) techniques, which allowed tracking of both culturable and total enterococcus populations. Inhibition of QPCR and DNA extraction efficiencies were accounted for in the interpretation of the QPCR results. The results provide evidence that enterococci may not be an appropriate indicator of enteric disease risk at recreational beaches subject to nonpoint sources of pollution."

Thirty-three MRCoNS isolates, representing 21 strains from 9 Staphylococcus spp., carried a range of SCCmec types [I (2), II (6), III (3), V (2), I/II (1) and NT (7)] and varied in their antibiotic susceptibility to other antibiotic classes and carriage of acquired tetracycline/macrolide resistance gene(s).

The MLST types and antibiotic carriage of five MRSA isolates were similar to hospital MRSA isolates rather than US community-acquired MRSA isolates.

The effects of P9 and P9R inoculation were studied in two separate experiments. The roots of transplants of three different cultivars of potato were dipped in suspensions of P9 or P9R cells, and the plants were planted in soil. The fate of both strains was followed by examining colony growth and by performing PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Colonies of both strains were recovered from rhizoplane and endosphere samples of all three cultivars at two growth stages. A conspicuous band, representing P9 and P9R, was found in all Pseudomonas PCR-DGGE fingerprints for treated plants. The numbers of P9R CFU and the P9R-specific band intensities for the different replicate samples were positively correlated, as determined by linear regression analysis. The effects of plant growth stage, genotype, and the presence of P9R on associated microbial communities were examined by multivariate and unweighted-pair group method with arithmetic mean cluster analyses of PCR-DGGE fingerprints. The presence of strain P9R had an effect on bacterial groups identified as Pseudomonas azotoformans, Pseudomonas veronii, and Pseudomonas syringae. In conclusion, strain P9 is an avid colonizer of potato plants, competing with microbial populations indigenous to the potato phytosphere. Bacterization with a biocontrol agent has an important and previously unexplored effect on plant-associated communities."

AtbZIP24 encodes a bZIP transcription factor that is induced by salt stress in Arabidopsis thaliana but suppressed in the salt-tolerant relative Lobularia maritima. Transcriptional repression of AtbZIP24 using RNA interference improved salt tolerance in A. thaliana. Under non-stress growth conditions, transgenic A. thaliana lines with decreased AtbZIP24 expression activated the expression of stress-inducible genes involved in cytoplasmic ion homeostasis and osmotic adjustment: the Na(+) transporter AtHKT1, the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter AtSOS1, the aquaporin AtPIP2.1, and a glutamine synthetase. In addition, candidate target genes of AtbZIP24 with functions in plant growth and development were identified such as an argonaute (AGO1)-related protein and cyclophilin AtCYP19. The salt tolerance in transgenic plants correlated with reduced Na(+) accumulation in leaves. In vivo interaction of AtbZIP24 as a homodimer was shown using fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) as fused FRET pairs. Translational fusion of AtbZIP24 with GFP showed subcellular localization of the protein in nucleus and cytoplasm in plants grown under control conditions whereas in response to salt stress AtbZIP24 was preferentially targeted to the nucleus. It is concluded that AtbZIP24 is an important regulator of salt stress response in plants. The modification of transcriptional control by regulatory transcription factors provides a useful strategy for improving salt tolerance in plants."

Novel primers and quantitative kinetic PCR (qPCR) assays were developed to analyze the diversity and abundance of tfdA-like genes in soil. Five primer sets targeting tfdA-like genes were designed and evaluated. Primer sets 3 to 5 specifically amplified tfdA-like genes from soil, and a total of 437 sequences were retrieved. Coverages of gene libraries were 62 to 100%, up to 122 genotypes were detected, and up to 389 genotypes were predicted to occur in the gene libraries as indicated by the richness estimator Chao1. Phylogenetic analysis of in silico-translated tfdA-like genes indicated that soil tfdA-like genes were related to those of group 2 and 3 Bradyrhizobium spp., Sphingomonas spp., and uncultured soil bacteria. Soil-derived tfdA-like genes were assigned to 11 clusters, 4 of which were composed of novel sequences from this study, indicating that soil harbors novel and diverse tfdA-like genes. Correlation analysis of 16S rRNA and tfdA-like gene similarity indicated that any two bacteria with D&gt;20% of group 2 tfdA-like gene-derived protein sequences belong to different species. Thus, data indicate that the soil analyzed harbors at least 48 novel bacterial species containing group 2 tfdA-like genes. Novel qPCR assays were established to quantify such new tfdA-like genes. Copy numbers of tfdA-like genes were 1.0x10(6) to 65x10(6) per gram (dry weight) soil in four different soils, indicating that hitherto-unknown, diverse tfdA-like genes are abundant in soils."

After confirming the presence of indigenous HCH-degraders (seven of 24 strains), an ex situ biostimulation experiment was conducted. For this, residue levels in soil were diluted by mixing with pristine garden soil and aeration, moisture and nutrients were provided intermittently. This soil was monitored for reduction in Sigma-HCH (sum of alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-HCH) levels and stimulation of HCH-degraders. Experiments were conducted twice, in March-April (c. 75 microg Sigma-HCH g(-1) soil) and October-November 2006 (c. 280 microg Sigma-HCH g(-1) soil) at 26-30 degrees C.

These two genera have members that can grow at temperatures as low as -5 and -10 degrees C, respectively. We used quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) to quantify members of these genera in 54 soil or sediment samples from polar, temperate and tropical environments to determine to what extent they are selected by cold environments. These results were further analyzed by multiple linear regression to identify the most relevant environmental factors corresponding to their distribution. Exiguobacterium was detected in all three climatic zones at similar densities, but was patchier in the temperate and tropical samples. Psychrobacter was present in almost all polar samples, was at highest densities in Antarctica sediment samples, but was in very low densities and infrequently detected in temperate and tropical soils. Clone libraries, specific for the 16S rRNA gene for each genus, were constructed from a sample from each climatic region. The clone libraries were analyzed for alpha and beta diversities, as well as for variation in population structure by using analysis of molecular variance. Results confirm that both genera were found in all three climatic zones; however, Psychrobacter populations seemed to be much more diverse than Exiguobacterium in all three climatic zones.

Previous work from Lower Kane Cave, Wyoming, USA, focused on the aerobic portion of microbial mats, dominated by putative chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing groups within the Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. To evaluate nutrient cycling and turnover within the whole mat system, a multidisciplinary strategy was used to characterize the anaerobic portion of the mats, including application of the full-cycle rRNA approach, the most probable number method, and geochemical and isotopic analyses. Seventeen major taxonomic bacterial groups and one archaeal group were retrieved from the anaerobic portions of the mats, dominated by Deltaproteobacteria and uncultured members of the Chloroflexi phylum. A nutrient spiraling model was applied to evaluate upstream to downstream changes in microbial diversity based on carbon and sulfur nutrient concentrations. Variability in dissolved sulfide concentrations was attributed to changes in the abundance of sulfide-oxidizing microbial groups and shifts in the occurrence and abundance of sulfate-reducing microbes. Gradients in carbon and sulfur isotopic composition indicated that released and recycled byproduct compounds from upstream microbial activities were incorporated by downstream communities. On the basis of the type of available chemical energy, the variability of nutrient species in a spiraling model may explain observed differences in microbial taxonomic affiliations and metabolic functions, thereby spatially linking microbial diversity to nutrient spiraling in the cave stream ecosystem."

A comprehensive, detailed and robust phylogeny of Streptomyces and its relatives is needed for understanding how this group emerged and maintained such a vast diversity throughout evolution and how soil-living mycelial forms (e.g., Streptomyces s. str.) are related to parasitic, unicellular pathogens (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or marine species (e.g., Salinispora tropica). The most important application area of such a phylogenetic analysis will be in the comparative re-annotation of genome sequences and the reconstruction of Streptomyces metabolic networks for biotechnology.METHODS: Classical 16S-rRNA-based phylogenetic reconstruction does not guarantee to produce well-resolved robust trees that reflect the overall relationship between bacterial species with widespread horizontal gene transfer. In our study we therefore combine three whole genome-based phylogenies with eight different, highly informative single-gene phylogenies to determine a new robust consensus tree of 45 Actinomycetales species with completely sequenced genomes.RESULTS: None of the individual methods achieved a resolved phylogeny of Streptomyces and its relatives. Single-gene approaches failed to yield a detailed phylogeny; even though the single trees are in good agreement among each other, they show very low resolution of inner branches. The three whole genome-based methods improve resolution considerably. Only by combining the phylogenies from single gene-based and genome-based approaches we finally obtained a consensus tree with well-resolved branches for the entire set of Actinomycetales species. This phylogenetic information is stable and informative enough for application to the system-wide comparative modeling of bacterial physiology."

The pathogens are linked to infant formula; however, they have also been isolated from a wide range of foods and environmental samples.RESULTS: In this study, 233 samples of food, infant formula and environment were screened for the presence of Cronobacter spp. in an attempt to find its source. Twenty nine strains were isolated from samples of spices, herbs, infant foods, and dust obtained from household vacuum cleaners. Among the 76 samples of infant food, infant formula, milk powder and non-milk dairy products tested, only one sample of infant food contained Cronobacter spp. (1.4%). The other Cronobacter spp. isolates recovered include two from household vacuum dust, and 26 from 67 samples of herbs and spices. Among the food categories analyzed, herbs and spices harbored the highest number of isolates, indicating plants as a possible reservoir of this pathogen. Initial screening with API 20E test strips yielded 42 presumptive isolates. Further characterization using 3 chromogenic media (alpha-MUG, DFI and EsPM) and 8 sets of PCR primers detecting ITS (internal transcribed spacer sequences), 16S rRNA, zpx, gluA, gluB, OmpA genes followed by nucleotide sequencing of some PCR amplicons did not confirm the identity of all the isolates as none of the methods proved to be free of both false positives or false negatives. The final confirmation step was done by 16S rRNA sequence analysis identifying only 29 of the 42 isolates as Cronobacter spp.CONCLUSION: Our studies showed that Cronobacter spp. are highly diverse and share many phenotypic traits with other Enterobacteriaceae members highlighting the need to use several methods to confirm the identity of this pathogen. None of the biochemical, chromogenic or PCR primers proved to be a reliable method for confirmation of the identity of the isolates as all of them gave either false positives or false negatives or both. It is therefore concluded that 16S rRNA sequencing is pivotal to confirm the identity of the isolates."

This study assessed the effects of organic matter removal and soil compaction on microbial community structures in different soil horizons 13 years after timber harvesting at the long-term soil productivity site at Skulow Lake, British Columbia. A harvested stand was compared with an unmanaged forest stand. Ribosomal intergenic spacer profiles of bacteria, archaea and eukarya indicated significantly different community structures in the upper three soil horizons of the two stands, with differences decreasing with depth. Large-scale sequencing of the ribosomal intergenic spacers coupled to small-subunit ribosomal RNA genes allowed taxonomic identification of major microbial phylotypes affected by harvesting or varying among soil horizons. Actinobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes were the predominant phylotypes in the bacterial profiles, with the relative abundance of these groups highest in the unmanaged stand, particularly in the deeper soil horizons. Predominant eukaryal phylotypes were mainly assigned to known mycorrhizal and saprotrophic species of Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes. Harvesting affected Basidiomycetes to a minor degree but had stronger effects on some Ascomycetes. Archaeal profiles had low diversity with only a few predominant crenarchaeal phylotypes whose abundance appeared to increase with depth. Detection of these effects 13 years after harvesting may indicate a long-term change in processes mediated by the microbial community with important consequences for forest productivity. These effects warrant more comprehensive investigation of the effects of harvesting on the structure of forest soil microbial communities and the functional consequences."

Most of experimental studies about microbial degradation of PCBs have been conducted on PCB mixtures, even though evidence accumulated in bacteria and other organisms shows that exposure to different congeners may have different biological effects. Microcosm experiments were conducted using aerobic agitated soil slurries individually exposed to PCB congeners with different degrees of chlorination: PCB-3, 15, 28, and 77, and the commercial mixture Aroclor 1242. After four weeks of incubation, PCBs were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) showing different transformation extents: With the exception of PCB-15 that was not significantly transformed (7%), biodegradation rates decreased with the degree of chlorination, from 75% for PCB-3 to 22% for PCB-77 and Aroclor 1242. The bacterial abundance, as measured by colony counting and 16S rDNA quantification by real-time PCR, was lower (of about 40%) in soil microcosms exposed to the higher-chlorinated congeners, PCB-28, PCB-77, and Aroclor 1242, as compared to non-exposed soils and soils exposed to the lower-chlorinated congeners, PCB-3 and PCB-15. The relative abundance of different taxonomic groups, as determined by real-time PCR, revealed an increase of β-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria in all microcosms exposed to PCBs, as compared with non-exposed soil. In addition, exposure to PCB-77 and Aroclor 1242 resulted in a higher abundance of α-Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. Globally, these results suggest that exposure to PCBs (and especially to higher-chlorinated congeners and Aroclor 1242) selected bacterial groups involving most known PCB degraders, i.e., β-Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. The quantification of biphenyl dioxygenase (BPH) genes--involved in the aerobic degradation of PCBs--using real-time PCR showed that exposure to all PCB congeners and Aroclor 1242 resulted in a marked increase of two out of the four BPH genes tested, similarly suggesting the selection of PCB-degrading bacteria. This paper showed that exposure to different PCB congeners leads to different structures of the soil bacterial community and BPH genes expression patterns."

This suggested a possibly active role of the trees and their associated bacteria in the remediation process. Therefore, the cultivable bacterial communities associated with both tree species growing on this TCE-contaminated groundwater plume were investigated in order to assess the possibilities and practical aspects of using these common native tree species and their associated bacteria for phytoremediation. In this study, only the cultivable bacteria were characterized because the final aim was to isolate TCE-degrading, heavy metal resistant bacteria that might be used as traceable inocula to enhance bioremediation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cultivable bacteria isolated from bulk soil, rhizosphere, root, stem, and leaf were genotypically characterized by amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) of their 16S rRNA gene and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacteria that displayed distinct ARDRA patterns were screened for heavy metal resistance, as well as TCE tolerance and degradation, as preparation for possible future in situ inoculation experiments. Furthermore, in situ evapotranspiration measurements were performed to investigate if the degradation capacity of the associated bacteria is enough to prevent TCE evapotranspiration to the air.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Between both tree species, the associated populations of cultivable bacteria clearly differed in composition. In English Oak, more species-specific, most likely obligate endophytes were found. The majority of the isolated bacteria showed increased tolerance to TCE, and TCE degradation capacity was observed in some of the strains. However, in situ evapotranspiration measurements revealed that a significant amount of TCE and its metabolites was evaporating through the leaves to the atmosphere.CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The characterization of the isolates obtained in this study shows that the bacterial community associated with Oak and Ash on a TCE-contaminated site, was strongly enriched with TCE-tolerant strains. However, this was not sufficient to degrade all TCE before it reaches the leaves. A possible strategy to overcome this evapotranspiration to the atmosphere is to enrich the plant-associated TCE-degrading bacteria by in situ inoculation with endophytic strains capable of degrading TCE."

For this purpose, cucumber seedlings were grown, under controlled conditions, in perlite potting mix amended with biosolid compost or straw compost, or inoculated with Streptomyces spp. A uniform trend of response of root bacterial communities for all treatments was observed. Root bacterial density, measured as bacterial targets per plant tef gene by real-time PCR, was reduced in 31 to 67%. In addition, increased taxonomic diversity accompanied shifts in composition (alpha-diversity). The magnitude of change in these parameters relative to the perlite control varied between the different treatments but not in relation to the treatment method (compost amendments versus inoculations). Similarity between the compositions of root and of potting mix bacterial communities (beta-diversity) was relatively unchanged. The abundance of Oxalobacteraceae was &gt;50% of the total root bacterial community in the untreated perlite.

Given the importance of nematode infection in plants and mammalian pathogenesis pathways, proteomics could be applied to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying plant- or animal-nematode pathogenesis and to identify novel antinematodal drugs. Thus, C. elegans proteomics, in combination of other molecular, biological and genetic techniques, would provide a versatile new tool box for the systematic analysis of gene functions throughout the entire life cycle of this nematode."

The evaluation of the environmental impact on soil ciliate communities with methods relying on morphology-based identification may be hampered by the large number of samples usually required for a statistically supported, reliable conclusion. Cultivation-independent molecular-biological diagnostic tools are a promising alternative to greatly simplify and accelerate such studies. In this present work a ciliate-specific fingerprint method based on the amplification of a phylogenetic marker gene (i.e. the 18S ribosomal RNA gene) with subsequent analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was developed and used to monitor community shifts in a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) polluted soil. The semi-nested approach generated ciliate-specific amplification products from all soil samples and allowed to distinguish community profiles from a PAH-polluted and a non-polluted control soil. Subsequent sequence analysis of excised bands provided evidence that polluted soil samples are dominated by organisms belonging to the class Colpodea. The general DGGE approach presented in this study might thus in principle serve as a fast and reproducible diagnostic tool, complementing and facilitating future ecological and ecotoxicological monitoring of ciliates in polluted habitats."

Using a most probable number (MPN) method, 8-30 000 cells of sulphate-reducing bacteria per ml were found in groundwater from seven boreholes at the Aspö HRL. The content of lytic phages infecting the indigenous bacterium Desulfovibrio aespoeensis in Aspö groundwater was analysed using the MPN technique for phages. In four of 10 boreholes, 0.2-80 phages per ml were found at depths of 342-450 m. Isolates of lytic phages were made from five cultures. Using transmission electron microscopy, these were characterized and found to be in the Podoviridae morphology group. The isolated phages were further analysed regarding host range and were found not to infect five other species of Desulfovibrio or 10 Desulfovibrio isolates with up to 99.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to D. aespoeensis. To further analyse phage-host interactions, using a direct count method, growth of the phages and their host was followed in batch cultures, and the viral burst size was calculated to be approximately 170 phages per lytic event, after a latent period of approximately 70 h. When surviving cells from infected D. aespoeensis batch cultures were inoculated into new cultures and reinfected, immunity to the phages was found. The parasite-prey system found implies that viruses are important for microbial ecosystem diversity and activity, and for microbial numbers in deep subsurface groundwater."

The stable mixed cultures and J14a were tested in a medium containing 100 microg l(-1) of atrazine. For all cultures, atrazine was removed 33-51% within 7 days and the cell optical density increased from 0.05 to between 0.50 and 0.70.

Compared with mineral soils of the Ross Sea region, ornithogenic soils are generally high in microbial biomass, organic carbon, and total nitrogen and phosphorus, with high electrical conductivity and large variations in pH. The objective of this study was to assess the bacterial composition of ornithogenic soils from Cape Hallett and Cape Bird in the Ross Sea region using culture-independent methods. Soil clone libraries were constructed and those clones that occurred &gt; or = 3 times were sequenced. The bacterial diversity of the soils was dependent on the presence of penguins. Firmicutes most closely related to the endospore-formers (e.g., Oceanobacillus profundus and Clostridium acidurici) and (or) Gammaproteobacteria belonging to the genus Psychrobacter dominated soils currently occupied with penguins. In contrast, Gammaproteobacteria, closely related to cultured members of the genera Rhodanobacter, Psychrobacter, Dokdonella, and Lysobacter, dominated the soils previously colonized by penguins. Results of this study indicate that despite relatively high nutrient levels and microbial biomass, bacterial communities of ornithogenic soils were not more diverse than those of mineral soils of the Ross Sea region of Antarctica."

To study the bioremediation potential in this area, molecular methods based on PCR-DGGE were used to determine the diversity of the bacterial communities in bulk and in contaminated soils. Bacterial fingerprints revealed that the bacterial communities were affected by the presence of the mixture of oil and production water, and different profiles were observed when the contaminated soils were compared with the control. Halotolerant strains capable of degrading crude oil were also isolated from enrichment cultures obtained from the contaminated soil samples. Twenty-two strains showing these features were characterized genetically by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and phenotypically by their colonial morphology and tolerance to high NaCl concentrations. Fifteen ARDRA groups were formed. Selected strains were analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing, and Actinobacteria was identified as the main group found. Strains were also tested for their growth capability in the presence of different oil derivatives (hexane, dodecane, hexadecane, diesel, gasoline, toluene, naphthalene, o-xylene, and p-xylene) and different degradation profiles were observed. PCR products were obtained from 12 of the 15 ARDRA representatives when they were screened for the presence of the alkane hydroxylase gene (alkB). Members of the genera Rhodococcus and Gordonia were identified as predominant in the soil studied. These genera are usually implicated in oil degradation processes and, as such, the potential for bioremediation in this area can be considered as feasible."

The lack of consistent morphological information and the extreme abundance of these classes makes morphological identification of rare, or even common cryptic taxa a large and unwieldy task. This limits the ability to perform large-scale surveys of the diversity of these organisms.Here we demonstrate a culture-independent molecular survey approach that enables the generation of large amounts of eutardigrade and bdelloid rotifer sequence data directly from soil. Our PCR primers, specific to the 18s small-subunit rRNA gene, were developed for both eutardigrades and bdelloid rotifers.RESULTS: The developed primers successfully amplified DNA of their target organism from various soil DNA extracts. This was confirmed by both the BLAST similarity searches and phylogenetic analyses. Tardigrades showed much better phylogenetic resolution than bdelloids. Both groups of organisms exhibited varying levels of endemism.CONCLUSION: The development of clade-specific primers for characterizing eutardigrades and bdelloid rotifers from environmental samples should greatly increase our ability to characterize the composition of these taxa in environmental samples. Environmental sequencing as shown here differs from other molecular survey methods in that there is no need to pre-isolate the organisms of interest from soil in order to amplify their DNA. The DNA sequences obtained from methods that do not require culturing can be identified post-hoc and placed phylogenetically as additional closely related sequences are obtained from morphologically identified conspecifics. Our non-cultured environmental sequence based approach will be able to provide a rapid and large-scale screening of the presence, absence and diversity of Bdelloidea and Eutardigrada in a variety of soils."

Despite relatively wide use of this environmentally friendly technology, relatively little is known about the microbial populations involved in biotransformation and removal of contaminants in this system. The aim of the current study was to investigate the assembly and function of microbial populations in vertical-flow constructed wetland microcosms designed to improve the quality of wastewater after activated sludge treatment. Also, the performance of 3-year-old wetland ponds was investigated. Even though the quality of the influent water was relatively high, improvement in water parameters such as coliform level, ammonia concentration, BOD, and TSS was observed. The performance of the wetland ponds was comparable to that of the microcosms. The microbial community composition of the biofilm formed on the surface of gravel particles in vegetated and plant-free microcosms was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Highly complex bacterial diversity was observed in the biofilm. Cluster analysis of DGGE patterns demonstrated that depth within the wetland microcosm has a stronger effect on microbial community composition of the biofilm formed on wetland matrix than vegetation. Measurements of fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis activity and nitrification potential revealed that hydrolytic activity was affected by both microcosm depth and vegetation presence, whereas nitrification potential was mostly influenced by depth. Resolving the bacterial assemblage of wetland biofilm, which often is considered a black box, will help to understand the interactions involved in the development of diverse and mature biofilm and its function."

Because of the variability of morphological characteristics, unchangeable and stable characters have been investigated for phylogenic criteria. Isoenzyme and mitochondrial DNA RFLP (Mt DNA RFLP) analyses revealed different patterns among strains assigned to a same species. Therefore, these characteristics would be considered as tools for strain discrimination than species identification. The most recently developed and the most promising method is the sequence analysis of 18s ribosomal RNA coding DNA (18s rDNA). The phylogenic tree based on comparison of 18s rDNA sequences distinguished the 3 morphological groups of Acanthamoeba and divided them into 12 unique sequence types (T1-T12 genotypes). Most clinical and environmental isolates belonged to the morphological group II and the genotype T4. In the Republic of Korea, 2 strains of Acanthamoeba, YM-2 and YM-3, were first isolated from the environment in 1974. However, phylogenic identification of Korean Acanthamoeba isolates from human infections or the environment were tried from the late 1990s. By RFLP analysis or total sequence analysis of 18s rDNA revealed that almost all clinical isolates including the one from a suspicious granulomatous amebic encephalitis patient belonged to the genotype T4. A large number of environmental isolates from contact lens storage cases, tapped water, and ocean sediments also belonged to the genotype T4. Almost identical strain characteristics, such as Mt DNA RFLP pattern of environmental isolates, with the clinical isolates could make a simple conclusion that most environmental isolates might be a potential keratopathogen."

Biodegradation studies with this soil indicated the presence of microbial community that is capable of degrading the model PAH compounds viz naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene at 50 ppm each. PCR clone libraries were established from the DNA of the coal-tar-contaminated soil, targeting the 16S rRNA to characterize (i) the microbial communities, (ii) partial gene fragment encoding the Rieske iron sulfur center (alpha-subunit) common to all PAH dioxygenase enzymes and (iii) beta-subunit of dioxygenase. Phylotypes related to Proteobacteria (Alpha-, Epsilon- and Gammaproteobacteria), Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes and Deinococci were detected in 16S rRNA derived clone libraries. Many of the gene fragment sequences of alpha-subunit and beta-subunit of dioxygenase obtained from the respective clone libraries fell into clades that are distinct from the reference dioxygenase gene sequences. Presence of consensus sequence of the Rieske type [2Fe-2S] cluster binding site suggested that these gene fragments encode for alpha-subunit of dioxygenase gene.CONCLUSIONS: Sequencing of the cloned libraries representing alpha-subunit gene fragments (Rf1) and beta-subunit of dioxygenase showed the presence of hitherto unidentified dioxygenase in coal-tar-contaminated soil.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The combination of the Rieske primers and bacterial community profiling represents a powerful tool for both assessing bioremediation potential and the exploration of novel dioxygenase genes in a contaminated environment."

Its morphology and 18S rDNA gene sequence were studied with standard methods. Sandmanniella terricola is very likely an adversity strategist because it reaches peak abundances 6-12 h after rewetting the soil and maintains trophic food vacuoles with undigested bacteria in the resting cyst, a highly specific feature suggested as an indicator for an adversity life strategy. Possibly, the energy of the stored food vacuoles is used for reproduction and support of the cyst wall. Morphologically, Sandmanniella terricola is inconspicuous, having a size of only 50 x 40 microm and a simple, ellipsoidal shape. The main characteristics of the genus are a colpodid silverline pattern; a perioral cilia condensation; a flat, dish-shaped oral cavity, in the centre of which originates a long, conical oral basket resembling that of certain nassulid ciliates; and a vertically oriented left oral polykinetid composed of brick-shaped adoral organelles. This unique mixture of features and the gene sequence trees, where Sandmanniella shows an isolated position, suggest establishing a new family, the Sandmanniellidae n. fam., possibly related to the families Colpodidae or Bryophryidae.

This has led to the use of sequence analysis tools such as multiple alignments and hierarchical clustering that are not adapted to the analysis of large and diverse data sets and not always justified for characterization of MOTUs. Here, we developed an approach combining a pairwise alignment algorithm and graph partitioning by using MCL (Markov clustering) in order to generate discrete groups for nuclear large-subunit rRNA gene and internal transcript spacer 1 sequence data sets obtained from a yearly monitoring study of two spatially close but ecologically contrasting alpine soils (namely, early and late snowmelt locations). We compared MCL with a classical single-linkage method (Ccomps) and showed that MCL reduced bias such as the chaining effect.

Hence identification of mycobacteria to the species level is not only relevant to patient management but also to understand epidemiology of mycobacterial diseases and effect on vaccination. We undertook this study to assess the usefulness of various conventional and molecular methods in identification of environmental mycobacterial species from Agra, north India.METHODS: One hundred nineteen isolates of environmental mycobacteria were grown from 291 (116 soil and 175 water) samples. These isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests, and a simple, rapid and cost-effective in-house developed gene amplification restriction analysis targeting 16S-23S rRNA spacer and flanking region and 16S rRNA sequencing.RESULTS: Biochemical tests could clearly identify only 68.1 per cent (81/119) of isolates to species level. An in-house developed gene amplification--restriction analysis method could confirm the identity of 102 of 119 (85.7%) isolates and the remaining 17 isolates (14.3%) were confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing also. These 119 environmental mycobacterial isolates, included several potentially pathogenic species such as M. fortuitum, M. chelonae, M. avium, M. marinum, M. manitobense, M. kansasii and others belonged to nonpathogenic species, M. terrae, M. smegmatis and M. flavescens. M. chelonae was isolated from water samples only whereas M. fortuitum was isolated from both water as well as soil samples.INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: The in-house developed gene amplification restriction analysis method though failed to accurately identify 14.3 per cent of isolates, facilitated rapid differentiation of most of environmental mycobacteria including potential pathogens from this area and thus would have diagnostic potential in cases with NTM infections.

However, little is known about the influence of GTW on soil bacterial community. A field experiment was established at Menangle in south western Sydney in Australia to quantitatively assess the impacts of different types (GTW CO and GTW CL) and amounts of GTW application on the soil bacterial community and diversity. Furthermore, a municipal solid waste (MSW) compost was simultaneously examined to compare against the other organic wastes. Knowledge about the shifts in microbial community structure and diversity following the applications of organic wastes could help to evaluate the ecological consequences on the soil and thus to develop sound regulatory guidelines for the beneficial reuse of organic wastes in agricultural lands.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Soil samples were collected from recycled organics plots treated with different types and quantity of organic wastes. The field experimental treatments included control (CK, without application of any organic wastes), low amount of GTW CO (COL), GTW CL (CLL), and MSW (ML), and high amounts of GTW CO (COH), GTW CL (CLH), and MSW compost (MH). Microbial DNA was extracted from soil samples and the 16S rRNA genes were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified. The PCR products were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), cloning, and sequencing. The bacterial community structures and diversity were assessed using the DGGE profiles and clone libraries constructed from the excised DGGE bands.RESULTS: DGGE-based analyses showed that application of the GTW CO, regardless of the amount applied, had significant negative effects on soil bacterial genotypic diversity and community structure compared with the control, while the applications of other organic wastes including the GTW CL and MSW had no clear effects. The effects of the rate of organic waste application on soil bacterial community characteristics varied with the types of organic wastes applied. Sequence-based analyses of 126 clones indicated that Proteobacteria (53.2%) was the dominant taxa at the experimental site, followed by Actinobacteria (9.5%), Bacteroidetes (7.9%), Firmicutes (7.9%), Gemmatimonadetes (5.6%), Chloroflexi (2.4%), Acidobacteria (1.6%) and the unclassified group (11.9%). In the COH treatment, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Gemmatimonadetes were not detected; the percentages of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria in the COH treatment were significantly different from those in CK. There is a significant positive correlation (r = 0.71, p = 0.002) between the C/N ratio of organic wastes and the bacterial genotypic communities.DISCUSSION: Both the type and the amount of GTW applied affected soil bacterial genotypic diversity and community structure. The different effects of various types of organic wastes on soil bacterial characteristics may be predicted by the differences in specific properties of organic wastes such as C/N ratio, as evidenced by the strong and significant positive relationship between the bacterial community distance and the environmental distance of C/N ratio. This also indicates that the C/N ratio of GTW applied can be a major driver for the shift in the soil bacterial community.CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that the effects of organic wastes on soil bacterial communities varied with the types of organic wastes, and depending on the rate of application. Application of the GTW CO led to significant shifts in soil bacterial community diversity and structure. The effects of different types of organic wastes on the soil bacterial characteristics can be predicted by the differences of specific properties of organic wastes, such as the C/N ratio. Sequence-based analyses of 126 clones indicated that Proteobacteria was the dominant taxa at the experimental site.RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: Our results have important implications for developing sound regulatory guidelines for the beneficial reuse of organic wastes, indicating that GTW CO and similar organic waste treatments may not be suitable for application in agricultural soils due to its significant negative effect on soil bacterial community."

Traditionally, this trait has been the basis for taxonomic definition of several genera, notably Microcoleus and Hydrocoleum, but the trait has not been associated with any plausible function.METHOD AND FINDINGS: Through the use of phylogenetic reconstruction, we demonstrate that pedigreed, rope-building cyanobacteria from various habitats do not form a monophyletic group. This is consistent with the hypothesis that rope-building ability was fixed independently in several discrete clades, likely through processes of convergent evolution or lateral transfer. Because rope-building cyanobacteria share the ability to colonize geologically unstable sedimentary substrates, such as subtidal and intertidal marine sediments and non-vegetated soils, it is also likely that this supracellular differentiation capacity imparts a particular fitness advantage in such habitats. The physics of sediment and soil erosion in fact predict that threads in the 50-200 microm size range will attain optimal characteristics to stabilize such substrates on contact.CONCLUSIONS: Rope building is a supracellular morphological adaptation in filamentous cyanobacteria that allows them to colonize physically unstable sedimentary environments, and to act as successful pioneers in the biostabilization process."

However, members of this phylum have typically been recalcitrant to cultivation methods, hampering the study of this presumably important bacterial group. In this study, we examine the phylogenetic diversity of the Verrucomicrobia in a former agricultural field and gain access to genomic information via a metagenomic approach. We examined Verrucomicrobia-like 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from general bacterial and phylum-specific libraries, revealing a dominance of subdivisions 1 and 2. A PCR-based screening method was developed to identify inserts containing verrucomicrobial 16S rRNA genes within a large-insert metagenomic library, and on screening of 28,800 clones, four fosmids were identified as containing verrucomicrobial genomic DNA. Full-length sequencing of fosmid inserts and gene annotation identified a total of 98 ORFs, representing a range of functions. No conservation of gene order was observed adjacent to the ribosomal operons. Fosmid inserts were further analyzed for tetranucleotide frequencies to identify remnants of past horizontal gene transfer events. The metagenomic approach utilized proved to be suitable for the recovery of verrucomicrobial genomic DNA, thereby providing a window into the genomes of members of this important, yet poorly characterized, bacterial phylum."

In this study, the effects of intercropping and intercropping-rhizobial inoculation on soil enzyme activities, microbial biomass and bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere were examined. In both treatments, the yield of alfalfa, microbial biomass and activities of soil urease, invertase and alkaline phosphatase in the alfalfa rhizosphere were markedly increased, whereas there was a slight increase in the yield of Siberian wild rye, few impacts on soil microbial biomass, and decreased enzyme activities (except for urease) in the Siberian wild rye rhizosphere. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of 16S rRNA genes indicated that Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the major bacterial groups in the rhizosphere of both plants. However, intercropping and rhizobial inoculation induced some shifts in the relative abundance of them. Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira groups were detected in all treatments by the T-RFLP patterns of ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene, but the relative abundance of Nitrosomonas increased and that of Nitrosospira decreased in the intercropping-rhizobial inoculation treatment.

However, appropriate examinations have been mainly performed on phenotypic level, whereas genetic investigations, as well as researches under realistic conditions, are scarce. Therefore, the present field study aimed to accomplish a particular description of how an antibiotic contaminated environment influences microorganisms on both a phenotypic and a genetic level, using analytical, phenotypical and molecular biological methods. For this purpose, concentrations of tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline and doxycycline were analysed in liquid manure samples (n=179) from Bavarian (Germany) pig farms. All detected tetracyclines found in each manure sample were summed up and referred to as total tetracycline concentrations (TET). Phenotypic doxycycline resistance of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from these manure samples was determined by means of the microdilution method. After that, doxycycline resistant (n=147) and susceptible (n=32) E. faecalis were screened for tet(L), tet(M), tet(S) and tet(O) by using PCR. If despite doxycycline resistance no respective gene was detected, tet(A/B/C/D/K/L/M/W/Z) were additionally tested. The most frequent resistance determinant was tet(M) (n=128), followed by tet(L) (n=95). Tet(S) and tet(O) were present in 12 and 7 isolates; the remaining tet-genes were not detected. A correlation between the TET concentration in manure and the occurrence of tet(M) and tet(L) could be shown. In particular, strains that contained neither tet(M) nor tet(L) (n=44) were isolated from manure samples with mean TET of 0.35 mg/kg. If tet(M) was the only tetracycline resistance gene (n=40), mean concentrations were 0.51 mg/kg, and, if tet(L) was the only tet-gene (n=7), 1.18 mg/kg, respectively. On the other hand, if co-occurrence of tet(M) and tet(L) was detected (n=88, including 1 susceptible isolate), mean TET in the referring manure samples was 4.08 mg/kg. The present study demonstrates that high tetracycline concentrations in manure lead to higher doxycycline minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in E. faecalis, genetically based on co-occurrence of tet(M) and tet(L)."

However, this procedure has various types of intrinsic error and bias, thus often misleads the relative abundance of bacterial populations. In order to establish a reliability for the current 16S rDNA DGGE method, we investigated various parameters and potential sources of errors in the DGGE procedures, such as primer mismatch, dNTP concentration, DNA polymerase, PCR cycles, uneven amplification of templates, secondary structure of PCR product, melting domain profiles, and acrylamide/bis concentration. Our result showed that the relative band intensities of the corresponding 16S rDNA templates were closely correlated with the differences of the melting temperature between the higher and lower melting domains of the PCR products. In addition, application of i) real-time PCR, ii) combination of PCR primers and iii) optimization of both dNTP and acrylamide/bis concentrations significantly improved the quantitative representation of bacterial 16S rDNA levels in the mixed samples. Especially, identification of the inflection points of DNA samples through the real-time PCR was crucial for the accurate representation of soil bacterial populations. Beyond these points DNA templates can be over-amplified to a saturated level independently of their initial amounts. Therefore for the accurate analysis of soil bacterial community, a quantitative 16S rDNA DGGE analysis needs to be performed in combination with a real-time PCR."

EH831.";"BACKGROUND, AIM, AND SCOPE: Hexane, a representative VOC, is used as a solvent for extraction and as an ingredient in gasoline. The degradation of hexane by bacteria is relatively slow due to its low solubility. Moreover, the biodegradation pathway of hexane under aerobic conditions remains to be investigated; therefore, a study relating to aerobic biodegradation mechanisms is required. Consequently, in this study, an effective hexane degrader was isolated and the biodegradation pathway examined for the first time. In addition, the degradation characteristics of a variety of recalcitrant hydrocarbons were qualitatively and quantitatively investigated using the isolate.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hexane-degrading bacterium was isolated from an enrichment culture using petroleum-contaminated soil as an inoculum with hexane as the sole carbon and energy source. The bacterium was also identified using the partial 16S rRNA gene sequence. To test the hexane-degrading capacity of the isolate, 10 ml of an EH831 cell suspension was inoculated into a 600-ml serum bottle with hexane (7.6-75.8 micromol) injected as the sole carbon source. The rates of hexane degradation were determined by analyzing the concentrations of hexane using headspace gas chromatography. In addition, the hexane biodegradation pathway under aerobic conditions was investigated by identifying the metabolites using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with solid-phase microextraction. 14C-hexane was used to check if EH831 could mineralize hexane in the same experimental system. The degradabilities of other hydrocarbons were examined using EH831 with methanol, ethanol, acetone, cyclohexane, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), dichloromethane (DCM), trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX), pyrene, diesel, lubricant oil, and crude oil as sole carbon sources.RESULTS: A bacterium, EH831, was isolated from the enriched hexane-degrading consortium, which was able to degrade hexane and various hydrocarbons, including alcohols, chlorinated hydrocarbons, cyclic alkanes, ethers, ketones, monoaromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and petroleum hydrocarbons. The maximum hexane degradation rate (V max) of EH831 was 290 micromol g dry cell weight(-1) h(-1), and the saturation constant (K s) was 15 mM. Using 14C-hexane, EH831 was confirmed to mineralize approximately 49% of the hexane into CO2 and, converted approximately, 46% into biomass; the rest (1.7%) remained as extracellular metabolites in the liquid phase. The degradation pathway was assessed through the qualitative analysis of the hexane intermediates due to EH831, which were 2-hexanol, 2-hexanone, 5-hexen-2-one and 2,5-hexanedione, in that order, followed by 4-methyl-2-pentanone, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanone and butanal, and finally, CO2. EH831 could degrade methanol, ethanol, acetone, cyclohexane, MTBE, DCM, BTEX, pyrene, diesel, and lubricant oil.DISCUSSION: EH831 was able to degrade many recalcitrant hydrocarbons at higher degradation rates compared with previous well-known degraders. Furthermore, this study primarily suggested the aerobic biodegradation pathway, which may provide valuable information for researchers and engineers working in the field of environmental engineering.CONCLUSIONS: Rhodococcus sp. EH831 is a promising bioresource for removing hexane and other recalcitrant hydrocarbons from a variety of environments. Moreover, the aerobic biodegradation pathway is reported for the first time in this study, which offers valuable information for understanding the microbial degradation of hexane.RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The utility of the strain isolated in this study needs to be proved by its application to biological process systems, such as biofilters and bioreactors, etc., for the degradation of hexane and many other recalcitrant hydrocarbons. Detailed investigations will also be needed to clarify the enzymatic characteristics relating the degradation of both recalcitrant hydrocarbons and hexane."

Analysis of sequences from a subset of the phylotypes showed that at least 11 bacterial divisions were represented in the clone libraries. The phylotype richness, frequency distribution (evenness), and composition of the two clone libraries were investigated using a variety of diversity indices. Although the analysis of diversity indices and LIBSHUFF comparisons revealed that the compared libraries were not significantly different (P=0.05) between the RC vs. CC soils, some differences could be observed in terms of specific phyla and groups.

The taxonomic position of the bacterium was confirmed by sequencing of 16S rRNA and phylogenetic analysis. A strain grew at a wide range of temperature ranging from 5-40 degrees C, but optimum growth was observed at 28-30 degrees C. It showed multiple plant growth-promoting attributes such as phosphate solubilization activity, indole acetic acid (IAA) production, siderophore production and HCN production. It was able to solubilize (28 microg of Ca(3)PO(4) ml(-1) day(-1)), and produce IAA (59 microg) at 28 degrees C. The solubilization of insoluble phosphate was associates with a drop in the pH of the culture medium. Pantoea sp.

The diversity and long-term succession of microorganisms found in composted biosolids has been less characterized than other composts. In this study, bacterial and fungal communities found in composted biosolids aging from 1 to 24 months were studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing. The results revealed high levels of diversity, where 53 bacterial species belonging to 10 phyla and 21 fungal species belonging to 4 phyla were identified. Significant differences were observed when comparing the bacterial DGGE patterns of young compost samples, whereas no differences were observed in samples over 8 months. For fungal patterns, no significant differences were observed during the first 4 months of composting, but the diversity then significantly shifted until 24 months. The results indicate that patterns of bacterial species vary during the first few months of composting, whereas fungal patterns generally vary throughout the whole process, except during early stages. The description of the main microbial groups found in composted biosolids could find various applications, including the discovery of biotechnologically relevant microorganisms and the development of novel markers allowing quantitative monitoring of key microorganisms."

The abundance of Bacillus spp. as nitrate reducing bacteria were isolated and identified from the soil sample collected from a greenhouse at Jinju City of Gyengsangnamdo, South Korea. The nitrate reducing bacterial species were identified by 16s RNA sequencing technique. The efficiency of bacterial isolates on nitrate removal in broth was tested. The experiment was conducted in an electrokinetic (EK) cell by applying 20V across the electrodes. The nitrate reducing bacteria (Bacillus spp.) were inoculated in the soil for nitrate removal process by the addition of necessary nutrient. The influence of nitrate reducers on electrokinetic process was also studied. The concentration of nitrate at anodic area of soil was higher when compared to cathode in electrokinetic system, while adding bacteria in EK (EK+bio) system, the nitrate concentration was almost nil in all the area of soil. The bacteria supplies electron from organic degradation (humic substances) and enhances NO(3)(-) reduction (denitrification). Experimental results showed that the electro-bio kinetic process viz. electroosmosis and physiological activity of bacteria reduced nitrate in soil environment effectively. Involvement of Bacillus spp. on nitrification was controlled by electrokinetics at cathode area by reduction of ammonium ions to nitrogen gas. The excellence of the combined electro-bio kinetics technology on nitrate removal is discussed."

The analysis on 16S rRNA gene revealed that bacterial community structures were clearly different between the two sites. The cloning analyses were performed by using primers specific for the catabolic genes involved in the aerobic or anaerobic degradation of monoaromatic hydrocarbons, i.e. xylene monooxygenase (xylM), catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O), and benzoyl-CoA reductase (bcr) genes. From the result of xylM gene, it was suggested that there are lineages specific to the respective sites, reflecting the differences of sampling sites. In the analysis of the C23O gene, the results obtained with two primer sets were distinct from each other. A comparison of these suggested that catabolic types of major bacteria carrying this gene were different between the two sites. As for the bcr gene, no amplicon was obtained from one sample.

Here we describe the development of a cultivation method, based on the embedment of pure bacterial cultures in between two layers of agar. Plates containing either embedded Pseudomonas putida or Arthrobacter globiformis resulted in higher numbers of CFUs of soil bacteria (21% and 38%, respectively) after 833 h of incubation, compared to plates with no embedded strain. This indicates a stimulatory effect of the bacterial pure cultures on the cultivation of soil bacteria. Analysis of partial 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed a phylogenetical distribution of the soil isolates into 7 classes in 4 phyla. No difference was observed at the phylum or class level when comparing isolates grouped according to embedded strain. The number of isolates belonging to the same class as the embedded strain was reduced in comparison to that of plates with no embedded strain, indicating that intercellular signalling was unlikely to cause the observed stimulatory effect. Significantly higher fractions of isolates with less than 97% sequence homology to known sequenced isolates in GenBank were recovered from plates with embedded strains than from those without, which indicate a higher number of potential novel soil isolates. This approach for cultivation is therefore a feasible alternative or supplement to traditional cultivation on agar plates in order to enhance bacterial culturability."

Lizard eggs may be particularly susceptible to soil contamination and in ovo exposure may interfere or disrupt normal physiological function in the developing embryo, including regulation of gene expression. Fertilized eggs of the lizard Podarcis sicula were incubated in cadmium-contaminated soil at 25 degrees C for 20 days. Gene expression profiling showed 5 down- and 9 up-regulated genes. Four cDNAs had no homology to known gene sequences, thus suggesting that may either encode not yet identified proteins, or correspond to untranslated regions of mRNA molecules. Four fragments exhibited significant sequence similarity with genes encoding novel proteins or ESTs derived from other vertebrates. The remaining genes are mainly involved in molecular pathways associated with processes such as membrane trafficking, signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation and differentiation. Cadmium also affected the expression of factors actively involved in the regulation of the transcription machinery. Down-regulated genes are mainly associated with cellular metabolism and cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis. All of these differentially expressed genes may represent candidates that function in cadmium responses.

Oxidase and catalase activities were present. Flexirubin-type pigments were present, but extracellular glycans were absent. MK-6 was the major respiratory quinone. The major fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0) (28.3 %) and iso-C(17 : 1)omega9c (13.8 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain LM5(T) was a member of the genus Flavobacterium with highest sequence similarity to Flavobacterium soli DS-6(T) (93.2 %) and Flavobacterium lindanitolerans IP-10(T) (92.9 %). Together with F. lindanitolerans IP-10(T), strain LM5(T) formed a distinct lineage in the phylogenetic tree.

The tricalcium phosphate (TCP) solubilizing abilities of the isolates were estimated at three different incubation temperatures viz., 4, 15, and 30 degrees C under in vitro conditions. Irrespective of their geographical origin, all the isolates recorded maximum P release values at 30 degrees C. At 4 degrees C, the isolates from the north facing slope were found to release significantly higher levels of P, as compared to the isolates from the south facing slopes. Alternatively at 15 degrees C, the isolates from the south facing slope were found to release significantly higher levels of P. Initial confirmation of their genus level identity as Pseudomonads was arrived by amplification of a 990 bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene using genus specific primers. Further putative species level identification was arrived by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The diversity among the isolates was determined by rep-PCR using the primers BOX, ERIC, and ERIC2. A composite dendrogram constructed using the rep-PCR profiles revealed that the isolates from the north and south mountain aspects formed separate major clusters. The extent of diversity was greater among the isolates from the south mountain aspect. This study reveals the potential of rep-PCR in determining the genetic diversity among Pseudomonads selected for a single functional trait, but varying in their geographical origin."

LAS is regarded as a readily biodegradable product under aerobic conditions in aqueous media and is mostly removed in wastewater treatment plants, but an important fraction (20-25%) is immobilized in sewage sludge and persists under anoxic conditions. Due to the application of the sludge as a fertilizer, LAS reaches agricultural soil, and therefore, microbial toxicity tests have been widely used to evaluate the influence of LAS on soil microbial ecology. However, molecular-based community-level analyses have been seldom applied in studies regarding the effects of LAS on natural or engineered systems, and, to our knowledge, there are no reports of their use for such appraisals in agricultural soil. In this study, a microcosm system is used to evaluate the effects of a commercial mixture of LAS on the community structure of Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria in an agricultural soil.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The microcosms consisted of agricultural soil columns (800 g) fed with sterile water (8 ml h(-1)) added of different concentration of LAS (10 or 50 mg l(-1)) for periods of time up to 21 days. Sterile water was added to control columns for comparison. The structures of Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria communities were analyzed by a cultivation independent method (temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) separation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified partial 16S rRNA genes). Relevant populations were identified by subsequent reamplification, DNA sequencing, and database comparisons.RESULTS: Cluster analysis of the TGGE fingerprints taking into consideration both the number of bands and their relative intensities revealed that the structure of the Alphaproteobacteria community was significantly changed in the presence of LAS, at both concentrations tested. The average number of bands was significantly lower in the microcosms receiving 50 mg l(-1) LAS and in the lower portion of soil cores. The clear differentiation of the samples of the upper portion of the soil columns amended with LAS was specifically related to the presence and intensity of a distinctive major band (named band class 7). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the concentrations of LAS detected in soil portions taken from LAS 10 mg l(-1) and LAS 50 mg l(-1) microcosms and the relative intensity of band class 7 in the corresponding TGGE profiles. Prevalent Alphaproteobacteria populations in the soil microcosms had close similarity (&gt;99%) to cultivated species affiliated to genera of the Rhizobiaceae, Methylocystaceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae, Rhodospirillaceae, Brucellaceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae, and Caulobacteraceae families. The population represented by band class 7 was found closely related to the genus Phenylobacterium (Caulobacteraceae). According to cluster analysis of TGGE profiles, the structure of both Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria communities in the soil microcosms was remarkably stable in the presence of LAS at the two concentrations tested, as most bands were universally present in all samples and displayed fairly similar relative intensities.DISCUSSION: Previous studies by others authors, based on biological and chemical tests, concluded that LAS toxicity was not an important microbial selection factor in sludge amended soil, while work based on the use of molecular fingerprinting to evaluate the impact of LAS in aqueous media and marine sediments showed that concentrations as low as 1 mg l(-1) significantly influence the development of the bacterial community structure. Although TGGE is not a strictly quantitative method due to the bias introduced by the PCR reaction, changes of band intensity through experiments are a consequence of a change in the relative abundance of the corresponding populations in the community and can be used as a semiquantitative measure of bacterial diversity. Our results evidence that the Phenylobacterium population represented by band class 7 was favored by the presence of increasing concentrations of LAS in the soil and turned into a dominant population, suggesting its possible ability to use LAS in soil as a source of nutrients. As studies with pure cultures are required to confirm the ability of this population to degrade LAS, isolation strategies are currently under development in our laboratory. The weak effect of LAS on the structure of Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria communities is particularly interesting, as to our knowledge, there are no previous reports regarding the effects of LAS on these bacterial groups in soil. CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND PERSPECTIVES: The Phenylobacterium-related alphaproteobacterial population identified in this work was selectively enriched in LAS polluted soil and is a plausible candidate to play a relevant role in the biotransformation of the surfactant under the conditions tested. The surfactant had no remarkable effects on the Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria fingerprints in soil, even when present at concentrations widely exceeding those reached in soil immediately after sludge application. TGGE fingerprinting provides a reliable and low time-consuming method for the monitoring of the bacterial community structure and dynamics, and we recommend its integration with the biological and chemical analyses usually applied in risk assessment of LAS in the environment."

The studied soil is a potential source for isolation of actinomycetes, especially Streptomyces, and the application of organic amendment to the soil appeared to have an impact on the diversity of actinomycetes. Amendment of the soil with MSWC and FM significantly increased the number of actinomycetes due to the contribution of bacteria originally contained in biowastes and/or by stimulation of the endogenous soil micro-organisms."

Twenty-five representative isolates were phylogenetically analyzed based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Antimicrobial activities against four bacteria and seven fungi were tested using agar well diffusion method.

Ten actinomycetes out of 195 screened in vitro were strongly inhibitory to S. rolfsii. These isolates were subsequently tested for their ability to inhibit sclerotial germination and hyphal growth of S. roflsii. The most important inhibitions were obtained by the culture filtrate from the isolates J-2 and B-11, including 100% inhibition of sclerotial germination and 80% inhibition of hyphal growth. These two isolates (J-2 and B-11) were then screened for their ability to protect sugar beet against infection of S. rolfsii induced root rot in a pot trial. The treatment of S. rolfsii infested soil with a biomass and culture filtrate mixture of the selected antagonists reduced significantly (P &lt; or = 0.05) the incidence of root rot on sugar beet. Isolate J-2 was most effective and allowed a high fresh weight of sugar beet roots to be obtained.

The conversion yield of fosfomycin is less than 50% in the whole process and a large quantity of waste is produced. Biotransformation by microorganisms is an alternative method of preparation. This kind of conversion is more delicate, environmentally friendly, and the conversion yield of fosfomycin would be higher. In this work, an aerobic bacterium capable of transforming cPPA to fosfomycin was isolated. The organism, designated as strain S101, was identified as Bacillus simplex by morphological and physiological characteristics as well as by analysis of the gene encoding the 16S rRNA. Fosfomycin was assayed by two means, bioassay and gas chromatography (GC). Glycerol was a good carbon source for growth and cPPA conversion of strain S101. When cPPA was used as the sole carbon source, neither growth nor conversion to fosfomycin occurred. The optimum cPPA concentration in the conversion medium was 2,000 microg ml(-1). After 6 days of incubation, the concentration of fosfomycin reached its maximum level (1,838.2 microg ml(-1)), with a conversion ratio of 81.3%.

Experimental approaches studying these systems usually focus on either the soil community's taxonomic structure or its functional characteristics. Many methods target DNA as marker molecule and use PCR for amplification.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we apply an RNA-centered meta-transcriptomic approach to simultaneously obtain information on both structure and function of a soil community. Total community RNA is random reversely transcribed into cDNA without any PCR or cloning step. Direct pyrosequencing produces large numbers of cDNA rRNA-tags; these are taxonomically profiled in a binning approach using the MEGAN software and two specifically compiled rRNA reference databases containing small and large subunit rRNA sequences. The pyrosequencing also produces mRNA-tags; these provide a sequence-based transcriptome of the community. One soil dataset of 258,411 RNA-tags of approximately 98 bp length contained 193,219 rRNA-tags with valid taxonomic information, together with 21,133 mRNA-tags. Quantitative information about the relative abundance of organisms from all three domains of life and from different trophic levels was obtained in a single experiment. Less frequent taxa, such as soil Crenarchaeota, were well represented in the data set. These were identified by more than 2,000 rRNA-tags; furthermore, their activity in situ was revealed through the presence of mRNA-tags specific for enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation and CO(2) fixation.SIGNIFICANCE: This approach could be widely applied in microbial ecology by efficiently linking community structure and function in a single experiment while avoiding biases inherent in other methods."

Most endogenous siRNAs in Arabidopsis are dependent on RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2) for their biogenesis. Recent work has demonstrated that the maize MEDIATOR OF PARAMUTATION1 (mop1) gene is a predicted ortholog of RDR2. The mop1 gene is required for establishment of paramutation and maintenance of transcriptional silencing of transposons and transgenes, suggesting the potential involvement of small RNAs. We analyzed small RNAs in wild-type maize and in the isogenic mop1-1 loss-of-function mutant by using Illumina's sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) technology, which allowed us to characterize the complement of maize small RNAs to considerable depth. Similar to rdr2 in Arabidopsis, in mop1-1, the 24-nucleotide (nt) endogenous heterochromatic short-interfering siRNAs were dramatically reduced, resulting in an enrichment of miRNAs and transacting siRNAs. In contrast to the Arabidopsis rdr2 mutant, the mop1-1 plants retained a highly abundant heterochromatic approximately 22-nt class of small RNAs, suggesting a second mechanism for heterochromatic siRNA production. The enrichment of miRNAs and loss of 24-nt heterochromatic siRNAs in mop1-1 should be advantageous for miRNA discovery as the maize genome becomes more fully sequenced."

However, in the long term, more structured surveys can be achieved by estimating the diversity of microbial communities and the effort required to describe them. The rates of recovery of new microbial taxa in very large samples suggest that many more taxa remain to be discovered in soils and the oceans. We apply a robust statistical method to large gene sequence libraries from these environments to estimate both diversity and the sequencing effort required to obtain a given fraction of that diversity. In the upper ocean, we predict some 1400 phylotypes, and a mere fivefold increase in shotgun reads could yield 90% of the metagenome, that is, all genes from all taxa. However, at deep ocean, hydrothermal vents and diversities in soils can be up to two orders of magnitude larger, and hundreds of times the current number of samples will be required just to obtain 90% of the taxonomic diversity based on 3% difference in 16S rDNA. Obtaining 90% of the metagenome will require tens of thousands of times the current sequencing effort. Although the definitive sequencing of hyperdiverse environments is not yet possible, we can, using taxa-abundance distributions, begin to plan and develop the required methods and strategies. This would initiate a new phase in the exploration of the microbial world."

Massive datasets of metagenomic sequences have been accumulated, but analysis of these sequences has focused primarily on the descriptive comparison of the relative abundance of proteins that belong to specific functional categories. More robust statistical methods are needed to make inferences from metagenomic data. In this study, we developed and applied a suite of tools to describe and compare the richness, membership, and structure of microbial communities using peptide fragment sequences extracted from metagenomic sequence data.RESULTS: Application of these tools to acid mine drainage, soil, and whale fall metagenomic sequence collections revealed groups of peptide fragments with a relatively high abundance and no known function. When combined with analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments from the same communities these tools enabled us to demonstrate that although there was no overlap in the types of 16S rRNA gene sequence observed, there was a core collection of operational protein families that was shared among the three environments.CONCLUSION: The results of comparisons between the three habitats were surprising considering the relatively low overlap of membership and the distinctively different characteristics of the three habitats.

These bacteria share the unique ability of using methane as a sole carbon and energy source and have been found in a great variety of habitats. Phylogenetically, known methanotrophs constitute a rather limited group and have so far only been affiliated with the Proteobacteria. Here, we report the isolation and initial characterization of a nonproteobacterial obligately methanotrophic bacterium. The isolate, designated Kam1, was recovered from an acidic hot spring in Kamchatka, Russia, and is more thermoacidophilic than any other known methanotroph, with optimal growth at approximately 55 degrees C and pH 3.5. Kam1 is only distantly related to all previously known methanotrophs and belongs to the Verrucomicrobia lineage of evolution. Genes for methane monooxygenases, essential for initiation of methane oxidation, could not be detected by using standard primers in PCR amplification and Southern blot analysis, suggesting the presence of a different methane oxidation enzyme. Kam1 also lacks the well developed intracellular membrane systems typical for other methanotrophs. The isolate represents a previously unrecognized biological methane sink, and, due to its unusual phylogenetic affiliation, it will shed important light on the origin, evolution, and diversity of biological methane oxidation and on the adaptation of this process to extreme habitats.

PhyloChip results showed a significant change compared with bulk soil in relative abundance for 7% of the total rhizosphere microbial community (147 of 1917 taxa); the 7% response value was confirmed by16S rRNA terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. This PhyloChip-defined dynamic subset was comprised of taxa in 17 of the 44 phyla detected in all soil samples.

Richness of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria decreased in soil near the root tip compared with bulk soil, but then increased in older root zones. Quantitative PCR revealed rhizosphere abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria at about 10(8) copies of 16S rRNA genes per g soil, with Nitrospira having about 10(5) copies per g soil.

Maize survival under low oxygen conditions is largely dependent on metabolic, physiological and morphological adaptation strategies; the regulation mechanisms of which remain unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the response to adverse biotic or abiotic stresses at the post-transcriptional level. The aim of this study was to understand submergence-responsive miRNAs and their potential roles in submerged maize roots.METHODS: A custom muParaflo microfluidic array containing plant miRNA (miRBase: http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk) probes was used to explore differentially expressed miRNAs. Small RNAs from treated roots were hybridized with the microarray. The targets and their cis-acting elements of small RNA were predicted and analysed by RT-PCR.KEY RESULTS: Microarray data revealed that the expression levels of 39 miRNAs from nine maize and some other plant miRNA families were significantly altered (P &lt; 0.01). Four expression profiles were identified across different submergence time-points. The zma-miRNA166, zma-miRNA167, zma-miRNA171 and osa-miRNA396-like were induced in the early phase, and their target genes were predicted to encode important transcription factors, including; HD-ZIP, auxin response factor, SCL and the WRKY domain protein. zma-miR159, ath-miR395-like, ptc-miR474-like and osa-miR528-like were reduced at the early submergence phase and induced after 24 h of submergence. The predicted targets for these miRNAs were involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism, including starch synthase, invertase, malic enzyme and ATPase. In addition, many of the predicted targets were involved in the elimination of reactive oxygen species and acetaldehyde. Overall, most of the targets of induced miRNAs contained the cis-acting element, which is essential for the anaerobic response or hormone induction.CONCLUSIONS: Submergence-responsive miRNAs are involved in the regulation of metabolic, physiological and morphological adaptations of maize roots at the post-transcriptional level."

We therefore utilized a recently designed 16S rRNA gene microarray, the PhyloChip, which targets 8741 bacterial and archaeal taxa, to interrogate microbial communities inhabiting densely vegetated and bare fell-field soils along a latitudinal gradient ranging from 51 degrees S (Falkland Islands) to 72 degrees S (Coal Nunatak). Results indicated a clear decrease in diversity with increasing latitude, with the two southernmost sites harboring the most distinct Bacterial and Archaeal communities. The microarray approach proved more sensitive in detecting the breadth of microbial diversity than polymerase chain reaction-based bacterial 16S rRNA gene libraries of modest size ( approximately 190 clones per library). Furthermore, the relative signal intensities summed for phyla and families on the PhyloChip were significantly correlated with the relative occurrence of these taxa in clone libraries.

Little is known about the biological mechanisms by which nematode-bacterial interactions are achieved, largely because in the laboratory nematodes are often cultured under artificial conditions. We investigated the bacterial interactions of nematodes from the genus Pristionchus that have a strong association with scarab beetles. Pristionchus has a different feeding strategy than Caenorhabditis and meta-genomic 16S sequence analysis of Pristionchus individuals showed a diversity of living bacteria within the nematode gut and on the nematode cuticle. Twenty-three different bacterial strains were isolated from three Pristionchus-beetle associations and were used to study nematode-bacterial interactions under controlled laboratory conditions. We show a continuum of bacterial interactions from dissemination, to reduction in brood size and nematode mortality caused by bacteria derived from insect hosts. Olfactory discrimination experiments show distinct chemoattraction and fitness profiles of Pristionchus nematodes when exposed to different bacteria. For example, Pristionchus pacificus avoids Serratia marcescens possibly because of pathogenicity. Also, P. pacificus avoids Bacillus thuringiensis and insect pathogenic bacteria but is resistant to the human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, unlike Caenorhabditis elegans.

After ultracentrifugation, (13)C-labelled DNA, containing genomic DNA of these Methylocystis spp., was separated from (12)C DNA and subjected to multiple displacement amplification (MDA) to generate sufficient DNA for the preparation of a fosmid metagenomic library. Potential bias of MDA was detected by fingerprint analysis of 16S rRNA using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for low-template amplification (0.01 ng template). Sufficient template (1-5 ng) was used in MDA to circumvent this bias and chimeric artefacts were minimized by using an enzymatic treatment of MDA-generated DNA with S1 nuclease and DNA polymerase I.

In the first experiment, we examined bacterial community structure in bulk and rhizosphere soils in fields exposed to different plant diversity treatments, via a 16S rRNA gene clone library approach. Clear differences were observed between bacterial communities of the bulk soil and the rhizosphere, with the latter containing lower bacterial diversity. The second experiment focused on the influence of 12 different native grassland plant species on bacterial community size and structure in the rhizosphere, as well as the structure of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia community structures. In general, bacterial and phylum-specific quantitative PCR and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed only weak influences of plant species on rhizosphere communities. Thus, although plants did exert an influence on microbial species composition and diversity, these interactions were not specific and selective enough to lead to major impacts of vegetation composition and plant species on below-ground microbial communities."

Since conventional production methods retrieve only about one-third of the oil in place, either large new fields or innovative strategies for recovering energy resources from existing fields are needed to meet the burgeoning demand. The anaerobic biodegradation of n-alkanes to methane gas has now been documented in a few studies, and it was speculated that this process might be useful for recovering energy from existing petroleum reservoirs. We found that residual oil entrained in a marginal sandstone reservoir core could be converted to methane, a key component of natural gas, by an oil-degrading methanogenic consortium. Methane production required inoculation, and rates ranged from 0.15 to 0.40 micromol/day/g core (or 11 to 31 micromol/day/g oil), with yields of up to 3 mmol CH(4)/g residual oil. Concomitant alterations in the hydrocarbon profile of the oil-bearing core revealed that alkanes were preferentially metabolized. The consortium was found to produce comparable amounts of methane in the absence or presence of sulfate as an alternate electron acceptor. Cloning and sequencing exercises revealed that the inoculum comprised sulfate-reducing, syntrophic, and fermentative bacteria acting in concert with aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Collectively, the cells generated methane from a variety of petroliferous rocks. Such microbe-based methane production holds promise for producing a clean-burning and efficient form of energy from underutilized hydrocarbon-bearing resources."

However, previous studies have indicated that regardless of the utilized approach, species richness estimates obtained are dependent on the size of the analyzed clone libraries. We here propose an approach to overcome sample size bias in species richness estimates in complex microbial communities. Parametric (Maximum likelihood-based and rarefaction curve-based) and non-parametric approaches were used to estimate species richness in a library of 13,001 near full-length 16S rRNA clones derived from soil, as well as in multiple subsets of the original library. Species richness estimates obtained increased with the increase in library size. To obtain a sample size-unbiased estimate of species richness, we calculated the theoretical clone library sizes required to encounter the estimated species richness at various clone library sizes, used curve fitting to determine the theoretical clone library size required to encounter the &quot;true&quot; species richness, and subsequently determined the corresponding sample size-unbiased species richness value. Using this approach, sample size-unbiased estimates of 17,230, 15,571, and 33,912 were obtained for the ML-based, rarefaction curve-based, and ACE-1 estimators, respectively, compared to bias-uncorrected values of 15,009, 11,913, and 20,909."

In this study, a set of 13 previously used and novel reverse primers was tested with the canonical forward primer as to the DGGE fingerprints obtained from grassland soil. Analysis of these DGGE profiles by GelCompar showed that they all fell into two main clusters separated by a G/A alteration at position 14 in the reverse primer used. To assess differences between the dominant bacteria amplified, we then produced four (100-membered) 16S rRNA gene clone libraries by using reverse primers with either an A or a G at position 14, designated R1401-1a, R1401-1b, R1401-2a, and R1401-2b.

The aim of this study was to identify and spatially characterize the specific microbial communities associated with Shark Bay intertidal columnar stromatolites. Conventional culturing methods and construction of 16S rDNA clone libraries from community genomic DNA with both universal and specific PCR primers were employed. The estimated coverage, richness and diversity of stromatolite microbial populations were compared with earlier studies on these ecosystems. The estimated coverage for all clone libraries indicated that population coverage was comprehensive. Phylogenetic analyses of stromatolite and surrounding seawater sequences were performed in ARB with the Greengenes database of full-length non-chimaeric 16S rRNA genes. The communities identified exhibited extensive diversity. The most abundant sequences from the stromatolites were alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria (58%), whereas the cyanobacterial community was characterized by sequences related to the genera Euhalothece, Gloeocapsa, Gloeothece, Chroococcidiopsis, Dermocarpella, Acaryochloris, Geitlerinema and Schizothrix. All clones from the archaeal-specific clone libraries were related to the halophilic archaea; however, no archaeal sequence was identified from the surrounding seawater. Fluorescence in situ hybridization also revealed stromatolite surfaces to be dominated by unicellular cyanobacteria, in contrast to the sub-surface archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria. This study is the first to compare the microbial composition of morphologically similar stromatolites over time and examine the spatial distribution of specific microorganismic groups in these intertidal structures and the surrounding seawater at Shark Bay.

The species of the genus are phenotypically closely related, making rapid identification of Pantoea strains to the species level difficult. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) was evaluated as a means for rapid classification and identification of Pantoea strains. Four housekeeping genes, gyrB, rpoB, atpD and infB, were sequenced for strains assigned to the genus. Included in the study were (1) reference strains from the seven currently recognized species of Pantoea, (2) strains belonging to Brenner DNA groups II, IV and V, previously isolated from clinical samples and difficult to identify because of high phenotypic similarity to P. agglomerans or P. ananatis and (3) isolates from diseased Eucalyptus, maize and onion, assigned to the genus on the basis of phenotypic tests. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the sequences of the four housekeeping genes. The &quot;core&quot;Pantoea species formed a cluster separate from the &quot;Japanese&quot; species which formed a tight cluster that included the genus Tatumella when the tree was based on concatenated sequences of the four genes. The MLSA data further suggested the existence of ten potential novel species, phylogenetically related to the currently recognized Pantoea species and the possible inclusion of Pectobacterium cypripedii in the genus Pantoea. When compared with DNA-DNA hybridization data, a good congruence was observed between both methods, with gyrB sequence data being the most consistent.

Microbial diversity was similar in the active layer (surface) soil, permafrost table and permafrost horizons while the ground ice microbial community showed low diversity.

Glycine mutations in the triple helix have been identified in both Bethlem and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, but it is not known why they cause these different phenotypes.METHODS: We studied eight new patients who presented with a spectrum of clinical severity, screened the three collagen VI messenger RNA for mutations, and examined collagen VI biosynthesis and the assembly pathway.RESULTS: All eight patients had heterozygous glycine mutations toward the N-terminal end of the triple helix. The mutations produced two assembly phenotypes. In the first patient group, collagen VI dimers accumulated in the cell but not the medium, microfibril formation in the medium was moderately reduced, and the amount of collagen VI in the extracellular matrix was not significantly altered. The second group had more severe assembly defects: some secreted collagen VI tetramers were not disulfide bonded, microfibril formation in the medium was severely compromised, and collagen VI in the extracellular matrix was reduced.INTERPRETATION: These data indicate that collagen VI glycine mutations impair the assembly pathway in different ways and disease severity correlates with the assembly abnormality. In mildly affected patients, normal amounts of collagen VI were deposited in the fibroblast matrix, whereas in patients with moderate-to-severe disability, assembly defects led to a reduced collagen VI fibroblast matrix. This study thus provides an explanation for how different glycine mutations produce a spectrum of clinical severity."

To assess the distribution of type III secretion systems (TTSS), a PCR-based system for the broad detection of a highly conserved gene involved in TTSS, that is hrcR, was developed and used to assay the cultured bacteria from the L. proxima mycosphere and surrounding bulk soil. PCR-DGGE based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene showed the selection of presumably mycosphere-specific bacterial groups in the mycosphere of L. proxima compared to the bulk soil in 3 sampling years. Moreover, plate counts revealed that the numbers of culturable heterotrophic bacteria were increased in the mycosphere as compared to the bulk soil. Strikingly, the percentage of randomly picked isolates that carried the hrcR gene showed a significant increase, from 2.8 in the bulk to 13.4 in the mycosphere soil. The increase could be mainly attributed to the emergence of a hrcR positive Pseudomonas fluorescens, denoted BS053, which constituted the most dominant species in the culturable mycosphere communities. This organism was, together with a hrcR-positive Burkholderia terrae BS110, exclusively found in mycosphere soil. Direct detection of hrcR genes using a cultivation-independent approach showed the selection of several hrcR gene types uniquely in the mycosphere, indicating the selection of several TTSS-harboring bacterial species.

In this study, we report on the detection of a novel group of dehalorespiring bacteria that reductively dechlorinate PCE to cis-dichloroethene by RNA-based stable isotope probing. Pristine river sediment was incubated at 15 degrees C with PCE at low aqueous concentration. Upon formation of dechlorination products, the microbial community was probed with (13)C-labelled acetate as electron donor and carbon source. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of density-separated 16S rRNA revealed a predominantly (13)C-labelled bacterial population only in the microcosm with PCE in high-density gradient fractions, whereas in the control without PCE Bacteria-specific rRNA was restricted to light gradient fractions. By cloning and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA, the predominant population was identified as a novel group of bacteria within the phylum Chloroflexi. These microorganisms, designated Lahn Cluster (LC), were only distantly related to cultivated dehalorespiring Dehalococcoides spp. (92-94% sequence identity). Minor clone groups detected (13)C-labelled and thus, potentially involved in PCE dehalorespiration, were related to beta-proteobacterial Dechloromonas spp., and delta-Proteobacteria (Geobacteraceae, Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfobulbaceae). In contrast, clones from an ethene-producing microcosm incubated at 20 degrees C grouped with known Dehalococcoides spp. Our results show that stable isotope probing allows targeting dehalorespiring bacteria as functional guild, and to identify novel PCE-respiring populations previously not recognized."

Using transcriptional analyses to study microbial gene functions is currently problematic due to difficulties working with unstable microbial mRNA as a small fraction of total cellular RNA. Current techniques can be expensive and time consuming, and still result in significant levels of rRNA contamination. We have adapted techniques to rapidly isolate high high-quality RNA from environmental samples and developed a simple method for specific isolation of mRNA by size separation. This new technique was evaluated by constructing cDNA libraries directly from uncultured environmental microbial communities, including agricultural soil samples, aquatic flocculants, organic composts, mammalian oral and faecal samples, and wastewater sludge. The sequencing of a fraction of these cDNA clones revealed a high degree of novelty, demonstrating the potential of this approach to capture a large number of unique transcripts directly from the environment. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses gel electrophoresis to isolate mRNA from microbial communities. We conclude that this method could be used to provide insights into the microbial 'metatranscriptome' of entire microbial communities.

Malus baccata is widely used as an apple rootstock in north China and is highly resistant to low temperatures. There are few studies on iron absorption by this species at the molecular level. It is very important to understand the mechanism of iron uptake and transport in such woody plants. As a helpful tool, the aim of the present study was the cloning and functional analysis of NRAMP (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein) genes from the apple tree in relation to trafficking of micronutrients (Fe, Mn and Cd).METHODS: Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) combined with RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was adopted to isolate the full-length NRAMP1 cDNA. Southern blotting was used to test gene copy information, and northern blot was used to detect the gene's expression level. Complementation experiments using the yeast mutant strains DEY1453 and SLY8 were employed to confirm the iron- and manganese-transporting ability of NRAMP1 from apple, and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry was used to measure Cd accumulation in yeast. NRAMP1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was used to determine the cellular localization in yeast.KEY RESULTS: A 2090 bp cDNA was isolated and named MbNRAMP1. It encodes a predicted polypeptide of 551 amino acids. MbNRAMP1 exists in the M. baccata genome as a single copy and was expressed mainly in roots. MbNRAMP1 rescued the phenotype of yeast mutant strains DEY1453 and SLY8, and also increased Cd2+ sensitivity and accumulation. MbNRAMP1 expression in yeast was largely influenced by iron status, and the expression pattern of MbNRAMP1-GFP varied with the environmental iron nutrition status.CONCLUSIONS: MbNRAMP1 encodes a functional metal transporter capable of mediating the distribution of ions as well as transport of the micronutrients, Fe and Mn, and the toxic metal, Cd."

Comparing and contrasting these MPSS floral expression libraries enabled demarcation of transcripts enriched in the petals, stamens, stigma-style, gynoecia, and those with predicted enrichment within the sepal/sepal-petals, petal-stamens, or gynoecia-stamens.RESULTS: By comparison of expression libraries, a total of 572 genes were found to have organ-enriched expression within the inflorescence. The bulk of characterized organ-enriched transcript diversity was noted in the gynoecia and stamens, whereas fewer genes demonstrated sepal or petal-localized expression. Validation of the computational analyses was performed by comparison with previously published expression data, in situ hybridizations, promoter-reporter fusions, and reverse transcription PCR. A number of well-characterized genes were accurately delineated within our system of transcript filtration.

The vast majority (67 of 71) of the partial sequences recovered from clone libraries were greater than or equal to 97% similar to one another, 98% similar to sequences of pyrene-degrading bacteria previously detected by SIP with pyrene in different soil, and only 89% similar to the closest cultivated genus. All of the sequences recovered from the field-wet incubation and most of the sequences recovered from the slurry incubation were in this clade. Of the four sequences from slurry incubations not within this clade, three possessed greater than 99% similarity to the 16S rRNA gene sequences of phylogenetically dissimilar Caulobacter spp."

Whole genome sequence data indicate that prophage-derived sequences pervade prokaryotic genomes, but the connection between inferred prophage sequence and an active temperate phage is tenuous. Thus, definitive evidence of phage production from lysogenic prokaryotes will be critical in determining the presence and extent of temperate phage diversity existing as prophage within bacterial genomes and within environmental contexts such as soils. This study optimized methods for systematic and definitive determination of lysogeny within a collection of autochthonous soil bacteria. Twenty bacterial isolates from a range of Delaware soil environments (five from each soil) were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin C (MC) or UV light. Six isolates (30%) carried inducible temperate phages as evidenced by an increase in virus direct counts. The magnitude of induction response was highly dependent upon specific induction conditions, and corresponding burst sizes ranged from 1 to 176. Treatment with MC for 30 min yielded the largest induction responses for three of the six lysogens. Morphological analysis revealed that four of the lysogens produced lambda-like Siphoviridae particles, whereas two produced Myoviridae particles. Additionally, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data indicated that two of the six lysogens were polylysogens, producing more than one distinct type of phage particle. These results suggest that lysogeny is relatively common among soil bacteria."

These microbes form endospores that can survive high-temperature, short-time pasteurization; hence, their presence in raw milk represents a major potential cause of milk spoilage. A previously developed culture-dependent selection strategy and an rpoB sequence-based subtyping method were applied to bacterial isolates obtained from environmental samples collected on a New York State dairy farm. A total of 54 different rpoB allelic types putatively identified as Bacillus (75% of isolates), Paenibacillus (24%), and Sporosarcina spp. (1%) were identified among 93 isolates. Assembly of a broader data set, including 93 dairy farm isolates, 57 raw milk tank truck isolates, 138 dairy plant storage silo isolates, and 336 pasteurized milk isolates, identified a total of 154 rpoB allelic types, representing an extensive diversity of Bacillus and Paenibacillus spp. Our molecular subtype data clearly showed that certain endospore-forming bacterial subtypes are present in the dairy farm environment as well as in the processing plant. The potential for entry of these ubiquitous heat-resistant spoilage organisms into milk production and processing systems, from the dairy farm to the processing plant, represents a considerable challenge that will require a comprehensive farm-to-table approach to fluid milk quality."

Community level physiological profiles (CLPPs) based on sole C source oxidation have been used as a fast and reproducible tool to study soil microbial functional diversity because the utilisation of available carbon is the key factor governing microbial growth in soil. Our aim was to assess the phylogenetic affiliation of the microorganisms responsible for C consumption after inoculating Biolog plates. For this purpose, two semi-arid Mediterranean forest soils with significantly different patterns of C consumption and microbial community structure were used. Following the inoculation of the Biolog plates, suspensions from seven wells were sampled after 1, 2 and 7 d of incubation. DNA was extracted and the microbial communities analysed by polymerase chain reaction followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and sequencing of excised bands. Despite major differences in the microbial communities of the soils studied, their DGGE banding patterns after incubation were similar for all the analysed C source suspensions. Microorganisms belonging to beta-Proteobacteria (Ralstonia sp. and Burkholderia sp.) and alpha-Proteobacteria (Rhizobium sp.) were dominant. These opportunists had a competitive advantage under the conditions at which the CLPPs were analysed. This study reveals that significantly different CLPP patterns can be generated on the basis of only 3-4 genera, as reflected by PCR-DGGE analysis. Also for this reason, CLPPs based on incubations of soil suspensions should just be used as a screening method and always be accompanied by other techniques for community analysis."

The major difficulties with these approaches are that they are not selective for actinomycetes - a group of gram-positive bacteria well known as a rich source of antibiotics. In order to efficiently access actinomycetes, a trap for specifically capturing and cultivating these microorganisms in situ has been developed, based on the ability of these bacteria to form hyphae and penetrate solid environments. The trap is formed by two semi-permeable membranes (0.2-0.6 microm pore-size bottom membrane and 0.03 microm pore-size top membrane) glued to a plastic washer with sterile agar or gellan gum inside. The trap is placed on top of soil, and filamentous microorganisms selectively penetrate into the device and form colonies. Decreasing the size of the pores of the lower membrane to 0.2 microm restricted penetration of fungi. The trap produced more filamentous actinobacteria, and a higher variety of them, as compared to a conventional Petri dish cultivation from the same soil sample. Importantly, the trap cultivation resulted in the isolation of unusual and rare actinomycetes."

In contrast, the T-RFLP analysis of the phyllosphere bacteria revealed in two of the 3 years significant differences in the community structure between the transgenic lines producing inulin and the other variants. This effect was studied in more detail through the analysis of bacterial isolates and a 16S rRNA gene clone library obtained from a transgenic line and the control. Both methods revealed a lower genetic diversity in the transgenic line and changes in the abundance of several bacterial groups. The isolates of the transgenic line were dominated by Bacilli, whereas most of the control isolates represented Actinobacteria. The clones were dominated by Proteobacteria, with main differences between both variants in Deltaproteobacteria, Bacilli and Bacteroidetes.

DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) was used to compare the effect of alternate methods of salicylate addition (spike vs slow, continuous addition) on the diversity of the enriched microbial community. After identification of salicylate degraders by SIP, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) primers were developed to quantify the abundances of three groups containing salicylate-utilizing organisms in the bioreactor community before and after enrichment. The different methods of salicylate addition were found to select for different microbial communities. Two groups containing salicylate-degrading bacteria increased in abundance substantially after enrichment by continuous addition of salicylate but did not increase in abundance in response to the spike addition, whereas a third group increased in abundance in response to both methods of salicylate addition. The initial rate of naphthalene mineralization increased significantly after enrichment by spike addition of salicylate, but neither phenanthrene nor benzo[a] pyrene mineralization rates were enhanced. Continuous addition of salicylate did not enhance the mineralization rate for any of the PAHs. These results suggest that enrichment with salicylate can select for naphthalene-degrading bacteria, but does not select for organisms responsible for degrading PAHs of higher molecular weight. Differences in microbial selection observed in this study that resulted from different rates of carbon source addition also have implications for the design of SIP experiments with water-soluble carbon sources."

It is hypothesized that differences in feeding and housing strategies of cows may influence the microbial quality of milk. This assumption was investigated through comparison of the aerobic spore-forming flora in milk from organic and conventional dairy farms. Laboratory pasteurized milk samples from five conventional and five organic dairy farms, sampled in late summer/autumn and in winter, were plated on a standard medium and two differential media, one screening for phospholipolytic and the other for proteolytic activity of bacteria. Almost 930 isolates were obtained of which 898 could be screened via fatty acid methyl ester analysis. Representative isolates were further analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and (GTG)(5)-PCR. The majority of aerobic spore-formers in milk belonged to the genus Bacillus and showed at least 97% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with type strains of Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus subtilis and with type strains of species belonging to the Bacillus cereus group. About 7% of all isolates may belong to possibly new spore-forming taxa. Although the overall diversity of aerobic spore-forming bacteria in milk from organic vs. conventional dairy farms was highly similar, some differences between both were observed: (i) a relatively higher number of thermotolerant organisms in milk from conventional dairy farms compared to organic farms (41.2% vs. 25.9%), and (ii) a relatively higher number of B. cereus group organisms in milk from organic (81.3%) and Ureibacillus thermosphaericus in milk from conventional (85.7%) dairy farms. One of these differences, the higher occurrence of B. cereus group organisms in milk from organic dairy farms, may be linked to differences in housing strategy between the two types of dairy farming. However, no plausible clarification was found for the relatively higher number of thermotolerant organisms and the higher occurrence of U. thermosphaericus in milk from conventional dairy farms. Possibly this is due to differences in feeding strategy but no decisive indications were found to support this assumption."

We have developed a 16S rRNA-based taxonomic microarray that targets key actinomycetes at the genus level. In total, 113 actinomycete 16S rRNA probes, corresponding to 55 of the 202 described genera, were designed. The microarray accuracy was evaluated by comparing signal intensities with probe/target-weighted mismatch values and the Gibbs energy of the probe/target duplex formation by hybridizing 17 non-actinomycete and 29 actinomycete strains/clones with the probe set. The validation proved that the probe set was specific, with only 1.3% of false results. The incomplete coverage of actinomycetes by a genus-specific probe was caused by the limited number of 16S rRNA gene sequences in databases or insufficient 16S rRNA gene polymorphism. The microarray enabled discrimination between actinomycete communities from three forest soil samples collected at one site. Cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from one of the soil samples confirmed the microarray results. We propose that this newly constructed microarray will be a valuable tool for genus-level comparisons of actinomycete communities in various ecological conditions."

Compared to the bacterial gene libraries, greater coverage of the underlying population was achieved with the fungal 18S rRNA libraries. Members of the Zygomycota, Chytridiomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota were recovered from both libraries. The dominant groups of fungi associated with each tree type were very similar, although there were some qualitative differences in the recovery of less-abundant fungi, likely as a result of the underlying heterogeneity of the fungal population.

The cultivation method simulated natural conditions by using polycarbonate membranes as a growth support and a nonsterile soil slurry as a culture medium. Resistant bacteria were pregrown to microcolony-forming units (mCFU) before being plated on standard medium. Compared to direct plating, culturability was increased up to 2,800 times and numbers of mCFU were similar to the total number of mercury-resistant bacteria in the soils. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of DNA extracted from membranes suggested stimulation of growth of hard-to-culture bacteria during the preincubation. A total of 25 different 16S rRNA gene sequences were observed, including Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria; Actinobacteria; Firmicutes; and Bacteroidetes. The diversity of isolates obtained by direct plating included eight different 16S rRNA gene sequences (Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria). Partial sequencing of merA of selected isolates led to the discovery of new merA sequences. With phylum-specific merA primers, PCR products were obtained for Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria but not for Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The similarity to known sequences ranged between 89 and 95%. One of the sequences did not result in a match in the BLAST search.

Roots of Dichanthelium lanuginosum, a grass only occurring in geothermal areas, were sampled along with thermal and nonthermal Agrostis scabra and control plants growing outside the thermally influenced sites. In addition, root samples of Agrostis stolonifera from geothermal areas of Iceland were analyzed to identify possible common mycosymbionts between these geographically isolated locations.

The most diverse and abundant lineage was Glomus group A, with the most frequent phylotype corresponding to Glomus intraradices. Five of the seven phylotypes detected in a preliminary sampling in a geothermal area in Iceland were also found in YNP. Nonthermal vegetation was dominated by a high diversity of Glomus group A phylotypes while nonthermal plants were not. Using multivariate analyses, a subset of three phylotypes were determined to be associated with geothermal conditions in the field sites analyzed.

Our results indicate that the capability of oxalate utilization seems to be an uncommon trait and could be used as a valuable taxonomic criterion for differentiation of Methylobacterium species."

Phenotypic patterns showed adaptations of the rhizobial strains to many environmental stresses such as heat, drought, and salinity. Twelve molecular groups were distinguished by profiles obtained using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques from intergenic spacer region rDNA. The highest genetic diversity was found around the A. senegal rhizosphere. Therefore, A. senegal seemed to have a positive influence on occurrence and genotypical diversity of rhizobial populations. Rhizobial isolates obtained in this study belonged phylogenetically to the genera Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium.CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided information about the genetic diversity of the rhizobial strains associated with A. senegal and suggested the adaptability of natural rhizobial populations to major ecological environmental stress within these soil environments.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results suggested a potential selection of compatible and well adapted strains under stress conditions as inoculants for successful A. senegal growth in arid lands."

The rice field plot consisted of eighteen subplots planted with two genetically modified (GM) rice and four non-GM rice plants in three replicates. Analysis with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes revealed that the bacterial community structures were quite similar to each other in a given month, suggesting that there were no significant differences in bacterial communities between GM and non- GM rice soils. The bacterial community structures appeared to be generally stable with the seasons, as shown by a slight variation of microbial population levels and DGGE banding patterns over the year. Comparison analysis of 16S rDNA clone libraries constructed from soil bacterial DNA showed that there were no significant differences between GM and non-GM soil libraries but revealed seasonal differences of phyla distribution between August and December. The composition profile of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) between GM and non-GM soils also was not significantly different to each other. When soil DNAs were analyzed with PCR by using primers for the bar gene, which was introduced into GM rice, positive DNA bands were found in October and December soils. However, no bar gene sequence was detected in PCR analysis with DNAs extracted from both cultured and uncultured soil bacterial fractions. The result of this study suggested that, in spite of seasonal variations of bacterial communities and persistence of the bar gene, the bacterial communities of the experimental rice field were not significantly affected by cultivation of GM rice varieties."

Among them, isolate MKRh3 was specifically chosen as the most favorable cadmium-resistant plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium based on its higher 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid deaminase activity, siderophore production, phosphate solubilization, and auxin synthesis and the in vivo growth increment of black gram plants. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing identified MKRh3 as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effect of cadmium on black gram plants was studied in soil amended with a gradient of CdCl(2) concentration and the toxicity was evident from stunted growth, poor rooting, and cadmium accumulation. Application of isolate MKRh3 by seed coating overcomes the cadmium toxicity; plants showed lessened cadmium accumulation, extensive rooting, and enhanced plant growth. Further research and development of this promising innate strategy for scale-up to higher-efficiency and large-scale application will be a potent tool to prevent accumulation of cadmium in plants, thereby ensuring food security for humans."

These fungi have been studied both because of their unique predatory life history and because they are potential control agents of important plant- and animal-parasitic nematodes. Ecological studies of nematode-trapping fungi have primarily used culture-based methods, but molecular detection techniques are now available and should be useful for studying this group. We developed Orbiliales-specific PCR primers for the ITS and 28s rDNA to directly detect nematode-trapping fungi without culturing and also to screen fungal isolates for phylogenetic placement in the Orbiliales. We used these primers to selectively amplify, clone, and sequence Orbiliales DNA extracted from soil, litter, and wood, and we compared the results of molecular detection with those obtained using a culture-based method. Of the eight species of nematode-trapping Orbiliales detected with the culture-based assay, only three were detected with PCR.

In most cases, the NF negatively correlated with salt content and alkalinity. Five enrichments at pH 10 under micro-oxic conditions with glucose resulted in stable haloalkaliphilic mixed cultures, with diazotrophic component(s) active up to 2.0-3.0 M total Na(+).

Isolation of pure cultures of haloalkaliphilic diazotrophs from micro-oxic enrichments yielded nine strains, comprising two phylogenetic lineages.

We found that T. buchloëana induces hermaphroditism in not only male sex forms of buffalograss by inducing the development of otherwise vestigial pistils but also in female sex forms by inducing hypertrophy of otherwise vestigial stamens (male sex organs). The fungus also induces the development of additional pistillate flowers in both infected male and female plants. Due to its pistil inducing effects we refer to T. buchloëana as pistil smut. Pistil smut exhibits a combination of morphological and life cycle characteristics that are unique among species of order Tilletiales. Phylogenetic analyses of nLSU-rDNA sequences using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and genetic distance-based methods show that pistil smut exhibits an elevated rate of nucleotide substitution and is as, or more, distant from Tilletia species than the basal group Erratomyces patelli.

However, its applications are limited due to a lack of genetic sequence information for organisms used in ecotoxicological studies. We used high-coverage expression profiling (HiCEP), a method that requires no prior sequence knowledge, to examine stress-responsive genes and their dose dependence in the springtail Folsomia candida using gamma radiation as the stressor. Radiation-responsive genes and their dose dependency were detected at effective doses for reproduction, and 16 up-regulated transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were sequenced. Quantitative PCR analysis also found that most of the TDFs were up-regulated. The sequences of the TDFs showed resemblance to known genes, such as glutathione S-transferase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, but most showed no similarity to any genes in the gene databases. These results suggest that HiCEP is effective for discovering differently expressed genes and their dose dependence, even in organisms for which few sequence data are available. The limited length of the TDFs, however, may impede functional annotation of the genes. In conclusion, HiCEP is useful for ecotoxicogenomic studies in which various organisms with few available genomic resources are involved."

It is hypothesized that natural areas play an important role for survival and that soil may serve as a source of inoculum for new aphid populations in spring. To test these hypotheses, a cultivation-independent PCR-based diagnostic tool was developed, that allows the detection of P. neoaphidis in the environment. Two P. neoaphidis specific PCR primer pairs were designed, targeting sequences in the ribosomal RNA gene cluster. Specificity of both primer pairs was demonstrated with P. neoaphidis and non-target close entomophthoralean relatives. Moreover, single amplicons of expected sizes were obtained with both primer pairs from various environmental sample types, including aphid cadavers, plant material, and soil.

It has been reported in Belgium since the 1980s. The control of this disease is managed almost exclusively through the use of resistant varieties. The resistance of most commercial barley cultivars grown in Europe is conferred mainly by a single recessive gene, rym4. This monogenic resistance provides immunity against BaYMV pathotype 1 and has been mapped on barley chromosome 3HL and shown to be caused by mutations in the translation initiation factor eIF4E. Another pathotype, BaYMV pathotype 2, which appeared in the late 1980s (in Belgium, in the early 1990s), is able to overcome the rym4-controlled resistance. Until recently, this pathotype remained confined to specific locations. During a systematic survey in 2003, mosaic symptoms were observed only on susceptible barley cultivars collected in Belgian fields. BaYMV was detected by ELISA and RT-PCR on the susceptible cultivars and only by RT-PCR on the resistant cultivars. In 2004, mosaic symptoms were observed on susceptible and resistant cultivars. BaYMV was detected by ELISA and RT-PCR on both cultivars. In addition to developing RT-PCR methods for detecting and identifying BaYMV and Barley mild mosaic virus (BaMMV), an RT-PCR targeting the VPg/NIa viral protein part of the genome, known to discriminate the two BaYMV pathotypes, was set up to accurately identify the pathotype(s) now present in Belgium. The sequences from the generated amplicons revealed the single nucleotide substitution resulting in an amino acid change from lysine to asparagine specific to BaYMV pathotype 2. The possible reasons for the change in the BaYMV pathotype situation in Belgium, such as climatic change or a progressive build-up of soil inoculum potential, will be discussed, as well as the use of eIF4E-based resistance."

The general method of sampling and categorizing DNA has been to clone then sequence the PCR products. However, the number of clones required to adequately catalog the majority of taxa in a sample is unwieldy. Alternatively, hybridizing target sequences to a universal 16S rRNA gene microarray may provide a more rapid and comprehensive view of prokaryotic community composition. This study investigated the breadth and accuracy of a microarray in detecting diverse 16S rRNA gene sequence types compared to clone-and-sequencing using three environmental samples: urban aerosol, subsurface soil, and subsurface water. PCR products generated from universal 16S rRNA gene-targeted primers were classified by using either the clone-and-sequence method or by hybridization to a novel high-density microarray of 297,851 probes complementary to 842 prokaryotic subfamilies. The three clone libraries comprised 1391 high-quality sequences. Approximately 8% of the clones could not be placed into a known subfamily and were considered novel. The microarray results confirmed the majority of clone-detected subfamilies and additionally demonstrated greater amplicon diversity extending into phyla not observed by the cloning method. Sequences matching operational taxonomic units within the phyla Nitrospira, Planctomycetes, and TM7, which were uniquely detected by the array, were verified with specific primers and subsequent amplicon sequencing. Subfamily richness detected by the array corresponded well with nonparametric richness predictions extrapolated from clone libraries except in the water community where clone-based richness predictions were greatly exceeded. It was concluded that although the microarray is unreliable in identifying novel prokaryotic taxa, it reveals greater diversity in environmental samples than sequencing a typically sized clone library. Furthermore, the microarray allowed samples to be rapidly evaluated with replication, a significant advantage in studies of microbial ecology."

Here, we report a simple array platform that can detect 553 nonredundant miRNAs encompassing the entire set of miRNAs for humans and mice. The platform features carefully selected and designed probes with optimized hybridization parameters. Potential cross-reaction between mature miRNAs and their precursors was investigated. The array platform was used to analyze miRNAs in the mouse central nervous system (CNS, spinal cord and brain), and two other non-CNS organs (liver and heart). Two types of miRNAs, differentially expressed organ/tissue-associated miRNAs and ubiquitously expressed miRNAs, were detected in the array analysis. In addition to the previously reported neuron-related miR-124a, liver-related miR-122a, and muscle-related miR-133a, we also detected new tissue-associated miRNAs (e.g., liver-associated miR-194). Interestingly, while the majority of pre-miRNAs were undetectable, miR690, miR709, and miR720 were clearly detected at both mature and precursor levels by the array analysis, indicating a limited cross-reaction between pre-miRNAs and their mature miRNAs. The reliability of this array technology was validated by comparing the results with independent Northern blot analyses and published data. A new approach of data normalization based on Northern blot analysis of one ubiquitously expressed miRNA is introduced and compared with traditional approaches.

Such a library contains genes that are expressed by each of the different organisms forming the community and represents its metatranscriptome. The diversity of the organisms that contributed to this library was evaluated by sequencing a portion of the 18S rDNA gene amplified from either soil DNA or reverse-transcribed RNA. More than 70% of the sequences were from fungi and unicellular eukaryotes (protists) while the other most represented group was the metazoa. Calculation of richness estimators suggested that more than 180 species could be present in the soil samples studied. Sequencing of 119 cDNA identified genes with no homologues in databases (32%) and genes coding proteins involved in different biochemical and cellular processes. Surprisingly, the taxonomic distribution of the cDNA and of the 18S rDNA genes did not coincide, with a marked under-representation of the protists among the cDNA. Specific genes from such an environmental cDNA library could be isolated by expression in a heterologous microbial host, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This is illustrated by the functional complementation of a histidine auxotrophic yeast mutant by two cDNA originating possibly from an ascomycete and a basidiomycete fungal species.

Mineral phosphate solubilization through organic acid production appears to be the mechanism used by most diazotrophic Burkholderia species, but in B. tropica, there presumably exists an additional unknown mechanism. Most of the diazotrophic Burkholderia species produced hydroxamate-type siderophores. Certainly, the N2-fixing Burkholderia species associated with plants have great potential for agro-biotechnological applications."

To effectively exclude the interference of chloroplast DNA and mitochondrial DNA of rice, a pair of bacterial PCR primers (799f-1492r) was selected to specifically amplify bacterial 16S rDNA sequences directly from rice root tissues. Among 192 positive clones in the 16S rDNA library of endophytes, 52 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) were identified based on the similarity of the ARDRA banding profiles. Sequence analysis revealed diverse phyla of bacteria in the 16S rDNA library, which consisted of alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon subclasses of the Proteobacteria, Cytophaga/Flexibacter/Bacteroides (CFB) phylum, low G+C gram-positive bacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Acidobacteria, and archaea. The dominant group was Betaproteobacteria (27.08% of the total clones), and the most dominant genus was Stenotrophomonas. More than 14.58% of the total clones showed high similarity to uncultured bacteria, suggesting that nonculturable bacteria were detected in rice endophytic bacterial community.

Here we report the isolation of a methanogen (strain SANAE) belonging to an abundant and ubiquitous group of methanogens called rice cluster I (RC-I) previously identified as an ecologically important microbial component via culture-independent analyses. To enrich the RC-I methanogens from rice paddy samples, we attempted to mimic the in situ conditions of RC-I on the basis of the idea that methanogens in such ecosystems should thrive by receiving low concentrations of substrate (H(2)) continuously provided by heterotrophic H(2)-producing bacteria. For this purpose, we developed a coculture method using an indirect substrate (propionate) in defined medium and a propionate-oxidizing, H(2)-producing syntroph, Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans, as the H(2) supplier. By doing so, we significantly enriched the RC-I methanogens and eventually obtained a methanogen within the RC-I group in pure culture.

We reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships within Hippoboscoidea using maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods based on nucleotide sequences from fragments of four genes: nuclear 28S ribosomal DNA and the CPSase domain of CAD, and mitochondrial 16S rDNA and cytochrome oxidase I. We recover monophyly for most of the presently recognized groups within Hippoboscoidea including the superfamily as a whole, the Hippoboscidae, the Nycteribiidae, the bat flies, and the Pupipara (=Hippoboscidae+Nycteribiidae+Streblidae), as well as several subfamilies within the constituent families. Streblidae appear to be paraphyletic. Our phylogenetic hypothesis is well supported and decisive in that most competing topological hypotheses for the Hippoboscoidea require significantly longer trees. We confirm a single shift from a free-living fly to a blood-feeding ectoparasite of vertebrates and demonstrate that at least two host shifts from mammals to birds have occurred. Wings have been repeatedly lost, but never regained. The hippoboscoid ancestor also evolved adenotrophic viviparity and our cladogram is consistent with a gradual reduction in the motility of the deposited final instar larvae from active burrowing in the soil to true pupiparity where adult females glue the puparium within the confines of bat roosts."

In this study, we characterized a collection of 61 bacterial strains isolated from Scleroderma citrinum mycorrhizae, the mycorrhizosphere, and the adjacent bulk soil in an oak forest. The ability of bacteria to weather biotite was assessed with a new microplate bioassay that measures the pH and the quantity of iron released from this mineral. We showed that weathering bacteria occurred more frequently in the vicinity of S. citrinum than in the bulk soil. Moreover, the weathering efficacy of the mycorrhizosphere bacterial isolates was significantly greater than that of the bulk soil isolates. All the bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis as members of the genera Burkholderia, Collimonas, Pseudomonas, and Sphingomonas, and their carbon metabolism was characterized by the BIOLOG method. The most efficient isolates belonged to the genera Burkholderia and Collimonas. Multivariate analysis resulted in identification of three metabolic groups, one of which contained mainly bacterial isolates associated with S. citrinum and exhibiting high mineral-weathering potential.

Universal bacterial primers 24f and 1492r (modified and original versions) were used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene from the putative Actinobacteria. While both reverse primers failed to provide amplification products from 20% to 50% of the isolates, the 1492r primer detected Actinobacteria more effectively than 1492r-mod. The region of the gene containing the annealing site for the 1492r primers from 15 isolates that failed to amplify showed no differences in nucleotide sequence to the original 1492r primer.CONCLUSIONS: Universal 16S rRNA gene primers are not capable of amplifying this gene from all bacteria within an environmental sample.

Samples were collected at 17 sites along a trophic gradient ranging from mesotrophic to hypertrophic areas in August and September 2004. These sites cover two alternative stable states of shallow lakes, which are basically characterized by the dominance or the lack of submerged macrophytes. In the case of Taihu Lake, the macrophyte-dominated state is characterized by clear water and immobilized sediment, and the state largely lacking macrophytes is characterized by the dominance of phytoplankton, frequent wind-driven re-suspension of sediments, and a high turbidity. Three different methods, i.e. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), reverse line blot hybridization (RLB) with probes targeting 17 freshwater bacterial groups, and 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing, were used for analysis of BCC. The BCC varied strongly between the two alternative ecological states, but less pronounced between phytoplankton-dominated sites even spanning chlorophyll a gradients from 16.5 (mesotrophic) to 229.8 microg l(-1) (hypertrophic). The 16S rRNA gene library representing the turbid water state contained many sequences closely related to sequences previously obtained from soil or freshwater sediment samples. Furthermore, sequences representing two new lineages of freshwater Actinobacteria were obtained from the investigated samples.

Similar levels in the diversity of bacterial 16S rDNA amplicons were detected in soil samples collected from organically and conventionally managed plots 3 and 4 years after initiation of land management programs, whereas significantly lower levels of diversity were observed in samples collected from bahiagrass pasture. Differences in diversity were attributed to effects on how the relative abundance of individual amplicons were distributed (evenness) and not on the total numbers of bacterial 16S rDNA amplicons detected (richness). Similar levels of diversity were detected among all land management programs in soil samples collected after successive years of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) cultivation. A different trend was observed after a multivariate examination of the similarities in genetic composition among soil bacterial communities. After 3 years of land management, similarities in genetic composition of soil bacterial communities were observed in plots where disturbance was minimized (bahiagrass and weed fallow). The genetic compositions in plots managed organically were similar to each other and distinct from bacterial communities in other land management programs. After successive years of tomato cultivation and damage from two major hurricanes, only the composition of soil bacterial communities within organically managed plots continued to maintain a high degree of similarity to each other and remain distinct from other bacterial communities.

Hyphomicrobium spp. were involved in the metabolism of N,O-DMHA. Whereas several isolates degraded linuron independently, more efficient degradation was achieved by combining linuron and 3,4-DCA-degraders or by adding casamino acids.

The presence of several taxa, namely sequences affiliated to the orders Phyllopharyngia, Haptoria, Nassophorea, Peniculida and Scuticociliatia in samples from nonpolluted soil, points to the existence of various trophic functional groups. In contrast, the 18S rRNA gene diversity was much lower in the clone libraries from the polluted soil.

After hybridization, the captured nucleic acids were released by denaturation and purified of contaminating DNA using DNase. The resulting RNA was of high purity and there was no need for dilution of the samples prior to RT-PCR. The developed procedure was reproducibly used to quantify Salmonella sp. in high organic agricultural soil. The detection limit for mRNA using ordinary quantitative PCR (employing SYBRgreen-based detection) was 5 x 10(4)Salmonella sp. cells per gram of soil. Chicken manure amended into soil (1:4 w/w) did not reduce the ability to quantify Salmonella sp. mRNA in soil. Pasteurization (65 degrees C, 30 min) of chicken manure containing Salmonella sp. dramatically reduced the detection of invA mRNA (requiring 42 qPCR cycles for detection versus 26 cycles in unpasteurized manure), presumably due to degradation of the invA mRNA in Salmonella sp. cells killed by pasteurization. By contrast, DNA-based qPCR still detected Salmonella sp. in the pasteurized manure. Thus, in this case using samples seeded with fresh Salmonella sp. the mRNA-based detection appears to be superior to minimizing false-positive detection which was prevalent with DNA-based qPCR."

The differences between stream water and sediment were more significant than those between sites within the same habitat along the stretch from the stream source to the mouth.

As ascertained by nucleotide sequence analysis, stream water communities were dominated by Betaproteobacteria (one-third of the total bacteria), whereas sediment communities were composed mainly of Betaproteobacteria and members of the Fibrobacteres/Acidobacteria group (each accounting for about 25% of bacteria). Sequences obtained from bacteria from water samples indicated the presence of typical cosmopolitan freshwater organisms.

Using methods derived from plant landscape ecology, we measured the abundance and spatial distribution of cyanobacterial colonization on quartz stony pavement across environmental gradients of rainfall and temperature in the isolated Taklimakan and Qaidam Basin deserts of western China. Colonization within available habitat ranged from 0.37+/-0.16% to 12.6+/-1.8%, with cold dry desert sites exhibiting the lowest abundance.

Cyanobacterial communities were spatially aggregated at multiple scales in patterns distinct from the underlying rock pattern. Site-level differences in cyanobacterial spatial pattern (e.g. mean inter-patch distance) were linked with rainfall, whereas patchiness within sites was correlated with local geology (greater colonization frequency of large rocks) and biology (dispersal during rainfall).

In this study we show that RpoN is required for efficient colonization of sugar beet seedlings by the plant growth-promoting bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25, and use phenotypic and bioinformatic approaches to profile the RpoN-dependent traits and genes of P. fluorescens SBW25. RpoN is required for flagellar biosynthesis and for assimilation of a wide variety of nutrient sources including inorganic nitrogen, amino acids, sugar alcohols and dicarboxylic acids. Chemosensitivity assays indicate that RpoN-regulated genes contribute to acid tolerance and resistance to some antibiotics, including tetracyclines and aminoglycosides. Gain of function changes associated with loss of RpoN included increased tolerance to hydroxyurea and Guanazole. Bioinformatic predictions of RpoN-regulated genes show a close correspondence with phenotypic analyses of RpoN-regulated traits and suggest novel functions for RpoN in P. fluorescens, including regulation of poly(A) polymerase. The reduced plant colonization ability observed for an rpoN mutant of P. fluorescens is therefore likely to be due to defects in multiple traits including nutrient assimilation, protein secretion and stress tolerance."

Complex interactions occur between plants and nematodes during the nematode life cycle with plant roots developing specialized feeding structures through which nematodes withdraw nutrients. Here we describe a novel method for delivering macromolecules to feeding nematodes using a virus-based vector [tobacco rattle virus (TRV)]. We show that the parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii will ingest fluorescent proteins transiently expressed in plant roots infected with a TRV construct carrying the appropriate protein sequence. A prerequisite for this delivery is the presence of replicating virus in root tips prior to the formation of nematode-induced syncytia.

Culture and phylogenetic analyses of bulk biosolids provided a basis for the development of three different MST methods. They included (i) culture- and 16S rRNA gene-based identification of Clostridium bifermentans, (ii) direct PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene for an uncultured bacterium of the class Chloroflexi that is commonly present in anaerobically digested biosolids, and (iii) direct PCR amplification of a 16S rRNA gene of the phylum Euryarchaeota coupled with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism to distinguish terminal fragments that are unique to biosolid-specific microorganisms. Each method was first validated with a broad group of bulk biosolids and soil samples to confirm the target's exclusive presence in biosolids and absence in soils. Positive responses were observed in 100% of bulk biosolid samples and in less than 11% of the bulk soils tested. Next, a sampling campaign was conducted in which all three methods were applied to aerosol samples taken upwind and downwind of fields that had recently been land applied with biosolids. When average wind speeds were greater than 5 m/s, source tracking results confirmed the presence of biosolids in 56% of the downwind samples versus 3% of the upwind samples. During these high-wind events, the biosolid concentration in downwind aerosols was between 0.1 and 2 microg/m3.

Using culture methods with or without Acanthamoeba culbertsoni, a total of 22 isolates of legionellae were obtained from five of the nine samples. Identification of species and/or serogroups (SGs), performed by DNA-DNA hybridization and agglutination tests, revealed that the 22 isolates consisted of ten isolates of Legionella pneumophila including five SGs, five Legionella feeleii, and one each of Legionella dumoffii, Legionella longbeachae, and Legionella jamestownensis. The species of the remaining four isolates (strains OA1-1, -2, -3, and -4) could not be determined, suggesting that these isolates may belong to new species.

A phylogenetic tree created by analysis of the 16S rRNA (1270bp) genes demonstrated that the isolates formed distinct clusters within the genus Legionella. Quantitative DNA-DNA hybridization tests on the OA1 strains indicated that OA1-1 should be categorized as a new taxon, whereas OA1-2, -3, and -4 were also genetically independent in another taxon.

Ninety seven-isolates were identified to the species level by direct sequencing of fragments of 16S rRNA, hsp65 and rpoB genes. A total of 120 isolates were studied for the distribution analysis.RESULTS: Frequently identified NTM species were M. avium (30.8%), M. intracellulare (23.3%) and M. abscessus (18.3%). Others were M. gordonae, M. senegalense, M. fortuitum, M. peregrinum, M. kansasii, M. terrae complex, M. lentiflavum, M. chelonae, and M. szulgai. Three M. tuberculosis complex (2.5%) were also identified among the presumptive NTM isolates. The identification rate by sequencing of 16S rRNA, rpoB, and hsp65 were 65%, 82% and 87%, respectively. The hsp65 or rpoB gene was more efficient than 16S rRNA for the identification of NTM by sequencing.CONCLUSIONS: Some NTM are increasingly considered to be the causative organisms in clinical diseases. Thus, direct sequencing could be adapted to routine work of clinical laboratories for accurate identification of NTM to the species level."

Hypotheses regarding patterns of microbial composition relative to acquisition and dispersal of plumage bacteria in the ecosystem were tested by comparing microbial communities within and between soil and plumage. Samples from the plumage of American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) were collected across both habitat types and geographic scales for intraspecific comparisons. The microbial diversity in avian plumage was moderately diverse and was dominated by Pseudomonas species. Despite a highly significant individual bird effect on microbial composition of the plumage, we detected significant biogeographic and type of habitat effects. Pseudomonas species were more abundant on the temperate site when all avian species were included in the analysis, and Bacillus subtilis and Xanthomonas groups were more abundant on the Neotropical site for redstarts alone. However, 16S rDNA sequence libraries were not significantly different between Jamaican and Maryland redstarts. Biogeographic and habitat effects were significant and more pronounced for soil samples indicating lower dispersal of soil microbiota. We detected a significant difference between soil and plumage microbial communities suggesting that soil plays a small role in plumage bacterial acquisition.

The Catharanthus roseus G10H controls the first committed step in biosynthesis of terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIA). The C. roseus G10H promoter sequence was isolated by a PCR-based genome walking method. Sequence analysis revealed that the G10H promoter contains several potential eukaryotic regulatory elements involved in regulation of gene expression. The major transcription start site of the promoter was mapped to an adenine 31 bp downstream of the TATA-box. For functional characterization, transcriptional fusions between the G10H promoter fragments with 5' or 3' deletions and the GUS reporter gene were generated and their expressions were analyzed in a tobacco protoplast transient expression assay. Deletion of the promoter down to -318 bp had little effect on GUS activity. However, further deletion of the promoter to position -103 resulted in approximately 5-fold reduction of GUS activity. Gain-of-function experiments revealed the presence of three potential transcriptional enhancers located in regions between -191 and -147, -266 and -188, and -318 and -266, respectively. The G10H promoter was capable of conferring stable GUS expression in transgenic tobacco plants and C. roseus hairy roots. In transgenic tobacco seedlings GUS expression was tissue-specific, restricted to leaf and actively growing cells around the root tip, and not detected in the hypocotyls, root cap and older developing areas of the root. The GUS expression in both transgenic C. roseus hairy roots and tobacco seedlings were responsive to fungal elicitor and methyljasmonate. Compared to other known promoters of TIA pathway genes, the G10H promoter contains unique binding sites for several transcription factors, suggesting that the G10H promoter may be regulated by a different transcriptional cascade."

After the mold spores, which are the infectious particles, are inhaled into the lung of a susceptible mammalian host, they undergo a morphological change into a pathogenic yeast form. The ability to convert to the yeast form is essential for this class of fungal agents to be pathogenic and produce disease. Temperature change is one key stimulus that triggers the phase transition from mold (25 degrees ) to yeast (37 degrees ). Genes that are expressed only in the pathogenic yeast form of these fungi have been identified to help explain how and why this phase transition is required for virulence. However, the regulators of yeast-phase specific genes, especially of phase transition from mold to yeast, have remained poorly understood. We used Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer for insertional mutagenesis to create mutants that are defective in the phase transition and to identify genes that regulate this critical event.

These results indicate that rice NADP-ME2 responds to salts and osmotic stresses. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing NADP-ME2 were obtained through transformation, screening, Northern analysis and in situ NADP-ME activity assay. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing NADP-ME2 grew well in 1/2 x MS medium with 100 mM NaCl or 4% mannitol, whereas growth of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis seedlings was strongly inhibited.

To date, 19 types of phototrophic consortia are distinguished based on the different 16S rRNA gene sequences of their epibionts, but the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of the heterotrophic partner bacteria are still unknown.

Several cases of misidentification in a major culture collection have recently been reported. Here we provide evidence for misidentifications of two more gymnamoebae. The first concerns &quot;Gephyramoeba sp.&quot; ATCC 50654; it is not Gephyramoeba, a leptomyxid with lobose pseudopods, but a hitherto undescribed branching amoeba with fine, filamentous subpseudopods named here Acramoeba dendroida gen. et sp. nov. We also sequenced 18S rRNA of Page's strain of Rhizamoeba saxonica (CCAP 1570/2) and show that it is the most deeply branching leptomyxid and is not phylogenetically close to 'Rhizamoeba saxonica' ATCC 50742, which was misidentified. Correcting these misidentifications improves the congruence between morphological diversity of Amoebozoa and their rRNA-based phylogenies, both for Leptomyxida and for the Acramoeba part of the tree. On morphological grounds we transfer Gephyramoebidae from Varipodida back to Leptomyxida and remove Flamella from Leptomyxida; sequences are needed to confirm these two revisions."

Total community DNA was extracted and bacterial 16S rRNA genes were subsequently amplified, cloned, restriction fragment length polymorphism-screened and sequenced. Thirty-three unique sequence types were found among the 110 analysed positive clones from superstratum sample; 56 among 122 from middle-level sample and 32 among 114 from substrate sample, respectively. The sequences related to Clostridium sp. were most common in the composts. One hundred and thirteen out of 121 16S rDNA sequence types displayed homology with those in the GenBank database. Seven 16S rDNA sequence types were not closely related to any known species. The middle-level sample had the highest microbial diversity, containing unique sequences related to Lactosphaera pasteurii, Firmicutes sp., Aerococcus sp., Megasphaera sp. and Stenotrophomonas sp.CONCLUSIONS: Pile temperature significantly affected microbial community in the initial stage of the composting. Microbial community in different locations is quite different resulting from gradient effect.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results of this study reveal high bacterial diversity in manure composts, and provide molecular evidence to support gradient effect on microbial diversity in initial stage as well."

In total, 17 different AMF clades were identified, and most were members of the Glomaceae, Acaulosporaceae, and Gigasporaceae. The AMF community structures detected by spore sampling were inconsistent with those from plant roots. Of all AMF clades, six (35.3%) were detected only on the basis of spores, six (35.3%) only in roots, and five corresponded to both spores and roots (29.4%). Although an Acaulospora species was the most dominant among spores (67.1%), it accounted for only 6.8% in root samples. A species analysis of AMF communities at different altitudes demonstrated that AMF species diversity increased as altitude decreased and that the species enrichment at lower altitudes resulted from the addition of new species rather than species replacement. The inconsistencies in the species composition of spore communities with those in roots and the change in species diversity with altitude are discussed."

The cultivation methods were restricted to recover lactate-utilizing species with the exclusion of Desulfobacter and some Desulfobacterium species presumably not being dominant members of the examined community. The most-probable-number (MPN) estimations of lactate-utilizing SRB showed that the cell counts in reed rhizosphere were at least one order of magnitude higher than that in the bulk sediment. The number of endospores was low compared to the total SRB counts. From the highest positive dilution of MPN series, 47 strains were isolated and grouped by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the amplified 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and dsrAB (dissimilatory sulfite reductase) genes. Contrary to the physiological diversity of the isolates, the combined results of RFLP analysis revealed higher diversity at species as well as at subspecies level. Based on the partial 16S rRNA sequences, the representative strains were closely affiliated with the genera Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum. The partial dsrAB sequences of the clones, recovered after isolation and PCR amplification of the community DNA, were related to hitherto uncultured species of the genera Desulfovibrio and Desulfobulbus. Nevertheless, the representative of the second largest clone group was shown to be closely affiliated with the sequenced dsrAB gene of a strain isolated from the same environment and identified as Desulfovibrio alcoholivorans.

The AB-QProbe is a singly labeled oligonucleotide bearing a fluorescent dye at the 5' end. The fluorescence intensity of the AB-QProbe reflects the ratio of the LAMP products from the target and competitor. We amplified the target and competitor by LAMP under isothermal conditions with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity and calculated the starting quantity of the target from the fluorescence intensities at the beginning and end of LAMP. We call this technique alternately binding quenching probe competitive LAMP (ABC-LAMP). We quantified amoA, which encodes the ammonia-oxidizing enzyme in environmental bacteria, as a model target by ABC-LAMP, real-time PCR, and real-time turbidimetry of LAMP. By comparison, the accuracy of ABC-LAMP was found to be similar to that of real-time PCR.

Amplification of 16S rRNA gene using the archaeal universal A2F and Euryarchaea specific EK510R/(EURY498) primer pair, combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), revealed distinct differences between rDNA and rRNA DGGE profiles. The soil depth, time, or rhizosphere effects did not significantly influence Archaeal community structure. Surprisingly, sequence analysis of DGGE-derived amplicons revealed the presence of Euryarchaea as well as uncultured soil Crenarchaea affiliated with group 1. In agreement, sequence comparison analyses showed that the majority of uncultured Crenarchaea group 1 had almost 100% sequence complementarity to the 3' end of the EK510R/(EURY498) primer.

In addition, clone libraries were generated from the rpoB fragments of two cultivars (IPA 1011 and IS 5322-C) using both fertilization conditions, and 318 selected clones were sequenced. Analyzed sequences were grouped into 14 Paenibacillus species. A greater diversity of Paenibacillus species was observed in cultivar IPA 1011 compared with cultivar IS 5322-C. Moreover, statistical analyses of the sequences showed that the bacterial diversity was more influenced by cultivar type than nitrogen fertilization, corroborating the DGGE results.

Degenerate primers based on the N-terminal sequences of the purified glucoamylase according to our previous works and a cDNA fragment encoding the glucoamylase gene was obtained through RT-PCR. Using RACE-PCR, full-length cDNA of glucoamylase gene was cloned from C. thermophilum. The full-length cDNA of the glucoamylase was 2016 bp and contained a 1797-bp open reading frame encoding a protein glucoamylase precursor of 599 amino acid residues. The amino-acid sequence from 31 to 45 corresponded to the N-terminal sequence of the purified protein. The first 30 amino acids were presumed to be a signal peptide. The alignment results of the putative amino acid sequence showed the catalytic domain of the glucoamylase was high homology with the catalytic domains of the other glucoamylases. The C. thermophilum glucoamylase gene was expressed in Pichia pastoris, and the glucoamylase was secreted into the culture medium by the yeast in a functionally active form. The recombinant glucoamylase purified was a glycoprotein with a size of about 66 kDa, and exhibited optimum catalytic activity at pH 4.5-5.0 and 65 degrees C. The enzyme was stable at 60 degrees C, the enzyme activity kept 80% after 60 min incubation at 70 degrees C.

Since 1959, a groundwater extraction plant has generated a water-level gradient at our study site that has gradually changed part of the wet fen into a dry peatland forest. The average water-level drawdown of the gradient (from a pristine 9 cm to 26 cm in the dry end) is close to an estimate predicted by an increase in mean global temperature of 3 degrees C. We studied the total microbial community of the aerobic surface peat in four locations along the gradient through phospholipid fatty acid and PCR-DGGE methods. Additionally, field measurements of soil respiration showed a threefold increase in the C-emission rate at the driest location compared with the wettest one, indicating enhanced decomposition. Also, both fungal and bacterial biomass increased in the drier locations. At the species level, the fungal community changed due to water-level drawdown whereas actinobacteria were less sensitive to drying.

Molecular systematic analyses also revealed that myxobacterial genera described to date on the basis of the morphology of multi-cellular fruiting bodies were mostly monophyletic. However, these known taxa comprised only in a small part of the sequences recovered directly from soil in a cultivation-independent approach, indicating that the group is much more diverse than previously thought. We propose that the myxobacteria exist in two forms: the fruiting and the non-fruiting types. Most of the uncultured myxobacteria may represent taxa which rarely form fruiting bodies, or may lack some or all of the developmental genes needed for fruiting body formation. In order to identify non-fruiting myxobacteria, new morphology-independent cultivation and isolation techniques need to be developed."

This has led us to access the metabolic potential of soil microorganisms via cultivation strategy. Keeping this in mind, we have performed a culture-dependent survey of important soil bacterial community diversity in East Calcutta Wetland area (Dhapa Landfill Area).

Here, we report the first field inventory of the occurrence and abundance of Collimonas in soils (n = 45) with naturally different fungal densities, which was performed in order to test the null hypothesis that there is a relationship between the presence of Collimonas and fungal biomass. Estimates of fungal densities were based on ergosterol measurements. Each soil was also characterized in terms of its physical and chemical properties and vegetation and management types. Culturable Collimonas was identified in plate-spread soil samples by its ability to clear colloidal chitin, in combination with a Collimonas-specific restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rRNA PCR amplified from individual colonies. Using this approach, we found culturable collimonads only in (semi)natural grasslands. A real-time PCR assay for the specific quantification of Collimonas 16S rRNA in total soil DNA was developed. Collimonas was detectable in 80% of the soil samples, with densities up to 10(5) cells g(-1) (dry weight) soil. The numbers of Collimonas cells per gram of soil were consistently lowest in fungus-poor arable soils and, surprisingly, also in fungus-rich organic layers of forest soils.

Molecular or PCR-based analysis of environmental samples provides a sensitive method for strain- or species-based detection, and real-time PCR, in particular, allows quantification of the organism of interest. In this study we developed a DNA extraction method and a real-time PCR assay for detection and quantification of Entomophaga maimaiga (Zygomycetes: Entomophthorales), a fungal pathogen of the gypsy moth, in the organic layer of forest soil. DNA from fungal resting spores (azygospores) in soil was extracted using a detergent and bead mill homogenization treatment followed by purification of the crude DNA extract using Sephadex-polyvinylpolypyrrolidone microcolumns. The purification step eliminated most of the environmental contaminants commonly co-extracted with genomic DNA from soil samples but detection assays still required the addition of bovine serum albumin to relieve PCR inhibition. The real-time PCR assay used primers and probe based on sequence analysis of the nuclear ribosomal ITS region of several E. maimaiga and two E. aulicae strains. Comparison of threshold cycle values from different soil samples spiked with E. maimaiga DNA showed that soil background DNA and remaining co-extracted contaminants are critical factors determining detection sensitivity. Based on our results from comparisons of resting spore titres among different forest soils, estimates were best for organic soils with comparatively high densities of resting spores."

To determine if changes in microbial community composition were a factor in U(IV) reoxidation, we employed a high-density phylogenetic DNA microarray (16S microarray) containing 500,000 probes to monitor changes in bacterial populations during this remediation process. Comparison of the 16S microarray with clone libraries demonstrated successful detection and classification of most clone groups. Analysis of the most dynamic groups of 16S rRNA gene amplicons detected by the 16S microarray identified five clusters of bacterial subfamilies responding in a similar manner. This approach demonstrated that amplicons of known metal-reducing bacteria such as Geothrix fermentans (confirmed by quantitative PCR) and those within the Geobacteraceae were abundant during U(VI) reduction and did not decline during the U(IV) reoxidation phase. Significantly, it appears that the observed reoxidation of uranium under reducing conditions occurred despite elevated microbial activity and the consistent presence of metal-reducing bacteria.

By first amplifying the genomic DNA (gDNA), biodiversity analysis and gDNA library construction of microbes found in contaminated soils were made possible. The MDA method was validated by analyzing amplified genome coverage from approximately five Escherichia coli cells, resulting in 99.2% genome coverage. The method was further validated by confirming overall representative species coverage and also an amplification bias when amplifying from a mix of eight known bacterial strains. We extracted DNA from samples with extremely low cell densities from a U.S. Department of Energy contaminated site. After amplification, small-subunit rRNA analysis revealed relatively even distribution of species across several major phyla. Clone libraries were constructed from the amplified gDNA, and a small subset of clones was used for shotgun sequencing. BLAST analysis of the library clone sequences showed that 64.9% of the sequences had significant similarities to known proteins, and &quot;clusters of orthologous groups&quot; (COG) analysis revealed that more than half of the sequences from each library contained sequence similarity to known proteins. The libraries can be readily screened for native genes or any target of interest.

Here, we characterize a label-free, electronic sensor, termed E-DNA, for its ability to simultaneously meet these challenging demands. We find that because signal generation is coupled to a hybridization-linked conformational change, rather than to only adsorption to the sensor surface, E-DNA is selective enough to detect oligonucleotides in complex, multicomponent samples, such as blood serum and soil. Moreover, E-DNA signaling is monotonically related to target complementarity, allowing the sensor to discriminate between mismatched targets: we readily detect the complementary 17-base target against a 50 000-fold excess of genomic DNA, can distinguish a three-base mismatch from perfect target directly in blood serum, and under ideal conditions, observe statistically significant differences between single-base mismatches. Finally, because the sensing components are linked to the electrode surface, E-DNA is reusable: a 30-s room temperature wash recovers &gt;99% of the sensor signal. This work further supports the utility of E-DNA as a rapid, specific, and convenient method for the detection of DNA and RNA sequences."

Dehalococcoides populations were the dominant phylotypes assayed in most KB-1 cultures, agreeing with the DGGE and cloning results. A Geobacter phylotype was also strongly represented in most PCE and TCE cultures, but not in cDCE or VC cultures, suggesting a possible role for this organism as a PCE-to-cDCE dechlorinator.

At pH 5.5, 7 to 8% of colonies that formed on plates that were incubated for 4 months were formed by subdivision 1 acidobacteria. These colonies were formed by bacteria that spanned almost the entire phylogenetic breadth of the subdivision, and there was considerable congruence between the diversity of this group as determined by the cultivation-based method and by surveying 16S rRNA genes in the same soil. Members of subdivision 1 acidobacteria therefore appear to be readily culturable. An analysis of published libraries of 16S rRNAs or 16S rRNA genes showed a very strong correlation between the abundance of subdivision 1 acidobacteria in soil bacterial communities and the soil pH. Subdivision 1 acidobacteria were most abundant in libraries from soils with pHs of &lt;6, but rare or absent in libraries from soils with pHs of &gt;6.5.

Here, we evaluate and compare two very different methods for estimating CAI values, one corresponding to translational codon usage bias and the second obtained mathematically by searching for the most dominant codon bias.RESULTS: The level of correlation between these two CAI methods is a simple and intuitive measure of the degree of translational bias in an organism, and from this we confirm that fast replicating bacteria are more likely to have a dominant translational codon usage bias than are slow replicating bacteria, and that this translational codon usage bias may be used for prediction of highly expressed genes. By analyzing more than 300 bacterial genomes, as well as five fungal genomes, we show that codon usage preference provides an environmental signature by which it is possible to group bacteria according to their lifestyle, for instance soil bacteria and soil symbionts, spore formers, enteric bacteria, aquatic bacteria, and intercellular and extracellular pathogens.CONCLUSION: The results and the approach described here may be used to acquire new knowledge regarding species lifestyle and to elucidate relationships between organisms that are far apart evolutionarily."

Additionally, we sought to identify linkages between the observed phylotype variations and known chemical and biological drivers.

Employment of the 16S rRNA gene/ARISA method revealed that specific phylotypes varied independently of the entire bacterial community dynamics. Actinobacteria, which were present on greater than 95% of sampling dates, did not share the large temporal variability of the other identified phyla. Examination of phylotype relative abundance patterns (inferred using ARISA fragment relative fluorescence) revealed a strong correlation between the dominant phytoplankton succession and the relative abundance patterns of the majority of individual phylotypes.

We investigated the use of different standardizing methods in T-RFLP analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes to elucidate the similarities between the bacterial communities in 17 soil and sediment samples. We developed a robust method for standardizing data sets that appeared to allow detection of similarities between complex bacterial communities. We term this the variable percentage threshold method. We found that making conclusions about the similarities of complex bacterial communities from T-RFLP profiles generated by a single restriction enzyme (RE) may lead to erroneous conclusions. Instead, the use of multiple REs, each individually, to generate multiple data sets allowed us to determine a confidence estimate for groupings of apparently similar communities and at the same time minimized the effects of RE selection. In conjunction with the variable percentage threshold method, this allowed us to make confident conclusions about the similarities of the complex bacterial communities in the 17 different samples."

Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is a vital enzyme in CH(4) production, and the mcrA gene coding for a subunit of MCR has been employed as a specific marker for the detection and differentiation of methanogen communities. A critical step in assessing environmental mcrA diversity is the selection of PCR primers. The objective of this study was to compare the diversity coverage of three published mcrA primer sets MCR, ME and ML (also known as MCR and Luton-mcrA) and their ability to discern methanogen communities in a drained peatland. The primers were applied to DNA extracts from unfertilised and ash-fertilised peat from two different depths. Amplified mcrA communities were cloned and sequenced, and the sequences were divided into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence analysis. All primers recovered characteristic OTUs associated with the peat depths and treatments and confirmed a previous observation of low methanogen diversity. The minor differences in OTU ranges of the primers did not greatly affect the observed community composition. However, as the proportions of several OTUs varied strongly, the primers provided different quantitative representations of mcrA communities. We concluded that the ML and MCR primers had better amplification ranges than the ME set, but the use of MCR with peat samples was problematic due to poor amplification. Consequently, the ML primers were best suited for mcrA analysis of peatland methanogen communities."

Several unique clones were isolated from these libraries by functional heterologous complementation of a Sinorhizobium meliloti bdhA mutant, which is unable to grow on the PHB cycle intermediate D-3-hydroxybutyrate due to absence of the enzyme D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity.

Relatively long incubation times are often used with laboratory microcosms in order to incorporate sufficient 13C into the DNA of the target organisms. Addition of nutrients can be used to accelerate the processes. However, unnatural concentrations of nutrients may artificially change bacterial diversity and activity. In this study, methanotroph activity and diversity in soil was examined during the consumption of 13CH4 with three DNA-SIP experiments, using microcosms with natural field soil water conditions, the addition of water, and the addition of mineral salts solution. Methanotroph population diversity was studied by targeting 16S rRNA and pmoA genes. Clone library analyses, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting, and pmoA microarray hybridization analyses were carried out. Most methanotroph diversity (type I and type II methanotrophs) was observed in non-amended SIP microcosms. Although this treatment probably best reflected the in situ environmental conditions, one major disadvantage of this incubation was that the incorporation of 13CH4 was slow and some cross-feeding of 13C occurred, thereby leading to labeling of nonmethanotroph microorganisms. Conversely, microcosms supplemented with mineral salts medium exhibited rapid consumption of 13CH4, resulting in the labeling of a less diverse population of only type I methanotrophs. DNA-SIP incubations using water-amended microcosms yielded faster incorporation of 13C into active methanotrophs while avoiding the cross-feeding of 13C."

We found no evidence that the size of the bacterial community was significantly affected by either soil age or the presence of L. alpina. In contrast, the proportion of the bacterial community that could be cultured on nonselective agars, and which was taken as an indication of the proportion of r-selected populations, was significantly higher in the 50- and 70-year-old soils than in the 5-year-old soil, and was also significantly higher in the rhizosphere of L. alpina at all time points. RDA indicated significant correlations between the increased culturability of the bacterial community over time and increasing concentrations of labile N, and between the increased culturability in the rhizosphere and increased concentrations of labile C and N. HaeIII-amplified ribosomal DNA (rDNA) restriction analysis of a library of 120 clones of 16S rDNA revealed 85 distinct phylotypes. Hurlbert's probability of interspecific encounter (PIE) values derived from this library ranged from 0.95 to 1.0, indicating a very high genetic diversity. There was no significant difference in the PIE values of rhizosphere and interspace communities. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) community profiles clearly distinguished the rhizosphere from the interspace community in the 5-year-old soils and also clearly distinguished between these communities and the rhizosphere and interspace communities of the 50- and 70-year-old soils. However, 16S rRNA DGGE revealed little difference between rhizosphere and interspace communities in the 50- and 70-year-old soils. The relative similarity of the 16S rRNA profiles strongly reflected labile carbon and nitrogen availability. Overall, our results suggest that improved C and N availability in the rhizosphere of L. alpina increases the size of r-selected bacterial species populations, but that the influence of L. alpina depends on soil age, being maximal in the youngest soils and minimal in the oldest. The reduced influence of L. alpina in the older soils may reflect a feedback between improved nutrient availability and reduced rhizodeposition."

To determine whether this highly structured succession was unique to the Rotmoosferner glacier foreland, 1.1b and 1.1c communities were compared with those present along a successional gradient at Odenwinkelkees glacier, 125 km away, by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction products. Similarities in community structure were observed; 1.1b communities were present throughout both successional gradients (though lacking the defined structure at Odenwinkelkees) and 1.1c communities were present only in mature soil. Comigration of bands on DGGE gels indicated that a number of similar crenarchaeal populations were present at both sites. To compare populations, and examine microscale diversity, 16S rRNA genes and complete 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions representing six major band positions in DGGE analysis were amplified, cloned and sequenced and represented four 1.1b and two 1.1c lineages.

In contrast, two other 1.1b and two 1.1c lineages (each possessing &gt; 99% 16S rRNA gene similarity) exhibited markedly less variation in their respective 16S-23S ITS regions.

The drawback to this approach for fungi is that 18S rRNA sequences often do not provide sufficient taxonomic resolution to allow identification of taxa in mixed communities to genus or species level. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences are known to be more taxonomically informative than 18S rRNA sequences and are the common target in DNA based studies but are thought to be absent from RNA pools as they are cleaved after transcription of the large rRNA precursor molecule to leave the mature rRNA's for ribosome synthesis. Here we show, however, that fungal ITS regions can be detected in RNA pools by RT-PCR amplification of fungal precursor rRNA molecules. This suggests that precursor rRNA molecules reside in the cells of active fungi for sufficient time to allow RT-PCR amplification of ITS regions prior to their removal by post-transcriptional cleavage. The RT-PCR conditions for this approach were initially optimised using a range of fungi grown in pure culture prior to applying the approach to complex fungal communities in two contrasting soil types."

Most strains (191/197) were found to have genes with greatest similarity to those of Xenorhabdus bovienii, and the remaining six strains had genes most similar to those of Xenorhabdus nematophila. Generally, 16S rRNA sequences and the sequence types based on housekeeping genes were in agreement, with a few notable exceptions. Statistical analysis implied that recombination had occurred at the serC locus and that moderate amounts of interallele recombination had also taken place. Surprisingly, the fliC locus contained a highly variable central region, even though insects lack an adaptive immune response, which is thought to drive flagellar variation in pathogens of higher organisms. All the X. nematophila strains exhibited a consistent pattern of insecticidal activity, and all contained the insecticidal toxin genes xptA1A2B1C1, which were present on a pathogenicity island (PAI). The PAIs were similar among the X. nematophila strains, except for partial deletions of a peptide synthetase gene and the presence of insertion sequences. Comparison of the PAI locus with that of X. bovienii suggested that the PAI integrated into the genome first and then acquired the xpt genes. The independent mobility of xpt genes was further supported by the presence of xpt genes in X. bovienii strain I73 on a type 2 transposon structure and by the variable patterns of insecticidal activity in X. bovienii isolates, even among closely related strains."

Plasmodiophora brassicae spores, chitin, sodium acetate, and cabbage plants were added to activate specific bacterial populations as an aid in screening for novel antagonists to plant pathogens. DNA from growing bacteria was specifically extracted from the soil by bromodeoxyuridine immunocapture. The captured DNA was fingerprinted by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). The composition of the dominant bacterial community was also analyzed directly by T-RFLP and by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). After chitin addition to the soil, some bacterial populations increased dramatically and became dominant both in the total and in the actively growing community. Some of the emerging bands on DGGE gels from chitin-amended soil were sequenced and found to be similar to known chitin-degrading genera such as Oerskovia, Kitasatospora, and Streptomyces species. Some of these sequences could be matched to specific terminal restriction fragments on the T-RFLP output. After addition of Plasmodiophora spores, an increase in specific Pseudomonads could be observed with Pseudomonas-specific primers for DGGE. These results demonstrate the utility of microbiomics, or a combination of molecular approaches, for investigating the composition of complex microbial communities in soil."

The population size of planctomycetes in oxic layers of the peat bog profile was in the range of 0.4-2.0 x 10(7) cells per g of wet peat, comprising 4 to 13% of the total bacterial cell number. A novel effective approach that combined a traditional cultivation technique with FISH-mediated monitoring of the target organism during the isolation procedure has been developed for the isolation of planctomycetes. Using this approach, we succeeded in isolating several peat-inhabiting planctomycetes in a pure culture. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes from two of these isolates, strains A10 and MPL7, showed that they belonged to the planctomycete lineages defined by the genera Gemmata and Planctomyces, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strains A10 and MPL7 and the phylogenetically closest organisms, namely, Gemmata obscuriglobus and Planctomyces limnophilus, was only 90%.

Five approaches were assessed: (a) amplification with primers betaAMO143f-betaAMO1315r; (b) amplification with primers CTO189f-CTO654r; (c) nested amplification with betaAMO143f-betaAMO1315r followed by CTO189f-CTO654r primers; (d) nested amplification with betaAMO143f-betaAMO1315r and CTO189f-Pf1053r primers; (e) nested amplification with 27f-1492r and CTO189f-CTO654r primers. Amplification products were characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis after further amplification with 357f-GC-518r primers. DGGE profiles of soil communities were heterogeneous and depended on the approach followed. Ammonia oxidizer diversity was higher using approaches (b), (c) and (e) than using (a) and (d), where sequences of the most prominent bands showed similarities to nonammonia oxidizers. Profiles from marine sediments were more consistent, regardless of the approach adopted, and sequence analysis of excised bands indicated that these consisted of ammonia oxidizers only. The study demonstrates the importance of choice of primer, of screening for sequences of nontarget organisms and use of several approaches when characterizing microbial communities in natural environments."

Here, it was analysed whether the diversity of bacteria in finished composts is stable and specific for the production process. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) based on polymerase chain reaction amplified partial 16S rRNA genes was used to profile and analyse bacterial communities found in total DNA extracted from finished composts. Different batches of compost samples stored over a period of 12 years and a 1-year-old vermicompost were compared to each other. According to digital image analysis, clear differences could be detected between the profiles from compost and vermicompost. Differences between three different periods of compost storage and between replicate vermicompost windrows were only minor. A total of 41 different 16S rRNA genes were identified from the SSCP profiles by DNA sequencing, with the vast majority related to yet-uncultivated bacteria. Sequences retrieved from compost mainly belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. In contrast, vermicompost was dominated by bacteria related to uncultured Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Gemmatimonadetes. The differences were underscored with specific gene probes and Southern blot hybridizations. The results confirmed that different substrates and composting processes selected for specific bacterial communities in the finished products. The specificity and consistency of the bacterial communities inhabiting the compost materials suggest that cultivation-independent bacterial community analysis is a potentially useful indicator to characterize the quality of finished composts in regard to production processes and effects of storage conditions."

The importance of chimeric sequences was evaluated by Chimera Check (Ribosomal Database Project) and by data reanalyses after omission of potentially chimeric regions at the 5'- and 3'-ends of the cloned amplicons. Diverse communities of fungi representing Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Zygomycota were detected. Ectomycorrhizal fungi comprised a major component in the early plant communities in primary successional ecosystems, as both primer sets frequently detected basidiomycetes (Russulaceae and Thelephoraceae) forming mycorrhizal symbioses. Various ascomycetes (Ophiostomatales, Pezizales, and Sordariales) of uncertain function dominated the clone libraries amplified from the willow canopy soil with one set of primers, whereas the clone libraries of the amplicons generated with the second primer set were dominated by basidiomycetes. Accordingly, primer bias is an important factor in fungal community analyses using DNA extracted from environmental samples. A large proportion (&gt;30%) of the cloned sequences were concluded to be chimeric based on their changing positions in inferred phylogenies after omission of possibly chimeric data. Many chimeric sequences were positioned basal to existing classes of fungi, suggesting that PCR artifacts may cause frequent discovery of new, higher level taxa (order, class) in direct PCR analyses.

Fingerprints of microbial communities established under increasing concentrations of 2,4-D (0-500 mg kg-1) in batch soil microcosms were obtained using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene segments. While a 2,4-D concentration of at least 100 mg kg-1 was required to obtain an apparent change in the community structure as visualized by DGGE, the greatest impact of 2,4-D concentration occurred in the 500 mg kg-1 treatment, resulting in significantly reduced diversity of the dominant populations and enrichment by Burkholderia-like populations. The greatest diversity of 2,4-D degrading isolates was cultivated from the 10 mg kg-1 treatment, indicating that under these conditions, cultivation was more sensitive than DGGE for detecting changes in community structure. Most of these isolates harbored homologs of Ralstonia eutrophus JMP134 and Burkholderia cepacia tfdA catabolic genes.

These belowground communities drive many important ecosystem functions and are responsive to a variety of environmental changes. Nematodes, an abundant and diverse component of grassland soil communities, are particularly responsive to altered environmental conditions, such as those associated with reduced fire frequency and nitrogen enrichment, with the most consistent responses displayed by microbial-feeding nematodes. However, much of the available research characterizing nematode responses to environmental change has been carried out at the taxonomic level of family or by broad trophic categories (e.g. fungivores, bacterivores). The extent to which differential responses to environmental change occurs at the genus level or below is unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use molecular methods to quantify the response of microbial-feeding nematodes, at the lowest levels of taxonomic resolution, to nitrogen enrichment and changes in fire frequency. Using sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probes for the 18S ribosomal RNA gene and the ITS1 region, we identified 19 microbial-feeding nematode taxa across four families. When nematodes were sampled across treatments, we found that some nematode taxa within a family responded similarly to nitrogen and burning treatments, while other taxa within the same family respond quite differently. Additionally, although nematodes from different families on average responded differently to nitrogen enrichment and burning, similar responses were seen in nematode taxa that span three taxonomic families. Thus, if nematodes are to be used as indicators of environmental change, care should be taken to assess the response at the lowest taxonomic level possible."

Further main characteristics include the rigid body; the conspicuous, stylonychid frontal area; the undulating membranes in Oxytricha pattern; a mighty adoral zone of membranelles not reorganized during ontogenesis; distinct midventral rows of which those of the opisthe develop right of the parental ones; and eight dorsal kineties, of which three develop intrakinetally and five are generated dorsomarginally. Rigidothrix goiseri possesses main characteristics of oxytrichine, stylonychine, and urostyline stichotrichs, specifically, it is the first rigid stichotrich with midventral rows, and thus it breaks the flexibility dogma. Distinct similarities with the genus Uroleptus and the CEUU hypothesis suggest that R. goiseri is more closely related to the oxytrichine than urostyline stichotrichs, in spite of the conspicuous midventral rows. This is also supported by the sequence data which show that R. goiseri is almost equally similar to both Oxytricha granulifera (95.88%) and Uroleptus gallina (94.93%), but fairly different from Urostyla grandis (92.7%). The main morphological peculiarities of R. goiseri show that it represents a new genus which should be classified into a new family, the Rigidotrichidae, together with the genera Uroleptus, Territricha, and Afrophrya nov. gen., the latter comprising Rigidothrix-like stichotrichs with cyrtohymenid oral apparatus.

In this study, the capacity of a disease-suppressive compost to alter the expression pattern of certain pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in the root system of tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum) provided the opportunity to study their cellular expression pattern and to investigate putative roles of these genes in the mechanisms of plant defence.METHODS: Employing the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ RNA:RNA hybridization techniques, the accumulation and distribution of the transcripts of the differentially expressed PR genes were examined in plants grown on compost and compared with those of control plants grown on peat.KEY RESULTS: Elevated levels of expression of the pathogenesis-related genes PR-1, PR-5 and P69/PR-7 were detected in the roots of tomato plants grown on the compost. A clearly distinguished spatial induction pattern was observed for these PR genes: PR-1 transcripts were almost exclusively detected in the pericycle cells surrounding the root stele of the main and lateral roots; PR-5 transcripts were present in the phloem of the root and stem tissues; and the accumulation and distribution of PR-7 transcripts was detected in discrete groups of cells that appeared sporadically in both the parenchyma and vascular system of the root, suggesting that the gene is not expressed in a tissue-specific manner. In addition, a novel cDNA clone was isolated (P69G), which probably encodes a new tomato P69 isoform.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that a suppressive compost is able to elicit consistent and increased expression of certain PR genes in the roots of tomato plants, even in the absence of any pathogen. The in situ localization studies reveal expression patterns which are in accordance with the presence of protein or with the putative roles of the respective encoded proteins. The expression of the PR genes may be triggered by the microflora of the compost or could be associated with abiotic factors of the compost."

The bacterial community structure was studied for a pesticide-contaminated site that was subsequently remediated using an efficient degradative strain Arthrobacter protophormiae RKJ100. The efficiency of the bioremediation process was assessed by monitoring the depletion of the pollutant, and the effect of addition of an exogenous strain on the existing soil community structure was determined using molecular techniques. The 16S rRNA gene pool amplified from the soil metagenome was cloned and restriction fragment length polymorphism studies revealed 46 different phylotypes on the basis of similar banding patterns. Sequencing of representative clones of each phylotype showed that the community structure of the pesticide-contaminated soil was mainly constituted by Proteobacteria and Actinomycetes. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed only nonsignificant changes in community structure during the process of bioremediation. Immobilized cells of strain RKJ100 enhanced pollutant degradation but seemed to have no detectable effects on the existing bacterial community structure."

Using two sets of Peronosporomycete-specific primers, a portion of the 5' region of the large subunit (28S) rRNA gene was amplified from DNA extracted either directly from rhizosphere soil or from hempseed baits floated for 48 h over rhizosphere soil. Amplicons were cloned, sequenced, and then subjected to phylogenetic and diversity analyses. Both soil and bait communities arising from DNA amplified with a Peronosporomycetidae-biased primer set (Oom1) were dominated by Pythium species. In contrast, communities arising from DNA amplified with a Saprolegniomycetidae-biased primer set (Sap2) were dominated by Aphanomyces species. Neighbor-joining analyses revealed the presence of additional taxa that could not be identified with known Peronosporomycete species represented in GenBank. Sequence diversity and mean sequence divergence (Theta pi) within bait communities were lower than the diversity within soil communities. Furthermore, the composition of Peronosporomycete communities differed among the three fields sampled and between bait and soil communities based on F(st) and parsimony tests. The results of our study represent a significant advance in the study of Peronosporomycetes in terrestrial habitats. Our work has shown the utility of culture-independent approaches using 28S rRNA genes to assess the diversity of Peronosporomycete communities in association with plants. It also reveals the presence of potentially new species of Peronosporomycetes in soils and plant rhizospheres."

The in vitro characterisation of diverse parameters including the ability to parasitise mycelium and to inhibit the germination of Rhizoctonia sclerotia at different temperatures resulted in the selection of six potential fungal antagonists. These were genotypically characterised by their BOX-PCR fingerprints, and identified as Trichoderma reesei and T. viride by partial 18S rDNA sequencing. When potato sprouts were treated with Trichoderma, all isolates significantly reduced the incidence of Rhizoctonia symptoms. Evaluated under growth chamber conditions, the selected Trichoderma isolates either partly or completely controlled the dry mass loss of lettuce caused by R. solani. Furthermore, the antagonistic Trichoderma strains were active under field conditions. To analyse the effect of Trichoderma treatment on indigenous root-associated microbial communities, we performed a DNA-dependent SSCP (Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism) analysis of 16S rDNA/ITS sequences. In this first assessment study for Trichoderma it was shown that the pathogen and the vegetation time had much more influence on the composition of the microbiota than the BCA treatment. After evaluation of all results, three Trichoderma strains originally isolated from Rhizoctonia sclerotia were selected as promising BCAs."

The nematode is produced commercially as a biological control agent for slug pests of agriculture and horticulture. Given the difficulties of distinguishing this species from other nematode species in soil samples, very little is known about its natural ecology or its behaviour and persistence following application for biological control. Here we describe a method to quantify P. hermaphrodita in soil samples based on real time PCR. We designed primers and a dual labelled fluorescent probe that can be used to quantify numbers of P. hermaphrodita and which is capable of distinguishing this species from the morphologically identical Phasmarhabditis neopapillosa. We compared different methods whereby the entire nematode community is extracted prior to DNA extraction, and three methods to extract DNA directly from soil samples. Both nematode extraction and DNA extraction from large (10 g) samples of soil gave reliable estimates of nematode numbers, but methods which extracted DNA from small (1g or less) soil samples substantially underestimated numbers. However, direct extraction of DNA from soils may overestimate numbers of live nematodes as DNA from dead nematodes was found to persist in soil for at least 6 days. The technique could be modified for detection and quantification of all soil borne parasitic nematodes."

Tentative identification using conventional biochemical analysis consistently identified the isolate as Bacillus subtilis. DNA isolated from the tomb isolate, strain 10b(T), and closely related species was used to amplify a Bacillus-specific portion of the highly conserved 16S rRNA gene and an internal region of the superoxide dismutase gene (sodA(int)). Trees derived from maximum-likelihood methods applied to the sodA(int) sequences yielded non-zero branch lengths between strain 10b(T) and its closest relative, whereas a comparison of a Bacillus-specific 546 bp amplicon of the 16S rRNA gene demonstrated 99 % similarity with B. subtilis. Although the 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain 10b(T) and B. subtilis were 99 % similar, PFGE of NotI-digested DNA of strain 10b(T) revealed a restriction profile that was considerably different from those of B. subtilis and other closely related species. Whereas qualitative differences in whole-cell fatty acids were not observed, significant quantitative differences were found to exist between strain 10b(T) and each of the other closely related Bacillus species examined. In addition, DNA-DNA hybridization studies demonstrated that strain 10b(T) had a relatedness value of less than 70 % with B. subtilis and other closely related species. Evidence from the sodA(int) sequences, whole-cell fatty acid profiles and PFGE analysis, together with results from DNA-DNA hybridization studies, justify the classification of strain 10b(T) as representing a distinct species, for which the name Bacillus tequilensis sp. nov. is proposed.

The G+C DNA content was 43.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) analysis of L1(T) and related strains showed that it forms within Geobacillus toebii, a separate cluster in the Geobacillus genus. The composition of cellular fatty acids analyses by Gas-Mass Spectroscopy differed from that typical for the genus Geobacillus in that it is lacking in iso-C15 fatty acid, while iso-C16 and iso-C17 were predominant. Isolates grew on a rich complex medium at temperatures between 55-75 degrees C and presented a doubling time (t(d)) of 2 h and 6 h using complex media and hydrocarbon media, respectively.

The present study describes characterization of the second isolate, ARBG1. Nutrient agar (NA)-derived colonies of ARBG1 displayed consistently Gram-negative staining rods (2-4x0.5-0.6 micro) substantiated by KOH mucoid thread test. Older cultures (3-7 days) showed emergence of Gram-negative staining, oblong, phase-refractile cells with ellipsoidal spores. The growth and sporulation were modified by growth medium and incubation temperature with the optimum around 37 degrees C. Identification attempts involving microscopic, biochemical, Biolog or fatty acid profiling approaches brought in mixed and inconclusive results. PCR amplification of 16S rDNA was not successful with the standard primers 27F and 1492R but with 27F and a modified primer ARBG1-RP1. The identity of the isolate was established as Brevibacillus sp. based on partial 16S rDNA sequence data from eight single colonies with Gram-positive Brevibacillus choshinensis as the closest match (99.5%). Spotting tests on NA employing spore suspension in aqueous ethanol (0%, 25%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90%, v/v) indicated unhindered bacterial-survival in alcohol for 1 month, and that at 2 or 4 months revealed 90% ethanol as more sporicidal than lower levels, corroborated by plating results.

The primers produced amplicons from 192 fruiting body samples belonging to 10 genera. Twenty-four samples yielded longer fragments and sequence analysis revealed the presence of intron(s). As for the exonic regions, while sequence heterogeneities within a single species/varietas/forma were frequently observed, identical sequences were obtained only from identical species/varietas. The effectiveness of this primer pair in the analysis of morphologically unidentifiable samples was confirmed with the applications to samples of environmental plasmodium/sclerotium and soil. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis was also tested with the soil samples.

A nested PCR-based diagnostic test has been developed as part of an initiative to map the distribution of the pathogen in Scotland. The entire nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer and 5.8S rRNA gene regions from 14 isolates of diverse global origin exhibited complete homology following sequence characterization. Two pairs of species-specific primers, based on inter-specific sequence divergence with closely related species, were designed and empirically evaluated for diagnostic nested PCR.

Methanogenesis from butyrate oxidation was fourfold higher in microcosms containing soil from eutrophic regions of the marsh than from low nutrient regions. Propionate was oxidized in eutrophic microcosms at lower rates than butyrate and with lower yields of methane. Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from DNA extracted from microcosms and soils revealed differences such that the dominant restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) phylotypes (representing 82-88% of clone libraries) from eutrophic soils clustered with fatty acid oxidizing Syntrophomonas spp. The four dominant RFLP phylotypes (representing 11-24%) from microcosms containing soils from low nutrient regions were sequenced, and clustered with micro-organisms having the potential for fermentative and syntrophic metabolism. Archaeal 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that methanogens from eutrophic regions were from diverse families, including Methanomicrobiaceae, Methanosarcinaceae, and Methanocorpusculaceae, but clone libraries from low nutrient soils revealed only members of Methanosarcinaceae.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that syntroph-methanogen consortia differed with nutrient levels in a freshwater marsh.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is one of few studies addressing the distribution of fatty acid consuming-hydrogen producing bacteria (syntrophs) and their methanogenic partners in wetland soils, and the effects of eutrophication on the ecology these groups."

For each analysis, a dendrogram was generated using the software BioNumerics. All three molecular methods generated analogous clustering of the isolates, supporting previous results on 16S rDNA sequence-based phylogeny. Clusters obtained with IAR profile are similar to the species groups generated with the molecular methods used. IAR groups do not correlate significantly with the geographic origin of the isolates. These results may indicate a chromosomal location of antibiotic resistance genes, and suggest that IAR is species related. DAPD and IAR profiles proved to be the most discriminating approaches in strain differentiation and can be used as fast methods to screen diversity in new isolates."

We present a method that addresses the challenge of assigning sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on the genetic distances between sequences. We developed a computer program, DOTUR, which assigns sequences to OTUs by using either the furthest, average, or nearest neighbor algorithm for each distance level. DOTUR uses the frequency at which each OTU is observed to construct rarefaction and collector's curves for various measures of richness and diversity. We analyzed 16S rRNA gene libraries derived from Scottish and Amazonian soils and the Sargasso Sea with DOTUR, which assigned sequences to OTUs rapidly and reliably based on the genetic distances between sequences and identified previous inconsistencies and errors in assigning sequences to OTUs. An analysis of the two 16S rRNA gene libraries from soil demonstrated that they do not contain enough sequences to support a claim that they contain different numbers of bacterial lineages with statistical confidence (P &gt; 0.05), nor do they contain enough sequences to provide a robust estimate of species richness when an OTU is defined as containing sequences that are no more than 3% different from each other. In contrast, the richness of OTUs at the 3% level in the Sargasso Sea collection began to plateau after the sampling of 690 sequences.

New approaches to the cultivation of bacteria which rely on growth in dilute nutrient media or simulated environments are beginning to address this problem of selection. Here we describe a novel microcultivation method for soil bacteria that mimics natural conditions. Our soil slurry membrane system combines a polycarbonate membrane as a growth support and soil extract as the substrate. The result is abundant growth of uncharacterized bacteria as microcolonies. By combining microcultivation with fluorescent in situ hybridization, previously &quot;unculturable&quot; organisms belonging to cultivated and noncultivated divisions, including candidate division TM7, can be identified by fluorescence microscopy.

This analysis indicated that sequences related to Francisella were present in one water and seven soil samples. This is the first report of the detection of Francisella-related species in soil samples by DNA-based methods. Cloning and sequencing of PCR products indicated the presence of a wide variety of Francisella-related species. Sequences from two soil samples were 99.9% similar to previously reported sequences from F. tularensis isolates and may represent new subspecies. Additional analyses with primer sets developed for detection and differentiation of F. tularensis subspecies support the finding of very close relatives to known F. tularensis strains in some samples. While the pathogenicity of these organisms is unknown, they have the potential to be detected in F. tularensis-specific assays. Similarly, a potential new subspecies of Francisella philomiragia was identified. The majority of sequences obtained, while more similar to those of Francisella than to any other genus, were phylogenetically distinct from known species and formed several new clades potentially representing new species or genera.

The sensitivity of the assay was dramatically enhanced by using a probe consisting of three repeats of a B. cepacia complex-specific probe, each separated by a phosphoramidite spacer. In addition, a duplex PCR targeting B. cepacia complex-specific recA and 16S rRNA sequences was developed to enable a fast and reliable diagnostic assay for members of the complex.

The dynamics of the eubacterial community, the number of heterotrophs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degraders, and the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and PAH concentrations were monitored during the bioremediation process. TPH and PAHs were significantly degraded in all treatments (72 to 79% and 83 to 87%, respectively), and the biodegradation values were higher when nutrients were not added, especially for benzo(a)anthracene and chrysene. The moisture content and aeration were determined to be the key factors associated with PAH bioremediation. Neither biosurfactant addition, bioaugmentation, nor ferric octate addition led to differences in PAH or TPH biodegradation compared to biodegradation with nutrient treatment. All treatments resulted in a high first-order degradation rate during the first 45 days, which was markedly reduced after 90 days. A sharp increase in the size of the heterotrophic and PAH-degrading microbial populations was observed, which coincided with the highest rates of TPH and PAH biodegradation. At the end of the incubation period, PAH degraders were more prevalent in samples to which nutrients had not been added. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis and principal-component analysis confirmed that there was a remarkable shift in the composition of the bacterial community due to both the biodegradation process and the addition of nutrients. At early stages of biodegradation, the alpha-Proteobacteria group (genera Sphingomonas and Azospirillum) was the dominant group in all treatments. At later stages, the gamma-Proteobacteria group (genus Xanthomonas), the alpha-Proteobacteria group (genus Sphingomonas), and the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides group (Bacteroidetes) were the dominant groups in the nonnutrient treatment, while the gamma-Proteobacteria group (genus Xathomonas), the beta-Proteobacteria group (genera Alcaligenes and Achromobacter), and the alpha-Proteobacteria group (genus Sphingomonas) were the dominant groups in the nutrient treatment. This study shows that specific bacterial phylotypes are associated both with different phases of PAH degradation and with nutrient addition in a preadapted PAH-contaminated soil. Our findings also suggest that there are complex interactions between bacterial species and medium conditions that influence the biodegradation capacity of the microbial communities involved in bioremediation processes."

Archaeal community composition was found to be dominated by members of the non-thermophilic or Group 1 Crenarchaeota, where a dramatic yet highly structured successional sequence was observed. Succession over the 150 years sequence could be identified as occurring in three stages, each of which had a phylogenetically distinct 1.1b crenarchaea community with those organisms present in pioneering and intermediate stages belonging to a lineage distinct from those in developed soils. Climax communities also contained organisms belonging to three other major non-thermophilic crenarchaeal lineages. Comparison of archaeal communities in the rhizosphere indicated that plant species composition was not the major driver of specific crenarchaeal populations.

Several clones produced purple or brown colonies. One of the selected antibacterial clones, pJEC5, produced purple colonies. Structural analysis of the purified pigments demonstrated that the metagenomic clone produced both the pigment indirubin and its isomer, indigo blue, resulting in purple colonies. In vitro mutational and subclonal analyses revealed that two open reading frames (ORFs) are responsible for the pigment production and antibacterial activity. The ORFs encode an oxygenase-like protein and a putative transcriptional regulator. Mutations of the gene encoding the oxygenase canceled both pigment production and antibacterial activity, whereas a subclone carrying the two ORFs retained pigment production and antibacterial activity.

To facilitate the rational design of sulphur amino acid-producing strains, the pathway for assimilatory sulphate reduction providing the necessary reduced sulfur moieties has to be known. Although this pathway has been well studied in Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli and low-GC Gram-positives like Bacillus subtilis, little is known for the Actinomycetales and other high-GC Gram-positive bacteria.RESULTS: The genome sequence of C. glutamicum was searched for genes involved in the assimilatory reduction of inorganic sulphur compounds. A cluster of eight candidate genes could be identified by combining sequence similarity searches with a subsequent synteny analysis between C. glutamicum and the closely related C. efficiens. Using mutational analysis, seven of the eight candidate genes, namely cysZ, cysY, cysN, cysD, cysH, cysX, and cysI, were demonstrated to be involved in the reduction of inorganic sulphur compounds. For three of the up to now unknown genes possible functions could be proposed: CysZ is likely to be the sulphate permease, while CysX and CysY are possibly involved in electron transfer and cofactor biosynthesis, respectively. Finally, the candidate gene designated fpr2 influences sulphur utilisation only weakly and might be involved in electron transport for the reduction of sulphite. Real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed that cysIXHDNYZ form an operon and that transcription of the extended cluster fpr2 cysIXHDNYZ is strongly influenced by the availability of inorganic sulphur, as well as L-cysteine. Mapping of the fpr2 and cysIXHDNYZ promoters using RACE-PCR indicated that both promoters overlap with binding-sites of the transcriptional repressor McbR, suggesting an involvement of McbR in the observed regulation. Comparative genomics revealed that large parts of the extended cluster are conserved in 11 of 17 completely sequenced members of the Actinomycetales.CONCLUSION: The set of C. glutamicum genes involved in assimilatory sulphate reduction was identified and four novel genes involved in this pathway were found. The high degree of conservation of this cluster among the Actinomycetales supports the hypothesis that a different metabolic pathway for the reduction of inorganic sulphur compounds than that known from the well-studied model organisms E. coli and B. subtilis is used by members of this order, providing the basis for further biochemical studies."

To study the natural role and diversity of the Mycobacterium community in contaminated soils, a culture-independent fingerprinting method based on PCR combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was developed. New PCR primers were selected which specifically targeted the 16S rRNA genes of fast-growing mycobacteria, and single-band DGGE profiles of amplicons were obtained for most Mycobacterium strains tested. Strains belonging to the same species revealed identical DGGE fingerprints, and in most cases, but not all, these fingerprints were typical for one species, allowing partial differentiation between species in a Mycobacterium community. Mycobacterium strains inoculated in soil were detected with a detection limit of 10(6) CFU g(-1) of soil using the new primer set as such, or approximately 10(2) CFU g(-1) in a nested PCR approach combining eubacterial and the Mycobacterium specific primers. Using the PCR-DGGE method, different species could be individually recognized in a mixed Mycobacterium community. This approach was used to rapidly assess the Mycobacterium community structure of several PAH-contaminated soils of diverse origin with different overall contamination profiles, pollution concentrations and chemical-physical soil characteristics. In the non-contaminated soil, most of the recovered 16SrRNA gene sequence did not match with previous described PAH-degrading Mycobacterium strains. In most PAH-contaminated soils, mycobacteria were detected which were closely related to fast-growing species such as Mycobacterium frederiksbergense and Mycobacterium austroafricanum, species that are known to include strains with PAH-degrading capacities.

Soil chemical analysis revealed high sulfate concentrations and low pH values (pH 2.8 to 3.8), which are characteristic of acid-sulfate geothermal activity. The hydrocarbon composition of the seep soils consisted almost entirely of saturated, acyclic alkanes (e.g., n-alkanes with chain lengths of C15 to C30, as well as branched alkanes, predominately pristane and phytane). Bacterial populations present in the seep soils were phylogenetically characterized by 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis. The majority of the sequences recovered (&gt;75%) were related to sequences of heterotrophic acidophilic bacteria, including Acidisphaera spp. and Acidiphilium spp. of the alpha-Proteobacteria. Clones related to the iron- and sulfur-oxidizing chemolithotroph Acidithiobacillus spp. were also recovered from one of the seep soils. Hydrocarbon-amended soil-sand mixtures were established to examine [14C]hexadecane mineralization and corresponding changes in the bacterial populations using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Approximately 50% of the [14C]hexadecane added was recovered as 14CO2 during an 80-day incubation, and this was accompanied by detection of heterotrophic acidophile-related sequences as dominant DGGE bands. An alkane-degrading isolate was cultivated, whose 16S rRNA gene sequence was identical to the sequence of a dominant DGGE band in the soil-sand mixture, as well as the clone sequence recovered most frequently from the original soil. This and the presence of an alkB gene homolog in this isolate confirmed the alkane degradation capability of one population indigenous to acidic hydrocarbon seep soils."

Using known pairs of miRNA and target mRNA in Caenorhabditis elegans, we first performed computational analysis for specific hybridization patterns between these two RNAs. We counted the numbers of perfectly complementary dinucleotide sequences and calculated the free energy within complementary base pairs of each dinucleotide, observed by sliding a 2-nt window along all nucleotides of the miRNA-mRNA duplex. We confirmed not only strong base pairing within the 5' region of miRNAs (nts 1-8) in C. elegans, but also the required mismatch within the central region (nt 9 or nt 10), and we found weak binding within the 3' region (nts 13-14). We also predicted 687 possible miRNA target transcripts, many of which are thought to be involved in C. elegans development, by combining the above mentioned hybridization tendency with the following analyses: (1) prediction of the miRNA-mRNA duplex with free-energy minimization; (2) identification of the complementary pattern within the miRNA-mRNA duplex; (3) conservation of target sites between C. elegans and C. briggsae, a related soil nematode; and (4) extraction of mRNA candidates with multiple target sites. Rigorous tests using shuffled miRNA controls supported these predictions. Our results suggest that miRNAs recognize their target mRNAs by their hybridization pattern and that many target mRNAs may be regulated through a combination of several specific miRNA target sites in C. elegans."

One of the primary techniques used to study such geologic samples is molecular phylogenetic analysis, but this technique is hampered by low microbial biomass and calcium in the host rock, often leading to poor and irreproducible DNA extraction. We describe an improved protocol to recover extremely low amounts of DNA from calcium-rich geologic samples. This protocol relies on the use of the synthetic DNA molecule poly-dIdC, to act both as blocking agent and carrier molecule to increase the yield of DNA, and dialysis to remove calcium inhibitors of PCR amplification. Further, we demonstrate that many traditionally used laboratory substrates contain microbial DNA that can be amplified through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and contaminate molecular phylogenetic profiles. While the number of potential contaminants can be minimized, it cannot be eliminated from extraction techniques. We have therefore established the low-biomass contaminant (LBC) database, which contains the 16S rRNA gene sequences of species that have been identified as common laboratory contaminants. These identified contaminants provide a reference database to allow investigators to critically evaluate certain species identified within their phylogenetic profile when examining such low-biomass environments."

The cDNA was cloned without the use of prescribed primers that target specific genes, and the procedure did not involve random priming. Purified RNA was first modified by addition of a poly(A) tail and then was amplified by using a commercially available reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) cDNA synthesis kit. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, a cDNA clone library was constructed from size-fractionated RNA (targeting 16S rRNA) purified from a geothermally heated soil in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. The resulting cDNA library contained clones representing Bacteria and Eukarya taxa and several mRNAs. There was no exact clone match between this library and a separate cDNA library generated from an RT-PCR performed with unmodified rRNA and Bacteria-specific forward and universal reverse primers that were designed from cultivated organisms; however, both libraries contained representatives of the Firmicutes and the alpha-Proteobacteria. Unexpectedly, there were no Archaea clones in the library generated from poly(A)-modified RNA. Additional RT-PCRs performed with universal and Archaea-biased primers and unmodified RNA demonstrated the presence of novel Archaea in the soil. Experiments with pure cultures of Sulfolobus solfataricus and Halobacterium halobium revealed that some Archaea rRNA may not be a suitable substrate for the poly(A) tail modification step. The protocol described here demonstrates the feasibility of directly accessing prokaryote RNA (rRNA and/or mRNA) in environmental samples, but the results also illustrate potentially important problems."

The roots of poplar trees regularly experience flooded and anoxic conditions. Therefore, we also determined the effect of flooding on microbial communities in microcosm experiments. Total community DNA was extracted and bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR and analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, cloning and sequencing. Clone libraries were created from all three habitats under both unflooded and flooded conditions resulting in a total of 281 sequences. Numbers of different sequences (&lt;97% similarity) in the different habitats represented 16-55% of total bacterial species richness determined from the nonparametric richness estimator Chao1. According to the number of different terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs), all of the different habitats contained approximately 20 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs), except the flooded rhizoplane habitat whose community contained less OTUs. Results of cloning and T-RFLP analysis generally supported each other. Correspondence analysis of T-RFLP patterns showed that the bacterial communities were different in bulk soil, rhizosphere and rhizoplane and changed upon flooding. For example OTUs representing Bacillus sp. were highest in the unflooded bulk soil and rhizosphere. Sequences related to Aquaspirillum, in contrast, were predominant on the poplar roots and in the rhizosphere of flooded microcosms but were rarely found in the other habitats."

These fermentation products were transiently accumulated at the beginning of the exponential phase and were further consumed with the concomitant production of methane. Clone libraries of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes were generated for each stable enrichment. Our 16S rRNA gene-cloning analysis combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the predominant microorganisms in the associations were affiliated with a clone cluster close to the genus Syntrophus in the class &quot;Deltaproteobacteria&quot; and with the methanogenic genera Methanocalculus and Methanosaeta. Confocal scanning laser microscopy showed that the bacterial and archaeal cells formed compact aggregates around the insoluble substrates.

After laboratory studies revealed that bacterial strain PM1 rapidly and completely biodegraded MTBE in groundwater sediments, the organism was tested in an in situ field study at Port Hueneme Naval Construction Battalion Center in Oxnard, California. Two pilot test plots (A and B) in groundwater located down-gradient from an MTBE source were intermittently sparged with pure oxygen. Plot B was also inoculated with strain PM1. MTBE concentrations up-gradient from plots A and B initially varied temporally from 1.5 to 6 mg MTBE/L. Six months after treatment began, MTBE concentrations in monitoring wells down-gradient from the injection bed decreased substantially in the shallow zone of the groundwater in plots A and B, thus even in the absence of the inoculated strain PM1. In the deeper zone, downstream MTBE concentrations also decreased in plot A and to a lesser extent in plot B. Difficulties in delivery of oxygen to the deeper zone of plot B, evidenced by low dissolved oxygen concentrations, were likely responsible for low rates of MTBE removal at that location. We measured the survival and movement of strain PM1 in groundwater samples using two methods for detection of DNA sequences specific to strain PM1: TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and internal transcribed spacer region analysis. A naturally occurring bacterial strain with &gt; 99% 16S rDNA sequence similarity to strain PM1 was detected in groundwater collected at various locations at Port Hueneme, including outside the plots where the organism was inoculated. Addition of oxygen to naturally occurring microbial populations was sufficient to stimulate MTBE removal at this site.

Studying gene expression changes in allopolyploids is more complicated than in autopolyploids, because allopolyploids contain more than two sets of genomes originating from divergent, but related, species. Here we describe two methods that are applicable to the genome-wide analysis of gene expression differences resulting from genome duplication in autopolyploids or interactions between homoeologous genomes in allopolyploids. First, we describe an amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)--complementary DNA (cDNA) display method that allows the discrimination of homoeologous loci based on restriction polymorphisms between the progenitors. Second, we describe microarray analyses that can be used to compare gene expression differences between the allopolyploids and respective progenitors using appropriate experimental design and statistical analysis. We demonstrate the utility of these two complementary methods and discuss the pros and cons of using the methods to analyze gene expression changes in autopolyploids and allopolyploids.

Fingerprints of 200/370 bp respectively were obtained by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis following PCR and nested PCR amplification. In parallel to DGGE analysis, clone libraries containing PCR fragments of the ribosomal gene were constructed and clones were screened by DGGE. DGGE analysis indicated a high diversity of bacterial communities in salad samples. Fingerprints indicated clearly reduced diversity of bacterial communities in processed samples from markets compared to field-grown salads.

The strongest correlations to alpha-HCH were probe signals corresponding to the genus Sphingomonas, which contains known HCH degraders. This suggests that the population detected was enriched in situ by HCH contamination and may play a role in HCH degradation.

The phospholipids observed were phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol and menaquinones consisting of MK-10(H(4)), MK-10(H(6)), MK-11(H(4)) and MK-11(H(6)). A significant quantity (14.5%) of 17:0 anteiso 2-hydroxy fatty acid was observed in the fatty acid profile of this strain. These characteristics clearly differentiate NRRL B-16338(T) from members of the genus Glycomyces and it is proposed that the strain represents a new genus within the family Glycomycetaceae to be called Stackebrandtia gen. nov. The description of this family is emended to permit its inclusion. It is proposed that the type species of the genus should be named Stackebrandtia nassauensis. The type strain LLR-40K-21(T) (=NRRL B-16338(T)=DSM 44728(T)) was isolated from a soil sample from Nassau, Bahamas."

Using the Vitek Gram-positive identification card kit and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the isolate was identified as Enterococcus gallinarum, designated strain MG25. On glucose this isolate produced lactate plus small amounts of acetate, formate and CO2 and its growth rates were similar in the presence and absence of Fe(O)OH. These results suggest that MG25 can couple glucose oxidation to Fe(III) reduction, but without conservation of energy to support growth.

Four groups were recognized within this cluster, only one of which, containing two strains from St. Lucia, Lower Antilles, was exclusively defined by strains from the same sample. The other groups contained members from different countries, even continents. The largest group embraced the type strains of C. coralloides DSM 2259(T) and Corallococcus exiguus 14696(T) which were almost indistinguishable in their 16S rRNA gene sequence. Corallococcus macrosporus DSM 14697(T) grouped outside the C. coralloides cluster, showing a higher relationship to a member of Myxococcus. The topology of the tree generated on the basis of the partial gyrase B (gyrB) gene sequence supports the rRNA gene tree, though some differences in the order of branching were observed. As judged by the binary similarity values the higher resolution power of gyrB sequences was confirmed. From a taxonomic standpoint, the size of myxospores is not a valuable taxonomic criterion, as small- and medium-sized myxospores are members of the same group. If the species status of C. coralloides and C. exiguus is verified by other methods (e.g. DNA-DNA hybridisation, RiboTyping), the genus Corallococcus may embrace a broad range of yet-to-be described novel species.

The actinomycetes-specific primers were shown to amplify the entire 16S-23S rDNA ITS region from all tested strains. More importantly, the described technique allows the detection of Kitasatospora strains from soil samples by extracting metagenomic DNA followed by a PCR amplification step.

One of the isolates designated as HRO10 produced glucose aside from limit dextrin as the only hydrolysis product from starch and was characterized in detail. The starch-degrading enzymes produced by strain HRO10 were determined to be alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase. Whereas the alpha-amylase activity was detected exclusively in the culture supernatant, alpha-glucosidase occurred intracellular, extracellular, or on the surface of the bacteria depending on the growth phase. The optimum temperature and pH required for the growth of strain HRO10 were about 50 degrees C and pH 6.5 to 7.5. The strain used different carbohydrates as the carbon source, but the maximum production of alpha-amylase occurred when 1.0% (w/v) starch or dextrin was used. The use of organic vs. inorganic nitrogen favored the production of alpha-amylase in strain HRO10. The metal ions Li+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ stimulated the production of both enzymes. Identification of strain HRO10 by physiological and molecular methods including sequencing of the 16S rDNA showed that this strain belongs to the species Geobacillus thermodenitrificans.

Changes in bacterial community structure were determined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the rRNA following reverse transcription PCR using primers specific to the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. To identify which components of the microbial community were changing during incubation, PCR amplicons were resolved using DGGE and the banding patterns analyzed using stepwise discriminant function analysis (SDA). SDA showed that the number of bands needed to recover the differences between samples over time could be reduced from the initial 11 bands for the 16S rRNA transcript to 3 bands. Sequences originating from the rRNA gels (16S rRNA transcripts) were recovered in clades containing known cultured isolates of Bacillus marisflavi, Microbacterium oxydans and Pseudomonas oleovorans. Isolation studies on these soils using lubricant oil as a carbon source yielded 317 bacterial isolates, 3 of which showed high sequence similarity (&gt;96%) with the 16S rRNA transcripts identified using SDA as being important in differentiating between bacterial communities over time. These isolates were then tested singly and in combination for their ability to degrade lubricant oil.

Biofilter samples were incubated in various concentrations of sulfide or thiosulfate (0 to 5 mM) with either oxygen or nitrate as the sole electron acceptor.

DGGE analysis of DNA showed no significant change of the original microbial consortia upon incubation. In contrast, DGGE of cDNA revealed several phylotypes whose relative band intensities markedly increased or decreased in response to certain incubation conditions, indicating enhanced or suppressed rRNA transcription and thus implying metabolic activity under these conditions. Specifically, species of the gammaproteobacterial genus Thiomicrospira and phylotypes related to symbiotic sulfide oxidizers could be linked to oxygen-dependent sulfide oxidation, while members of the Rhodobacteraceae (genera Roseobacter, Rhodobacter, and Rhodobium) were putatively active in anoxic, nitrate-dependent sulfide oxidation. For all these organisms, the physiology of their closest cultured relatives matches their DT-DGGE-inferred function. In addition, higher band intensities following exposure to 5 mM sulfide and nitrate were observed for Thauera-, Hydrogenophaga-, and Dethiosulfovibrio-like phylotypes. For these genera, nitrate-dependent sulfide oxidation has not been documented previously and therefore DT-DGGE might indicate a higher relative tolerance to high sulfide concentrations than that of other community members. We anticipate that DT-DGGE will be of general use in tracing functionally equivalent yet phylogenetically diverse microbial populations in nature."

RISA appears to be a useful tool for the study of the community structures of food-associated microbes and their use as a unique fingerprinting signature for each agronomic product. Sequencing analyses of amplicons generated from RISA suggest that this method can detect conventional microbes. In the case of RISA of wasabi paste DNA, the sequences of the amplicons showed high similarity to the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris and the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, whereas several food-associated bacteria (Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, and Lactococcus sakei) were detected using this technique in sausage DNA. Unexpectedly, the sequencing analyses also revealed the presence of several microbes that possessed high similarity to human bacterial pathogens such as Weissella confusa and Yersinia pestis. The results suggest that RISA will be a useful method for routine microbial community analysis in agronomic products."

Two of these strains, one isolated from the rhizospheric soil of Chloris ciliata (strain CH01(T)) and the other from Pappophorum caespitosum (strain PA01), were Gram-negative, strictly aerobic rods, which formed yellow round colonies on nutrient agar. They produced a water-insoluble yellow pigment, and a fluorescent pigment was also detected. A polyphasic taxonomic approach was used to characterize the strains. Comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed a similarity of 99.3 % between them, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strains belong to the genus Pseudomonas, within the gamma-subclass of the Proteobacteria. The closest related species is Pseudomonas straminea IAM 1598(T) (similarity of 99.0 % to strain CH01(T) and 98.8 % to strain PA01), clustering in a separate branch with the various methods of tree building used. Strains CH01(T) and PA01 both had a single polar flagellum, like other yellow pigment-producing pseudomonads related to them. Both strains produced catalase and oxidase. Similar to P. straminea, they did not hydrolyse gelatin or casein. The G+C DNA contents determined were 57.5 mol% for CH01(T) and 58.0 mol% for PA01. DNA-DNA hybridization results showed 81 % relatedness between them, and only 40-44 % relatedness with respect to the type strain of P. straminea. These results, together with other phenotypic characteristics, support the conclusion that both isolates belong to the same species, and should be described as representing a novel species within the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas argentinensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CH01(T) (=LMG 22563(T) = CECT 7010(T))."

The objective of this research was to optimize methanogenesis from fatty acids by evaluating a variety of support matrices for use in maintaining efficient syntrophic-methanogenic consortia. Tested matrices included clays (montmorillonite and bentonite), glass beads (106 and 425-600mum), microcarriers (cytopore, cytodex, cytoline, and cultispher; conventionally employed for cultivation of mammalian cell lines), BioSep beads (powdered activated carbon), and membranes (hydrophilic; nylon, polysulfone, and hydrophobic; teflon, polypropylene). Data obtained from headspace methane (CH(4)) analyses as an indicator of anaerobic carbon cycling efficiency indicated that material surface properties were important in maintenance and functioning of the anaerobic consortia. Cytoline yielded significantly higher CH(4) than other matrices as early as in the first week of incubation. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis from crushed cytoline matrix showed the presence of Syntrophomonas spp. (butyrate oxidizing syntrophs) and Syntrophobacter spp. (propionate oxidizing syntrophs), with Methanosaeta spp. (acetate utilizing methanogen), and Methanospirillum spp. (hydrogen utilizing methanogen) cells. It is likely that the more hydrophobic surfaces provided a suitable surface for adherence of cells of syntrophic-methanogenic consortia. Cytoline also appeared to protect entrapped consortia from air, resulting in rapid methanogenesis after aerial exposure. Our study suggests that support matrices can be used in anaerobic digestors, pre-seeded with immobilized or entrapped consortia on support matrices, and may be of value as inoculant-adsorbents to rapidly initiate or recover proper system functioning following perturbation."

This array contained 1,662 unique and group-specific probes with &lt;85% similarity to their nontarget sequences. Based on artificial probes, our results showed that under hybridization conditions of 50 degrees C and 50% formamide, the 50-mer microarray hybridization can differentiate sequences having &lt;88% similarity. Specificity tests with representative pure cultures indicated that the designed probes on the arrays appeared to be specific to their corresponding target genes. The detection limit was approximately 5 to 10 ng of genomic DNA in the absence of background DNA and 50 to 100 ng of pure-culture genomic DNA in the presence of background DNA or 1.3 x 10(7) cells in the presence of background RNA. Strong linear relationships between the signal intensity and the target DNA and RNA were observed (r(2) = 0.95 to 0.99). Application of this type of microarray to analyze naphthalene-amended enrichment and soil microcosms demonstrated that microflora changed differently depending on the incubation conditions. While the naphthalene-degrading genes from Rhodococcus-type microorganisms were dominant in naphthalene-degrading enrichments, the genes involved in naphthalene (and polyaromatic hydrocarbon and nitrotoluene) degradation from gram-negative microorganisms, such as Ralstonia, Comamonas, and Burkholderia, were most abundant in the soil microcosms. In contrast to general conceptions, naphthalene-degrading genes from Pseudomonas were not detected, although Pseudomonas is widely known as a model microorganism for studying naphthalene degradation. The real-time PCR analysis with four representative genes showed that the microarray-based quantification was very consistent with real-time PCR (r(2) = 0.74). In addition, application of the arrays to both polyaromatic-hydrocarbon- and benzene-toluene-ethylbenzene-xylene-contaminated and uncontaminated soils indicated that the developed microarrays appeared to be useful for profiling differences in microbial community structures. Our results indicate that this technology has potential as a specific, sensitive, and quantitative tool in revealing a comprehensive picture of the compositions of biodegradation genes and the microbial community in contaminated environments, although more work is needed to improve detection sensitivity."

Members of the family &quot;Syntrophobacteraceae&quot; were detected in both fens, while signals specific for the genus Desulfomonile were observed only in soils from Schlöppnerbrunnen I. These results were confirmed and extended by comparative analyses of environmentally retrieved 16S rRNA and dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase (dsrAB) gene sequences; dsrAB sequences from Desulfobacca-like SRPs, which were not identified by microarray analysis, were obtained from both fens. Hypotheses concerning the ecophysiological role of these three SRP groups in the fens were formulated based on the known physiological properties of their cultured relatives. In addition to these recognized SRP lineages, six novel dsrAB types that were phylogenetically unrelated to all known SRPs were detected in the fens.

The L-TIRs include 1005 annotated genes and increase the overall chromosome size to 9.7 Mb. The 1.06 Mb L-TIRs are the longest reported thus far for an actinomycete, and are proposed to represent the chromosomal state of the original soil isolate of S. coelicolor A3(2). S. coelicolor A3(2), M600 and J1501 possess L-TIRs, whereas approximately half the examined early mutants of A3(2) generated by ultraviolet (UV) or X-ray mutagenesis have truncated their TIRs to the 22 kb length. UV radiation was found to stimulate L-TIR truncation. Two copies of a transposase gene (SCO0020) flank 1.04 Mb of DNA in the right L-TIR, and recombination between them appears to generate strains containing short TIRs. This TIR reduction mechanism may represent a general strategy by which transposable elements can modulate the structure of chromosome ends.

The total eubacterial 16S rRNA gene copy number determined in a sample DNA by using eubacterial primers and the three standard curves led to differences in the estimated copy numbers of a factor up to 73. However, the amplification efficiencies for one specific standard curve were the same independent of the PCR primer pair used. This allowed the determination of the abundance of a population expressed as fractional number, hence, the percentage of genus-specific copy numbers within the total eubacterial 16S rRNA gene copy numbers. Determination of the fractional numbers in DNA mixtures of known composition showed the accuracy of this approach. The average difference in threshold value between two 10-fold dilutions of DNA of pure cultures, mixtures thereof and of environmental samples was -3.45+/-0.34, corresponding to an average almost optimal amplification efficiency of 1.95. This indicated that the low amplification efficiency of certain standard curves seemed to be mainly a problem of the plasmid DNA used and not of the 16S rRNA gene of the target genera."

The direct detection of Sphingomonas strains in contaminated soils, either indigenous or inoculated, is, as such, of interest for bioremediation purposes. In this study, a culture-independent PCR-based detection method using specific primers targeting the Sphingomonas 16S rRNA gene combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was developed to assess Sphingomonas diversity in PAH-contaminated soils. PCR using the new primer pair on a set of template DNAs of different bacterial genera showed that the method was selective for bacteria belonging to the family Sphingomonadaceae.Single-band DGGE profiles were obtained for most Sphingomonas strains tested. Strains belonging to the same species had identical DGGE fingerprints, and in most cases, these fingerprints were typical for one species. Inoculated strains could be detected at a cell concentration of 10(4) CFU g of soil(-1). The analysis of Sphingomonas population structures of several PAH-contaminated soils by the new PCR-DGGE method revealed that soils containing the highest phenanthrene concentrations showed the lowest Sphingomonas diversity. Sequence analysis of cloned PCR products amplified from soil DNA revealed new 16S rRNA gene Sphingomonas sequences significantly different from sequences from known cultivated isolates (i.e., sequences from environmental clones grouped phylogenetically with other environmental clone sequences available on the web and that possibly originated from several potential new species).

However, identifications based on morphology are time-consuming, require expertise in taxonomy, and often fail to distinguish differences among the multitudes of minute, nondescript planktonic organisms. Molecular techniques, which have revealed new insights into bacterial and picoplankton communities, may also enhance our knowledge of the diversity among communities of larger plankton. We compared plankton identifications and community assessments based on the two types of techniques (morphological vs molecular) for surface seawater samples collected on 2 May, 31 July and 25 September 2000 from several sampling stations in the Bay of Fundy. Phytoplankton captured in surface bucket samples were quantified and identified based on morphology. DNA was extracted from plankton communities (5-100 microm in diameter) collected by filtration, and 18S rRNA gene fragments were amplified with primers specific for eukaryotes. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to develop DNA profiles of eukaryotic phylogenetic diversity and to select cloned 18S rDNA fragments for sequencing. Both morphological and molecular methods showed great community diversity. However, the communities identified with the two different types of techniques were starkly different. Morphological abundances and taxon richness were lowest in the May samples, whereas the number of DGGE bands was highest in May and July. Morphological identifications showed a succession of dominant organisms through time. Whereas neither diatoms nor dinoflagellates were dominant in May, diatoms and a few dinoflagellates were dominant in July and September. In contrast, few 18S rDNA sequences were related to rDNA sequences of known identity, and furthermore, few diatoms were identified in the molecular analyses. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated the presence of many novel organisms, several of which were most closely related to other unidentified sequences from diverse marine environments representing new lineages. Our results support the ideas that we are just beginning to uncover the diversity of eukaryotic marine organisms and that there may be many more ubiquitous, microeukaryotic plankton than previously realized. Our results suggest that both types of methods capture only a portion of the community. Morphological methods may be more adept at capturing the phototrophic organisms within the community.

By use of two cultivation-independent techniques, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA, a high degree of moss specificity was found for associated bacterial communities. This specificity could be further evidenced by a cultivation-dependent approach for the following parameters: (i) plate counts of bacteria on R2A medium, (ii) proportion of antagonistic isolates, (iii) antagonistic activity as well as spectrum against pathogens, and (iv) diversity and richness of antagonistic isolates. The proportion of isolates with antagonistic activity against the pathogenic model fungus Verticillium dahliae was highest for S. rubellum (31%), followed by A. palustre (17%) and T. ruralis (5%). A high percentage (99%) of moss-associated antagonistic bacteria produced antifungal compounds.

A method of confocal microscopy for quantifying the density of endobacteria in spore cytoplasm was designed and applied; endobacteria were consistently found in all of the spore generations, although their number rapidly decreased from SG0 to SG4.

The isolate degraded the DETP-containing organophosphates parathion, diazinon, coumaphos, and isazofos when provided as the sole source of carbon and phosphorus, but not fenamiphos, fonofos, ethoprop, and cadusafos, which have different side chains. Studies of the molecular basis of degradation suggested that the degrading ability could be polygenic and chromosome based. Further studies revealed that the strain possessed a novel phosphotriesterase enzyme system, as the gene coding for this enzyme had a different sequence from the widely studied organophosphate-degrading gene (opd). The addition of strain B-14 (10(6) cells g(-1)) to soil with a low indigenous population of chlorpyrifos-degrading bacteria treated with 35 mg of chlorpyrifos kg(-1) resulted in a higher degradation rate than was observed in noninoculated soils. These results highlight the potential of this bacterium to be used in the cleanup of contaminated pesticide waste in the environment."

The method uses casein digest-mannitol agarose (CM) media that promote rapid dendritic growth (low K+ ion) or profuse surface film formation (high K+ ion) of Bacillus species at 40 degrees C. Inoculation from the tips of surface growth on agarose leads to self-purification and streaking on CM agar plates (hard agar and high K+) leads to characteristic colony morphology. Phenotypic and 16S rDNA analysis revealed that most root isolates obtained by this method are spore-forming Bacillus species, with enrichment for B. subtilis and its close relatives. Of particular interest is the finding that the majority of these Bacillus isolates and the B. subtilis Marburg strain also form adhering biofilms on inert surfaces. Thus the methods presented may be useful in isolation of biofilm-forming Bacillus and investigation of their role on plant roots."

This collection included 16 strains belonging to 13 pathogenic species, and 87 strains belonging to five saprophytic species isolated from plant rhizosphere and soil. Presence of conserved hypersensitive reaction/pathogenicity (hrp) genes (hrc RST) was assessed both by PCR using primers designed to amplify the corresponding sequence and by dot-blot hybridization using a PCR-amplified hrc RST fragment as a probe. PCR allowed the detection of TTSS-like genes in 75% and 32% of the phytopathogenic and saprophytic strains, respectively, and dot-blot hybridization in 100% and 49% of the phytopathogenic and saprophytic strains, respectively. The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of 26 amplified hrc RST fragments revealed a considerable diversity. Twenty-one distinct RFLP types were identified and one hrc RST fragment was sequenced per RFLP type. The obtained hrc RST sequences clustered into three groups. Two of these groups included both phytopathogenic and saprophytic strains. The diversity of 16S rRNA genes, commonly used as an evolution marker, was characterized using PCR-RFLP. Polymorphism of the 16S rRNA genes corresponded to that of hrc RST genes, suggesting that these genes have followed a similar evolution. However, the occurrence of few mismatches suggests that sometimes TTSS-like genes might have undergone horizontal genetic transfer."

Shifts in microbial community structure and function were observed during the course of degradation. Each litter sample had its unique metabolic profile and both soil effects and litter quality effects were evident. RAP-PCR products were also cloned to generate libraries.

Sequencing of the 16S rDNA amplicon assigned 12 of the 14 OTUs to Gram-positive bacteria, associated with the genera Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Exiguobacterium, Staphylococcus, Desemzia, Carnobacterium, Brevibacterium, Arthrobacter and Microbacterium of the bacterial divisions Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Two bacterial groups have phylogenetic links with the genera Comamonas and Sphingobacterium, which belong to beta-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes respectively. Two potentially novel bacteria are reported, which are associated with the genera Bacillus and Microbacterium. Most of the bacteria identified are of environmental origin, while strains related to species usually isolated from insects, animal and clinical sources were also detected. It appears that bacterial diversity in SMC is greatly affected by the origin of the initial material, its thermal pasteurization treatment and the potential unintended colonization of the mushroom substrate during the cultivation process."

Owing to the difficulty in cultivating the bacteria in vitro, the identity of X-bacteria has not been determined. As the life cycle of X-bacteria is similar to that of Legionella spp. in soil amoebae, we applied the polymerase chain reaction method with specific primers aimed at Legionella spp. for the detection and cloning of 16S rRNA gene. The identity and intracellular localization of the endosymbiont were confirmed by the application of a specific fluorescently labelled 16S rRNA-targeted probe. In addition we cloned RNA polymerase beta-subunit gene (rpoB) of X-bacteria by genomic library tagging. A phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene placed the bacterium within a unique monophyletic group containing all other members of the genus Legionella. Phylogeny from rpoB and mip genes further confirmed the taxonomic context of X-bacteria to be a Legionella sp. In all three phylogenic analyses, X-bacterium was placed apart from Legionella-like amoebal pathogens present in soil amoebae.

Close matches with environmental clones were also found, thus demonstrating much more diversity beyond previously known 16S rDNA sequences. The rep-PCR fingerprinting method revealed a high genomic variety, redundancy could not be observed among our isolates. Hence, the hitherto neglected B. niacini lineage, apparently among the most abundant soil Bacillus, was accessible to our cultivation approach."

A clone library generated from such a PCR product will be dominated by chloroplast, and the emulation of numerous chloroplasts and rhizoplane bacterial 16S rDNA for primers also distorts the results of different fingerprinting analyses. To resolve this problem, a new approach has been developed. The ribosome content is correlated with the metabolic activity of cells; therefore, RNA-based methods seem to be appropriate to exclude cell organelles (e.g. chloroplast) and dormant bacterial cells. A rapid RNA isolation and a reliable reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method were developed to investigate rhizoplane bacterial community and the results were compared with a total DNA isolation-based method of the same sample. 16S rRNA and DNA PCR products were cloned and screened by restriction analysis.

In each case, the degradation process was continuously monitored by measuring oxygen consumption. Two communities (CR1 and CR2) showed nearly equal degrees of degradation across a salinity range of 0%-10% (the former degrading about 63% of the diesel fuel and the latter about 70% after 53 and 80 d, respectively). Furthermore, the degree of degradation was not significantly lower in the presence of 17.5% salt (58% and 65% degraded, respectively). A third community (El Zorro) showed a maximum turnover at 5% salt (79% diesel fuel degraded) and significant degradation (66%) at a salinity of 10%. However, the degree of degradation by this community clearly dropped at 0% and 15% salt. None of the communities were able to degrade diesel fuel in the presence of 25% salt, but the living cell counts showed that components of the microbial population survived the long-term exposure. The surviving portion is obviously sufficient to allow substantial restoration of the original community, as verified by the BIOLOG method. Isolates of the CR1 community were identified as members of the genera Cellulomonas, Bacillus, Dietzia, and Halomonas.

We describe the colonisation of grey alder (Alnus incana) by Frankia from 10 urban soils with varying degrees of organic and inorganic pollution. Principal components analysis (PCA) of soil chemical profiles showed a separation of remediated and unremediated soils. A. incana seedlings were used as trap plants to capture the microsymbiont from soil. After 6 months growth, nodulation was lowest on trees grown with the most contaminated soils. Plant biomass was positively correlated with root nodule biomass and negatively correlated with PAH concentration. DNA was isolated from nodules for the analysis of Frankia genetic diversity. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the 16S-23S intergenic spacer (IGS) of Frankia ribosomal DNA. PCR products were subject to restriction digestion yielding 10 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) types from 72 nodules analysed. Our results demonstrate that each soil supports a distinct nodulating Frankia community. Partial 16S sequencing placed most strains in Frankia clusters 1a and 1b, which are typically Alnus-infecting, but sequences from several nodules obtained from a gasworks soil belonged to cluster 3, normally associated with Elaeagnus. These results show for the first time that polluted soils can be an effective source of Alnus-infective Frankia. Inoculation with site-adapted Frankia under greenhouse conditions could thus be an appropriate strategy to increase the symbiotic capacity of A. incana and to improve its chances of survival and growth when planted on polluted soils."

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the Acinetobacter 16S rRNA gene amplicons enabled discrimination between different Acinetobacter species. PCR using the Acinetobacter primer pair allowed detection of Acinetobacter in soil with a detection limit of 10(4) cells g(-1) soil, but attachment of the GC-clamp to the forward primer resulted in a 100-fold decrease in sensitivity. Using a nested PCR approach, the detection limit could be lowered to at least 10 cells g(-1) of soil. The method was applied to assess Acinetobacter diversity in soil samples originating from different historically hydrocarbon-contaminated sites. In addition, for one oil-contaminated soil, the dynamics of the Acinetobacter community in response to different treatments was monitored over time in a laboratory biostimulation experimental set-up. In all cases, bands in the DGGE fingerprints were cloned and sequenced. Environmental samples taken from a mineral oil-contaminated site and from a kerosene-contaminated site demonstrated relatively simple Acinetobacter 16S rRNA gene fingerprints with A. lwoffii and A. johnsonii as dominant members.

SMC arises after mushroom production in phase II compost (pIIC), predominantly comprising straw and chicken litter as principal raw ingredients. The majority of SMC waste is disposed off by application to agricultural land. It is an attractive proposition for utilising SMC as soil inorganic fertiliser supplementation. However, there is limited data available as to the consequences of this method of disposal either in terms of microbiological loading of food-borne pathogens and those of concern to mushroom industry itself. The resulting imbalance of the natural flora of the agricultural land has not been properly audited. This study aims to initially examine SMC for prevalence of faecal bacterial pathogens including Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes that may arise from chicken litter. At another level, it aims to ascertain the pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae, pv phaseolicola or tolasii) and fungal populations (Trichoderma, Verticillium species) originating mainly from the straw component of the SMC, which are of concern to the mushroom industry. Lastly, the study would also qualitatively identify the diversity of bacterial populations within SMC.

However, for specific mushroom pathogens, nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) were directly extracted from composts before subjecting to sequence analysis.

The ecological microbe-microbe and plant-microbe interactions that potentially occur between the native bacterial soil flora and those added annually (approximately 10(18) cells) needs to be reviewed with caution. The above study highlights the ecological consequences involved in the disposal of SMC wastes on agricultural land and its implications for plant, animal and human health."

For the sensitive detection of recombined BNYVV genomes, we used nested PCRs with sense primers that are preferentially extended on the A type BNYVV sequence in the region of the coat protein gene and antisense primers which are preferentially extended on the B type BNYVV sequence in a region downstream of the coat protein gene which is not present in the transgene. Controls with mixtures of sap from plants which were singly infected with A or with B type BNYVV only revealed that, unless proper precautions are taken, PCR-mediated recombination artifacts may readily be produced. A method was developed that is able to detect A type/B type recombinant RNA molecules up to dilutions of one to a million in pure B type RNA molecules. Inspite of this high sensitivity we failed to detect any BNYVV with a recombined genome in the transgenic plants of the model experiment or at the sites of the previous field release experiments."

Until recently, laboratory diagnosis of these pathogens has relied upon ELISA using polyclonal antiserum. However, due to the unstable nature of these viruses, combined with the inability to sap transmit BaYMV, high quality antiserum has been difficult to obtain and as a result the performance of ELISA is often unsatisfactory. As an alternative approach two TaqMan assays (one BaYMV-specific and the other BaMMV-specific) have been developed. These assays have been validated for three seasons, by testing samples in parallel with ELISA. This testing indicates that TaqMan is a more reliable detection method than ELISA, especially with late-season and mixed infection samples. Data is also provided on a comparison of using simplex assays versus a multiplex assay for detecting BaYMV and BaMMV. The results indicate that while multiplexing does lead to a small reduction in sensitivity, it can be used reliably to streamline routine diagnosis. Further improvements in the development of a routine diagnostic procedure are also described including details of a rapid automated extraction procedure (Kingfisher) and the use of a novel cereal-specific control assay."

They have the same chromosome number and genome sizes, and they occupy the same ecological niche. To explore the basis for this striking conservation of structure and function, we have sequenced the C. briggsae genome to a high-quality draft stage and compared it to the finished C. elegans sequence. We predict approximately 19,500 protein-coding genes in the C. briggsae genome, roughly the same as in C. elegans. Of these, 12,200 have clear C. elegans orthologs, a further 6,500 have one or more clearly detectable C. elegans homologs, and approximately 800 C. briggsae genes have no detectable matches in C. elegans. Almost all of the noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) known are shared between the two species. The two genomes exhibit extensive colinearity, and the rate of divergence appears to be higher in the chromosomal arms than in the centers. Operons, a distinctive feature of C. elegans, are highly conserved in C. briggsae, with the arrangement of genes being preserved in 96% of cases. The difference in size between the C. briggsae (estimated at approximately 104 Mbp) and C. elegans (100.3 Mbp) genomes is almost entirely due to repetitive sequence, which accounts for 22.4% of the C. briggsae genome in contrast to 16.5% of the C. elegans genome. Few, if any, repeat families are shared, suggesting that most were acquired after the two species diverged or are undergoing rapid evolution. Coclustering the C. elegans and C. briggsae proteins reveals 2,169 protein families of two or more members. Most of these are shared between the two species, but some appear to be expanding or contracting, and there seem to be as many as several hundred novel C. briggsae gene families. The C. briggsae draft sequence will greatly improve the annotation of the C. elegans genome. Based on similarity to C. briggsae, we found strong evidence for 1,300 new C. elegans genes. In addition, comparisons of the two genomes will help to understand the evolutionary forces that mold nematode genomes."

In order to gain a more comprehensive view on the distribution and diversity of Crenarchaeota in moderate habitats, we have studied 18 different terrestrial and freshwater samples by 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic surveys. In seven different soil samples of diverse geographic areas in Europe (forest, grassland, ruderal) and Asia (permafrost, ruderal) as well as in two microbial mats, we have consistently found one particular lineage of crenarchaeota. The diversity of Crenarchaeota in freshwater sediments was considerably higher with respresentative 16S rDNA sequences distributed over four different groups within the moderate crenarchaeota. Systematic analysis of a 16S rDNA universal library from a sandy ecosystem containing 800 clones exclusively revealed the presence of the soil-specific crenarchaeotal cluster. With primers specific for non-thermophilic crenarchaeota we established a rapid method to quantify archaeal 16S rDNA in real time PCR. The relative abundance of crenarchaeotal rDNA was 0.5-3% in the bulk soil sample and only 0.16% in the rhizosphere of the sandy ecosystem. A nearby agricultural setting yielded a relative abundance of 0.17% crenarchaeotal rDNA.

Total genomic DNA from this bacterial community was used to construct cosmid DNA libraries, which were functionally searched for novel enzymes of biotechnological value. Our searches in combination with cosmid sequencing resulted in identification of four clones encoding 12 putative agarase genes, most of which were organized in clusters consisting of two or three genes. Interestingly, nine of these agarase genes probably originated from gene duplications. Furthermore, we identified by DNA sequencing several other biocatalyst-encoding genes, including genes encoding a putative stereoselective amidase (amiA), two cellulases (gnuB and uvs080), an alpha-amylase (amyA), a 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme (amyB), and two pectate lyases (pelA and uvs119).

Bog peat produced CH(4) (0.4 to 1.7 micro mol g [dry wt] of soil(-1) day(-1)) under anoxic conditions. At in situ pH, supplemental H(2)-CO(2), ethanol, and 1-propanol all increased CH(4) production rates while formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate inhibited the production of CH(4); methanol had no effect. H(2)-dependent acetogenesis occurred in H(2)-CO(2)-supplemented bog peat only after extended incubation periods. Nonsupplemented bog peat initially produced small amounts of H(2) that were subsequently consumed. The accumulation of H(2) was stimulated by ethanol and 1-propanol or by inhibiting methanogenesis with bromoethanesulfonate, and the consumption of ethanol was inhibited by large amounts of H(2); these results collectively indicated that ethanol- or 1-propanol-utilizing bacteria were trophically associated with H(2)-utilizing methanogens. A total of 10(9) anaerobes and 10(7) hydrogenotrophic methanogens per g (dry weight) of bog peat were enumerated by cultivation techniques. A stable methanogenic enrichment was obtained with an acidic, H(2)-CO(2)-supplemented, fatty acid-enriched defined medium. CH(4) production rates by the enrichment were similar at pH 4.5 and 6.5, and acetate inhibited methanogenesis at pH 4.5 but not at pH 6.5.

A total of 10 bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were also retrieved from the same dilutions and enrichments and were indicative of bacteria that might be responsible for the production of H(2) that could be used by hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

Both DNA and RNA have been analysed using molecular amplification methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA). However, due to the variable persistence of nucleic acids in cells post-death, the correlation between presence of DNA and RNA and viability is not clear-cut.

Recent reports, however, demonstrate the involvement of RpoN in other symbiotic functions, although no large-scale effort has yet been undertaken to unravel the RpoN-regulon in rhizobia. We screened two complete rhizobial genomes (Mesorhizobium loti, Sinorhizobium meliloti) and four symbiotic regions (Rhizobium etli, Rhizobium sp. NGR234, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, M. loti) for the presence of the highly conserved RpoN-binding sites. A comparison was also made with two closely related non-symbiotic members of the Rhizobiales (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Brucella melitensis).RESULTS: A highly specific weight-matrix-based screening method was applied to predict members of the RpoN-regulon, which were stored in a highly annotated and manually curated dataset. Possible enhancer-binding proteins (EBPs) controlling the expression of RpoN-dependent genes were predicted with a profile hidden Markov model.CONCLUSIONS: The methodology used to predict RpoN-binding sites proved highly effective as nearly all known RpoN-controlled genes were identified. In addition, many new RpoN-dependent functions were found. The dependency of several of these diverse functions on RpoN seems species-specific. Around 30% of the identified genes are hypothetical. Rhizobia appear to have recruited RpoN for symbiotic processes, whereas the role of RpoN in A. tumefaciens and B. melitensis remains largely to be elucidated. All species screened possess at least one uncharacterized EBP as well as the usual ones. Lastly, RpoN could significantly broaden its working range by direct interfering with the binding of regulatory proteins to the promoter DNA."

Here, we have traced methylotrophic members of a rice field soil microbial community, which became active upon continuous addition of 13C-methanol (&lt; 22 mM) as studied in microcosms. By combining rRNA- and DNA-based SIP, as well as domain-specific real-time PCR detection of templates in fractions of centrifugation gradients, we were able to detect 13C-labelled bacterial rRNA after 6 days of incubation. Fingerprinting and comparative sequence analysis of 'heavy' bacterial rRNA showed that mostly members of the Methylobacteriaceae and a novel clade within the Methylophilaceae formed part of the indigenous methylotrophic community. Over time, however, the Methylophilaceae were enriched. Unexpectedly, nucleic acids of eukaryotic origin were detected, mostly in intermediately 13C-labelled gradient fractions. These eukaryotes were identified as fungi mostly related to Fusarium and Aspergillus spp., and also Cercozoa, known as predatory soil flagellates. The detection of fungi and protozoa in 13C-enriched nucleic acid fractions suggests a possible involvement in either direct assimilation of label by the fungi, or a food web, i.e. that primary 13C-methanol consuming methylotrophs were decomposed by fungi and grazed by protozoa."

However, it is questionable whether uncultured organisms from a given sample are important for determining the impact of anthropogenic stress on indigenous communities. To investigate this, soil samples were taken from a site with patchy metal contamination, and the bacterial community structure was assessed with a variety of approaches. There were small differences in microscopic epifluorescence bacterial counts. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles of 16S rRNA gene fragments (16S-DGGE) amplified directly from soil samples were highly similar. A clone library generated from the most contaminated sample revealed a diverse bacterial community, which showed similarities to pristine soil communities from other studies. However, the proportion of bacteria from the soil samples that were culturable on standard plate-counting media varied between 0.08 and 2.2%, and these values correlated negatively with metal concentrations. The culturable communities from each sample were compared by 16S-DGGE of plate washes and by fatty acid profiling of individual isolates. Each approach indicated that there were considerable differences between the compositions of the culturable communities from each sample. DGGE bands from both culture-based and culture-independent approaches were sequenced and compared. These data indicated that metal contamination did not have a significant effect on the total genetic diversity present but affected physiological status, so that the number of bacteria capable of responding to laboratory culture and their taxonomic distribution were altered. Thus, it appears that plate counts may be a more appropriate method for determining the effect of heavy metals on soil bacteria than culture-independent approaches."

A 1.65-kb fragment of the 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplified from the total community DNA was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and by cloning and sequencing. A rhizosphere effect was observed for fungal populations at all stages of plant development. In addition, pronounced changes in the composition of fungal communities during plant growth development were found by DGGE. Similar types of fingerprints were observed in two consecutive growth periods. No major differences were detected in the fungal patterns of the two cultivars. Direct cloning of 18S rDNA fragments amplified from soil or rhizosphere DNA resulted in 75 clones matching 12 dominant DGGE bands. The clones were characterized by their HinfI restriction patterns, and 39 different clones representing each group of restriction patterns were sequenced. The cloning and sequencing approach provided information on the phylogeny of dominant amplifiable fungal populations and allowed us to determine a number of fungal phylotypes that contribute to each of the dominant DGGE bands. Based on the sequence similarity of the 18S rDNA fragment with existing fungal isolates in the database, it was shown that the rhizospheres of young maize plants seemed to select the Ascomycetes order Pleosporales, while different members of the Ascomycetes and basidiomycetic yeast were detected in the rhizospheres of senescent maize plants."

However, little is known about the distribution of biosurfactant-producing bacteria in the environment. The goal of this study was to determine how common culturable surfactant-producing bacteria are in undisturbed and contaminated sites. A series of 20 contaminated (i.e., with metals and/or hydrocarbons) and undisturbed soils were collected and plated on R(2)A agar. The 1,305 colonies obtained were screened for biosurfactant production in mineral salts medium containing 2% glucose. Forty-five of the isolates were positive for biosurfactant production, representing most of the soils tested. The 45 isolates were grouped by using repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)-PCR analysis, which yielded 16 unique isolates. Phylogenetic relationships were determined by comparing the 16S rRNA gene sequence of each unique isolate with known sequences, revealing one new biosurfactant-producing microbe, a Flavobacterium sp. Sequencing results indicated only 10 unique isolates (in comparison to the REP analysis, which indicated 16 unique isolates). Surface tension results demonstrated that isolates that were similar according to sequence analysis but unique according to REP analysis in fact produced different surfactant mixtures under identical growth conditions. These results suggest that the 16S rRNA gene database commonly used for determining phylogenetic relationships may miss diversity in microbial products (e.g., biosurfactants and antibiotics) that are made by closely related isolates. In summary, biosurfactant-producing microorganisms were found in most soils even by using a relatively limited screening assay. Distribution was dependent on soil conditions, with gram-positive biosurfactant-producing isolates tending to be from heavy metal-contaminated or uncontaminated soils and gram-negative isolates tending to be from hydrocarbon-contaminated or cocontaminated soils."

The arctic tundra is a potential source of extensive methane emission due to climatic warming because of its large reservoirs of stored organic carbon.

One band dominated DGGE profiles in all three grassland types examined, and reproducible differences in the presence and intensity of bands were observed between profiles from managed and natural grassland sites. Analysis of 16S rRNA-derived amplicons from managed and natural grasslands at sites in the north of England and the north of Wales also indicated high relative abundance of non-thermophilic crenarchaeotes within the archaeal community. The band dominating the Scottish grassland site also dominated DGGE profiles from the English and Welsh sites, and similar differences were seen between profiles derived from soils subjected to different management regimes. The study indicates that grassland archaeal communities are dominated by Crenarchaeota, with closely related members of this lineage ubiquitous in distribution in UK upland pasture, and indicate that management practices influence the nature of the crenarchaeotal community."

A specific and sensitive PCR detection method that uses primers targeting the gene coding for the flagella subunit, fliC, was established. Based on the first fliC gene sequence of R. solanacearum strain K60 available at GenBank, the Ral_fliC PCR primer system was designed; this system yielded a single 724-bp product with the DNAs of all of the R. solanacearum strains tested. However, R. pickettii and four environmental Ralstonia isolates also yielded amplicons. The Ral_fliC PCR products obtained with 12 strains (R. solanacearum, R. pickettii, and environmental isolates) were sequenced. By sequence alignment, Rsol_fliC primers specific for R. solanacearum were designed. With this primer system, a specific 400-bp PCR product was obtained from all 82 strains of R. solanacearum tested. Six strains of R. pickettii and several closely related environmental isolates yielded no PCR product; however, a product was obtained with one Pseudomonas syzygii strain. A GC-clamped 400-bp fliC product could be separated in denaturing gradient gels and allowed us to distinguish P. syzygii from R. solanacearum. The Rsol_fliC PCR system was applied to detect R. solanacearum in soil. PCR amplification, followed by Southern blot hybridization, allowed us to detect about one target DNA molecule per PCR, which is equivalent to 10(3) CFU g of bulk soil(-1). The system was applied to survey soils from different geographic origins for the presence of R. solanacearum."

Microscopic counts, extractable DNA, and plate counts of viable aerobic copiotrophs (VAC) revealed that the top centimeter of crusted soils contained atypically large bacterial populations, tenfold larger than those in uncrusted, deeper soils. The plate counts were not always consistent with more direct estimates of microbial biomass. Bacterial populations peaked at the immediate subsurface (1-2 mm) in light-appearing, young crusts, and at the surface (0-1 mm) in well-developed, dark crusts, which corresponds to the location of cyanobacterial populations. Bacterial abundance decreased with depth below these horizons. Spatially resolved DGGE fingerprints of Bacterial 16S rRNA genes demonstrated the presence of highly diverse natural communities, but we could detect neither trends with depth in bacterial richness or diversity, nor a difference in diversity indices between crust types. Fingerprints, however, revealed the presence of marked stratification in the structure of the microbial communities, probably a result of vertical gradients in physicochemical parameters. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses indicated that most of the naturally occurring bacteria are novel types, with low sequence similarity (83-93%) to those available in public databases. DGGE analyses of the VAC populations indicated communities of lower diversity, with most types having sequences more than 94% similar to those in public databases. Our study indicates that soil crusts represent small-scale mantles of fertility in arid ecosystems, harboring vertically structured, little-known bacterial populations that are not well represented by standard cultivation methods."

The microbial mechanisms underlying such spatial variability in degradation rate were investigated at Deep Slade field in Warwickshire, United Kingdom. Most-probable-number analysis showed that rapid degradation of IPU was associated with proliferation of IPU-degrading organisms. Slow degradation of IPU was linked to either a delay in the proliferation of IPU-degrading organisms or apparent cometabolic degradation. Using enrichment techniques, an IPU-degrading bacterial culture (designated strain F35) was isolated from fast-degrading soil, and partial 16S rRNA sequencing placed it within the Sphingomonas group. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified bacterial community 16S rRNA revealed two bands that increased in intensity in soil during growth-linked metabolism of IPU, and sequencing of the excised bands showed high sequence homology to the Sphingomonas group. However, while F35 was not closely related to either DGGE band, one of the DGGE bands showed 100% partial 16S rRNA sequence homology to an IPU-degrading Sphingomonas sp. (strain SRS2) isolated from Deep Slade field in an earlier study. Experiments with strains SRS2 and F35 in soil and liquid culture showed that the isolates had a narrow pH optimum (7 to 7.5) for metabolism of IPU. The pH requirements of IPU-degrading strains of Sphingomonas spp. could largely account for the spatial variation of IPU degradation rates across the field."

They are known for the formation of root nodules, but little information is available about their microsymbionts. In this study, 58 root-nodule isolates from Lespedeza spp., obtained from China and the USA, were characterized using numerical taxonomic analysis of phenotypic features, SDS-PAGE analysis of whole-cell proteins, DNA-DNA hybridization, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and cross-nodulation with selected legume species. From the results generated using these approaches, it was concluded that Lespedeza spp. were promiscuous hosts for rhizobia. Four main clusters of bacteria, which included 35 of the strains isolated from Lespedeza spp., were defined upon numerical taxonomic analysis; these groups corresponded to those determined from analyses of protein electrophoretic and DNA-DNA hybridization data. The four clusters were found to define strains belonging to one of four species, Sinorhizobium saheli, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Bradyrhizobium elkanii or a novel species of the genus Bradyrhizobium. The strains of B. japonicum and B. elkanii were all from the USA soil samples, and their representative strains could not nodulate soybean. The seven strains found to represent the novel Bradyrhizobium sp. were from China. These were differentiated from recognized species of the genus Bradyrhizobium by all of the taxonomic methods used here; hence, it is proposed that the novel strains isolated from Lespedeza spp. represent a novel species of the genus Bradyrhizobium, Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense. The type strain of the novel species, CCBAU 10071(T) (= CFNEB 101(T)), formed ineffective nodules on Medicago sativa and Melilotus albus but did not nodulate soybean. The other 23 bacterial strains isolated from Lespedeza spp. were found to form single branches or small groups (two to three strains) that were related to Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium spp. on the basis of numerical taxonomic analysis, indicating the possibility that other rhizobial species are also associated with Lespedeza spp."

A molecular technique to identify plant species from root DNA would greatly facilitate investigations of the root rhizosphere.RESULTS: We show that trnL PCR product length heterogeneity and a maximum of two restriction digests can separate 14 common grassland species. The RFLP key was used to identify root fragments at least to genus level in a field study of upland grassland community diversity. Roots which could not be matched to known types were putatively identified by comparison of the nuclear ribosomal ITS sequence to the GenBank database. Ten taxa were identified among almost 600 root fragments. Additionally, we have employed capillary electrophoresis of fluorescent trnL PCR products (fluorescent fragment length polymorphism, FFLP) to discriminate all taxa identified at the field site.CONCLUSION: We have developed a molecular database for the identification of some common grassland species based on PCR-RFLP of the plastid transfer RNA leucine (trnL) UAA gene intron.

The amplicons were used in a second (semi-nested) PCR for DGGE, in which bacterial primers F968GC and R1401 were used. The resulting products were separated into community fingerprints by DGGE. To assess the reliability of the method, the diversity of Paenibacillus species was evaluated on the basis of DNA extracted directly from the rhizospheres of four different cultivars of maize (Zea mays), i.e. CMS04, CMS11, CMS22 and CMS36, sown in two Brazilian field soils (Cerrado and Várzea). In addition, a clone library was generated from the PCR-generated 16S rDNA fragments, and selected clones were sequenced. The results of the bacterial community analyses showed, at the level of clone libraries, that considerable diversity among Paenibacillus spp. was present. The most dominantly found sequences clustered into 12 groups, each one potentially representing a species complex. Sequences closely affiliated with the P. macerans and P. azotofixans complexes were found in all samples, whereas other sequences were scarcer. Clones affiliated with the latter species complex were most abundant, representing 19% of all clones analysed. The Paenibacillus fingerprints generated via semi-nested PCR followed by DGGE showed a clear distinction between the maize plants grown in Cerrado versus Várzea soils. Thus, soil type, instead of maize cultivar type, was the overriding determinative factor that influenced the community structures of the Paenibacillus communities in the rhizospheres investigated. At a lower level (subcluster), there was a trend for maize cultivars CMS11 and CMS22 on the one hand, and CMS36 and CMS04 on the other hand, to cluster together, indicating that these respective pair of cultivars were similar in their Paenibacillus species composition. This trend was tentatively linked to the growth characteristics of these maize cultivars. These results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of the Paenibacillus-specific PCR-DGGE method in describing Paenibacillus species diversity in rhizosphere soils."

Involving of each species in human infection is poorly estimated due to unclear differential phenotypic characters. We performed 16S rDNA sequencing for identification of 20 clinical isolates of Ochrobactrum sp. to the species level. Then, we studied the phenotype of each isolate especially, morphology, culture onto different media and at different temperatures, biochemical characters and antibiotics resistance pattern. Colony morphology after growth onto Trypticase-Soy and McConkey agar, culture at 45 degrees C onto Trypticase-Soja agar, presence of urease, and netilmycin, tobramycin and colistin resistance allowed identification of species. Ribotyping using HindIII and EcoRI gave a supplementary criterion for species determination but did not allow typing at the infra-species level.

Since H. schachtii cysts isolated from the suppressive soil can transfer this beneficial property to nonsuppressive soils, analysis of the cyst-associated microorganisms should lead to the identification of the causal organisms. Our experimental approach was to identify bacterial rRNA genes (rDNA) associated with H. schachtii cysts obtained from soil mixtures with various levels of suppressiveness. We hypothesized that we would be able to identify bacteria involved in the suppressiveness by correlating population shifts with differing levels of suppressiveness. Soil treatments containing different amounts of suppressive and fumigation-induced nonsuppressive soils exhibited various levels of suppressiveness after two nematode generations. The 10%-suppressive-soil treatment contained numbers of eggs per gram of soil similar to those of the 100%-suppressive-soil treatment, indicating that the suppressive factor(s) had been transferred. Bacterial rDNA associated with H. schachtii cysts were identified using a culture-independent method termed oligonucleotide fingerprinting of rRNA genes. Bacteria from five major taxonomic groups (Actinobacteria, Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides, alpha-Proteobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, and gamma-Proteobacteria) were identified. Three bacterial rDNA groups contained clones that were more prevalent in the highly suppressive soil treatments than in the less suppressive treatments, indicating a potential involvement in the H. schachtii suppressiveness. When these three groups were examined with specific PCR analyses performed on H. schachtii cysts that developed in soils treated with three biocidal compounds, only one bacterial rDNA group with moderate to high sequence identity to rDNA from several Rhizobium species and uncultured alpha-proteobacterial clones was consistently associated with the highly suppressive treatments. A quantitative PCR analysis confirmed the association of this Rhizobium-like rDNA group with the H. schachtii suppressiveness."

The results indicated that the five culture populations belonged to two reproductively isolated species. The available morphological criteria, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were insufficient to differentiate among them, and all five could be classified as one morphospecies. Within-culture variation of the morphometrical data did not discern between the two biological species. Sequence data clearly separated the populations into two groups that supported the breeding results. Given this study represented only five populations of one genus, we suggest a congruence of MOTU analysis with the biological species concept. This multifaceted approach is promising for future identification of nematodes as it is simple, comparable, and transferable."

From 16S rRNA analysis, four isolates were identified as Mycobacterium gilvum B1 (99% identity),Bacillus pumilus B44 (99% identity), Microbacterium esteraromaticum B21 (98% identity), and to the genus Porphyrobacter B51 (96% identity). The two latter isolates have not previously been associated with PAH degradation. Isolate B51 grew strongly in the interfacial fraction in the presence of naphthalene vapours and phenanthrene compared with cultures without LMW PAHs. Benzo[a]pyrene was degraded in cultures containing a HMW PAH mixture but pyrene had no effect on its degradation. The growth of isolates B1 and B21 was improved in the aqueous phase than in the interfacial fraction for cultures with naphthalene vapours. Pyrene was required for benzo[a]pyrene degradation by isolate B1. For isolate B21, pyrene and chrysene were degraded only in cultures without naphthalene vapours.CONCLUSION: Consortium enriched in a TLP culture is composed of microorganisms with different abilities to grow at the interface or in the aqueous phase according to the culture conditions and the PAH that are present.

These isolates were genetically characterized by 16S rDNA partial sequencing and random amplification of polymorphic DNA-PCR fingerprinting. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that these isolates could represent three new Bradyrhizobium species. Shrubby legumes and bradyrhizobia displayed a high symbiotic promiscuity both for infectivity and effectiveness. Symbioses were effective in more than 70% of the associations established by four of the six plant species.CONCLUSIONS: Native woody legumes in western Spain are nodulated by Bradyrhizobium strains. The high degree of symbiotic promiscuity and effectiveness highlights the complex dynamics of these communities in wild ecosystems under a Mediterranean-type climate.

Sequences from nematodes obtained from in vitro cultures (soil or clinical sources), or isolated from infected horse tissues, were compared. Gene sequences from a fatal equine clinical case from southern California and a free-living isolate recovered from southern California soil showed no fixed differences. Sequences from isolates representing two fatal equine cases from North America, one from Ontario, Canada and another from Tennessee also showed no fixed differences. In contrast, two equine cases from Tennessee had 18 fixed differences for this LSU region, the greatest observed among isolates from horses. Phylogenetic analysis of six Halicephalobus sequences and four outgroup taxa by maximum parsimony yielded one tree with five well-supported clades. This phylogeny did not group isolates of Halicephalobus strictly by region of geographic isolation or source of sample, and depicted one clinical and one soil isolate as sister taxa. These results confirm that free-living environmental isolates are potential sources of infection for horses. The phylogeny also reveals that diverse isolates can cause infections in horses within a relatively limited geographic region, and conversely that genetically similar sister taxa can be recovered from geographically distant localities.

The kinetics of degradation in five United Kingdom soils varying in pH from 4.7 to 8.4 suggested that dissipation of chlorpyrifos was mediated by the cometabolic activities of the soil microorganisms. Repeated application of chlorpyrifos to these soils did not result in the development of a microbial population with an enhanced ability to degrade the pesticide. A robust bacterial population that utilized chlorpyrifos as a source of carbon was detected in an Australian soil. The enhanced ability to degrade chlorpyrifos in the Australian soil was successfully transferred to the five United Kingdom soils. Only soils with a pH of &gt;/=6.7 were able to maintain this degrading ability 90 days after inoculation. Transfer and proliferation of degrading microorganisms from the Australian soil to the United Kingdom soils was monitored by molecular fingerprinting of bacterial 16S rRNA genes by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Two bands were found to be associated with enhanced degradation of chlorpyrifos. Band 1 had sequence similarity to enterics and their relatives, while band 2 had sequence similarity to strains of Pseudomonas. Liquid enrichment culture using the Australian soil as the source of the inoculum led to the isolation of a chlorpyrifos-degrading bacterium. This strain had a 16S rRNA gene with a sequence identical to that of band 1 in the DGGE profile of the Australian soil. DNA probing indicated that genes similar to known organophosphate-degrading (opd) genes were present in the United Kingdom soils. However, no DNA hybridization signal was detected for the Australian soil or the isolated degrader. This indicates that unrelated genes were present in both the Australian soil and the chlorpyrifos-degrading isolate. These results are consistent with our observations that degradation of chlorpyrifos in these systems was unusual, as it was growth linked and involved complete mineralization. As the 16S rRNA gene of the isolate matched a visible DGGE band from the Australian soil, the isolate is likely to be both prominent and involved in the degradation of chlorpyrifos in this soil."

We had a basic assumption that the species level variation in 16S rDNA sequences of a bacterial genus is mainly due to substitutions rather than insertion or deletion of bases. Keeping this in view, the aim was to identify a region of 16S rDNA sequence and within that focus on substitution prone stretches indicating species level variation and to derive patterns from these stretches that are specific to the genus.RESULTS: Repeating elements that are highly conserved across different species of Pseudomonas were considered as guiding markers to locate a region within the 16S gene. Four repeating patterns showing more than 80% consistency across fifty different species of Pseudomonas were identified. The sub-sequences between the repeating patterns yielded a continuous region of 495 bases. The sub-sequences after alignment and using Shanon's entropy measure yielded a consensus pattern. A stretch of 24 base positions in this region, showing maximum variations across the sampled sequences was focused for possible genus specific patterns. Nine patterns in this stretch showed nearly 70% specificity to the target genus. These patterns were further used to obtain a signature that is highly specific to Pseudomonas. The signature region was used to design PCR primers, which yielded a PCR product of 150 bp whose specificity was validated through a sample experiment.CONCLUSIONS: The developed approach was successfully applied to genus Pseudomonas. It could be tried in other bacterial genera to obtain respective signature patterns and thereby PCR primers, for their rapid tracking in the environmental samples."

Sequence types A and B, when hybridized to the probe, generate two easily differentiated heteroduplexes. Thus, from heteroduplex profiles, the presence of B. cereus-B. thuringiensis-B. anthracis subgroups in environmental samples can be inferred unambiguously. The results show that fluorescent heteroduplex analysis is an effective profiling technique for detection and differentiation of sequences representing small phylogenetic or functional groups in environmental samples."

Oligonucleotide probes based on 16S rRNA sequences are widely used to identify bacteria in the environment. However, the successful development of a chip of immobilized 16S rRNA probes for identification of large numbers of species in a single hybridization step has not yet been reported. In reverse sample genome probing (RSGP), labelled total community DNA is hybridized to arrays in which genomes of cultured microorganisms are spotted on a solid support in denatured form. This method has provided useful information on changes in composition of the cultured component of microbial communities in oil fields, the soil rhizhosphere, hydrocarbon-contaminated soils and acid mine drainage sites. Applications and limitations of the method, as well as the prospects of extending RSGP to cover also the as yet uncultured component of microbial communities, are evaluated."

Genetic databases provide a huge resource from which candidate molecular biomarkers can be identified and, subsequently, exploited to address these issues. However, a major challenge is to link these novel molecular indices to ecologically relevant whole-organism life-cycle traits (such as reproduction and growth). Such a functional link is provided by annetocin, previously characterized as a member of the vasopressin/oxytocin superfamily of neuropeptides. It is expressed in annelid worms within the neurons of the central nervous system and has been shown to be involved in the induction of egg-laying behavior. This paper outlines the validation of annetocin as a novel biomarker of reproductive fitness in the earthworm Eisenia fetida. The design of primer pairs targeted toward oligochaete annetocin has facilitated the isolation of a full-length annetocin cDNA from this species. Optimization of a real-time quantitative PCR procedure exploiting the fluorescent DNA-binding molecule, Sybr Green, has allowed the measurement of annetocin transcript levels over a range covering six orders of magnitude. Using this approach, gene expression was measured in earthworms exposed to soils polluted with high concentrations of zinc and lead. Traditional growth and reproductive indices, including cocoon production, were also recorded and related to the molecular parameter. The future use of annetocin as a molecular genetic biomarker in terrestrial ecotoxicology is discussed."

With a combination of an anti-DnirK mAb and phylogenetic oligonucleotide probes, it is possible to bring structural and functional aspects of microbial communities together. To perform a double labelling, yielding a high signal strength for both the oligonucleotide and the antibody, cells have to be labelled with the oligonucleotide first followed by immunostaining. When the labelling sequence was changed, the accessibility for the oligonucleotide was reduced if high amounts of DnirK were expressed. Using flow cytometry, it was possible to sort bacterial cells, which were stained by the antibody, from nonlabelled cells. This technique provides means for a detailed analysis of populations, which express DnirK genes in the environment, including structural aspects of a community and detailed promoter studies. Using the immunostaining approach, it was possible to identify bacteria, which have the DnirK system expressed, in samples from a wastewater sewage treatment plant as well as in samples from the rhizosphere of wheat roots. Furthermore, expression studies using an Ochrobactrum anthropi strain were carried out to investigate the correlation between N(2)O production rates and DnirK expression in batch cultures, which had been shifted from aerobic to anaerobic conditions. As expected, expression of DnirK was the highest during periods with the greatest synthesis rates for N(2)O. However, the amount of expressed enzyme was not reduced in the cells, although the N(2)O production rates dropped in the cultures 12 h after the shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions."

These isolates were compared to representative strains of known rhizobial species. Twenty-two new isolates were slow growers and twenty-eight were fast growers. A polyphasic approach was performed including comparative total protein sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) profile analysis; 16S rDNA and 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS) sequence analysis. By SDS-PAGE the slow growing isolates grouped in one major cluster containing reference strains of Bradyrhizobium sp. including strains isolated in Africa, in Brazil and in New Zealand.

The representative strains of slow growing rhizobia were identified as closely related to Bradyrbizobium elkanii and Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis, one slow growing strain (ORS199) was phylogenetically related to Bradyrbizobium sp. (Lupinus) and Blastobacter denitrificans.

Soil suspensions were plated in serial dilutions on various media. After 2, 4 and 6 weeks, colonies were collected with toothpicks and transferred to microtiterplates for cell lysis and storage plates for subculture. Cell lysis was a simple freeze-heating cycle in distilled water. The multiplex PCR was adapted to operate sufficiently for Gram positives under these conditions.

The presence of the fusion in R. sphaeroides 2.4.3 resulted in a significant increase in fluorescent intensity of the cells, but only when nitrite reductase was active. Cells lacking nitrite reductase activity and consequently the ability to generate nitric oxide were only weakly fluorescent when grown under denitrification-inducing conditions. One of the R. sphaeroides strains unable to generate nitric oxide endogenously was used as a reporter to detect exogenously produced nitric oxide. Incubation of this strain with sodium nitroprusside, a nitric oxide generator, significantly increased its fluorescence intensity. Mixing of known denitrifiers with the reporter strain also led to significant increases in fluorescence intensity, although the level varied depending on the denitrifier used. The reporter was tested on unknown isolates capable of growing anaerobically in the presence of nitrate, and one of these was able to induce expression of the fusion. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of this isolate placed it within the Thauera aromatica subgroup, which is known to contain denitrifiers.

Likewise, soil and cast archaeal 16S rRNA gene libraries were similar, although the abundances of some groups were different. Two hundred and thirty aerobic bacteria were also isolated on general heterotrophic media from casts, burrows, and soil.

With these techniques, P. stutzeri populations (n = 2 to 170) were obtained from five of six sites giving positive PCR signals (including three marine sediment and two soil samples). The phylogenetic positions of isolates from the five sites, based on their 16S ribosomal DNA sequences, indicated that the environmental isolates were affiliated with different genomovars of P. stutzeri. Using the broad-host-range plasmid pNS1 with kanamycin and gentamicin resistance determinants as the transforming DNA, naturally transformable strains were identified among the isolates from all sites. For one population from soil, the genetic relationship of the 120 members was determined by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR with three PCR primers. Among the population members which are taxonomically closely related as determined by 16S sequence comparisons of group representatives, a rather high genetic diversity and a characteristic clustering into subgroups were found. Remarkably, within the population, nontransformability and different levels of transformability (a frequency between about 10(-9) and 10(-4) per cell) were often associated with distinct genetic subgroups. It is concluded that transformability is widespread among environmental P. stutzeri strains and that its specific level is a heritable trait that may vary strongly within a local population."

Either 82 or 93% of the soil samples were positive for at least one Bcc genomovar, depending on the PCR assay system used. Cloning and sequencing were performed to check the specificity of the PCR assays. Sequence analysis of the 463-bp 16S rRNA inserts from eight clones indicated that all were from members of the Bcc. The four soil samples from which these clones were generated did not yield isolates identified as Bcc. Based on PCR detection, Bcc appears to be prevalent in soil from urban and suburban environments. Culture-based recovery of Bcc may underestimate environmental populations."

As(III) oxidation was studied under batch and continuous conditions. The main organisms present in CASO1 were identified with molecular biology tools. CASO1 exhibited significant As(III)-oxidizing activity between pH 3 and 8. The optimum temperature was 25 degrees C. As(III) oxidation was still observed in the presence of 1000 mg l(-1) As(III). In continuous culture mode, the As(III) oxidation rate reached 160 mg l(-1) h(-1). The CASO1 consortium contains at least two organisms - strain b3, which is phylogenetically close to Ralstonia picketii, and strain b6, which is related to the genus Thiomonas. The divergence in 16S rDNA sequences between b6 and the closest related organism was 5.9%, suggesting that b6 may be a new species.CONCLUSIONS: High As(III)-oxidizing activity can be obtained without organic nutrient supply, using a bacterial population from a mining environment.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The biological oxidation of arsenite by the CASO1 population is of particular interest for decontamination of arsenic-contaminated waste or groundwater."

In this work, two primer pairs, StrepB/StrepE and StrepB/StrepF combined with Bst YI restriction endonuclease digestion, targeting the 16S rRNA gene of streptomycetes were designed. The specificity of the primers was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from Streptomyces strains and near relatives. All streptomycetes tested positive and non-streptomycetes were not amplified except three strains that, however, gave Bst YI restriction endonuclease digestion results distinct from streptomycetes. Moreover, both primer pairs gave an amplification product of the expected size only when Streptomyces VTT E-99-1334 DNA was present in the template DNA mixture isolated from six bacterial and three fungal strains. The primers were further successfully used to amplify from DNA isolated from two soil and two building material samples. The 40 sequenced amplification products obtained with the primer pair StrepB/StrepE showed greater than 96.1% similarity to streptomycete 16S rRNA sequences. Seventy PCR amplification products obtained with the primers StrepB/StrepF were analysed by sequencing and restriction analysis. All 54 PCR products having &gt;95.7% similarity to streptomycete sequences were cleaved with Bst YI. No false-positive results were achieved.

We compared conventional batch enrichment with a biofilm culture method for the isolation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-degrading microbial communities from a PAH-contaminated soil. The two methods were assessed by comparing: (i) the diversity of culturable bacteria; (ii) the diversity of PAH-catabolic genes in isolated bacteria; (iii) the inter- and intraspecific diversity of active PAH-catabolic gene classes; (iv) the diversity of bacteria present in 16S rRNA gene libraries generated from RNA extracted from the two communities and soil; and (v) the estimated diversity of active bacteria in the soil and culture systems. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis showed that the biofilm culture yielded 36 bacterial and two fungal species compared with 12 bacterial species from the enrichment culture. Application of accumulation and non-parametric estimators to clone libraries generated from 16S rRNA confirmed that the biofilm community contained greater diversity. Sequencing of clones showed that only species from the Proteobacteria were active in the enrichment culture, and that these species were expressing an identical nahAc-like naphthalene dioxygenase. 16S rRNA clones generated from the biofilm community indicated that species from the Cytophaga/Flavobacterium, high G+C bacteria and Proteobacteria were active at the time of sampling, expressing cndA-, nahAc- and phnAc-like naphthalene dioxygenases. The diversity of active species in the biofilm culture system closely matched that in the PAH-contaminated source soil. The results of this study showed that biofilm culture methods are more appropriate for the study of community-level interactions in PAH-degrading microbial communities. The study also indicated that cultivation of microbial communities on solid media might be the primary source of bias in the recovery of diverse species."

A PCR-hybridization assay has been developed to identify this pathogen. This study describes the use of single and nested PCR methods for the rapid identification of P. marneffei. Two sets of oligonucleotide primers were derived from the sequence of 18S rRNA genes of P. marneffei. The outer primers (RRF1 and RRH1) were fungus specific. The inner primers (Pm1 and Pm2) were specific for P. marneffei and were used in nested or single PCR. The specific fragment of approximately 400-bp was amplified from both mold and yeast forms of 13 P. marneffei human isolates, 12 bamboo rat isolates, and 1 soil isolate, but not from other fungi, bacteria, and human DNA. The amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. The sensitivities of the single PCR and nested PCR were 1.0 pg/microl and 1.8 fg/microl, respectively. The assay is useful for rapid identification of P. marneffei cultures. Very young culture of P. marneffei (2-day-old filamentous colony, 2 mm in diameter) could be performed by this assay. The species was identified within 7 h (single PCR) or 10 h (nested PCR), compared to 4 to 7 days for confirmation of dimorphism. The application of these PCR methods for early diagnosis of the disease needs to be studied further."

The specificity of the primer set was checked on sequence databases and validated on collection strains and on one hundred soil bacterial isolates. Our results showed that both collection, soil-inhabiting Pseudomonas and some Pseudomonas-related Azotobacter DNAs could be amplified. This specific PCR for the detection of Pseudomonas strains was in good agreement with colony hybridisation using a Pseudomonas-specific probe. The targeted segment is relevant for a characterisation at the species (16S rDNA) as well as at the infraspecific (ITS1) levels.

Analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence, and morphological and physiological characteristics revealed it to be a new fast-growing Mycobacterium, closely related to other Mycobacterium species with xenobiotic-degrading capabilities. Degradation of endosulfan by strain ESD involved both oxidative and sulfur-separation reactions. Strain ESD did not degrade endosulfan when sulfite, sulphate or methionine were present in the medium along with the insecticide. Partial degradation occurred when the culture was grown, with endosulfan, in the presence of MOPS (3-(N-morpholino)propane sulphonic acid), DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), cysteine or sulphonane and complete degradation occurred in the presence of gutathione. When both beta-endosulfan and low levels of sulphate were provided as the only sources of sulfur, biphasic exponential growth was observed with endosulfan metabolism being restricted to the latter phase of exponential growth.CONCLUSIONS: This study isolated a Mycobacterium strain (strain ESD) capable of metabolizing endosulfan by both oxidative and sulfur-separation reactions. The endosulfan-degrading reactions are a result of the sulfur-starvation response of this bacterium.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This describes the isolation of a Mycobacterium strain capable of degrading the insecticide endosulfan.

Primer sets specific for Spizellomyces acuminatus and S. kniepii were developed by sequencing internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of the gene encoding ribosomal RNA for 9 isolates within the genus Spizellomyces, 5 representatives of different genera within the order Spizellomycetales and one member of the order Chytridiales. These primers were used with fungal-specific primers in a nested PCR approach to generate a specific molecular signal for S. acuminatus and S. kneipii in a soil from which S. acuminatus had previously been recovered. Using MPN-PCR (a quantitative molecular technique) and traditional cultural techniques, we found that chytridiomycetous fungi, including members of the genus Spizellomyces, are abundant in the grassland ecosystems studied. No significant differences in occurrence were observed between native and disturbed control soils but it appeared in 2 separate MPN assays and one MPN-PCR assay that chytrid populations increased in response to disturbance. No significant differences in chytrid or Spizellomyces populations were observed with variations in nitrogen availability. The primer sets and protocols developed in this study worked well to complement traditional cultural data to better assess Spizellomyces populations in the environment.

Both isolates grew on alkanes at low temperature and had general characteristics consistent with their respective phylotypes. During growth of the consortium, the three phylotype populations were monitored by a most probable number PCR assay. All three phylotypes were detected, but their relative abundance was not consistent with that of the phylotypes in the clone library. The relative abundance of all three phylotypes changed substantially during long-term incubation of the consortium.

Analyses of 16S ribosomal DNA indicated that strain SG2 falls into the Synechocystis/Pleurocapsa/Microcystis group.

No atrazine accretion, mineralization, or metabolites were detected when strain SG2 was grown with [(14)C]atrazine. Strain SG2 contained three copies of the psbA gene, which encodes the D(1) protein of the photosystem II reaction center. Nucleotide sequence analyses indicated that the psbA2 and psbA3 genes encoded predicted proteins with the same amino acid sequence. However, the psbA1 gene product contained five extra amino acids, which were not found in PsbA proteins from five other cyanobacteria. Moreover, the PsbA1 protein from strain SG2 had an additional 13 amino acid changes compared to the PsbA2/PsbA3 proteins and contained 10 amino acid alterations compared to conserved residues found in other cyanobacteria. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis indicated that the psbA1 gene and the psbA2/psbA3 gene(s) were expressed in photosynthetically grown cells in the presence of atrazine.

We assessed the phylogenetic resolution and reproducibility of TRF profiles in order to evaluate the limitations of the method, and we developed an essential analysis technique to improve the interpretation of TRF data. The theoretical phylogenetic resolution of TRF profiles was determined based on the specificity of TRFs predicted from 3,908 16S rRNA gene sequences.

As many as 85% of the 169 distinct TRFs found among the profiles were irreproducible (i.e., not present in all nine replicates). Substantial variation also occurred in the height of synonymous peaks. To make comparisons of microbial communities more reliable, we developed an analytical procedure that reduces variation and extracts a reproducible subset of data from replicate TRF profiles. The procedure can also be used with other DNA fingerprinting techniques for microbial communities or microbial genomes."

All eight classes of genes encoding this mechanism of resistance [tet(O), tet(Q), tet(W), tet(M), tetB(P), tet(S), tet(T), and otrA] were found in total DNA extracted from water of two lagoons. These determinants were found to be seeping into the underlying groundwater and could be detected as far as 250 m downstream from the lagoons. The identities and origin of these genes in groundwater were confirmed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analyses. Tetracycline-resistant bacterial isolates from groundwater harbored the tet(M) gene, which was not predominant in the environmental samples and was identical to tet(M) from the lagoons. The presence of this gene in some typical soil inhabitants suggests that the vector of antibiotic resistance gene dissemination is not limited to strains of gastrointestinal origin carrying the gene but can be mobilized into the indigenous soil microbiota. This study demonstrated that tet genes occur in the environment as a direct result of agriculture and suggested that groundwater may be a potential source of antibiotic resistance in the food chain."

Total RNAs from Geobacter chapellei and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans were hybridized to an oligonucleotide array consisting of universal and species-specific 16S rRNA probes. PCR-amplified products from Geobacter and Desulfovibrio were easily and specifically detected under a range of hybridization times, temperatures, and buffers. However, reproducible, specific hybridization and detection of intact rRNA could be accomplished only by using a chaperone-detector probe strategy. With this knowledge, assay conditions were developed for rRNA detection using a 2-h hybridization time at room temperature. Hybridization specificity and signal intensity were enhanced using fragmented RNA. Formamide was required in the hybridization buffer in order to achieve species-specific detection of intact rRNA. With the chaperone detection strategy, we were able to specifically hybridize and detect G. chapellei 16S rRNA directly from a total-RNA soil extract, without further purification or removal of soluble soil constituents. The detection sensitivity for G. chapellei 16S rRNA in soil extracts was at least 0.5 microg of total RNA, representing approximately 7.5 x 10(6) Geobacter cell equivalents of RNA. These results suggest that it is now possible to apply microarray technology to the direct detection of microorganisms in environmental samples, without using PCR."

We employed a novel fragment identification approach based on a hierarchical agglomerative clustering routine that identifies fragments in an automated fashion. No method is free of error, and we identified the major sources so that experiments can be designed to minimize its effect. Phylogenetic analysis of the fluorescent AFLP results reveals five genetic groups in these group 1 bacilli. The ATCC reference strains were restricted to two of the genetic groups, clearly not representative of the diversity in these bacteria. Both B. anthracis strains analyzed were closely related and affiliated with a B. cereus milk isolate (ATCC 4342) and a B. cereus human pathogenic strain (periodontitis). Across the entire study, pathogenic strains, including B. anthracis, were more closely related to one another than to the environmental isolates. Eight strains representing the five distinct phylogenetic clusters were further analyzed by comparison of their 16S rRNA gene sequences to confirm the phylogenetic status of these groups. This analysis was consistent with the AFLP analysis, although of much lower resolution. The innovation of automated genotype analysis by using a replicated and statistical approach to fragment identification will allow very large sample analyses in the future."

For this purpose the soil microbial community of a wheat field on an experimental farm in The Netherlands was studied by using both cultivation-based and molecule-based methods. Samples were taken in the different seasons over a 1-year period. Fatty acid-based typing of bacterial isolates obtained via plating revealed a diverse community of mainly gram-positive bacteria, and only a few isolates appeared to belong to the Proteobacteria and green sulfur bacteria. Some genera, such as Micrococcus, Arthrobacter, and Corynebacterium were detected throughout the year, while Bacillus was found only in July. Isolate diversity was lowest in July, and the most abundant species, Arthrobacter oxydans, and members of the genus Pseudomonas were found in reduced numbers in July. Analysis by molecular techniques showed that diversity of cloned 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences was greater than the diversity among cultured isolates. Moreover, based on analysis of 16S rDNA sequences, there was a more even distribution among five main divisions, Acidobacterium, Proteobacteria, Nitrospira, cyanobacteria, and green sulfur bacteria. No clones were found belonging to the gram-positive bacteria, which dominated the cultured isolates. Seasonal fluctuations were assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Statistical analysis of the banding patterns revealed significant differences between samples taken in different seasons. Cluster analysis of the patterns revealed that the bacterial community in July clearly differed from those in the other months. Although the molecule- and cultivation-based methods allowed the detection of different parts of the bacterial community, results from both methods indicated that the community present in July showed the largest difference from the communities of the other months. Efforts were made to use the sequence data for providing insight into more general ecological relationships. Based on the distribution of 16S rDNA sequences among the bacterial divisions found in this work and in literature, it is suggested that the ratio between the number of Proteobacteria and Acidobacterium organisms might be indicative of the trophic level of the soil."

Consequently, a major proportion of both genetic diversity within known gene families and an unknown number of novel gene families reside in these uncultured organisms. Isolation of these genes is limited by lack of sequence information. Where such sequence data exist, PCR directed at conserved sequence motifs recovers only partial genes. Here we outline a strategy for recovering complete open reading frames from environmental DNA samples. PCR assays were designed to target the 59-base element family of recombination sites that flank gene cassettes associated with integrons. Using such assays, diverse gene cassettes could be amplified from the vast majority of environmental DNA samples tested. These gene cassettes contained complete open reading frames, the majority of which were associated with ribosome binding sites. Novel genes with clear homologies to phosphotransferase, DNA glycosylase, methyl transferase, and thiotransferase genes were identified. However, the majority of amplified gene cassettes contained open reading frames with no identifiable homologues in databases. Accumulation analysis of the gene cassettes amplified from soil samples showed no signs of saturation, and soil samples taken at 1-m intervals along transects demonstrated different amplification profiles. Taken together, the genetic novelty, steep accumulation curves, and spatial heterogeneity of genes recovered show that this method taps into a vast pool of unexploited genetic diversity. The success of this approach indicates that mobile gene cassettes and, by inference, integrons are widespread in natural environments and are likely to contribute significantly to bacterial diversity."

One of the key differences is that the samples are ground in a denaturing solution at a temperature below 0 degrees C to inactivate nuclease activity. Two different methods were evaluated for separating RNA from DNA. Among the methods examined for RNA purification, anion exchange resin gave the best results in terms of RNA integrity, yield, and purity. With the optimized protocol, intact RNA and high-molecular-weight DNA were simultaneously recovered from 19 soil and stream sediment samples of diverse composition. The RNA yield from these samples ranged from 1.4 to 56 microg g of soil(-1) dry weight), whereas the DNA yield ranged from 23 to 435 microg g(-1). In addition, studies with the same soil sample showed that the DNA yield was, on average, 40% higher than that in our previous procedure and 68% higher than that in a commercial bead milling method.

The research focused mainly on the retrieval of pmoA, which encodes the alpha subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase. A novel methanotroph-specific community-profiling method was established using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) technique. The T-RFLP profiles clearly revealed a more complex root-associated methanotrophic community than did banding patterns obtained by pmoA-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The comparison of pmoA-based T-RFLP profiles obtained from rice roots and bulk soil of flooded rice microcosms suggested that there was a substantially higher abundance of type I methanotrophs on rice roots than in the bulk soil. These were affiliated to the genera Methylomonas, Methylobacter, Methylococcus, and to a novel type I methanotroph sublineage. By contrast, type II methanotrophs of the Methylocystis-Methylosinus group could be detected with high relative signal intensity in both soil and root compartments. Phylogenetic treeing analyses and a set of substrate-diagnostic amino acid residues provided evidence that a novel pmoA lineage was detected. This branched distinctly from all currently known methanotrophs. To examine whether the retrieval of pmoA provided a complete view of root-associated methanotroph diversity, we also assessed the diversity detectable by recovery of genes coding for subunits of soluble methane monooxygenase (mmoX) and methanol dehydrogenase (mxaF). In addition, both 16S rRNA and 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were retrieved using a PCR primer set specific to type I methanotrophs.

Although, these results have been impressive, they have been tempered by sampling difficulties and limited by the taxonomic resolution of restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. Minor modifications of the sampling schemes, and more use of direct sequencing, has the potential to solve these problems.

PCR and reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR were used to amplify 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and 16S rRNA, respectively, and the products were subjected to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Prominent DGGE bands were excised and sequenced to gain insight into the identities of predominantly present (PCR) and predominantly active (RT-PCR) bacterial populations. The majority of DGGE band sequences were related to bacterial genera previously associated with the rhizosphere, such as Pseudomonas, Comamonas, Variovorax, and Acetobacter, or typical of root-free soil environments, such as Bacillus and Arthrobacter. The PCR-DGGE patterns observed for bulk soil were somewhat more complex than those obtained from rhizosphere samples, and the latter contained a subset of the bands present in bulk soil. DGGE analysis of RT-PCR products detected a subset of bands visible in the rDNA-based analysis, indicating that some dominantly detected bacterial populations did not have high levels of metabolic activity. The sequences detected by the RT-PCR approach were, however, derived from a wide taxonomic range, suggesting that activity in the rhizosphere was not determined at broad taxonomic levels but rather was a strain- or species-specific phenomenon. Comparative analysis of DGGE profiles grouped all DNA-derived root tip samples together in a cluster, and within this cluster the root tip samples from young plants formed a separate subcluster. Comparison of rRNA-derived bacterial profiles showed no grouping of root tip samples versus root base samples. Rather, all profiles derived from 2-week-old plant rhizosphere soils grouped together regardless of location along the root."

Semi-improved grassland soils were analyzed only by DGGE. No differences between communities were detected by calculation of diversity indices and similarity coefficients for clone data (possibly due to poor coverage). Differences were not observed between the diversities of individual unimproved and improved grassland DGGE profiles, although considerable spatial variation was observed among triplicate samples. Semi-improved grassland samples, however, were less diverse than the other grassland samples and had much lower within-group variation. DGGE banding profiles obtained from triplicate samples pooled prior to analysis indicated that there was less evenness in improved soils, suggesting that selection for specific bacterial groups occurred. Analysis of DGGE profiles by canonical variate analysis but not by principal-coordinate analysis, using unweighted data (considering only the presence and absence of bands) and weighted data (considering the relative intensity of each band), demonstrated that there were clear differences between grasslands, and the results were not affected by weighting of data.

Several bacterial populations were more abundant on diseased plants than on healthy plants, as indicated by higher counts on a Pseudomonas-selective medium and a higher fluorescence signal in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of amplified 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) of the most abundant cultured populations showed a shift in dominance from Pseudomonas to Chryseobacterium species in the rhizosphere of diseased plants.

Changes in soil microbial community structure were examined in a microcosm experiment following the application of methyl bromide (MeBr), methyl isothiocyanate, 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D), and chloropicrin. Variations among Biolog fingerprints showed that the effect of MeBr on heterotrophic microbial activities was most severe in the first week and that thereafter the effects of MeBr and the other fumigants were expressed at much lower levels. The results of PLFA analysis demonstrated a community shift in all treatments to a community dominated by gram-positive bacterial biomass. Different 16S rDNA profiles from fumigated soils were quantified by analyzing the DGGE band patterns. The Shannon-Weaver index of diversity, H, was calculated for each fumigated soil sample. High diversity indices were maintained between the control soil and the fumigant-treated soils, except for MeBr (H decreased from 1.14 to 0.13). After 12 weeks of incubation, H increased to 0.73 in the MeBr-treated samples. Sequence analysis of clones generated from unique bands showed the presence of taxonomically unique clones that had emerged from the MeBr-treated samples and were dominated by clones closely related to Bacillus spp. and Heliothrix oregonensis. Variations in the data were much higher in the Biolog assay than in the PLFA and DGGE assays, suggesting a high sensitivity of PLFA analysis and DGGE in monitoring the effects of fumigants on soil community composition and structure.

This decrease in diversity may be due to toxicity, since significantly fewer Mycobacterium phylotypes were detected in soils determined to be toxic by the Microtox assay than in nontoxic soils.

The DNA G+C content of Herbaspirillum frisingense sp. nov. is 63+/-2 mol%, in agreement with the values of 61-65% for the genus. PCR fingerprinting exhibits a consistent pattern for groups of strains isolated from the same plant, suggesting a low genomic diversity among bacteria inhabiting C4-gramineous plant tissues. Low genetic DNA diversity seems to be common between probable endophytic bacterial isolates of the same taxon. The type strain of Herbaspirillum frisingense sp. nov. is GSF30T (= DSM 13128T)."

The bacterial community degrading rice straw under anoxic conditions was investigated with molecular methods. Rice straw was incubated in paddy soil anaerobically for 71 days. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the amplified bacterial 16S rRNA genes showed that the composition of the bacterial community changed during the first 15 days but then was stable until the end of incubation. Fifteen DGGE bands with different signal intensities were excised, cloned, and sequenced. In addition, DNA was extracted from straw incubated for 1 and 29 days and the bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified and cloned. From these clone libraries 16 clones with different electrophoretic mobilities on a DGGE gel were sequenced. From a total of 31 clones, 20 belonged to different phylogenetic clusters of the clostridia, i.e., clostridial clusters I (14 clones), III (1 clone), IV (1 clone), and XIVa (4 clones). One clone fell also within the clostridia but could not be affiliated to one of the clostridial clusters. Ten clones grouped closely with the genera Bacillus (3 clones), Nitrosospira (1 clone), Fluoribacter (1 clones), and Acidobacterium (2 clones) and with clone sequences previously obtained from rice field soil (3 clones). The relative abundances of various phylogenetic groups in the rice straw-colonizing community were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Bacteria were detached from the incubated rice straw with an efficiency of about 80 to 90%, as determined by dot blot hybridization of 16S rRNA in extract and residue. The number of active (i.e., a sufficient number of ribosomes) Bacteria detected with a general eubacterial probe (Eub338) after 8 days of incubation was 61% of the total cell counts. This percentage decreased to 17% after 29 days of incubation. Most (55%) of the active cells on day 8 belonged to the genus Clostridium, mainly to clostridial clusters I (24%), III (6%), and XIVa (24%). An additional 5% belonged to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum, 4% belonged to the alpha, beta, and gamma Proteobacteria, and 1.3% belonged to the Bacillus subbranch of the gram-positive bacteria with a low G+C content. The results show that the bacterial community colonizing and decomposing rice straw developed during the first 15 days of incubation and was dominated by members of different clostridial clusters, especially clusters I, III, and XIVa."

Samples taken from a polluted field soil (A) along a concentration gradient of sulfurous oil and from soil microcosms treated with dibenzothiophene (DBT)-containing petroleum (FSL soil) were analyzed. Analyses included plate counts of total bacteria and of DBT utilizers, molecular community profiling via soil DNA-based PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), and detection of genes that encode enzymes involved in the desulfurization of hydrocarbons, i.e., dszA, dszB, and dszC. Data obtained from the A soil showed no discriminating effects of oil levels on the culturable bacterial numbers on either medium used. Generally, counts of DBT degraders were 10- to 100-fold lower than the total culturable counts. However, PCR-DGGE showed that the numbers of bands detected in the molecular community profiles decreased with increasing oil content of the soil. Analysis of the sequences of three prominent bands of the profiles generated with the highly polluted soil samples suggested that the underlying organisms were related to Actinomyces sp., Arthrobacter sp., and a bacterium of uncertain affiliation. dszA, dszB, and dszC genes were present in all A soil samples, whereas a range of unpolluted soils gave negative results in this analysis. Results from the study of FSL soil revealed minor effects of the petroleum-DBT treatment on culturable bacterial numbers and clear effects on the DBT-utilizing communities. The molecular community profiles were largely stable over time in the untreated soil, whereas they showed a progressive change over time following treatment with DBT-containing petroleum. Direct PCR assessment revealed the presence of dszB-related signals in the untreated FSL soil and the apparent selection of dszA- and dszC-related sequences by the petroleum-DBT treatment. PCR-DGGE applied to sequential enrichment cultures in DBT-containing sulfur-free basal salts medium prepared from the A and treated FSL soils revealed the selection of up to 10 distinct bands. Sequencing a subset of these bands provided evidence for the presence of organisms related to Pseudomonas putida, a Pseudomonas sp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Rhodococcus erythropolis. Several of 52 colonies obtained from the A and FSL soils on agar plates with DBT as the sole sulfur source produced bands that matched the migration of bands selected in the enrichment cultures. Evidence for the presence of dszB in 12 strains was obtained, whereas dszA and dszC genes were found in only 7 and 6 strains, respectively. Most of the strains carrying dszA or dszC were classified as R. erythropolis related, and all revealed the capacity to desulfurize DBT. A comparison of 37 dszA sequences, obtained via PCR from the A and FSL soils, from enrichments of these soils, and from isolates, revealed the great similarity of all sequences to the canonical (R. erythropolis strain IGTS8) dszA sequence and a large degree of internal conservation. The 37 sequences recovered were grouped in three clusters. One group, consisting of 30 sequences, was minimally 98% related to the IGTS8 sequence, a second group of 2 sequences was slightly different, and a third group of 5 sequences was 95% similar. The first two groups contained sequences obtained from both soil types and enrichment cultures (including isolates), but the last consisted of sequences obtained directly from the polluted A soil."

Little is known about the molecular biology of Histoplasma dimorphism. In particular, the possible roles of genes which are transcriptionally silent in yeast (i.e. mold-specific) have not been studied. We have produced a cDNA library highly enriched for mold-upregulated clones by fragmenting cDNA and removing yeast-specific and common sequences with a highly efficient enzyme degrading subtraction method. Screening of randomly selected clones identified cDNA fragments representing 16 different mold-upregulated genes. Because multiple cDNA fragments can be treated as alleles in a genetic screen, we were able to apply probability analysis to estimate the total number of mold-upregulated genes. We estimate that there are 27 upregulated genes; cDNA fragments of 16 have been isolated. Here we report the first isolation and analysis of cDNA from two mold-specific genes, MS8 (GenBank AF292398) and MS88 (GenBank AF357882). The MS8 transcript was very strongly expressed in mold but not detected on Northern blots with yeast RNA.

The MS88 transcript was weakly expressed in mold and not detected in yeast. The putative MS88 protein was predicted to be 22.5 kDa (219 aa) with a pI of 4.46.

Two rhizobial strains which have been isolated from root nodules of the aquatic legumes Aeschynomene fluminensis (IRBG271) and Sesbania aculeata (IRBG74) were previously found to promote rice growth. In addition to analyzing their phylogenetic positions, we assessed the suitability of the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacer (IGS) sequences for the differentiation of closely related rhizobial taxa and for the development of PCR protocols allowing the specific detection of strains in the environment. 16S rDNA sequence analysis (sequence identity, 99%) and phylogenetic analysis of IGS sequences showed that strain IRBG271 was related to but distinct from Bradyrhizobium elkanii. Rhizobium sp. (Sesbania) strain IRBG74 was located in the Rhizobium-Agrobacterium cluster as a novel lineage according to phylogenetic 16S rDNA analysis (96.8 to 98.9% sequence identity with Agrobacterium tumefaciens; emended name, Rhizobium radiobacter). Strain IRBG74 harbored four copies of rRNA operons whose IGS sequences varied only slightly (2 to 9 nucleotides). The IGS sequence analyses allowed intraspecies differentiation, especially in the genus Bradyrhizobium, as illustrated here for strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, B. elkanii, Bradyrhizobium liaoningense, and Bradyrhizobium sp. (Chamaecytisus) strain BTA-1. It also clearly differentiated fast-growing rhizobial species and strains, albeit with lower statistical significance. Moreover, the high sequence variability allowed the development of highly specific IGS-targeted nested-PCR assays. Strains IRBG74 and IRBG271 were specifically detected in complex DNA mixtures of numerous related bacteria and in the DNA of roots of gnotobiotically cultured or even of soil-grown rice plants after inoculation.

Quantification of heterotrophic flagellates and naked amoebae in soil has traditionally relied on dilution culturing techniques, followed by most-probable-number (MPN) calculations. Such methods are biased by differences in the culturability of soil protozoa and are unable to quantify specific taxonomic groups, and the results are highly dependent on the choice of media and the skills of the microscopists. Successful detection of protozoa in soil by DNA techniques requires (i) the development and validation of DNA extraction and quantification protocols and (ii) the collection of sufficient sequence data to find specific protozoan 18S ribosomal DNA sequences. This paper describes the development of an MPN-PCR assay for detection of the common soil flagellate Heteromita globosa, using primers targeting a 700-bp sequence of the small-subunit rRNA gene. The method was tested by use of gnotobiotic laboratory microcosms with sterile tar-contaminated soil inoculated with the bacterium Pseudomonas putida OUS82 UCB55 as prey. There was satisfactory overall agreement between H. globosa population estimates obtained by the PCR assay and a conventional MPN assay in the three soils tested."

Upon digestion using a specific restriction endonuclease, labeled and unlabeled fragments are generated. This restriction endonuclease is chosen such that following this digestion, each labeled fragment corresponds to a different sequence variant. During electrophoretic separation, the DNA sequencing machine detects only these labeled fragments and therefore detects only the sequence variants.

Stochastic tests derived from the neutral theory of evolution (including Slatkin's exact test, Watterson's homozygosity test and the Tajima test) indicated that the population had developed under strong purifying selection pressure.

Phytopathogenicity of a P. brassicacearum strain determined with tomato plants reached the level obtained with the type strain of the known pathogen Pseudomonas corrugata.

Nine rhizobial genomospecies were identified, and these taxa corresponded to previously described genomospecies (B. Lafay and J. J. Burdon, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 64:3989-3997, 1998). Eight of these genomospecies belonged to the Bradyrhizobium lineage and accounted for 96.6% of the isolates. The remaining genomospecies corresponded to Rhizobium tropici. For analysis of geographic patterns, results were grouped into five latitudinal regions regardless of host origin. In each region, as observed previously for rhizobial isolates taken from non-Acacia legumes (Lafay and Burdon, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 64:3989-3997, 1998), rhizobial communities were dominated by one or two genomospecies, the identities of which varied from place to place. Despite this similarity in patterns, the most abundant genomospecies for Acacia isolates differed from the genomospecies found in the non-Acacia-derived rhizobial collection, suggesting that there is a difference in nodulation patterns of the Mimosoideae and the Papilionoideae. Only two genomospecies were both widespread and relatively abundant across the range of sites sampled. Genomospecies A was found in all regions except the most northern sites located in Queensland, whereas genomospecies B was not detected in Tasmania. This suggests that genomospecies A might be restricted to the more temperate regions of Australia, whereas in contrast, genomospecies B occurs in different climatic and edaphic conditions across the whole continent. The latter hypothesis is supported by the presence of genomospecies B in southwestern Australia, based on partial SSU rDNA sequence data (N. D. S. Marsudi, A. R. Glenn, and M. J. Dilworth, Soil Biol.

Strains of these 4 species were obtained from the American type culture collection (ATCC) and were characterized using biochemical tests and ARDRA patterns obtained on their partial-lenght amplified 16S rDNAs. To validate this approach, ARDRA with two restriction enzymes, TaqI and HhaI, was applied to 49 thermophilic actinomycete-like strains from environmental samples (sawmills). The results obtained show that combining some cultural characteristics and biochemical tests, such as xanthine or hypoxanthine decomposition, growth in the presence of NaCl, lysozyme or novobiocin, and spore resistance over 100 degrees C provide a rough identification and selection of the genera of interest. Consequently, target species could be confirmed by digestion of partial-lenght 16S rDNA with the use of Taql and HhaI restriction enzymes that gave specific restriction patterns.

Regulatory agencies compensate for this uncertainty by lowering cleanup goals, but in this process they effectively exclude otherwise attractive cleanup options (i.e. bioremediation). Direct evaluations of soil and sediment toxicity preclude uncertainty from most of these sources. However, the time and cost of chronic toxicity tests limits their general application to higher levels of tiered toxicity assessments. Transcriptional level (mRNA) toxicity assessments offer great advantages in terms of speed, cost and sample throughput. These advantages are currently offset by questions about the environmental relevance of molecular level responses. To this end a flow-through, high-density DNA hybridization array (genosensor) system specifically designed for environmental risk assessment was developed. The genosensor is based on highly regular microchannel glass wafers to which gene probes are covalently bound at discrete (200-microm diameter spot) and addressable (250-microm spot pitch) locations. The flow-through design enables hybridization and washing times to be reduced from approximately 18 h to 20 min. The genosensor was configured so that DNA from 28 environmental samples can be simultaneously hybridized with up to 64 different gene probes. The standard microscopic slide format facilitates data capture with most automated array readers and, thus high sample throughput (&gt; 350 sample/h). In conclusion, hardware development for molecular analysis is enabling very tractable means for analyzing RNA and DNA. These developments have underscored the need for further developmental work in probe design software, and the need to relate transcriptional level data to whole-organism toxicity indicators."

To develop methods to investigate the full extent of microbial diversity, we used a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector to construct libraries of genomic DNA isolated directly from soil (termed metagenomic libraries). To date, we have constructed two such libraries, which contain more than 1 Gbp of DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from one of the libraries indicates that the BAC libraries contain DNA from a wide diversity of microbial phyla, including sequences from diverse taxa such as the low-G+C, gram-positive Acidobacterium, Cytophagales, and Proteobacteria. Initial screening of the libraries in Escherichia coli identified several clones that express heterologous genes from the inserts, confirming that the BAC vector can be used to maintain, express, and analyze environmental DNA. The phenotypes expressed by these clones include antibacterial, lipase, amylase, nuclease, and hemolytic activities. Metagenomic libraries are a powerful tool for exploring soil microbial diversity, providing access to the genetic information of uncultured soil microorganisms. Such libraries will be the basis of new initiatives to conduct genomic studies that link phylogenetic and functional information about the microbiota of environments dominated by microorganisms that are refractory to cultivation."

Four soil communities representing two pinyon rhizosphere and two between-tree (interspace) soil environments were compared by analysis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and culture collections (Dunbar et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:1662-1669, 1998) and by analysis of 16S rDNA TRF profiles of community DNA. The TRF method was able to differentiate the four communities in a manner consistent with previous comparisons of the communities by analysis of 16S rDNA clone libraries. TRF profiles were not useful for calculating and comparing traditional community richness or evenness values among the four soil environments. Statistics calculated from RsaI, HhaI, HaeIII, and MspI profiles of each community were inconsistent, and the combined data were not significantly different between samples. The detection sensitivity of the method was tested. In standard PCRs, a seeded population comprising 0.1 to 1% of the total community could be detected. The combined results demonstrate that TRF analysis is an excellent method for rapidly comparing the relationships between bacterial communities in environmental samples. However, for highly complex communities, the method appears unable to provide classical measures of relative community diversity."

To examine this question, we performed an experiment with barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants under iron-limiting and iron-sufficient growth conditions. Plants were grown in an iron-limiting soil in root box microcosms. One-half of the plants were treated with foliar iron every day to inhibit phytosiderophore production and to alter root exudate composition. After 30 days, the bacterial communities associated with different root zones, including the primary root tips, nonelongating secondary root tips, sites of lateral root emergence, and older roots distal from the tip, were characterized by using 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fingerprints generated by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Our results showed that the microbial communities associated with the different root locations produced many common 16S rDNA bands but that the communities could be distinguished by using correspondence analysis. Approximately 40% of the variation between communities could be attributed to plant iron nutritional status. A sequence analysis of clones generated from a single 16S rDNA band obtained at all of the root locations revealed that there were taxonomically different species in the same band, suggesting that the resolving power of DGGE for characterization of community structure at the species level is limited. Our results suggest that the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere are substantially different in different root zones and that a rhizosphere community may be altered by changes in root exudate composition caused by changes in plant iron nutritional status."

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), coupled with specific oligonucleotide probing, was used to analyze 16S rRNA genes of ammonia oxidizers belonging to the beta subgroup of the division Proteobacteria by use of DNA extracted from cultivated, successional, and native deciduous forest soils. Community profiles of the different soil types were compared with nitrification rates and most-probable-number (MPN) counts. Despite significant variation in measured nitrification rates among communities, there were no differences in the DGGE banding profiles of DNAs extracted from these soils. DGGE profiles of DNA extracted from samples of MPN incubations, cultivated at a range of ammonia concentrations, showed the presence of bands not amplified from directly extracted DNA. Nitrosomonas-like bands were seen in the MPN DNA but were not detected in the DNA extracted directly from soils. These bands were detected in some samples taken from MPN incubations carried out with medium containing 1,000 microg of NH(4)(+)-N ml(-1), to the exclusion of bands detected in the native DNA. Cell concentrations of ammonia oxidizers determined by MPN counts were between 10- and 100-fold lower than those determined by competitive PCR (cPCR). Although no differences were seen in ammonia oxidizer MPN counts from the different soil treatments, cPCR revealed higher numbers in fertilized soils. The use of a combination of traditional and molecular methods to investigate the activities and compositions of ammonia oxidizers in soil demonstrates differences in fine-scale compositions among treatments that may be associated with changes in population size and function."

Inskeep, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 66:2695-2702, 2000). Bacteria enriched and isolated from contaminated soils under these conditions were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal DNA segments. Compared to DGGE patterns obtained with enrichment cultures containing sand or no sorptive solid phase, different DGGE patterns were obtained with enrichment cultures containing phenanthrene sorbed to beads of Amberlite IRC-50 (AMB), a weak cation-exchange resin, and especially Biobead SM7 (SM7), a polyacrylic resin that sorbed phenanthrene more strongly. SM7 enrichments selected for mycobacterial phenanthrene mineralizers, whereas AMB enrichments selected for a Burkholderia sp. that degrades phenanthrene. Identical mycobacterial and Burkholderia 16S rRNA sequence segments were found in SM7 and AMB enrichment cultures inoculated with contaminated soil from two geographically distant sites. Other closely related Burkholderia sp. populations, some of which utilized phenanthrene, were detected in sand and control enrichment cultures. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that different phenanthrene-utilizing bacteria inhabiting the same soils may be adapted to different phenanthrene bioavailabilities."

A total of 1,716 isolates were obtained, and 188 of these isolates were able to produce DAPG. DAPG producers were isolated at each stage of plant growth, indicating that the maize rhizosphere is colonized by natural DAPG producers throughout development. The frequency of DAPG producers was very low in the first stage of plant growth and increased over time. An analysis of the level of biodiversity of the DAPG producers at the species level was performed by comparing the AluI restriction patterns of the 16S ribosomal DNAs (rDNAs) amplified by PCR from 167 isolates. This comparison allowed us to cluster the isolates into four amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) groups, and the main group (ARDRA group 1) contained 89.8% of the isolates. The diversity of the 150 isolates belonging to ARDRA group 1 was analyzed by the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. An analysis of RAPD patterns by a molecular variance method revealed that there was a high level of genetic diversity in this population and that the genetic diversity was related to plant age. Finally, we found that some of the DAPG producers, which originated from all stages of plant growth, had the same genotype. These DAPG producers could be exploited in future screening programs for biocontrol agents."

The aim of this study was to determine the origin and composition of bacterial communities in the developing barley (Hordeum vulgare) phytosphere, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 16S rRNA genes amplified from extracted DNA. Discrete community compositions were identified in the endorhizosphere, rhizoplane, and rhizosphere soil of plants grown in an agricultural soil for up to 36 days. Cluster analysis revealed that DGGE profiles of the rhizoplane more closely resembled those in the soil than the profiles found in the root tissue or on the seed, suggesting that rhizoplane bacteria primarily originated from the surrounding soil. No change in bacterial community composition was observed in relation to plant age. Pregermination of the seeds for up to 6 days improved the survival of seed-associated bacteria on roots grown in soil, but only in the upper, nongrowing part of the rhizoplane. The potential occurrence of skewed PCR amplification was examined, and only minor cases of PCR bias for mixtures of two different DNA samples were observed, even when one of the samples contained plant DNA. The results demonstrate the application of culture-independent, molecular techniques in assessment of rhizosphere bacterial populations and the importance of the indigenous soil population in colonization of the rhizosphere."

When the soil was amended with nutrients, plasmid transfer and enhanced degradation of 2,4-D were observed. These findings were most striking in the B horizon, where the indigenous bacteria were unable to degrade any of the 2,4-D (100 mg/kg of soil) during at least 22 days but where inoculation with either of the two plasmid donors resulted in complete 2,4-D degradation within 14 days. In contrast, in soils not amended with nutrients, inoculation of donors in the A horizon and subsequent formation of transconjugants (10(5) CFU/g of soil) could not increase the 2,4-D degradation rate compared to that of the noninoculated soil. However, donor inoculation in the nonamended B-horizon soil resulted in complete degradation of 2,4-D within 19 days, while no degradation at all was observed in noninoculated soil during 89 days. With plasmid pEMT1, this enhanced degradation seemed to be due only to transconjugants (10(5) CFU/g of soil), since the donor was already undetectable when degradation started. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes showed that inoculation of the donors was followed by a shift in the microbial community structure of the nonamended B-horizon soils. The new 16S rRNA gene fragments in the DGGE profile corresponded with the 16S rRNA genes of 2,4-D-degrading transconjugant colonies isolated on agar plates. This result indicates that the observed change in the community was due to proliferation of transconjugants formed in soil. Overall, this work clearly demonstrates that bioaugmentation can constitute an effective strategy for cleanup of soils which are poor in nutrients and microbial activity, such as those of the B horizon."

We found that also in the guts of the higher termites Nasutitermes arborum (wood-feeding), Thoracotermes macrothorax, and Anoplotermes pacificus (both soil-feeding), lactic acid bacteria represent the largest group of culturable carbohydrate-utilizing bacteria (3.6-5.2x10(4) bacteria per gut; 43%-54% of all colonies). All isolates were coccoid and phenotypically difficult to distinguish, but their enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence (ERIC) fingerprint patterns showed a significant genetic diversity. Six different genotypes each were identified among the isolates from R. flavipes and T. macrothorax, and representative strains were selected for further characterization. By 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain RfL6 from R. flavipes was classified as a close relative of Enterococcus faecalis, whereas strain RfLs4 from R. flavipes and strain TmLO5 from T. macrothorax were closely related to Lactococcus lactis. All strains consumed oxygen during growth on glucose and cellobiose; oxygen consumption of these and other isolates from both termite species was due to NADH and pyruvate oxidase activities, but did not result in H2O2 formation. In order to assess the significance of the isolates in the hindgut, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to compare the fingerprints of 16S rRNA genes in the bacterial community of R. flavipes with those of representative isolates. The major DNA band from the hindgut bacterial community was further separated by bisbenzimide-polyethylene glycol electrophoresis, and the two resulting bands were sequenced. Whereas one sequence belonged to a spirochete, the second sequence was closely related to the sequences of the Lactococcus strains RfLs4 and TmLO5. Apparently, those isolates represent strains of a new Lactococcus species which forms a significant fraction of the complex hindgut community of the lower termite R. flavipes and possibly also of other termites."
