Especially in complex eukaryotes, data generated by these methods, coupled with other genome-wide datasets, demonstrated that non-random chromatin folding correlates strongly with cellular processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.RESULTS: We describe a genome architecture assay, tethered multiple 3C (TM3C), that maps genome-wide chromatin contacts via a simple protocol of restriction enzyme digestion and religation of fragments upon agarose gel beads followed by paired-end sequencing. In addition to identifying contacts between pairs of loci, TM3C enables identification of contacts among more than two loci simultaneously. We use TM3C to assay the genome architectures of two human cell lines: KBM7, a near-haploid chronic leukemia cell line, and NHEK, a normal diploid human epidermal keratinocyte cell line. We confirm that the contact frequency maps produced by TM3C exhibit features characteristic of existing genome architecture datasets, including the expected scaling of contact probabilities with genomic distance, megabase scale chromosomal compartments and sub-megabase scale topological domains. We also confirm that TM3C captures several known cell type-specific contacts, ploidy shifts and translocations, such as Philadelphia chromosome formation (Ph+) in KBM7. We confirm a subset of the triple contacts involving the IGF2-H19 imprinting control region (ICR) using PCR analysis for KBM7 cells. Our genome-wide analysis of pairwise and triple contacts demonstrates their preference for linking open chromatin regions to each other and for linking regions with higher numbers of DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs) to each other. For near-haploid KBM7 cells, we infer whole genome 3D models that exhibit clustering of small chromosomes with each other and large chromosomes with each other, consistent with previous studies of the genome architectures of other human cell lines.CONCLUSION: TM3C is a simple protocol for ascertaining genome architecture and can be used to identify simultaneous contacts among three or four loci. Application of TM3C to a near-haploid human cell line revealed large-scale features of chromosomal organization and multi-way chromatin contacts that preferentially link regions of open chromatin."

However, there is currently no parameter to quantitatively measure the structural characteristics of TADs, thus obscuring our understanding on the structural and functional differences among TADs. Based on our finding that there exist intrinsic chromatin interaction patterns in TADs, we define a theoretical parameter, called aggregation preference (AP), to characterize TAD structures by capturing the interaction aggregation degree. Applying this defined parameter to 11 Hi-C data sets generated by both traditional and in situ Hi-C experimental pipelines, our analyses reveal that heterogeneous structures exist among TADs, and this structural heterogeneity is significantly correlated to DNA sequences, epigenomic signals and gene expressions. Although TADs can be stable in genomic positions across cell lines, structural comparisons show that a considerable number of stable TADs undergo significantly structural rearrangements during cell changes. Moreover, the structural change of TAD is tightly associated with its transcription remodeling. Altogether, the theoretical parameter defined in this work provides a quantitative method to link structural characteristics and biological functions of TADs, and this linkage implies that chromatin interaction pattern has the potential to mark transcription activity in TADs."

In particular, they can be applied to the study of chromosome folding and organization in model organisms with small genomes and for which powerful genetic tools exist, such as budding yeast. Studies in yeast allow the mechanisms that establish or maintain chromatin structure to be analyzed at very high resolution with relatively low cost, and further our understanding of these fundamental processes in higher eukaryotes as well. Here we provide an overview of chromatin structure and introduce methods for performing 3C, with a focus on studies in budding yeast. Variations of the basic 3C approach (e.g., 3C-PCR, 5C, and Hi-C) can be used according to the scope and goals of a given experiment."
"26134906";"3C";"(3C AND chromosome)";"Cold Spring Harb Protoc";0;2015;"Hi-C in Budding Yeast.";"Hi-C enables simultaneous detection of interaction frequencies between all possible pairs of restriction fragments in the genome. The Hi-C method is based on chromosome conformation capture (3C), which uses formaldehyde cross-linking to fix chromatin regions that interact in three-dimensional space, irrespective of their genomic locations. In the Hi-C protocol described here, cross-linked chromatin is digested with HindIII and the ends are filled in with a nucleotide mix containing biotinylated dCTP. These fragments are ligated together, and the resulting chimeric molecules are purified and sheared to reduce length. Finally, biotinylated ligation junctions are pulled down with streptavidin-coated beads, linked to high-throughput sequencing adaptors, and amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The resolution of the Hi-C data set will depend on the depth of sequencing and choice of restriction enzyme. When sufficient sequence reads are obtained, information on chromatin interactions and chromosome conformation can be derived at single restriction fragment resolution for complete genomes."

The disease is most commonly caused by mutations in the PHEX gene located on the X-chromosome or by mutations in CLCN5, DMP1, ENPP1, FGF23, and SLC34A3. The aims of this study were to perform molecular diagnostics for four patients with HR of Indian origin (two independent families) and to describe their clinical features.METHODS: We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) for the affected mother of two boys who also displayed the typical features of HR, including bone malformations and phosphate wasting. B-lymphoblast cell lines were established by EBV transformation and subsequent RT-PCR to investigate an uncommon splice site variant found by WES. An in silico analysis was done to obtain accurate nucleotide frequency occurrences of consensus splice positions other than the canonical sites of all human exons. Additionally, we applied direct Sanger sequencing for all exons and exon/intron boundaries of the PHEX gene for an affected girl from an independent second Indian family.RESULTS: WES revealed a novel PHEX splice acceptor mutation in intron 9 (c.1080-3C&gt;A) in a family with 3 affected individuals with HR. The effect on splicing of this mutation was further investigated by RT-PCR using RNA obtained from a patient's EBV-transformed lymphoblast cell line. RT-PCR revealed an aberrant splice transcript skipping exons 10-14 which was not observed in control samples, confirming the diagnosis of X-linked dominant hypophosphatemia (XLH). The in silico analysis of all human splice sites adjacent to all 327,293 exons across 81,814 transcripts among 20,345 human genes revealed that cytosine is, with 64.3%, the most frequent nucleobase at the minus 3 splice acceptor position, followed by thymidine with 28.7%, adenine with 6.3%, and guanine with 0.8%. We generated frequency tables and pictograms for the extended donor and acceptor splice consensus regions by analyzing all human exons. Direct Sanger sequencing of all PHEX exons in a sporadic case with HR from the Indian subcontinent revealed an additional novel PHEX mutation (c.1211_1215delACAAAinsTTTACAT, p.Asp404Valfs*5, de novo) located in exon 11.CONCLUSIONS: Mutation analyses revealed two novel mutations and helped to confirm the clinical diagnoses of XLH in two families from India. WES helped to analyze all genes implicated in the underlying disease complex. Mutations at splice positions other than the canonical key sites need further functional investigation to support the assertion of pathogenicity."

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) comprises a small genome featuring organizational elements of more complex eukaryotic systems, including conserved heterochromatin assembly machinery. Here we review key insights into genome organization revealed in this model system through a variety of techniques. We discuss the predominant role of Rabl-like configuration for interphase chromosome organization and the dynamic changes that occur during mitosis and meiosis. High resolution Hi-C studies have also revealed the presence of locally crumpled chromatin regions called &quot;globules&quot; along chromosome arms, and implicated a critical role for pericentromeric heterochromatin in imposing fundamental constraints on the genome to maintain chromosome territoriality and stability. These findings have shed new light on the connections between genome organization and function. It is likely that insights gained from the S. pombe system will also broadly apply to higher eukaryotes."

However, the kisspeptin-mediated intracellular mechanisms associated with the dynamic chromatin modifications modulating GnRH gene expression are unclear. The studies in this manuscript describe specific histone modifications on the enhancer and promoter of the mouse GnRH (mGnRH) gene induced by kisspeptin in GnRH neuronal cell lines (GT1-7 cells). ChIP assays followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) demonstrate that 15 and 45 min of 10(-9) M kisspeptin significantly increased histone 3 acetylation (H3Ac) at the kisspeptin response element (KsRE) contained between -3446 and -2806 bp of the mGnRH enhancer (GnRHen) in GT1-7 cells, while no changes were observed in the downstream neuron-specific element (NSE). Moreover, kisspeptin specifically induced acetylation of H3AcK14 and K27 and trimethylation of H3 lysine 4 at the KsRE (markers of active chromatin) and no changes in dimethylation of H3K9 (a marker associated with gene repression). Occupancy of RNA Pol II (RNAPII) and a differential carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation pattern was observed. An interaction between the NSE and the KsRE via a chromatin loop in the mGnRH gene by kisspeptin was detected by the chromosome conformation capture assay (3C). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that kisspeptin induces histone acetylation/methylation and consequently enhances the formation of a chromatin loop in the mGnRH gene which results in known increase in kisspeptin-dependent mGnRH expression."

This procedure produces a 5C library of short DNA molecules which represent the interactions between the corresponding restriction fragments. The 5C library can be amplified using universal primers containing the Illumina paired-end adaptor sequences for subsequent high-throughput sequencing."

Characteristics such as GC%, annealing temperature, efficiency of 3C primers or 5C probes, and length of restriction fragment can cause variations in primer or probe performance and fragment ligation efficiency. Bias can be measured empirically by production of a random control library, as described here, to be used with the 3C library of interest."

The 3C method begins with whole-cell formaldehyde fixation of chromatin. After cell lysis, solubilized chromatin is digested with a type II restriction endonuclease, and cross-linked DNA fragments are ligated together. Cross-links are reversed by degradation with proteinase K, and chimeric DNA molecules are purified by standard phenol:chloroform extraction. The resulting 3C library represents chromatin fragments that may be separated by large genomic distances or located on different chromosomes, but are close enough in three-dimensional space for cross-linking. Locus-specific oligonucleotide primers are used to detect interactions of interest in the 3C library using end-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR)."

Genome-wide HIF-1α/2α/β DNA-binding studies revealed that the majority of HREs reside distant to the promoter regions, but the function of these distal HREs has only been marginally studied in the genomic context. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), gene editing (TALEN) and chromosome conformation capture (3C) to localize and functionally characterize a 82 kb upstream HRE that solely drives oxygen-regulated expression of the newly identified HIF target gene PAG1. PAG1, a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in Src signalling, was hypoxically induced in various cell lines and mouse tissues. ChIP and reporter gene assays demonstrated that the -82 kb HRE regulates PAG1, but not an equally distant gene further upstream, by direct interaction with HIF. Ablation of the consensus HRE motif abolished the hypoxic induction of PAG1 but not general oxygen signalling. 3C assays revealed that the -82 kb HRE physically associates with the PAG1 promoter region, independent of HIF-DNA interaction. These results demonstrate a constitutive interaction between the -82 kb HRE and the PAG1 promoter, suggesting a physiologically important rapid response to hypoxia."

In some species, such as humans, this polymer can sum up to meters long and still be properly folded within the nuclear space of few microns in size. The exact mechanisms of how the meters long DNA is folded into the nucleus, as well as how the regulatory machinery can access it, is to a large extend still a mystery. However, and thanks to newly developed molecular, genomic and computational approaches based on the Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technology, we are now obtaining insight on how genomes are spatially organized. Here we review a new family of computational approaches that aim at using 3C-based data to obtain spatial restraints for modeling genomes and genomic domains."

A cytological analysis showed that the chromosome numbers of the F2 and F3 progeny ranged from 28 to 41. A large number of univalents, lagging chromosomes, chromosome bridges and micronuclei were found at the metaphase I, anaphase I, anaphase II and tetrad stages in the F2 and F3 progeny. The averages of univalents were 3.50 and 2.73 per cell, and those of lagging chromosomes were 3.37 and 1.87 in the F2 and F3 progeny, respectively. The PMC meiotic indices of the F2 and F3 progeny were 12.22 and 20.34, respectively, indicating considerable genetic instability. A sequential C-banding-GISH analysis revealed that some chromosomes and fragments from the hexaploid wild oat were detected at metaphase I and anaphase I in the progeny, showing that the progeny were of true intergeneric hybrid origin. The alien chromosomes 6A, 7A, 3C and 2D were lost during transmission from F2 to F3. In addition, partial T. timopheevii chromosomes appeared in the form of univalents or lagging chromosomes, which might result from large genome differences between the parents, and the wild oat chromosome introgression interfered with the wheat homologues' normally pairing."

While current DNA sequencing technologies remain limited to reading stretches of a few hundreds or thousands of base pairs, experimental and computational methods are continuously improving with the goal of assembling entire genomes from large numbers of short DNA sequences. However, the algorithms that piece together DNA strands face important limitations due, notably, to the presence of repeated sequences or of multiple haplotypes within one genome, thus leaving many assemblies incomplete. Recently, the realization that the physical contacts experienced by a portion of a DNA molecule could be used as a robust and quantitative assay to determine its genomic position has led to the emerging field of contact genomics, which promises to revolutionize current genome assembly approaches by exploiting the flexible polymer properties of chromosomes. Here we review the current applications of contact genomics to genome scaffolding, haplotyping and metagenomic assembly, then outline the future developments we envision."

Coupled to high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics they have unveiled different organizational levels of the genome at an unprecedented scale. Initially performed using large populations of cells, a new variant of these techniques can be applied to single cell. Although it can be shown that chromosome folding varies from one cell to the other, their overall organization into topologically associating domains is conserved between cells of the same population. Interestingly, the predicted chromosome structures reveal that regions engaged in trans-chromosomal interactions are preferentially localized at the surface of the chromosome territory. These results confirm and extend previous observations on individual loci therefore highlighting the power of 3C based techniques."

Rare, high-penetrance coding variants and common, low-penetrance non-coding variants in 13 genes are known to underlie HSCR risk, with the most frequent variants in the ret proto-oncogene (RET). We used a genome-wide association (220 trios) and replication (429 trios) study to reveal a second non-coding variant distal to RET and a non-coding allele on chromosome 7 within the class 3 Semaphorin gene cluster. Analysis in Ret wild-type and Ret-null mice demonstrates specific expression of Sema3a, Sema3c, and Sema3d in the enteric nervous system (ENS). In zebrafish embryos, sema3 knockdowns show reduction of migratory ENS precursors with complete ablation under conjoint ret loss of function. Seven candidate receptors of Sema3 proteins are also expressed within the mouse ENS and their expression is also lost in the ENS of Ret-null embryos. Sequencing of SEMA3A, SEMA3C, and SEMA3D in 254 HSCR-affected subjects followed by in silico protein structure modeling and functional analyses identified five disease-associated alleles with loss-of-function defects in semaphorin dimerization and binding to their cognate neuropilin and plexin receptors. Thus, semaphorin 3C/3D signaling is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of ENS development whose dys-regulation is a cause of enteric aganglionosis."

Special attention is paid to the enchancer-promoter interactions important for the regulation of gene expression.

We previously developed a reconstruction method to resolve the 3D architecture of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes using 3C-based data. These models were congruent with fluorescent imaging validation. However, the limits of such methods have not systematically been assessed. Here we propose the first evaluation of a mean-field restraint-based reconstruction of genomes by considering diverse chromosome architectures and different levels of data noise and structural variability. The results show that: first, current scoring functions for 3D reconstruction correlate with the accuracy of the models; second, reconstructed models are robust to noise but sensitive to structural variability; third, the local structure organization of genomes, such as Topologically Associating Domains, results in more accurate models; fourth, to a certain extent, the models capture the intrinsic structural variability in the input matrices and fifth, the accuracy of the models can be a priori predicted by analyzing the properties of the interaction matrices. In summary, our work provides a systematic analysis of the limitations of a mean-field restrain-based method, which could be taken into consideration in further development of methods as well as their applications."

Via an insertional mutation screen for loci affecting NCC development in mice, we identified one line-named TashT-that displays a partially penetrant aganglionic megacolon phenotype in a strong male-biased manner. Interestingly, this phenotype is highly reminiscent of human Hirschsprung's disease, a neurocristopathy with a still unexplained male sex bias. In contrast to the megacolon phenotype, colonic aganglionosis is almost fully penetrant in homozygous TashT animals. The sex bias in megacolon expressivity can be explained by the fact that the male ENS ends, on average, around a &quot;tipping point&quot; of minimal colonic ganglionosis while the female ENS ends, on average, just beyond it. Detailed analysis of embryonic intestines revealed that aganglionosis in homozygous TashT animals is due to slower migration of enteric NCC. The TashT insertional mutation is localized in a gene desert containing multiple highly conserved elements that exhibit repressive activity in reporter assays. RNAseq analyses and 3C assays revealed that the TashT insertion results, at least in part, in NCC-specific relief of repression of the uncharacterized gene Fam162b; an outcome independently confirmed via transient transgenesis. The transcriptional signature of enteric NCC from homozygous TashT embryos is also characterized by the deregulation of genes encoding members of the most important signaling pathways for ENS formation-Gdnf/Ret and Edn3/Ednrb-and, intriguingly, the downregulation of specific subsets of X-linked genes. In conclusion, this study not only allowed the identification of Fam162b coding and regulatory sequences as novel candidate loci for Hirschsprung's disease but also provides important new insights into its male sex bias."

In the present study, we have identified by sequence analysis a putative NF-κB binding site in a DNase I hypersensitive site, termed HS-II, located in the distant 5' flanking region of the CYBB gene. Electrophoretic mobility assays showed binding of the sequence element by recombinant NF-κB protein p50 and by proteins in nuclear extract from the HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line corresponding to p50 and to p50/p65 heterodimers. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated NF-κB binding to the site in intact HL-60 cells. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays demonstrated physical interaction between the NF-κB binding site and the CYBB promoter region. Inhibition of NF-κB activity by salicylate reduced CYBB expression in peripheral blood neutrophils and differentiated U937 monocytic leukemia cells. U937 cells transfected with a mutant inhibitor of κB &quot;super-repressor&quot; showed markedly diminished CYBB expression. Luciferase reporter analysis of the NF-κB site linked to the CYBB 5' flanking promoter region revealed enhanced expression, augmented by treatment with interferon-γ.

The physical distances between regulatory elements of the genome, such as enhancers, promoters, insulators, and CpG-islands, do not necessarily reflect genomic distances. Some remote regulatory elements appear to interact physically with target promoters in the 3D nuclear space. These spatial contacts are thought to play a crucial role in the regulation of transcription. Recent studies performed using 3C (chromosome conformation capture)-based methods, FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) coupled with confocal microscopy, and other experimental approaches have revealed that the spatial interactions of distant genomic elements within a folded chromosome are specific and functionally relevant. Additionally, the spatial organization of the eukaryotic genome is linked to the functional compartmentalization of the cell nucleus. In this review, we discuss the current state of research on the functional architecture of the eukaryotic genome. Special emphasis is given to the role of the spatial organization of the genome in establishing communication between enhancers and promoters.

Understanding 3D spatial arrangements of chromosomes and revealing long-range chromatin interactions are critical to decipher these biological processes. In recent years, chromosome conformation capture (3C) related techniques have been developed to measure the interaction frequencies between long-range genome loci, which have provided a great opportunity to decode the 3D organization of the genome. In this paper, we develop a new Bayesian framework to derive the 3D architecture of a chromosome from 3C-based data. By modeling each chromosome as a polymer chain, we define the conformational energy based on our current knowledge on polymer physics and use it as prior information in the Bayesian framework. We also propose an expectation-maximization (EM) based algorithm to estimate the unknown parameters of the Bayesian model and infer an ensemble of chromatin structures based on interaction frequency data. We have validated our Bayesian inference approach through cross-validation and verified the computed chromatin conformations using the geometric constraints derived from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments. We have further confirmed the inferred chromatin structures using the known genetic interactions derived from other studies in the literature. Our test results have indicated that our Bayesian framework can compute an accurate ensemble of 3D chromatin conformations that best interpret the distance constraints derived from 3C-based data and also agree with other sources of geometric constraints derived from experimental evidence in the previous studies. The source code of our approach can be found in https://github.com/wangsy11/InfMod3DGen."

Chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques have recently revealed that the interactions between regulatory elements appear to occur in the context of topologically associating domains (TADs), each spanning few hundreds kilobases, within which the chromatin fiber preferentially interacts. However, 3C-based data represent average interaction probabilities of the chromatin fiber over millions of cells. To understand how variable chromatin conformation is within each TAD, one needs to employ single-cell techniques such as 3D DNA FISH. Given the small size of TADs however (typically &lt;1 Mb), classical DNA FISH design needs to be adapted to achieve high genomic and spatial resolution. Here, we describe a high-resolution 3D DNA FISH approach we recently developed, based on a combination of short plasmid probes and computational correction of optical aberrations. We describe probe design and generation and the 3D DNA FISH procedure. We further discuss how to optimize microscope settings and to implement calibration-bead-assisted computational corrections in order to achieve 50 nm resolution in two-color distance measurements between probes that can be as close as 50 kb along the genome."

We review current guidelines and precedents on the issue of coverage, as well as their underlying considerations, for four major study designs, which include de novo genome sequencing, genome resequencing, transcriptome sequencing and genomic location analyses (for example, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and chromosome conformation capture (3C))."

To explore TAD structure and function, we developed a polymer model that can extract the full repertoire of chromatin conformations within TADs from population-based 3C data. This model predicts actual physical distances and to what extent chromosomal contacts vary between cells. It also identifies interactions within single TADs that stabilize boundaries between TADs and allows us to identify and genetically validate key structural elements within TADs. Combining the model's predictions with high-resolution DNA FISH and quantitative RNA FISH for TADs within the X-inactivation center (Xic), we dissect the relationship between transcription and spatial proximity to cis-regulatory elements. We demonstrate that contacts between potential regulatory elements occur in the context of fluctuating structures rather than stable loops and propose that such fluctuations may contribute to asymmetric expression in the Xic during X inactivation."

Recent demonstration of large, topologically linked DNA domains, hundreds to thousands of kb in size, may now link 3C data to actual chromosome physical structures, as visualized directly by microscopic methods.

Genome wide studies have shown that PcG proteins and their associated H3K27me3 histone mark cover long genomic domains. PcG proteins and H3K27me3 accumulate in Pc nuclear foci, which are the cellular counterparts of genomic domains silenced by PcG proteins. One explanation for how large genomic domains form nuclear foci may rely on loops occurring between specific elements located within domains. However, recent improvement of the chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology, which allowed monitoring genome wide contacts depicts a more complex picture in which chromosomes are composed of many topologically associating domains (TADs). Chromatin regions marked with H3K27me3 correspond to one class of TADs and PcG proteins participate in long-range interactions of H3K27me3 TADs, whereas insulator proteins seem to be important for separating TADs and may also participate in the regulation of intra TAD architecture. Recent data converge to suggest that this hierarchical organization of chromosome domains plays an important role in genome function during cell proliferation and differentiation."

In addition, common single nucleotide polymorphisms in this genomic region are associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for AD and a common intergenic variant found near the TREML2 gene has been identified to be protective for AD. However, little is known about the functional variant underlying the latter association or its relationship with the p.R47H.

These steps sometimes fail at detecting non-coding functional sequences: for example, origins of replication, centromeres and rDNA positions have proven difficult to annotate with high confidence. Here, we demonstrate an unconventional application of Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technique, which typically aims at deciphering the average 3D organization of genomes, by showing how functional information about the sequence can be extracted solely from the chromosome contact map.RESULTS: Specifically, we describe a combined experimental and bioinformatic procedure that determines the genomic positions of centromeres and ribosomal DNA clusters in yeasts, including species where classical computational approaches fail. For instance, we determined the centromere positions in Naumovozyma castellii, where these coordinates could not be obtained previously. Although computed centromere positions were characterized by conserved synteny with neighboring species, no consensus sequences could be found, suggesting that centromeric binding proteins or mechanisms have significantly diverged. We also used our approach to refine centromere positions in Kuraishia capsulata and to identify rDNA positions in Debaryomyces hansenii. Our study demonstrates how 3C data can be used to complete the functional annotation of eukaryotic genomes.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is provided in the Supplementary Material.

Here we show that genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (3C) data can be used to overcome these limitations, and present a computational approach rooted in polymer physics that determines the most likely genome structure using chromosomal contact data. This algorithm--named GRAAL--generates high-quality assemblies of genomes in which repeated and duplicated regions are accurately represented and offers a direct probabilistic interpretation of the computed structures. We first validated GRAAL on the reference genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as other yeast isolates, where GRAAL recovered both known and unknown complex chromosomal structural variations. We then applied GRAAL to the finishing of the assembly of Trichoderma reesei and obtained a number of contigs congruent with the know karyotype of this species. Finally, we showed that GRAAL can accurately reconstruct human chromosomes from either fragments generated in silico or contigs obtained from de novo assembly. In all these applications, GRAAL compared favourably to recently published programmes implementing related approaches."

FISH directly visualizes the spatial relationship of sequences but is usually applied to a few loci at a time. The frequency at which sequences are ligated together by formaldehyde cross-linking can be measured genome-wide by 3C methods, with higher frequencies thought to reflect shorter distances. FISH and 3C should therefore give the same views of genome organization, but this has not been tested extensively. We investigated the murine HoxD locus with 3C carbon copy (5C) and FISH in different developmental and activity states and in the presence or absence of epigenetic regulators. We identified situations in which the two data sets are concordant but found other conditions under which chromatin topographies extrapolated from 5C or FISH data are not compatible. We suggest that products captured by 3C do not always reflect spatial proximity, with ligation occurring between sequences located hundreds of nanometers apart, influenced by nuclear environment and chromatin composition. We conclude that results obtained at high resolution with either 3C methods or FISH alone must be interpreted with caution and that views about genome organization should be validated by independent methods."

Recent Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) studies show that enhancers and promoters are embedded in a complex network of looping interactions. Here we use a polymer model of chromatin fiber to investigate whether, and to what extent, looping interactions between elements in the vicinity of an enhancer-promoter pair can influence their contact frequency. Our equilibrium polymer simulations show that a chromatin loop, formed by elements flanking either an enhancer or a promoter, suppresses enhancer-promoter interactions, working as an insulator. A loop formed by elements located in the region between an enhancer and a promoter, on the contrary, facilitates their interactions. We find that different mechanisms underlie insulation and facilitation; insulation occurs due to steric exclusion by the loop, and is a global effect, while facilitation occurs due to an effective shortening of the enhancer-promoter genomic distance, and is a local effect. Consistently, we find that these effects manifest quite differently for in silico 3C and microscopy. Our results show that looping interactions that do not directly involve an enhancer-promoter pair can nevertheless significantly modulate their interactions. This phenomenon is analogous to allosteric regulation in proteins, where a conformational change triggered by binding of a regulatory molecule to one site affects the state of another site."

Yet, the factors involved and the mechanisms by which the 3D organization of the nucleus is established remain poorly understood. The use of Chromosome Conformation-Capture (3C)-based approaches has resulted in a new appreciation of the role of architectural proteins in the establishment of 3D genome organization. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression."

However, the biological mechanism underlying this regulation is not well understood. Here, we developed a chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based multi-target sequencing technology and systematically examined three PC risk regions at the 8q24 locus and their potential regulatory targets across human genome in six cell lines. We observed frequent physical contacts of this risk locus with multiple genomic regions, in particular, inter-chromosomal interaction with CD96 at 3q13 and intra-chromosomal interaction with MYC at 8q24. We identified at least five interaction hot spots within the predicted functional regulatory elements at the 8q24 risk locus. We also found intra-chromosomal interaction genes PVT1, FAM84B and GSDMC and inter-chromosomal interaction gene CXorf36 in most of the six cell lines. Other gene regions appeared to be cell line-specific, such as RRP12 in LNCaP, USP14 in DU-145 and SMIN3 in lymphoblastoid cell line. We further found that the 8q24 functional domains more likely interacted with genomic regions containing genes enriched in critical pathways such as Wnt signaling and promoter motifs such as E2F1 and TCF3. This result suggests that the risk locus may function as a regulatory hub by physical interactions with multiple genes important for prostate carcinogenesis. Further understanding genetic effect and biological mechanism of these chromatin interactions will shed light on the newly discovered regulatory role of the risk locus in PC etiology and progression."

Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology and its derivatives are important tools used in this effort. However, many of these have limitations, such as being limited to one viewpoint, expensive with moderate to low resolution, and/or requiring a large sequencing effort. Techniques like Hi-C provide a genome-wide analysis. However, it requires massive sequencing effort with considerable costs. Here we describe a new technique termed Targeted Chromatin Capture (T2C), to interrogate large selected regions of the genome. T2C provides an unbiased view of the spatial organization of selected loci at superior resolution (single restriction fragment resolution, from 2 to 6 kbp) at much lower costs than Hi-C due to the lower sequencing effort.RESULTS: We applied T2C on well-known model regions, the mouse β-globin locus and the human H19/IGF2 locus. In both cases we identified all known chromatin interactions. Furthermore, we compared the human H19/IGF2 locus data obtained from different chromatin conformation capturing methods with T2C data. We observed the same compartmentalization of the locus, but at a much higher resolution (single restriction fragments vs. the common 40 kbp bins) and higher coverage. Moreover, we compared the β-globin locus in two different biological samples (mouse primary erythroid cells and mouse fetal brain), where it is either actively transcribed or not, to identify possible transcriptional dependent interactions. We identified the known interactions in the β-globin locus and the same topological domains in both mouse primary erythroid cells and in mouse fetal brain with the latter having fewer interactions probably due to the inactivity of the locus. Furthermore, we show that interactions due to the important chromatin proteins, Ldb1 and Ctcf, in both tissues can be analyzed easily to reveal their role on transcriptional interactions and genome folding.CONCLUSIONS: T2C is an efficient, easy, and affordable with high (restriction fragment) resolution tool to address both genome compartmentalization and chromatin-interaction networks for specific genomic regions at high resolution for both clinical and non-clinical research."

The macrophage RXR cistrome has 5200 genomic binding sites, which are not impacted by ligand. Active enhancers are characterized by PU.1 binding, an increase of enhancer RNA, and P300 recruitment. Using these features, 387 liganded RXR-bound enhancers were linked to 226 genes, which predominantly reside in CTCF/cohesin-limited functional domains. These findings were molecularly validated using chromosome conformation capture (3C) and 3C combined with sequencing (3C-seq), and we show that selected long-range enhancers communicate with promoters via stable or RXR-induced loops and that some of the enhancers interact with each other, forming an interchromosomal network.

This global change in gene expression involves temporal regulation of differentiation-specific genes that are located throughout the genome, raising the idea that genome structure may also be re-organized during cell differentiation to facilitate regulated gene expression. Using in vitro adipocyte differentiation as a model, we explored whether gene organization within the nucleus is altered upon exposure of precursor cells to signaling molecules that induce adipogenesis. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) nuclear hormone receptor is a master determinant of adipogenesis and is required for adipose differentiation. We utilized the chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay to determine whether the position of the PPARγ locus relative to other adipogenic genes is changed during differentiation. We report that the PPARγ2 promoter is transiently positioned in proximity to the promoters of genes encoding adipokines and lipid droplet associated proteins at 6 hours post-differentiation, a time that precedes expression of any of these genes. In contrast, the PPARγ2 promoter was not in proximity to the EF1α promoter, which drives expression of a constitutively active, housekeeping gene that encodes a translation elongation factor, nor was the PPARγ2 promoter in proximity to the promoter driving the expression of the C/EBPα regulatory protein. The formation of the long-range, intergenic interactions involving the PPARγ2 promoter required the regulatory factor C/EBPβ, elevated cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. We conclude that genome organization is dynamically remodeled in response to adipogenic signaling, and we speculate that these transient inter-genic interactions may be formed for the purposes of selecting some of the transcriptionally silent tissue-specific loci for subsequent transcriptional activation."

The same concentration of estradiol triggered MLL and MLLT3 co-localization without affecting the interaction of genes located on the same chromosomes. Estradiol also stimulated the generation of MLL-MLLT3 fusion transcripts as seen by RT-PCR. RNAi knockdown of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA) suppressed the induction of MLL-MLLT3 fusion transcript formation observed with estradiol. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed estradiol dependent localization of AICDA in MLL intron 11, upstream of a hotspot for both DNA cleavage and rearrangement, but not downstream within intron 12. Combined, these studies show that levels of estradiol consistent with that observed during pregnancy have the potential to initiate MLL fusions through an AICDA-mediated mechanism."

The RUNX2 transcription factor is required for differentiation of precursor cells into mature osteoblasts. Although organization and control of the bone-specific Runx2-P1 promoter have been studied extensively, long-range regulation has not been explored. In this study, we investigated higher-order organization of the Runx2-P1 promoter during osteoblast differentiation. Mining the ENCODE database revealed interactions between Runx2-P1 and Supt3h promoters in several non-mesenchymal human cell lines. Supt3h is a ubiquitously expressed gene located within the first intron of Runx2. These two genes show shared synteny across species from humans to sponges. Chromosome conformation capture analysis in the murine pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell line revealed increased contact frequency between Runx2-P1 and Supt3h promoters during differentiation. This increase was accompanied by enhanced DNaseI hypersensitivity along with RUNX2 and CTCF binding at the Supt3h promoter. Furthermore, interplasmid-3C and luciferase reporter assays showed that the Supt3h promoter can modulate Runx2-P1 activity via direct association. Taken together, our data demonstrate physical proximity between Runx2-P1 and Supt3h promoters, consistent with their syntenic nature.

We have searched for genetic causes of a phenotype similar to RSS/3C syndrome in an Austrian family with two affected sons.

Most imprinted domains are associated with differentially DNA methylated regions (DMRs) that originate in the gametes, and are maintained in somatic tissues after fertilization. This allelic methylation profile is associated with a plethora of histone tail modifications that orchestrates higher order chromatin interactions. The mouse chromosome 15 imprinted cluster contains multiple brain-specific maternally expressed transcripts including Ago2, Chrac1, Trappc9 and Kcnk9 and a paternally expressed gene, Peg13. The promoter of Peg13 is methylated on the maternal allele and is the sole DMR within the locus. To determine the extent of imprinting within the human orthologous region on chromosome 8q24, a region associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability, Birk-Barel mental retardation and dysmorphism syndrome, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of allelic expression and DNA methylation of genes mapping within an approximately 2 Mb region around TRAPPC9.RESULTS: Utilizing allele-specific RT-PCR, bisulphite sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation and chromosome conformation capture (3C) we show the reciprocal expression of the novel, paternally expressed, PEG13 non-coding RNA and maternally expressed KCNK9 genes in brain, and the biallelic expression of flanking transcripts in a range of tissues. We identify a tandem-repeat region overlapping the PEG13 transcript that is methylated on the maternal allele, which binds CTCF-cohesin in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and possesses enhancer-blocker activity. Using 3C, we identify mutually exclusive approximately 58 and 500 kb chromatin loops in adult frontal cortex between a novel brain-specific enhancer, marked by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, with the KCNK9 and PEG13 promoters which we propose regulates brain-specific expression.CONCLUSIONS: We have characterised the molecular mechanism responsible for reciprocal allelic expression of the PEG13 and KCNK9 transcripts. Therefore, our observations may have important implications for identifying the cause of intellectual disabilities associated with the 8q24 locus."

We have earlier invented the Chromatin In Situ Proximity (ChrISP) technique to determine proximities between chromatin fibers within a single chromosome. Here we used ChrISP to identify chromosome 11-specific hubs that are enriched in the H3K9me2 mark and that project toward the nuclear membrane in finger-like structures. Conversely, chromosome 11-specfic chromatin hubs, visualized by the presence of either H3K9me1 or H3K9me3 marks, are chromosome-wide and largely absent at the nuclear periphery. As the nuclear periphery-specific chromatin hubs were lost in the induced reduction of H3K9me2 levels, they likely represent Large Organization Chromatin in Lysine Methylation (LOCK) domains, previously identified by ChIP-seq analysis. Strikingly, the downregulation of the H3K9me2/3 marks also led to the chromosome-wide compaction of chromosome 11, suggesting a pleiotropic function of these features not recognized before.

Since its initial development, the technique has been used to advance our understanding of the folding of gene loci and has yielded important discoveries, like the demonstration that distant transcriptional regulatory elements interact with their target promoters through chromatin loops. The 3C method uses formaldehyde cross-linking to covalently link interacting chromatin segments in intact cells. After chromatin digestion and ligation of cross-linked fragments, the frequency of interaction between distant DNA elements can be quantified.

We anticipate that this method will be generally applicable to detect dynamic, short-range chromatin interactions, not limited to gene loops."

As such, there have been many techniques developed to probe these long-distance chromatin interactions. Here, we focus on one such method, called DamID (van Steensel and Henikoff, Nat Biotechnol 18(4):424-428, 2000). While other methods like 3C (Dekker et al., Science 295(5558):1306-1311, 2002), 4C (Simonis et al., Nat Genet 38(11):1348-1354, 2006; Zhao et al., Nat Genet 38(11):1341-1347, 2006), and 5C (Dostie et al., Genome Res 16(10):1299-1309, 2006) are undoubtedly powerful, the DamID method can offer some advantages over these methods if the genetic locus can be easily modified. The lack of tissue fixation, the low amounts of starting material required to perform the experiment, and the relatively modest hardware requirements make DamID experiments an interesting alternative to consider when examining long-distance chromatin interactions."

In endothelial cells, statin-dependent atheroprotective gene up-regulation is mediated by Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family transcription factors. To dissect the mechanism of gene regulation, we sought to determine molecular targets by performing microarray analyses of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with pitavastatin, and KLF4 was determined to be the most highly induced gene. In addition, it was revealed that the atheroprotective genes induced with pitavastatin, such as nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and thrombomodulin (THBD), were suppressed by KLF4 knockdown. Myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family activation is reported to be involved in pitavastatin-dependent KLF4 induction. We focused on MEF2C among the MEF2 family members and identified a novel functional MEF2C binding site 148 kb upstream of the KLF4 gene by chromatin immunoprecipitation along with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) followed by luciferase assay. By applying whole genome and quantitative chromatin conformation analysis {chromatin interaction analysis with paired end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), and real time chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay}, we observed that the MEF2C-bound enhancer and transcription start site (TSS) of KLF4 came into closer spatial proximity by pitavastatin treatment. 3D-Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) imaging supported the conformational change in individual cells. Taken together, dynamic chromatin conformation change was shown to mediate pitavastatin-responsive gene induction in endothelial cells."

These include agonists and antagonists of the parallel IL-1 and IL-36 systems, and IL1F7, the gene encoding IL-37. As the genes of the cluster are structurally and functionally related and have similar mRNA kinetics, we have sought evidence for gene induction-specific looping of chromatin in the IL-1 cluster by chromatin conformation capture (3C). We show here that IL1A, IL1B and IL1F7 regulatory regions come in close proximity in LPS stimulated cells but not in resting human monocytes. This suggests that IL1A, IL1B and IL1F7 are likely transcribed by the same transcription factory. One cardinal function of transcriptional Locus Control Region (LCR) is bringing map-distant activated genes into close physical proximity within the transcription factory. Our data show distant intergenic DNA segments are also in close proximity to the regulatory regions of the three genes. This may indicate that they are co-regulated and raise the possibility of a LCR within the cluster."

Wheat breeding has a long history in Kazakhstan and the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between key varieties from Kazakhstan and germplasm from breeding programs for other regions.RESULTS: The study revealed 5,898 polymorphic markers amongst ten cultivars, of which 2,730 were mapped in the consensus genetic map. Mapped SNP markers were distributed almost equally across the A and B genomes, with between 279 and 484 markers assigned to each chromosome. Marker coverage was approximately 10-fold lower in the D genome. There were 863 SNP markers identified as unique to specific cultivars, and clusters of these markers (regions containing more than three closely mapped unique SNPs) showed specific patterns on the consensus genetic map for each cultivar. Significant intra-varietal genetic polymorphism was identified in three cultivars (Tzelinnaya 3C, Kazakhstanskaya rannespelaya and Kazakhstanskaya 15). Phylogenetic analysis based on inter-varietal polymorphism showed that the very old cultivar Erythrospermum 841 was the most genetically distinct from the other nine cultivars from Kazakhstan, falling in a clade together with the American cultivar Sonora and genotypes from Central and South Asia. The modern cultivar Kazakhstanskaya 19 also fell into a separate clade, together with the American cultivar Thatcher. The remaining eight cultivars shared a single sub-clade but were categorised into four clusters.CONCLUSION: The accumulated data for SNP marker polymorphisms amongst bread wheat genotypes from Kazakhstan may be used for studying genetic diversity in bread wheat, with potential application for marker-assisted selection and the preparation of a set of genotype-specific markers."

Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C-seq) is a powerful technique that allows researchers to measure long-range chromosomal interactions with a locus of interest across the entire genome. This method relies on enzymatic cleavage of cross-linked chromatin and consecutive ligation to create ligation junctions between physically adjacent loci, followed by PCR amplification of locus-specific associating loci. The enzymes used must meet 4C standards because variations in their efficiency and performance may affect the quality of the obtained data. Here we systematically compare the efficiency and reliability of different T4 DNA ligases and PCR DNA polymerases, assessing the most critical and technically challenging steps in 4C. The results of this analysis enable the use of cost-effective enzymes with superior specificity and efficiency for 4C and save time in screening for appropriate primers.

One strategy is to identify the long-range looping interactions at these elements with the use of chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques. However, previous studies lack either the resolution or coverage to permit a whole-genome, unbiased view of chromatin interactions. Here we report a comprehensive chromatin interaction map generated in human fibroblasts using a genome-wide 3C analysis method (Hi-C). We determined over one million long-range chromatin interactions at 5-10-kb resolution, and uncovered general principles of chromatin organization at different types of genomic features. We also characterized the dynamics of promoter-enhancer contacts after TNF-α signalling in these cells. Unexpectedly, we found that TNF-α-responsive enhancers are already in contact with their target promoters before signalling. Such pre-existing chromatin looping, which also exists in other cell types with different extracellular signalling, is a strong predictor of gene induction. Our observations suggest that the three-dimensional chromatin landscape, once established in a particular cell type, is relatively stable and could influence the selection or activation of target genes by a ubiquitous transcription activator in a cell-specific manner."

Despite this structural stochasticity, localization of active gene domains to boundaries of chromosome territories is a hallmark of chromosomal conformation.

Several lines of evidence suggest that segmental packaging of chromosomal neighborhoods may underlie features of chromatin that span large domains, such as heterochromatin blocks, association with the nuclear lamina and replication timing. By defining which DNA elements preferentially contact each other, the segmentation of chromosomes into TADs may also underlie many properties of long-range transcriptional regulation. Several observations suggest that TADs can indeed provide a structural basis to regulatory landscapes, by controlling enhancer sharing and allocation. We also discuss how TADs may shape the evolution of chromosomes, by causing maintenance of synteny over large chromosomal segments. Finally we suggest a series of experiments to challenge these ideas and provide concrete examples illustrating how they could be practically applied."

Here we describe multiplexed 3C sequencing (3C-seq), a 4C variant coupled to next-generation sequencing, allowing genome-scale detection of long-range interactions with candidate regions. Compared with several other available techniques, 3C-seq offers a superior resolution (typically single restriction fragment resolution; approximately 1-8 kb on average) and can be applied in a semi-high-throughput fashion. It allows the assessment of long-range interactions of up to 192 genes or regions of interest in parallel by multiplexing library sequencing.

We previously found that GAA-triplet expansions stimulate heterochromatinization in vivo in transgenic mice. We report here using chromosome conformation capture (3C) coupled with high-throughput sequencing that the GAA-repeat expansion in FRDA cells stimulates a higher-order structure as a fragment containing the GAA-repeat expansion showed an increased interaction frequency with genomic regions along the FXN locus. This is consistent with a more compacted chromatin and coincided with an increase in both constitutive H3K9me3 and facultative H3K27me3 heterochromatic marks in FRDA. Consistent with this, DNase I accessibility in regions flanking the GAA repeats in patients was decreased compared with healthy controls. Strikingly, this effect could be antagonized with the class III histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor vitamin B3 (nicotinamide) which activated the silenced FXN gene in several FRDA models. Examination of the FXN locus revealed a reduction of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, an increased accessibility to DNase I and an induction of euchromatic H3 and H4 histone acetylations upon nicotinamide treatment. In addition, transcriptomic analysis of nicotinamide treated and untreated FRDA primary lymphocytes revealed that the expression of 67% of genes known to be dysregulated in FRDA was ameliorated by the treatment. These findings show that nictotinamide can up-regulate the FXN gene and reveal a potential mechanism of action for nicotinamide in reactivating the epigenetically silenced FXN gene and therefore support the further assessment of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi's) in FRDA and diseases caused by a similar mechanism."

The crucial step of this protocol is the proximity ligation-preferential ligation of DNA fragments assumed to be joined within nuclei by protein bridges and solubilized as a common complex after formaldehyde cross-linking and DNA cleavage. Here, we show that a substantial, and in some cases the major, part of DNA is not solubilized from cross-linked nuclei treated with restriction endonuclease(s) and sodium dodecyl sulphate and that this treatment neither causes lysis of the nucleus nor drastically affects its internal organization. Analysis of the ligation frequencies of the mouse β-globin gene domain DNA fragments demonstrated that the previously reported 3C signals were generated predominantly, if not exclusively, in the insoluble portion of the 3C material. The proximity ligation thus occurs within the cross-linked chromatin cage in non-lysed nuclei. The finding does not compromise the 3C protocol but allows the consideration of an active chromatin hub as a folded chromatin domain or a nuclear compartment rather than a rigid complex of regulatory elements."

These regions, with the average size of ∼1 Mb, were named topological domains. More recent studies demonstrated presence of unconstrained supercoiling in interphase chromosomes.

TNFAIP3 encodes the ubiquitin-editing enzyme, A20, a key negative regulator of NF-κB signaling. A20 expression is reduced in subjects carrying the TT&gt;A risk alleles; however, the underlying functional mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. We used a combination of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), mass spectrometry (MS), reporter assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR (ChIP-PCR) and chromosome conformation capture (3C) EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from individuals carrying risk and non-risk TNFAIP3 haplotypes to characterize the effect of TT&gt;A on A20 expression. Our results demonstrate that the TT&gt;A variants reside in an enhancer element that binds NF-κB and SATB1 enabling physical interaction of the enhancer with the TNFAIP3 promoter through long-range DNA looping. Impaired binding of NF-κB to the TT&gt;A risk alleles or knockdown of SATB1 expression by shRNA, inhibits the looping interaction resulting in reduced A20 expression. Together, these data reveal a novel mechanism of TNFAIP3 transcriptional regulation and establish the functional basis by which the TT&gt;A risk variants attenuate A20 expression through inefficient delivery of NF-κB to the TNFAIP3 promoter. These results provide critical functional evidence supporting a direct causal role for TT&gt;A in the genetic predisposition to SLE."

We have found that CTCF and cohesin are highly enriched at the convergent and partially overlapping transcripts for the LMP1 and LMP2A genes, but it is not yet known how CTCF and cohesin may coordinately regulate these transcripts. We now show that genetic disruption of this CTCF binding site (EBVΔCTCF166) leads to a deregulation of LMP1, LMP2A, and LMP2B transcription in EBV-immortalized B lymphocytes. EBVΔCTCF166 virus-immortalized primary B lymphocytes showed a decrease in LMP1 and LMP2A mRNA and a corresponding increase in LMP2B mRNA. The reduction of LMP1 and LMP2A correlated with a loss of euchromatic histone modification H3K9ac and a corresponding increase in heterochromatic histone modification H3K9me3 at the LMP2A promoter region in EBVΔCTCF166. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) revealed that DNA loop formation with the origin of plasmid replication (OriP) enhancer was eliminated in EBVΔCTCF166. We also observed that the EBV episome copy number was elevated in EBVΔCTCF166 and that this was not due to increased lytic cycle activity. These findings suggest that a single CTCF binding site controls LMP2A and LMP1 promoter selection, chromatin boundary function, DNA loop formation, and episome copy number control during EBV latency."

We recently demonstrated that CF1A subunits also crosslink to the 5' end of genes during transcription. The presence of CF1A complex at the promoter suggested its possible involvement in the initiation/reinitiation of transcription. To check this possibility, we performed transcription run-on assay, RNAP II-density ChIP and strand-specific RT-PCR analysis in a mutant of CF1A subunit Clp1. As expected, RNAP II read through the termination signal in the temperature-sensitive mutant of clp1 at elevated temperature. The transcription readthrough phenotype was accompanied by a decrease in the density of RNAP II in the vicinity of the promoter region. With the exception of TFIIB and TFIIF, the recruitment of the general transcription factors onto the promoter, however, remained unaffected in the clp1 mutant. These results suggest that the CF1A complex affects the recruitment of RNAP II onto the promoter for reinitiation of transcription. Simultaneously, an increase in synthesis of promoter-initiated divergent antisense transcript was observed in the clp1 mutant, thereby implicating CF1A complex in providing directionality to the promoter-bound polymerase. Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) analysis revealed a physical interaction of the promoter and terminator regions of a gene in the presence of a functional CF1A complex. Gene looping was completely abolished in the clp1 mutant. On the basis of these results, we propose that the CF1A-dependent recruitment of RNAP II onto the promoter for reinitiation and the regulation of directionality of promoter-associated transcription are accomplished through gene looping."

Here, using the mouse beta-globin genes in erythroid cells as a model, we estimated the actual frequencies of ligation between the fragments bearing the promoter of the major beta-globin gene and its distant enhancers and showed that the number of ligation products produced does not exceed 1% of all fragments subjected to the ligation.

Chromatin fragments released from formaldehyde-cross-linked cells by sodium dodecyl sulfate extraction and sonication are distributed in a polyacrylamide gel layer followed by amplification of selected test regions directly in the gel by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The fragments that have been cross-linked and separate fragments give rise to multi- and monocomponent molecular colonies, respectively, which can be distinguished and counted. Using in-gel replication of interacting DNA segments, we demonstrate that in the material from mouse erythroid cells, the majority of fragments containing the promoters of active β-globin genes and their remote enhancers do not form complexes stable enough to survive sodium dodecyl sulfate extraction and sonication. This indicates that either these elements do not interact directly in the majority of cells at a given time moment, or the formed DNA-protein complex cannot be stabilized by formaldehyde cross-linking."

Formation/maintenance of the Mu 'domain' configuration, reported by Cre-loxP recombination and 3C (chromosome conformation capture), is dependent on a strong gyrase site (SGS) at the center of Mu, the Mu L end and MuB protein, and the E. coli nucleoid proteins IHF, Fis and HU. The Mu domain was observed at two different chromosomal locations tested. By contrast, prophage λ does not form an independent domain. The establishment/maintenance of the Mu domain was promoted by low-level transcription from two phage promoters, one of which was domain dependent. We propose that the domain confers transposition readiness to Mu by fostering topological requirements of the reaction and the proximity of Mu ends. The potential benefits to the host cell from a subset of proteins expressed by the prophage may in turn help its long-term stability."

With the available Hi-C data, our next challenge is to model the 3D chromosomal structure from the 3C-derived data computationally. This article presents a deterministic method called ChromSDE, which applies semi-definite programming techniques to find the best structure fitting the observed data and uses golden section search to find the correct parameter for converting the contact frequency to spatial distance. Further, we develop a measure called consensus index to indicate if the Hi-C data corresponds to a single structure or a mixture of structures. To the best of our knowledge, ChromSDE is the only method that can guarantee recovering the correct structure in the noise-free case. In addition, we prove that the parameter of conversion from contact frequency to spatial distance will change under different resolutions theoretically and empirically. Using simulation data and real Hi-C data, we showed that ChromSDE is much more accurate and robust than existing methods.

Herein, we summarize our current knowledge on the functional significance of chromatin looping in estrogen-mediated transcription. ERα collaborative factors and other players that contribute to define the genomic interactions in breast cancer cells will also be discussed. Defects in chromatin organization are emerging key players in diseases such as cancer, thus understanding how ERα-mediated chromatin looping affects genome organization will clarify the receptor's role in estrogen responsive pathways sensitive to defects in chromatin organization."

Similarly, it has long been hypothesized that the spatial organization (in three dimensions evolving through time), as part of the epigenome, makes a significant contribution to the genotype-phenotype transition. Proximity ligation assays commonly known as chromosome conformation capture (3C) and 3C based methodologies (e.g., GCC, HiC and ChIA-Pet) are increasingly being incorporated into empirical studies to investigate the role that three-dimensional genome structure plays in the regulation of phenotype. The apparent simplicity of these methodologies-crosslink chromatin, digest, dilute, ligate, detect interactions-belies the complexity of the data and the considerations that should be taken into account to ensure the generation and accurate interpretation of reliable data. Here we discuss the probabilistic nature of these methodologies and how this contributes to their endogenous limitations."
"24014450";"3C";"(3C AND chromosome)";"Wiley Interdiscip Rev Dev Biol";3;2013;"Chromatin looping and organization at developmentally regulated gene loci.";"Developmentally regulated genes are often controlled by distant enhancers, silencers and insulators, to implement their correct transcriptional programs. In recent years, the development of 3C and derived techniques (4C, 5C, HiC, ChIA-PET, etc.) has confirmed that chromatin looping is an important mechanism for the transfer of regulatory information in mammalian cells. At many developmentally regulated gene loci, transcriptional activation is indeed accompanied by the formation of chromatin loops between genes and distant enhancers. Similarly, dynamic looping between insulator elements and changes in local 3D organization may be observed upon variation in transcriptional activity. Chromatin looping also occurs at silent gene loci, where its function remains less understood. In lineage-committed cells, partial 3D configurations are detected at loci that are activated at later stages. However, these partial configurations usually lack promoter-enhancer loops that accompany transcriptional activation, suggesting they have structural functions. Definitive evidence for a repressive role of chromatin looping is still lacking. Chromatin loops have been reported at repressed loci but, alternatively, they may act as a distraction for active loops. Together, these mechanisms allow fine-tuning of regulatory programs, thus providing further diversity in the transcriptional control of developmentally regulated gene loci."

In this study, we examined the role of chromatin loops formed by two unrelated insulators, gypsy and Fab-7, in their enhancer-blocking activity. To test for this activity, we selected the white reporter gene that is activated by the eye-specific enhancer. The results showed that one copy of the gypsy or Fab-7 insulator failed to block the eye enhancer in most of genomic sites, whereas a chromatin loop formed by two gypsy insulators flanking either the eye enhancer or the reporter completely blocked white stimulation by the enhancer. However, strong enhancer blocking was achieved due not only to chromatin loop formation but also to the direct interaction of the gypsy insulator with the eye enhancer, which was confirmed by the 3C assay. In particular, it was observed that Mod(mdg4)-67.2, a component of the gypsy insulator, interacted with the Zeste protein, which is critical for the eye enhancer-white promoter communication. These results suggest that efficient enhancer blocking depends on the combination of two factors: chromatin loop formation by paired insulators, which generates physical constraints for enhancer-promoter communication, and the direct interaction of proteins recruited to an insulator and to the enhancer-promoter pair."

These transcription regulatory elements forming loops have highly acetylated histones. To understand the correlation between histone acetylation and chromatin loop formation, we inhibited the expression of histone acetyltransferase CBP and p300 in erythroid K562 cells and analyzed the chromatin structure of the β-globin locus. The proximity between the locus control region (LCR) and the active (G)γ-globin gene was decreased in the β-globin locus when histones were hypoacetylated by the double knockdown of CBP and p300. Sensitivity to DNase I and binding of erythroid specific activators were reduced in the hypoacetylated LCR hypersensitive sites (HSs) and gene promoter. Interestingly, the chromatin loop between HS5 and 3'HS1 was formed regardless of the hypoacetylation of the β-globin locus. CTCF binding was maintained at HS5 and 3'HS1 in the hypoacetylated locus. Thus, these results indicate that histone acetylation contributes to chromatin looping through the formation of HSs in the LCR and gene promoter. However, looping between insulators appears to be independent from histone acetylation."

One component of the IC, the PWS-IC, governs the paternal epigenotype and expression of paternal genes. The mechanisms by which imprinting and expression of paternal genes within the AS/PWS domain - such as MKRN3 and NDN - are regulated by the PWS-IC are unclear. The syntenic region in the mouse is organized and imprinted similarly to the human domain with the murine PWS-IC defined by a 6 kb interval within the Snrpn locus that includes the promoter. To identify regulatory elements that may mediate PWS-IC function, we mapped the location and allele-specificity of DNase I hypersensitive (DH) sites within the PWS-IC in brain cells, then identified transcription factor binding sites within a subset of these DH sites. Six major paternal-specific DH sites were detected in the Snrpn gene, five of which map within the 6 kb PWS-IC. We postulate these five DH sites represent functional components of the murine PWS-IC. Analysis of transcription factor binding within multiple DH sites detected nuclear respiratory factors (NRF's) and YY1 specifically on the paternal allele. NRF's and YY1 were also detected in the paternal promoter region of the murine Mrkn3 and Ndn genes. These results suggest that NRF's and YY1 may facilitate PWS-IC function and coordinately regulate expression of paternal genes. The presence of NRF's also suggests a link between transcriptional regulation within the AS/PWS domain and regulation of respiration. 3C analyses indicated Mkrn3 lies in close proximity to the PWS-IC on the paternal chromosome, evidence that the PWS-IC functions by allele-specific interaction with its distal target genes. This could occur by allele-specific co-localization of the PWS-IC and its target genes to transcription factories containing NRF's and YY1."

Here, we describe a case of inducible trans interaction in chromosomes of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Special DNA sequences, inserted in two ectopic chromosomal loci positioned in trans, pair with one another in an inducible manner. The spatial proximity diagnostic of pairing is observable by both chromosome capture analysis (3C) and epifluorescence microscopy in whole cells.

Here, we describe NuChart, an R package that allows the user to annotate and statistically analyse a list of input genes with information relying on Hi-C data, integrating knowledge about genomic features that are involved in the chromosome spatial organization. NuChart works directly with sequenced reads to identify the related Hi-C fragments, with the aim of creating gene-centric neighbourhood graphs on which multi-omics features can be mapped. Predictions about CTCF binding sites, isochores and cryptic Recombination Signal Sequences are provided directly with the package for mapping, although other annotation data in bed format can be used (such as methylation profiles and histone patterns). Gene expression data can be automatically retrieved and processed from the Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress repositories to highlight the expression profile of genes in the identified neighbourhood. Moreover, statistical inferences about the graph structure and correlations between its topology and multi-omics features can be performed using Exponential-family Random Graph Models. The Hi-C fragment visualisation provided by NuChart allows the comparisons of cells in different conditions, thus providing the possibility of novel biomarkers identification.

Techniques such as FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) have proved that chromosomes organize themselves in so-called CTs (chromosome territories). In addition, newly developed 3C (chromatin conformation capture) techniques have revealed that certain chromosomal regions tend to interact with adjacent regions on either the same chromosome or adjacent chromosomes, and also that regions in close proximity are replicated simultaneously. Furthermore, transcriptionally repressed or active areas occupy different nuclear compartments. Another new technique, named DamID (DNA adenine methyltransferase identification), has strengthened the notion that transcriptionally repressed genes are often found in close association with the nuclear membrane, whereas transcriptionally active regions are found in the more central regions of the nucleus. However, in response to various stimuli, transcriptionally repressed regions are known to relocalize from the nuclear lamina to the interior of the nucleus, leading to a concomitant up-regulation of otherwise silenced genes. Taken together, these insights are of great interest for the relationship between chromosomal spatial organization and genome function. In the present article, we review recent advances in this field with a focus on mammalian cells and the eukaryotic model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe."

In the present study we demonstrate that FXR promotes the resolution of colitis in rodents by enhancing Gr gene transcription. We used the chromatin conformation capture (3C) assay to demonstrate that this FXRE is functional in mediating a head-to-tail chromatin looping, thus increasing Gr transcription efficiency. These findings underscore the importance of FXR/GR axis in the control of intestinal inflammation."

Here, we have addressed the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional hyper-reactivity of junb. Using transfection and pharmacological assays to complement chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses addressing the localization of histones, polymerase II, negative elongation factor (NELF)-, DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF)- and Positive Transcription Factor b complexes, we demonstrate that junb is a RNA Pol II-paused gene where Pol II is loaded in the transcription start site domain but poorly active. Moreover, High salt-Recovered Sequence, chromosome conformation capture (3C)- and gene transfer experiments show that (i) junb is organized in a nuclear chromatin loop bringing into close spatial proximity the upstream promoter region and the downstream enhancer and (ii) this configuration permits immediate Pol II release on the junb body on binding of LPS-activated NF-κB to the enhancer. Thus, our work unveils a novel topological framework underlying fast junb transcriptional response in DCs. Moreover, it also points to a novel layer of complexity in the modes of action of NF-κB."

However, the raw data from 3C experiments is an aggregation of interactions from many cells, and the spatial distances of any given interaction are uncertain.RESULTS: We introduce a new method for filtering 3C interactions that selects subsets of interactions that obey metric constraints of various strictness. We demonstrate that, although the problem is computationally hard, near-optimal results are often attainable in practice using well-designed heuristics and approximation algorithms. Further, we show that, compared with a standard technique, this metric filtering approach leads to (a) subgraphs with higher statistical significance, (b) lower embedding error, (c) lower sensitivity to initial conditions of the embedding algorithm, and (d) structures with better agreement with light microscopy measurements. Our filtering scheme is applicable for a strict frequency-to-distance mapping and a more relaxed mapping from frequency to a range of distances.CONCLUSIONS: Our filtering method for 3C data considers both metric consistency and statistical confidence simultaneously resulting in lower-error embeddings that are biologically more plausible."

Several distal regulatory elements have been identified upstream of the Lmo2 gene in the human and mouse genomes that are capable of enhancing reporter gene expression in erythroid cells and may be responsible for the high level transcription of Lmo2 in the erythroid lineage. In this study we investigate how these elements regulate transcription of Lmo2 and whether or not they function cooperatively in the endogenous context. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) experiments show that chromatin-chromatin interactions exist between upstream regulatory elements and the Lmo2 promoter in erythroid cells but that these interactions are absent from kidney where Lmo2 is transcribed at twelve fold lower levels. Specifically, long range chromatin-chromatin interactions occur between the Lmo2 proximal promoter and two broad regions, 3-31 and 66-105 kb upstream of Lmo2, which we term the proximal and distal control regions for Lmo2 (pCR and dCR respectively). Each of these regions is bound by several transcription factors suggesting that multiple regulatory elements cooperate in regulating high level transcription of Lmo2 in erythroid cells. Binding of CTCF and cohesin which support chromatin loops at other loci were also found within the dCR and at the Lmo2 proximal promoter. Intergenic transcription occurs throughout the dCR in erythroid cells but not in kidney suggesting a role for these intergenic transcripts in regulating Lmo2, similar to the broad domain of intergenic transcription observed at the human β-globin locus control region. Our data supports a model in which the dCR functions through a chromatin looping mechanism to contact and enhance Lmo2 transcription specifically in erythroid cells. Furthermore, these chromatin loops are supported by the cohesin complex recruited to both CTCF and transcription factor bound regions."

Current strategies to identify enhancers focus primarily on noncoding sequences and tend to exclude protein coding sequences. Here, we analyzed 25 available ChIP-seq data sets that identify enhancers in an unbiased manner (H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and EP300) for peaks that overlap exons. We find that, on average, 7% of all ChIP-seq peaks overlap coding exons (after excluding for peaks that overlap with first exons). By using mouse and zebrafish enhancer assays, we demonstrate that several of these exonic enhancer (eExons) candidates can function as enhancers of their neighboring genes and that the exonic sequence is necessary for enhancer activity. Using ChIP, 3C, and DNA FISH, we further show that one of these exonic limb enhancers, Dync1i1 exon 15, has active enhancer marks and physically interacts with Dlx5/6 promoter regions 900 kb away. In addition, its removal by chromosomal abnormalities in humans could cause split hand and foot malformation 1 (SHFM1), a disorder associated with DLX5/6. These results demonstrate that DNA sequences can have a dual function, operating as coding exons in one tissue and enhancers of nearby gene(s) in another tissue, suggesting that phenotypes resulting from coding mutations could be caused not only by protein alteration but also by disrupting the regulation of another gene."

However, a role for HIF1 in the epigenetic regulation remains unknown. Genome-wide analysis of HIF1 binding sites (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] with deep sequencing) of endothelial cells clarified that HIF1 mainly binds to the intergenic regions distal from transcriptional starting sites under both normoxia and hypoxia. Next, we examined the temporal profile of gene expression under hypoxic conditions by using DNA microarrays. We clarified that early hypoxia-responsive genes are functionally associated with glycolysis, including GLUT3 (SLC2A3). Acetylated lysine 27 of histone 3 covered the HIF1 binding sites, and HIF1 functioned as an enhancer of SLC2A3 by interaction with lysine (K)-specific demethylase 3A (KDM3A). Knockdown of HIF1α and KDM3A showed that glycolytic genes are regulated by both HIF1 and KDM3A and respond to hypoxia in a manner independent of cell type specificity. We elucidated that both the chromatin conformational structure and histone modification change under hypoxic conditions and enhance the expression of SLC2A3 based on the combined results of chromatin conformation capture (3C) and ChIP assays. KDM3A is recruited to the SLC2A3 locus in an HIF1-dependent manner and demethylates H3K9me2 so as to upregulate its expression.

Hereby GR can influence the activity of other transcription factors, without contacting DNA itself. GR is known to inhibit the activity of a growing list of immune-regulating transcription factors. Hence, GCs still rule the clinic for treatments of inflammatory disorders, notwithstanding concomitant deleterious side effects.

We identified nearly 600 pairs of unrelated genes that have remained tightly physically linked in diverse lineages across over 600 million years of evolution. Integrating sequence conservation, gene expression data, gene function, epigenetic marks, and other genomic features, we provide extensive evidence that many conserved ancient linkages involve (1) the coordinated transcription of neighboring genes, or (2) genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) in which transcriptional enhancers controlling developmental genes are contained within nearby bystander genes. In addition, we generated ChIP-seq data for key histone modifications in zebrafish embryos, which provided further evidence of putative GRBs in embryonic development. Finally, using chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays and stable transgenic experiments, we demonstrate that enhancers within bystander genes drive the expression of genes such as Otx and Islet, critical regulators of central nervous system development across bilaterians. These results suggest that ancient genomic functional associations are far more common than previously thought-involving ∼12% of the ancestral bilaterian genome-and that cis-regulatory constraints are crucial in determining metazoan genome architecture."

However, no global analysis of germ-line transcription throughout the Igh locus has been done. Therefore, we performed directional RNA-seq, demonstrating the locations and extent of both sense and antisense transcription throughout the Igh locus. Surprisingly, the majority of antisense transcripts are localized around two Pax5-activated intergenic repeat (PAIR) elements in the distal IghV region. Importantly, long-distance loops measured by chromosome conformation capture (3C) are observed between these two active PAIR promoters and Eμ, the start site of Iμ germ-line transcription, in a lineage- and stage-specific manner, even though this antisense transcription is Eμ-independent. YY1(-/-) pro-B cells are greatly impaired in distal V(H) gene rearrangement and Igh locus compaction, and we demonstrate that YY1 deficiency greatly reduces antisense transcription and PAIR-Eμ interactions. ChIP-seq shows high level YY1 binding only at Eμ, but low levels near some antisense promoters. PAIR-Eμ interactions are not disrupted by DRB, which blocks transcription elongation without disrupting transcription factories once they are established, but the looping is reduced after heat-shock treatment, which disrupts transcription factories. We propose that transcription-mediated interactions, most likely at transcription factories, initially compact the Igh locus, bringing distal V(H) genes close to the DJ(H) rearrangement which is adjacent to Eμ. Therefore, we hypothesize that one key role of noncoding germ-line transcription is to facilitate locus compaction, allowing distal V(H) genes to undergo efficient rearrangement."

"22935139";"3C";"(3C AND chromosome)";"BMC Genomics";11;2012;"Normalization of a chromosomal contact map.";"BACKGROUND: Chromatin organization has been increasingly studied in relation with its important influence on DNA-related metabolic processes such as replication or regulation of gene expression. Since its original design ten years ago, capture of chromosome conformation (3C) has become an essential tool to investigate the overall conformation of chromosomes. It relies on the capture of long-range trans and cis interactions of chromosomal segments whose relative proportions in the final bank reflect their frequencies of interactions, hence their spatial proximity in a population of cells. The recent coupling of 3C with deep sequencing approaches now allows the generation of high resolution genome-wide chromosomal contact maps. Different protocols have been used to generate such maps in various organisms. This includes mammals, drosophila and yeast. The massive amount of raw data generated by the genomic 3C has to be carefully processed to alleviate the various biases and byproducts generated by the experiments. Our study aims at proposing a simple normalization procedure to minimize the influence of these unwanted but inevitable events on the final results.RESULTS: Careful analysis of the raw data generated previously for budding yeast S. cerevisiae led to the identification of three main biases affecting the final datasets, including a previously unknown bias resulting from the circularization of DNA molecules. We then developed a simple normalization procedure to process the data and allow the generation of a normalized, highly contrasted, chromosomal contact map for S. cerevisiae. The same method was then extended to the first human genome contact map. Using the normalized data, we revisited the preferential interactions originally described between subsets of discrete chromosomal features. Notably, the detection of preferential interactions between tRNA in yeast and CTCF, PolII binding sites in human can vary with the normalization procedure used.CONCLUSIONS: We quantitatively reanalyzed the genomic 3C data obtained for S. cerevisiae, identified some of the biases inherent to the technique and proposed a simple normalization procedure to analyse them. Such an approach can be easily generalized for genomic 3C experiments in other organisms. More experiments and analysis will be necessary to reach optimal resolution and accuracies of the maps generated through these approaches. Working with cell population presenting highest levels of homogeneity will prove useful in this regards."

Defects in SHOX or its enhancers have been observed in ∼60% of Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD) patients, a skeletal dysplasia characterised by short stature and/or the characteristic Madelung deformity, and in 2-5% of idiopathic short stature (ISS). To identify the molecular defect in the remaining genetically undiagnosed LWD and ISS patients, this study screened previously unanalysed PAR1 regions in 124 LWD and 576 ISS probands.METHODS: PAR1 screening was undertaken by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Copy number alterations were subsequently confirmed and delimited by locus-specific custom-designed MLPA, array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) and breakpoint junction PCR/sequencing.RESULTS: A recurrent PAR1 deletion downstream of SHOX spanning 47543 bp with identical breakpoints was identified in 19 LWD (15.3%) and 11 ISS (1.9%) probands, from 30 unrelated families. Eight evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs 1-8) identified within the deleted sequence were evaluated for SHOX regulatory activity by means of chromosome conformation capture (3C) in chicken embryo limbs and luciferase reporter assays in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells. The 3C assay indicated potential SHOX regulatory activity by ECR1, which was subsequently confirmed to act as a SHOX enhancer, operating in an orientation and position independent manner, in human U2OS cells.CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified the first recurrent PAR1 deletion in LWD and ISS, which results in the loss of a previously uncharacterised SHOX enhancer. The loss of this enhancer may decrease SHOX transcription, resulting in LWD or ISS due to SHOX haploinsufficiency."

We investigated the three-dimensional folding of a 1 Mbp region of human chromosome 11 containing the β-globin genes by integrating looping interactions of the CCCTC-binding insulator protein CTCF determined comprehensively by chromosome conformation capture (3C) into a polymer model of chromatin. We find that CTCF-mediated cell type-specific interactions in erythroid cells are organized to favor contacts known to occur in vivo between the β-globin locus control region (LCR) and genes. In these cells, the modeled β-globin domain folds into a globule with the LCR and the active globin genes on the periphery. In contrast, in non-erythroid cells, the globule is less compact with few but dominant CTCF interactions driving the genes away from the LCR. This leads to a decrease in contact frequencies that can exceed 1000-fold depending on the stiffness of the chromatin and the exact position of the genes. Our findings show that an ensemble of CTCF contacts functionally affects spatial distances between control elements and target genes contributing to chromosomal organization required for transcription."

Hypotheses have been put forth to account for these phenomena, but data have not been provided to support a physical mechanism that explains long-range activation. In murine leukemia virus-induced myeloid leukemia in mice, integrated proviruses have been found upstream of c-myb in three regions, named Mml1, Mml2, and Mml3 (25, 50, and 70 kb upstream, respectively). The transcription factor c-Myb is an oncogene whose dysregulation and/or mutation can lead to human leukemia. We hypothesized that the murine c-myb upstream region contains regulatory elements accessed by the retrovirus. To identify regulatory sites in the murine c-myb upstream region, we looked by chromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray technology (ChIP-on-chip) for histone modifications implicating gene activation in normal cells. H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K9/14ac were enriched at Mml1 and/or Mml2 in the myeloblastic cell line M1, which expresses c-myb. The enrichment of all of these histone marks decreased with differentiation-induced downregulation of the gene in M1 cells but increased and spread in tumor cells containing integrated provirus. Importantly, using chromosome conformation capture (3C)-quantitative PCR assays, interactions between the 5' region, including the promoter and all Mml sites (Mml1, Mml2, and Mml3), were detected due to DNA looping in M1 cells and tumor cells with provirus in Mml1, Mml2, or Mml3. Therefore, our study provides a new mechanism of retrovirus insertional mutagenesis whereby spatial chromatin organization allows distally located provirus, with its own enhancer elements, to access the 5' regulatory region of the gene."

Acetylation of H2A.Z at promoters of oncogenes has been linked to tumorigenesis. The mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that in triple negative breast cancer cells, H2A.Z bound to the promoter of the constitutively, weakly expressed cyclin D1 oncogene (CCND1), a key regulator of cellular proliferation. Depleting the pool of H2A.Z stimulated transcription of CCND1 in the absence of its cognate transcription factor, the estrogen receptor (ER). During activation of CCND1, H2A.Z was released from the transcription start site (TSS) and downstream enhancer (enh2) sequences. Concurrently, acetylation of H2A.Z, H3 and H4 at the TSS was increased but only H2A.Z was acetylated at enh2. Acetylation of H2A.Z required the Tip60 acetyltransferase to be associated with the activated CCND1 on both TSS and enh2 sites. Depletion of Tip60 prevented CCND1 activation. Chromosome conformation capture experiments (3C) revealed specific contacts between the TSS and enh2 chromatin regions. These results suggest that release of a histone H2A.Z-mediated repression loop activates CCND1 for transcription. Our findings open new avenues for controlling and understanding aberrant gene expression associated with tumorigenesis."

As a DNA-binding transcription factor, c-Myb regulates specific gene programs through activation of target genes. Still, our understanding of these programs is incomplete. Here, we report a set of novel c-Myb target genes, identified using a combined approach: specific c-Myb knockdown by 2 different siRNAs and subsequent global expression profiling, combined with the confirmation of direct binding of c-Myb to the target promoters by ChIP assays. The combination of these 2 approaches, as well as additional validation such as cloning and testing the promoters in reporter assays, confirmed that MYADM, LMO2, GATA2, STAT5A, and IKZF1 are target genes of c-Myb. Additional studies, using chromosome conformation capture, demonstrated that c-Myb target genes may directly interact with each other, indicating that these genes may be coordinately regulated. Of the 5 novel target genes identified, 3 are transcription factors, and one is a transcriptional co-regulator, supporting a role of c-Myb as a master regulator controlling the expression of other transcriptional regulators in the hematopoietic system."

These events affect variable regions, through VDJ joining and subsequent somatic hypermutation, and constant regions through class switch recombination (CSR). Levels of IgH expression are also regulated during B cell development, resulting in high levels of secreted antibodies from fully differentiated plasma cells. Regulation of these events has been attributed primarily to two cis-elements that work from long distances on their target sequences, i.e., an ∼1 kb intronic enhancer, Eμ, located between the V region segments and the most 5' constant region gene, Cμ; and an ∼40 kb 3' regulatory region (3' RR) that is located downstream of the most 3' C(H) gene, Cα. The 3' RR is a candidate for an &quot;end&quot; of B cell-specific regulation of the Igh locus. The 3' RR contains several B cell-specific enhancers associated with DNase I hypersensitive sites (hs1-4), which are essential for CSR and for high levels of IgH expression in plasma cells. Downstream of this enhancer-containing region is a region of high-density CTCF binding sites, which extends through hs5, 6, and 7 and further downstream. CTCF, with its enhancer-blocking activities, has been associated with all mammalian insulators and implicated in multiple chromosomal interactions. Here we address the 3' RR CTCF-binding region as a potential insulator of the Igh locus, an independent regulatory element and a predicted modulator of the activity of 3' RR enhancers. Using chromosome conformation capture technology, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and genetic approaches, we have found that the 3' RR with its CTCF-binding region interacts with target sequences in the V(H), Eμ, and C(H) regions through DNA looping as regulated by protein binding. This region impacts on B cell-specific Igh processes at different stages of B cell development."

Growing evidence has revealed that the multivalent functional zinc finger protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master regulator of genome spatial organization, and mediates the ubiquitous chromatin loops within the genome. Using circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) methodology, we discovered that CTCF may be a master organizer in mediating the spatial organization of the kcnq5 gene locus. We characterized the cell-type specific spatial organization of the kcnq5 gene locus mediated by CTCF in detail using chromosome conformation capture (3C) and 3C-derived techniques. Cohesion also participated in mediating the organization of this locus. RNAi-mediated knockdown of CTCF sharply diminished the interaction frequencies between the chromatin loops of the kcnq5 gene locus and down-regulated local gene expression. Functional analysis showed that the interacting chromatin loops of the kcnq5 gene locus can repress the gene expression in a luciferase reporter assay. These interacting chromatin fragments were a series of repressing elements whose contacts were mediated by CTCF. Therefore, these findings suggested that the dynamical spatial organization of the kcnq5 locus regulates local gene expression."

To investigate whether these foci represent GalR-mediated association of some of the GalR specific DNA binding sites (gal operators), we used the chromosome conformation capture (3C) method in vivo. Our 3C data demonstrate that, in stationary phase cells, many of the operators distributed around the chromosome are interacted. By the use of atomic force microscopy, we showed that the observed remote chromosomal interconnections occur by direct interactions between DNA-bound GalR not involving any other factors. Mini plasmid DNA circles with three or five operators positioned at defined loci showed GalR-dependent loops of expected sizes of the intervening DNA segments. Our findings provide unique evidence that a transcription factor participates in organizing the chromosome in a three-dimensional structure.

Instead, we estimate CPs by simulating a physically realistic, bead-chain polymer model of the 30-nm chromatin fiber. We then use an approach from adaptive filter theory to iteratively adjust the parameters of this polymer model until the estimated CPs match the given CPs. We have validated this method against reference data sets obtained from simulations of test systems with up to 45 beads and 4 loops.

It has previously been shown that in the mouse the developmental switching of globin gene expression correlates with the reconfiguration of an active chromatin hub (ACH), a complex of promoters of transcribed genes with distant regulatory elements. Although it is likely that observations made in the mouse β-globin gene domain are also relevant for this locus in other species, the validity of this supposition still lacks direct experimental evidence. Here, we have studied the spatial organization of the chicken β-globin gene domain. This domain is of particular interest because it represents the perfect example of the so-called 'strong' tissue-specific gene domain flanked by insulators, which delimit the area of preferential sensitivity to DNase I in erythroid cells.RESULTS: Using chromosome conformation capture (3C), we have compared the spatial configuration of the β-globin gene domain in chicken red blood cells (RBCs) expressing embryonic (3-day-old RBCs) and adult (9-day-old RBCs) β-globin genes. In contrast to observations made in the mouse model, we found that in the chicken, the early embryonic β-globin gene, Ε, did not interact with the locus control region in RBCs of embryonic lineage (3-day RBCs), where this gene is actively transcribed. In contrast to the mouse model, a strong interaction of the promoter of another embryonic β-globin gene, ρ, with the promoter of the adult β-globin gene, βA, was observed in RBCs from both 3-day and 9-day chicken embryos. Finally, we have demonstrated that insulators flanking the chicken β-globin gene domain from the upstream and from the downstream interact with each other, which places the area characterized by lineage-specific sensitivity to DNase I in a separate chromatin loop.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results strongly support the ACH model but show that within a domain of tissue-specific genes, the active status of a promoter does not necessarily correlate with the recruitment of this promoter to the ACH."

The patients had a variable phenotype, from a severe prenatal form with intrauterine foetal death to a milder phenotype, albeit still with an early onset, within the first 2-3 months.RESULTS: A genome-wide search for homozygosity revealed one single 15.6 Mb region of homozygosity on chromosome 13, which included RNASEH2B, where a splice site mutation c.322-3C&gt;G was identified. Screening of 170 anonymous Faroese controls revealed a carrier frequency of approximately 1.8%, corresponding to an incidence of AGS in the Faroe Islands of around 1 in 12,300.CONCLUSION: The previously identified RNASEH2B mutations comprise altogether 20 mutations (missense, nonsense and splice site) with all patients harbouring at least one missense mutation. The severe phenotype of the Faroese patients compared with the previously reported patients with RNASEH2B mutations may be caused by the presence of two null alleles (although some residual normal splicing cannot be ruled out), whereas patients with one or two missense mutations may have some, albeit abnormal, RNASEH2B proteins, and hence some residual activity of RNASEH2B, explaining their milder phenotype."

Such interactions are shown to play a role in various aspects of gene regulation, for example transcriptional activation of genes by remote enhancer sequences, or the silencing by Polycomb-group complexes. The last few years the number of publications involving chromosomal interactions increased significantly. Until now, however, the vast majority of the studies reported are performed in yeast or animal systems. So far, studies on plant systems are extremely limited, possibly due to the plant-specific characteristics that hamper the implementation of the 3C technique. In this paper we provide a plant-specific 3C protocol, optimized for maize tissue, and an extensive discussion on (i) plant-specific adjustments to the protocol, and (ii) solutions to problems that may arise when optimizing the protocol for the tissue or plant of interest. Together, this paper should facilitate the application of 3C technology to plant tissue and stimulate studies on the 3D conformation of chromosomal regions and chromosomes in plants."

One consequence of such higher order structure is that chromatin looping can bring together genomic elements which are separated by several hundreds of kilobases, such as enhancers and promoters, and functionally facilitate their interaction. The Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) assay is a powerful technique to detect looping structures and assess the probability of interaction between distant genomic elements (1-3).

Nonetheless, due to throughput and resolution limitations associated with traditional assays, many question regarding bacterial chromosome structure and its relation to genome function remain. Here, I review the related technologies, chromosome conformation capture (3C) and chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C), which my collaborators and I recently introduced as tools to probe the high-resolution folding of entire bacterial genomes. These technologies utilize covalent cross-linking and proximity ligation to facilitate the measurement of the spatial positioning of hundreds of genomic loci, thereby opening the door to high-throughput studies of bacterial chromosome structure. Hence, 3C and 5C represent powerful new tools for assaying the three-dimensional architecture of bacterial genomes."

Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) demonstrated the formation of specific ligation products containing spliced IL-4 and IL-13 DNA sequences in human T(H)2 polarised HuT-78 cells. This suggests that co-ordinate expression of T(H)2 cytokines, under the control of GATA3 and NFAT1 is due to the formation of a chromatin hub by DNA looping."

The Gc chromosome induces chromosomal breakage resulting in chromosomal aberrations in the progeny of the 2H addition line of common wheat carrying the monosomic Gc chromosome. We conducted in situ hybridization to select plants carrying structurally rearranged aberrant 2H chromosomes and characterized them by sequential C-banding and in situ hybridization. We established 66 dissection lines of common wheat carrying single aberrant 2H chromosomes. The aberrant 2H chromosomes were of either deletion or translocation or complicated structural change. Their breakpoints were distributed in the short arm (2HS), centromere (2HC) and the long arm (2HL) at a rough 2HS/2HC/2HL ratio of 2:1:2. We conducted PCR analysis of the 66 dissection lines using 115 EST markers specific to chromosome 2H. Based on the PCR result, we constructed a physical or cytological map of chromosome 2H that were divided into 34 regions separated by the breakpoints of the aberrant 2H chromosomes. Forty-seven markers were present in 2HS and 68 in 2HL. We compared the 2H cytological map with a previously reported 2H genetic map using 44 markers that were used in common to construct both maps. The order of markers in the distal region was the same on both maps but that in the proximal region was somewhat contradictory between the two maps. We found that the markers distributed rather evenly in the genetic map were actually concentrated in the distal regions of both arms as revealed by the cytological map. We also recognized an EST-marker or gene-rich region in the 2HL interstitial region slightly to the telomere."

ChIP-Sequencing and Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C)-Sequencing were used to characterize the structural and protein-binding dynamics of the Myb locus during erythroid differentiation. In proliferating cells expressing Myb, enhancers within the Myb-Hbs1l intergenic region were shown to form an active chromatin hub (ACH) containing the Myb promoter and first intron. This first intron was found to harbour the transition site from transcription initiation to elongation, which takes place around a conserved CTCF site. Upon erythroid differentiation, Myb expression is downregulated and the ACH destabilized. We propose a model for Myb activation by distal enhancers dynamically bound by KLF1 and the GATA1/TAL1/LDB1 complex, which primarily function as a transcription elongation element through chromatin looping."

MYC has been widely presumed as the regulated target gene, but definitive evidence functionally linking these cancer regions with MYC has been difficult to obtain. Here we examined candidate functional variants of a haplotype block at 8q24 encompassing the two independent risk alleles for prostate and breast cancer, rs620861 and rs13281615. We used the mapping of DNase I hypersensitive sites as a tool to prioritise regions for further functional analysis. This approach identified rs378854, which is in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs620861, as a novel functional prostate cancer-specific genetic variant. We demonstrate that the risk allele (G) of rs378854 reduces binding of the transcription factor YY1 in vitro. This factor is known to repress global transcription in prostate cancer and is a candidate tumour suppressor. Additional experiments showed that the YY1 binding site is occupied in vivo in prostate cancer, but not breast cancer cells, consistent with the observed cancer-specific effects of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Using chromatin conformation capture (3C) experiments, we found that the region surrounding rs378854 interacts with the MYC and PVT1 promoters. Moreover, expression of the PVT1 oncogene in normal prostate tissue increased with the presence of the risk allele of rs378854, while expression of MYC was not affected. In conclusion, we identified a new functional prostate cancer risk variant at the 8q24 locus, rs378854 allele G, that reduces binding of the YY1 protein and is associated with increased expression of PVT1 located 0.5 Mb downstream."

We have previously shown that the Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) major latency transcripts encoding LANA, vCyclin, vFLIP, v-miRNAs, and Kaposin are regulated, in part, by a chromatin organizing element that binds CTCF and cohesins. Using viral genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (3C) methods, we now show that KSHV latency control region is physically linked to the promoter regulatory region for ORF50, which encodes the KSHV immediate early protein RTA. Other linkages were also observed, including an interaction between the 5' and 3' end of the latency transcription cluster. Mutation of the CTCF-cohesin binding site reduced or eliminated the chromatin conformation linkages, and deregulated viral transcription and genome copy number control. siRNA depletion of CTCF or cohesin subunits also disrupted chromosomal linkages and deregulated viral latent and lytic gene transcription. Furthermore, the linkage between the latent and lytic control region was subject to cell cycle fluctuation and disrupted during lytic cycle reactivation, suggesting that these interactions are dynamic and regulatory. Our findings indicate that KSHV genomes are organized into chromatin loops mediated by CTCF and cohesin interactions, and that these inter-chromosomal linkages coordinate latent and lytic gene control."

These different latency types are epigenetically stable and correspond to different promoter utilization. Here we explore the three-dimensional conformations of the EBV genome in different latency types. We employed Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) assay to investigate chromatin loop formation between the OriP enhancer and the promoters that determine type I (Qp) or type III (Cp) gene expression. We show that OriP is in close physical proximity to Qp in type I latency, and to Cp in type III latency. The cellular chromatin insulator and boundary factor CTCF was implicated in EBV chromatin loop formation. Combining 3C and ChIP assays we found that CTCF is physically associated with OriP-Qp loop formation in type I and OriP-Cp loop formation in type III latency. Mutations in the CTCF binding site located at Qp disrupt loop formation between Qp and OriP, and lead to the activation of Cp transcription. Mutation of the CTCF binding site at Cp, as well as siRNA depletion of CTCF eliminates both OriP-associated loops, indicating that CTCF plays an integral role in loop formation. These data indicate that epigenetically stable EBV latency types adopt distinct chromatin architectures that depend on CTCF and mediate alternative promoter targeting by the OriP enhancer."

As chromatin contacts have been found throughout the human genome and in different cell types, spatial transcriptional control is now viewed as a general mechanism of gene expression regulation. Chromosome Conformation Capture Carbon Copy (5C) and its variant Hi-C are techniques used to measure the interaction frequency (IF) between specific regions of the genome. Our goal is to use the IF data generated by these experiments to computationally model and analyze three-dimensional chromatin organization.RESULTS: We formulate a probabilistic model linking 5C/Hi-C data to physical distances and describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach called MCMC5C to generate a representative sample from the posterior distribution over structures from IF data. Structures produced from parallel MCMC runs on the same dataset demonstrate that our MCMC method mixes quickly and is able to sample from the posterior distribution of structures and find subclasses of structures. Structural properties (base looping, condensation, and local density) were defined and their distribution measured across the ensembles of structures generated. We applied these methods to a biological model of human myelomonocyte cellular differentiation and identified distinct chromatin conformation signatures (CCSs) corresponding to each of the cellular states. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to run on Hi-C data and produce a model of human chromosome 14 at 1Mb resolution that is consistent with previously observed structural properties as measured by 3D-FISH.CONCLUSIONS: We believe that tools like MCMC5C are essential for the reliable analysis of data from the 3C-derived techniques such as 5C and Hi-C. By integrating complex, high-dimensional and noisy datasets into an easy to interpret ensemble of three-dimensional conformations, MCMC5C allows researchers to reliably interpret the result of their assay and contrast conformations under different conditions.AVAILABILITY: http://Dostielab.biochem.mcgill.ca."

CLEC16A has been reported as the most likely candidate gene in the region, since it contains the most disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as an imunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. However, here we report that intron 19 of CLEC16A, containing the most autoimmune disease-associated SNPs, appears to behave as a regulatory sequence, affecting the expression of a neighbouring gene, DEXI. The CLEC16A alleles that are protective from T1D and MS are associated with increased expression of DEXI, and no other genes in the region, in two independent monocyte gene expression data sets. Critically, using chromosome conformation capture (3C), we identified physical proximity between the DEXI promoter region and intron 19 of CLEC16A, separated by a loop of &gt;150 kb. In reciprocal experiments, a 20 kb fragment of intron 19 of CLEC16A, containing SNPs associated with T1D and MS, as well as with DEXI expression, interacted with the promotor region of DEXI but not with candidate DNA fragments containing other potential causal genes in the region, including CLEC16A. Intron 19 of CLEC16A is highly enriched for transcription-factor-binding events and markers associated with enhancer activity. Taken together, these data indicate that although the causal variants in the 16p13 region lie within CLEC16A, DEXI is an unappreciated autoimmune disease candidate gene, and illustrate the power of the 3C approach in progressing from genome-wide association studies results to candidate causal genes."

Our previous studies have revealed that the mbr could regulate BCL2 transcription over a 200-kb distance and this regulatory function was closely related to SATB1. This study is to explore the underlying mechanism and its relevance to cellular apoptosis. With chromosome conformation capture (3C) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays we demonstrated that the mbr could physically interact with BCL2 promoter through SATB1-mediated chromatin looping, which was required for epigenetic modifications of the promoter, CREB accessibility and high expression of the BCL2 gene. During early apoptosis, SATB1 was a key regulator of BCL2 expression. Inhibition of SATB1 cleavage by treatment of cells with a caspase-6 inhibitor or overexpression of mutant SATB1 that was resistant to caspase-6, inhibited disassembly of the SATB1-mediated chromatin loop and restored the BCL2 mRNA level in Jurkat cells. These data revealed a novel mechanism of BCL2 regulation and mechanistically link SATB1-mediated long-range interaction with the regulation of a gene controlling apoptosis pathway for the first time."

In particular, the formation of loops mediated by the interaction between specific regulatory elements, for instance enhancers and promoters, is crucial in gene control. Biochemical studies that were based on the chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology have confirmed that eukaryotic genomes are highly looped. Insight into the underlying principles comes from polymer models that explore the properties of the chromatin fibre inside the nucleus. Recent models indicate that chromatin looping can explain various properties of interphase chromatin, including chromatin compaction and compartmentalisation of chromosomes. Entropic effects have a key role in these models. In this Commentary, we give an overview of the recent conjunction of ideas regarding chromatin looping in the fields of biology and polymer physics. Starting from simple linear polymer models, we explain how specific folding properties emerge upon introducing loops and how this explains a variety of experimental observations. We also discuss different polymer models that describe chromatin folding and compare them to experimental data. Experimentally testing the predictions of such polymer models and their subsequent improvement on the basis of measurements provides a solid framework to begin to understand how our genome is folded and how folding relates to function."

LacZ staining of E11 embryos obtained by first using the vectors in pools and then testing individual candidates led to the identification of 3 enhancers, only one of which shows significant evolutionary conservation. In situ hybridization and 3C/4C experiments suggest that this enhancer, which is active in the neural tube and posterior diencephalon, influences the expression of the Olig1 and/or Olig2 genes. This work provides a new approach for the large-scale in vivo screening of transcriptional regulatory sequences, and further demonstrates that evolutionary conservation alone seems too limiting a criterion for the identification of enhancers."

These chromatin contacts can be measured with the &quot;chromosome conformation capture&quot; (3C) technology and other 3C-related techniques. Given the recent innovation of 3C-derived approaches, it is not surprising that we still know very little about the structure of our genome at high-resolution.

Imprinted domains consist of clusters of genes, some of which exhibit parent-of-origin dependent monoallelic expression, while others are biallelic. The Kcnq1 imprinted domain illustrates the complexities of long-range regulation that coexists with local exceptions. A paternally expressed repressive non-coding RNA, Kcnq1ot1, regulates a domain of up to 750 kb, encompassing 14 genes. We study how the Kcnq1 gene, initially silenced by Kcnq1ot1, undergoes tissue-specific escape from imprinting during development. Specifically, we uncover the role of chromosome conformation during these events.RESULTS: We show that Kcnq1 transitions from monoallelic to biallelic expression during mid gestation in the developing heart. This transition is not associated with the loss of methylation on the Kcnq1 promoter. However, by exploiting chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology, we find tissue-specific and stage-specific chromatin loops between the Kcnq1 promoter and newly identified DNA regulatory elements. These regulatory elements showed in vitro activity in a luciferase assay and in vivo activity in transgenic embryos.CONCLUSIONS: By exploring the spatial organization of the Kcnq1 locus, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which local activation of genes can override the regional silencing effects of non-coding RNAs."

We find that, at several gene-rich loci, contact frequencies undergo a periodical modulation (every 90 to 100 kb) that affects chromatin dynamics over large genomic distances (a few hundred kilobases). Interestingly, this modulation appears to be conserved in human cells, and bioinformatic analyses of locus-specific, long-range cis-interactions suggest that it may underlie the dynamics of a significant number of gene-rich domains in mammals, thus contributing to genome evolution. Finally, using an original model derived from polymer physics, we show that this modulation can be understood as a fundamental helix shape that chromatin tends to adopt in gene-rich domains when no significant locus-specific interaction takes place.CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our work unveils a fundamental aspect of chromatin dynamics in mammals and contributes to a better understanding of genome organization within chromosomal territories."

LCR HS3 and HS2 were strongly occupied by erythroid specific transcriptional activators and co-factors in the induced locus. These HSs, but not HS4 and HS1, were in close proximity with the active globin genes as revealed by high resolution 3C experiments. The active features at HS3 were markedly established after transcriptional induction, while HS2 was in a relatively active conformation before the induction. Unexpectedly, HS1 did not show notable active features except histone hyperacetylation. Taken together, the LCR of the human β-globin locus transcribing the adult δ- and β-globin genes has HS specific chromatin structure. The structure at each HS, which is different from the locus transcribing the fetal globin genes, might relate to its role in transcribing the adult genes."

In addition, these elements frequently activate different members of gene families in temporal sequence or in different tissues. These issues have complicated understanding the mechanisms underlying long-range gene activation. Advances in primarily technical approaches, such as chromosome conformation capture (3C) and its derivatives have now solidified the idea that distant regulatory elements achieve proximity with their target genes when they are activating them. Furthermore, these approaches are now allowing genome-wide views of chromosome interactions that are likely to include regulatory, structural, and organization aspects from which we will be able to understand more about nuclear structure. At the base of these advances are experimental approaches to localize protein-binding sites in chromatin, to assess remodeling of chromatin and to measure interaction frequency between distant sites. Examples of these approaches comprise this review."

This genus is karyotypically diverse and shows extensive variation in diploid number (2n = 16 to 50). To foster a better understanding of the chromosomal diversities and phylogenetic relationships among the species of Callicebus, we performed a chromosome-painting analysis on the Callicebus personatus genome using human probes, and compared the resulting hybridization map to those of previously mapped titi species.

Previously, we generated chicken B-lymphocyte-derived DT40 cells lacking six transcriptional regulatory regions scattered in and around the immunoglobulin (Ig)-β gene. The deletions caused a complete shut down of transcription and epigenetic regulation of the Ig-β gene, demonstrating that the scattered regulatory regions cooperated in the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the gene. However, the in vivo 3-dimensional spatial relationships between the Ig-β promoter and these six regulatory regions were not investigated. In this study, we used chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology and demonstrated that the Ig-β promoter physically interacted with the scattered regulatory regions. We found that the Ig-β promoter also interacted with two downstream promoters of ubiquitously expressed genes, rad motif 1 (RDM1) and Plekhm1, to form a transcription factory, but not with three ubiquitously expressed genes, BAF60b, p45/SUG, and RRMJ3, located upstream of the Ig-β gene.

Eos (Ikaros family zinc finger 4, IKZF4), a member of the zinc finger transcription factor Ikaros family, plays a pivotal role as a repressor of gene expression. The aim of this study was to examine the role of Eos in globin gene regulation.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR detected a gradual decrease in Eos expression during erythroid differentiation of hemin-induced K562 cells and Epo-induced CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HPCs). DNA transfection and lentivirus-mediated gene transfer demonstrated that the enforced expression of Eos significantly represses the expression of γ-globin, but not other globin genes, in K562 cells and CD34+ HPCs. Consistent with a direct role of Eos in globin gene regulation, chromatin immunoprecipitaion and dual-luciferase reporter assays identified three discrete sites located in the DNase I hypersensitivity site 3 (HS3) of the β-globin locus control region (LCR), the promoter regions of the Gγ- and Aγ- globin genes, as functional binding sites of Eos protein. A chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay indicated that Eos may repress the interaction between the LCR and the γ-globin gene promoter. In addition, erythroid differentiation was inhibited by enforced expression of Eos in K562 cells and CD34+ HPCs.SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that Eos plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the γ-globin gene during erythroid differentiation."

This document reviews the options available to pregnant women and the challenges specific to screening and diagnosis in a twin pregnancy.OUTCOMES: Clinicians will be better informed about the accuracy of different screening options in twin pregnancies and about techniques of invasive prenatal diagnosis in twins.EVIDENCE: PubMed and Cochrane Database were searched for relevant English and French language articles published between 1985 and 2010, using appropriate controlled vocabulary and key words (aneuploidy, Down syndrome, trisomy, prenatal screening, genetic health risk, genetic health surveillance, prenatal diagnosis, twin gestation). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and relevant observational studies. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to August 2010. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. The previous Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada guidelines regarding prenatal screening were also reviewed in developing this clinical practice guideline.VALUES: The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1).BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: There is a need for specific guidelines for prenatal screening and diagnosis in twins. These guidelines should assist health care providers in the approach to this aspect of prenatal care of women with twin pregnancies. SUMMARY STATEMENTS 1. Fetal nuchal translucency combined with maternal age is an acceptable first trimester screening test for aneuploidies in twin pregnancies. (II-2) 2. First trimester serum screening combined with nuchal translucency may be considered in twin pregnancies. It provides some improvement over the performance of screening by nuchal translucency and maternal age by decreasing the false-positive rate. (II-3) 3. Integrated screening with nuchal translucency plus first and second trimester serum screening is an option in twin pregnancies. Further prospective studies are required in this area, since it has not been validated in prospective studies in twins. (III) 4. Non-directive counselling is essential when invasive testing is offered. (III) 5. When chorionic villus sampling is performed in non-monochorionic multiple pregnancies, a combination of transabdominal and transcervical approaches or a transabdominal only approach appears to provide the best results to minimize the likelihood of sampling errors. (II-2) Recommendations 1. All pregnant women in Canada, regardless of age, should be offered, through an informed counselling process, the option of a prenatal screening test for the most common clinically significant fetal aneuploidies. In addition, they should be offered a second trimester ultrasound for dating, assessment of fetal anatomy, and detection of multiples. (I-A) 2. Counselling must be non-directive and must respect a woman's right to accept or decline any or all of the testing or options offered at any point in the process. (III-A) 3. When non-invasive prenatal screening for aneuploidy is available, maternal age alone should not be an indication for invasive prenatal diagnosis in a twin pregnancy. (II-2A) If non-invasive prenatal screening is not available, invasive prenatal diagnosis in twins should be offered to women aged 35 and over. (II-2B) 4. Chorionicity has a major impact on the prenatal screening process and should be determined by ultrasound in the first trimester of all twin pregnancies. (II-2A) 5. When screening is done by nuchal translucency and maternal age, a pregnancy-specific risk should be calculated in monochorionic twins. In dichorionic twins, a fetus-specific risk should be calculated. (II-3C) 6. During amniocentesis, both amniotic sacs should be sampled in monochorionic twin pregnancies, unless monochorionicity is confirmed before 14 weeks and the fetuses appear concordant for growth and anatomy. (II-2B) 7. Prior to invasive testing or in the context of twins discordant for an abnormality, selective reduction should be discussed and made available to those requesting the procedure after appropriate counselling. (III-B) 8. Monitoring for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy is not indicated in dichorionic twin pregnancies undergoing selective reduction. (II-2B)."

The redundancy (copy number per 1C DNA) of sequences related to each probe varied greatly between the genomes. No significant correlation was found between the genome size and the copy number of sequences in any family. The quantitative ratios varied greatly (in each genome) between the two families of satellite DNA, between the sequences that represented copia or gypsy retrotransposons, and between tandemly arranged sequences and retroelements as a whole, suggesting that there is no common factor that controls the quantitative evolution of repeats belonging to different sequence families during speciation in Picea."

It is known to be important for the development and differentiation of the erythroid cell lineage and is thought to be implicated in long-range interactions. Here, the dynamics of the composition of the complex-in particular, the binding of the negative regulators Eto2 and Mtgr1-are studied, in the context of their genome-wide targets. This shows that the complex acts almost exclusively as an activator, binding a very specific combination of sequences, with a positioning relative to transcription start site, depending on the type of the core promoter. The activation is accompanied by a net decrease in the relative binding of Eto2 and Mtgr1. A Chromosome Conformation Capture sequencing (3C-seq) assay also shows that the binding of the Ldb1 complex marks genomic interaction sites in vivo. This establishes the Ldb1 complex as a positive regulator of the final steps of erythroid differentiation that acts through the shedding of negative regulators and the active interaction between regulatory sequences."

The transcription factor BCL11A is a central mediator of gamma-globin silencing and hemoglobin switching. Here we determine chromatin occupancy of BCL11A at the human beta-globin locus and other genomic regions in vivo by high-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip analysis. BCL11A binds the upstream locus control region (LCR), epsilon-globin, and the intergenic regions between gamma-globin and delta-globin genes. A chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay shows that BCL11A reconfigures the beta-globin cluster by modulating chromosomal loop formation. We also show that BCL11A and the HMG-box-containing transcription factor SOX6 interact physically and functionally during erythroid maturation. BCL11A and SOX6 co-occupy the human beta-globin cluster along with GATA1, and cooperate in silencing gamma-globin transcription in adult human erythroid progenitors. These findings collectively demonstrate that transcriptional silencing of gamma-globin genes by BCL11A involves long-range interactions and cooperation with SOX6. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism of BCL11A action and new clues for the developmental gene regulatory programs that function at the beta-globin locus."

Our relatively simple approach, referred to as enrichment of ligation products (ELP), involves digestion of the 3C sample with a 4 bp cutter and self-ligation, achieving a resolution of 20 kb. It recaptures previously characterized genome organizations and also identifies new and important interactions. We have modeled the 3D structure of the entire fission yeast genome and have explored the functional relationships between the global genome organization and transcriptional regulation. We find significant associations among highly transcribed genes. Moreover, we demonstrate that genes co-regulated during the cell cycle tend to associate with one another when activated. Remarkably, functionally defined genes derived from particular gene ontology groups tend to associate in a statistically significant manner. Those significantly associating genes frequently contain the same DNA motifs at their promoter regions, suggesting that potential transcription factors binding to these motifs are involved in defining the associations among those genes. Our study suggests the presence of a global genome organization in fission yeast that is functionally similar to the recently proposed mammalian transcription factory."

These associations are thought to be driven by interactions between PcG complexes and result in enhanced repression. Here, we show that a Polycomb response element (PRE) with strong PcG binding and repressive activity cannot mediate trans interactions. In the case of the two best-studied interacting PcG targets in Drosophila, the Mcp and the Fab-7 regulatory elements, we find that these associations are not dependent on or caused by the Polycomb response elements they contain. Using functional assays and physical colocalization by in vivo fluorescence imaging or chromosome conformation capture (3C) methods, we show that the interactions between remote copies of Mcp or Fab-7 elements are dependent on the insulator activities present in these elements and not on their PREs. We conclude that insulator binding proteins rather than PcG complexes are likely to be the major determinants of the long-range higher-order organization of PcG targets in the nucleus."

Here, we mapped the three-dimensional organization of the human Hox clusters with chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology. We show that computational modeling of 3C data sets can identify candidate regulatory proteins of chromatin architecture and gene expression. Hox genes encode evolutionarily conserved master regulators of development which strict control has fascinated biologists for over 25 years. Proper transcriptional silencing is key to Hox function since premature expression can lead to developmental defects or human disease. We now show that the HoxA cluster is organized into multiple chromatin loops that are dependent on transcription activity. Long-range contacts were found in all four silent clusters but looping patterns were specific to each cluster. In contrast to the Drosophila homeotic bithorax complex (BX-C), we found that Polycomb proteins are only modestly required for human cluster looping and silencing. However, computational three-dimensional Hox cluster modeling identified the insulator-binding protein CTCF as a likely candidate mediating DNA loops in all clusters. Our data suggest that Hox cluster looping may represent an evolutionarily conserved structural mechanism of transcription regulation."

Identification of long-range acting elements is particularly important in the case of disease genes as mutations in these elements can result in human disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that long-range control of gene expression is facilitated by chromatin looping interactions. These interactions can be detected by chromosome conformation capture (3C). Here, we employed 3C as a discovery tool for identification of long-range regulatory elements that control the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene, CFTR. We identified four elements in a 460-kb region around the locus that loop specifically to the CFTR promoter exclusively in CFTR expressing cells. The elements are located 20 and 80 kb upstream; and 109 and 203 kb downstream of the CFTR promoter. These elements contain DNase I hypersensitive sites and histone modification patterns characteristic of enhancers. The elements also interact with each other and the latter two activate the CFTR promoter synergistically in reporter assays. Our results reveal novel long-range acting elements that control expression of CFTR and suggest that 3C-based approaches can be used for discovery of novel regulatory elements."

Deciphering the relationship between chromosome organization and genome activity will aid in understanding genomic processes, like transcription and replication. However, little is known about how chromosomes fold. Microscopy is unable to distinguish large numbers of loci simultaneously or at high resolution. To date, the detection of chromosomal interactions using chromosome conformation capture (3C) and its subsequent adaptations required the choice of a set of target loci, making genome-wide studies impossible (7-10). We developed Hi-C, an extension of 3C that is capable of identifying long range interactions in an unbiased, genome-wide fashion. In Hi-C, cells are fixed with formaldehyde, causing interacting loci to be bound to one another by means of covalent DNA-protein cross-links. When the DNA is subsequently fragmented with a restriction enzyme, these loci remain linked. A biotinylated residue is incorporated as the 5' overhangs are filled in. Next, blunt-end ligation is performed under dilute conditions that favor ligation events between cross-linked DNA fragments. This results in a genome-wide library of ligation products, corresponding to pairs of fragments that were originally in close proximity to each other in the nucleus. Each ligation product is marked with biotin at the site of the junction. The library is sheared, and the junctions are pulled-down with streptavidin beads. The purified junctions can subsequently be analyzed using a high-throughput sequencer, resulting in a catalog of interacting fragments. Direct analysis of the resulting contact matrix reveals numerous features of genomic organization, such as the presence of chromosome territories and the preferential association of small gene-rich chromosomes. Correlation analysis can be applied to the contact matrix, demonstrating that the human genome is segregated into two compartments: a less densely packed compartment containing open, accessible, and active chromatin and a more dense compartment containing closed, inaccessible, and inactive chromatin regions. Finally, ensemble analysis of the contact matrix, coupled with theoretical derivations and computational simulations, revealed that at the megabase scale Hi-C reveals features consistent with a fractal globule conformation."

EBV nuclear proteins EBNA3A and EBNA3C are necessary for efficient transformation, while EBNA3B is dispensable. We describe a transcriptome analysis of BL31 cells infected with a series of EBNA3-knockout EBVs, including one deleted for all three EBNA3 genes. Using Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST microarrays analysed with the MMBGX algorithm, we have identified over 1000 genes whose regulation by EBV requires one of the EBNA3s. Remarkably, a third of the genes identified require more than one EBNA3 for their regulation, predominantly EBNA3C co-operating with either EBNA3B, EBNA3A or both. The microarray was validated by real-time PCR, while ChIP analysis of a selection of co-operatively repressed promoters indicates a role for polycomb group complexes. Targets include genes involved in apoptosis, cell migration and B-cell differentiation, and show a highly significant but subtle alteration in genes involved in mitosis. In order to assess the relevance of the BL31 system to LCLs, we analysed the transcriptome of a set of EBNA3B knockout (3BKO) LCLs. Around a third of the genes whose expression level in LCLs was altered in the absence of EBNA3B were also altered in 3BKO-BL31 cell lines.Among these are TERT and TCL1A, implying that EBV-induced changes in the expression of these genes are not required for B-cell transformation. We also identify 26 genes that require both EBNA3A and EBNA3B for their regulation in LCLs. Together, this shows the complexity of the interaction between EBV and its host, whereby multiple EBNA3 proteins co-operate to modulate the behaviour of the host cell."

Reporter gene studies showed that the single nucleotide polymorphism rs16888589 acts as an allele-specific transcriptional repressor. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) analysis demonstrated that the genomic region harboring rs16888589 interacts with the promoter of gene for eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit H (EIF3H). We show that increased expression of EIF3H gene increases CRC growth and invasiveness thereby providing a biological mechanism for the 8q23.3 association.

The use of these techniques provides complementary information on average spatial distances (FISH) and contact probabilities (3C) for specific genomic sites. To infer the structure of the chromatin fiber or to distinguish functional interactions from random colocalization, it is useful to compare experimental data to predictions from statistical fiber models. The current estimates of the fiber stiffness derived from FISH and 3C differ by a factor of 5. They are based on the wormlike chain model and a heuristic modification of the Shimada-Yamakawa theory of looping for unkinkable, unconstrained, zero-diameter filaments. Here, we provide an extended theoretical and computational framework to explain the currently available experimental data for various species on the basis of a unique, minimal model of decondensing chromosomes: a kinkable, topologically constraint, semiflexible polymer with the (FISH) Kuhn length of l(K) = 300 nm, 10 kinks per Mbp, and a contact distance of 45 nm. In particular: 1), we reconsider looping of finite-diameter filaments on the basis of an analytical approximation (novel, to our knowledge) of the wormlike chain radial density and show that unphysically large contact radii would be required to explain the 3C data based on the FISH estimate of the fiber stiffness; 2), we demonstrate that the observed interaction frequencies at short genomic lengths can be explained by the presence of a low concentration of curvature defects (kinks); and 3), we show that the most recent experimental 3C data for human chromosomes are in quantitative agreement with interaction frequencies extracted from our simulations of topologically confined model chromosomes."

Using the M3C procedure, we have demonstrated that CpG islands of at least three housekeeping genes that surround the chicken α-globin gene domain are assembled into a complex (presumably, a transcription factory) that is stabilized by the nuclear matrix in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells. In erythroid cells, the regulatory elements of the α-globin genes are attracted to this complex to form a new assembly: an active chromatin hub that is linked to the pre-existing transcription factory. The erythroid-specific part of the assembly is removed by high salt extraction. Based on these observations, we propose that mixed transcription factories that mediate the transcription of both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes are composed of a permanent compartment containing integrated into the nuclear matrix promoters of housekeeping genes and a 'guest' compartment where promoters and regulatory elements of tissue-specific genes can be temporarily recruited."

Gene loci, for example, often reveal altered localization patterns according to their developmental regulation. Whole chromosomes also demonstrate non-random nuclear positions, correlated with inherent characteristics such as gene density or size. Given that hundreds to thousands of genes are coordinately regulated in any given cell type, interest has grown in whether chromosomes may be specifically localized according to gene regulation. A synthesis of the evidence for preferential chromosomal organization suggests that, beyond basic characteristics, chromosomes can assume positions functionally related to gene expression. Moreover, analysis of total chromosome organization during cellular differentiation indicates that unique chromosome topologies, albeit probabilistic, in effect define a cell lineage. Future work with new techniques, including the advanced forms of the chromosome conformation capture (3C), and the development of next-generation whole-genome imaging approaches, will help to refine our view of chromosomal organization.

Although the mechanistic role of LCE proteins in psoriasis has not been identified, these proteins are putatively involved in skin barrier formation and repair. Considering the potential genetic overlap between the two diseases and the recent finding that mutations in the skin barrier protein filaggrin are associated with AD, we investigated a possible association between LCE3C_LCE3B-del and AD. Evaluation of four different cohorts of European ancestry, containing a total of 1075 AD patients and 1658 controls, did not provide evidence for such an association.

An accumulating body of evidence indicates the pivotal role of spatial chromatin organization for the coordination of gene regulation. Recently, chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique has been developed and opened a new way to study chromosomal interactions in the nucleus. In this study, we describe 3C method we applied in F9 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells and demonstrate that the chromosomal interactions at Hox loci are successfully detected. Interestingly, at Hoxc loci, the abundance of intrachromosomal interactions with neighboring fragments was drastically decreased when the genes are expressed. These results indicate the possibility of the dynamic pattern of chromosomal interaction in association with the transcriptional regulation of Hox genes."

To facilitate better understanding of the potential of mitochondrial genome data in freshwater mussels, we present here, for the first time, the mitochondrial sequences of 4 complete F-type mitochondrial genomes from the European freshwater bivalve Unio pictorum (Unionidae). These genomes are very compact (15,761 bp) but have a typical gene complement for bilaterian mitochondrial genomes and a very similar organization to other unionid genomes available in databases.

Recently developed biochemical techniques such as RNA TRAP and chromosome conformation capture (3C) have provided us with the tools to probe chromosomal structures. These techniques have been applied to the β-globin locus, revealing a complex pattern of interactions with regions along the chromosome that the gene resides on. However, biochemical and microscopy data on the nature of β-globin interactions with other chromosomes is contradictory. Therefore we developed a novel 4C variant, Complete-genome 3C by vectorette amplification (4Cv), which allows an unbiased and quantitative method to examine chromosomal structure. We have used 4Cv to study the microenvironment of the β-globin locus in mice and show that a significant proportion of the interactions of β-globin are inter-chromosomal. Furthermore, our data show that in the liver, where the gene is active, β-globin is more likely to interact with other chromosomes, compared to the brain where the gene is silent and is more likely to interact with other regions along the same chromosome. Our data suggest that transcriptional activation of the β-globin locus leads to a change in nuclear position relative to the chromosome territory."

The probes used were A. strigosa pAs120a (a repetitive sequence abundant in A-genome chromatin), A. murphyi pAm1 (a repetitive sequence abundant in C-genome chromatin), A. strigosa pITS (internal transcribed spacer of rDNA) and the wheat rDNA probes pTa71 (nucleolus organizer region or NOR) and pTa794 (5S). Simultaneous and sequential FISH employing pairs of these probes allowed the identification and genome assignation of all chromosomes. FISH mapping using mitotic and meiotic metaphases facilitated the genomic and chromosomal identification of the monosome in each line. Of the 17 'Sun II' lines analyzed, 13 distinct monosomic lines were found, corresponding to four monosomes of the A-genome, five of the C-genome and four of the D-genome. In addition, 12 distinct monosomic lines were detected among the 20 'Kanota' lines examined, corresponding to six monosomes of the A-genome, three of the C-genome and three of the D-genome. The results show that 19 chromosomes out of 21 of the complement are represented by monosomes between the two genetic backgrounds. The identity of the remaining chromosomes can be deduced either from one intergenomic translocation detected on both 'Sun II' and 'Kanota' lines, or from the single reciprocal, intergenomic translocation detected among the 'Sun II' lines. These results permit a new system to be proposed for numbering the 21 chromosome pairs of the hexaploid oat complement. Accordingly, the A-genome contains chromosomes 8A, 11A, 13A, 15A, 16A, 17A and 19A; the C-genome contains chromosomes 1C, 2C, 3C, 4C, 5C, 6C and 7C; and the D-genome consists of chromosomes 9D, 10D, 12D, 14D, 18D, 20D and 21D. Moreover, the FISH patterns of 16 chromosomes in 'Sun II' and 15 in 'Kanota' suggest that these chromosomes could be involved in intergenomic translocations. By comparing the identities of individually translocated chromosomes in the two hexaploid species with those of other hexaploids, we detected different types of intergenomic translocations."

The Gc chromosome induced chromosomal structural rearrangements in the progeny of the 4H addition line of common wheat carrying the monosomic Gc chromosome. We conducted in situ hybridization to select plants carrying rearranged 4H chromosomes and characterized the rearranged chromosomes by sequential C-banding and in situ hybridization. We established 60 dissection lines of common wheat carrying single rearranged 4H chromosomes. The rearranged 4H chromosomes had either a deletion or a translocation or a complicated structural change. The breakpoints were distributed in the short arm, centromere and the long arm at a rough ratio of 2:2:1. We conducted PCR analysis using the dissection lines and 93 EST markers specific to chromosome 4H. Based on the PCR result, we constructed a cytological map of chromosome 4H with 18 regions separated by the breakpoints of the rearranged chromosomes. Thirty-seven markers were present in the short arm and 56 in the long arm, and about 70% of the markers were present in no more than the distal 25.6% and 43.1% regions of the short and long arms, respectively. It is noteworthy that nine of the short-arm markers and 13 of the long-arm markers existed in the small subtelomeric regions at both ends characterized by the HvT01 sequences. We reconstructed a genetic map using 38 of the 93 markers that was used to construct the cytological map of chromosome 4H. The order of the markers on the genetic map was almost the same as that on the cytological map.

Gc genes kill the gametes without themselves by causing chromosomal breakage during post-meiotic cell divisions, and therefore are strong segregation distorters. The Gc gene Gc3-C1 derived from chromosome 3C of Ae. triuncialis (2n = 4x = 28, CCUU) induces chromosomal breakage in wheat cultivar 'Chinese Spring' (CS) but not in cultivar 'Norin 26' (N26). This cultivar-specific inhibition of Gc function is caused by a suppressor gene Igc1 located on chromosome 3B of N26. Igc1 is presumed to be a modified Gc gene without breakage function because of its homoeology to Gc3-C1. Here we report the results of linkage and physical mapping of Igc1 to help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying Gc action. Segregation analysis of the phenotypic data in BC(1)F(1) mapping population of the cross between (CSxN26)F(1) and CS + 3C&quot; showed a 1:1 segregation ratio indicating that Igc1 is a dominant gene. In the linkage analysis, three molecular marker loci Xgwm285, Xgwm376, and Xcfp1886 cosegregated with the Igc1 locus. Bin mapping assigned the loci Xgwm285 and Xcfp1886 to bin C-3BS1-0.33 and Xgwm376 to bin C-3BL2-0.22. Physical mapping using Gc-induced chromosomal deletion lines of chromosome 3B of N26 revealed that the Igc1 locus resides in 52.0% or 2.1% of bins C-3BS1-0.33 and C-3BL2-0.22, respectively. Pericentromeric localization of Igc1 in chromosome 3B of N26 may have a positive effect to keep the two-component system of the Gc action. Map-based cloning approach to isolate the Igc1 may be difficult because recombination is depleted in the pericentromeric region. As is shown in this study, the combination of genetic and physical mapping offers high efficiency to identify the regions where genes are located especially in regions with low levels of recombination."

Cohesin also has important roles in gene regulation, but the mechanistic basis of this function is poorly understood. In mammalian genomes, cohesin co-localizes with CCCTC binding factor (CTCF), a zinc finger protein implicated in multiple gene regulatory events. At the imprinted IGF2-H19 locus, CTCF plays an important role in organizing allele-specific higher-order chromatin conformation and functions as an enhancer blocking transcriptional insulator. Here we have used chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays and RNAi-mediated depletion of cohesin to address whether cohesin affects higher order chromatin conformation at the IGF2-H19 locus in human cells. Our data show that cohesin has a critical role in maintaining CTCF-mediated chromatin conformation at the locus and that disruption of this conformation coincides with changes in IGF2 expression. We show that the cohesin-dependent, higher-order chromatin conformation of the locus exists in both G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle and is therefore independent of cohesin's function in sister chromatid cohesion. We propose that cohesin can mediate interactions between DNA molecules in cis to insulate genes through the formation of chromatin loops, analogous to the cohesin mediated interaction with sister chromatids in trans to establish cohesion."

Here we induced site-specific DSBs in yeast cells and monitored chromatin dynamics surrounding the DSB using Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C). We find that formation of a DSB within G1 cells is not sufficient to alter chromosome dynamics. However, DSBs formed within an asynchronous cell population result in large decreases in both intra- and interchromosomal interactions. Using live cell microscopy, we find that changes in chromosome dynamics correlate with relocalization of the DSB to the nuclear periphery. Sequestration to the periphery requires the nuclear envelope protein, Mps3p, and Mps3p-dependent tethering delays recombinational repair of a DSB and enhances gross chromosomal rearrangements. Furthermore, we show that components of the telomerase machinery are recruited to a DSB and that telomerase recruitment is required for its peripheral localization. Based on these findings, we propose that sequestration of unrepaired or slowly repaired DSBs to the nuclear periphery reflects a competition between alternative repair pathways."

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae heterochromatic loci, including telomeres and silent mating type loci, form clusters at the nuclear periphery. We have employed live cell 3-D imaging and chromosome conformation capture (3C) to determine the contribution of nuclear positioning and heterochromatic factors in mediating associations of the silent mating type loci. We identify specific long-range interactions between HML and HMR that are dependent upon silencing proteins Sir2p, Sir3p, and Sir4p as well as Sir1p and Esc2p, two proteins involved in establishment of silencing. Although clustering of these loci frequently occurs near the nuclear periphery, colocalization can occur equally at more internal positions and is not affected in strains deleted for membrane anchoring proteins yKu70p and Esc1p. In addition, appropriate nucleosome assembly plays a role, as deletion of ASF1 or combined disruption of the CAF-1 and HIR complexes abolishes the HML-HMR interaction. Further, silencer proteins are required for clustering, but complete loss of clustering in asf1 and esc2 mutants had only minor effects on silencing. Our results indicate that formation of heterochromatic clusters depends on correctly assembled heterochromatin at the silent loci and, in addition, identify an Asf1p-, Esc2p-, and Sir1p-dependent step in heterochromatin formation that is not essential for gene silencing but is required for long-range interactions."

Whole genome ChIP methods have enjoyed much success, but are limited in that they cannot uncover important long-range chromatin interactions. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) and related methods are capable of detecting remote chromatin interactions, but are tedious, have low signal-to-noise ratios, and are not genome-wide. Although the addition of ChIP to 3C (ChIP-3C) would conceivably reduce noise and increase specificity for chromatin interaction detection, there are concerns that simple mixing of the ChIP and 3C protocols would lead to high levels of false positives. In this essay, we dissect current ChIP- and 3C-based methodologies, discuss the models of specific as opposed to non-specific chromatin interactions, and suggest approaches to separate specific chromatin complexes from non-specific chromatin fragments. We conclude that the combination of sonication-based chromatin fragmentation, ChIP-based enrichment, chromatin proximity ligation and Paired-End Tag ultra-high-throughput sequencing will be a winning implementation for genome-wide, unbiased and de novo discovery of long-range chromatin interactions, which will help to establish an emerging field for studying human chromatin interactomes and genome regulation networks in three-dimensional spaces."

A number of candidate FSHD genes, adenine nucleotide translocator 1 gene (ANT1), FSHD-related gene 1 (FRG1), FRG2 and DUX4c, upstream of the D4Z4 array (FSHD locus), and double homeobox chromosome 4 (DUX4) within the repeat itself, are upregulated in some patients, thus suggesting an underlying perturbation of the chromatin structure. Furthermore, a mouse model overexpressing FRG1 has been generated, displaying skeletal muscle defects.RESULTS: In the context of myogenic differentiation, we compared the chromatin structure and tridimensional interaction of the D4Z4 array and FRG1 gene promoter, and FRG1 expression, in control and FSHD cells. The FRG1 gene was prematurely expressed during FSHD myoblast differentiation, thus suggesting that the number of D4Z4 repeats in the array may affect the correct timing of FRG1 expression. Using chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology, we revealed that the FRG1 promoter and D4Z4 array physically interacted. Furthermore, this chromatin structure underwent dynamic changes during myogenic differentiation that led to the loosening of the FRG1/4q-D4Z4 array loop in myotubes. The FRG1 promoter in both normal and FSHD myoblasts was characterized by H3K27 trimethylation and Polycomb repressor complex binding, but these repression signs were replaced by H3K4 trimethylation during differentiation. The D4Z4 sequences behaved similarly, with H3K27 trimethylation and Polycomb binding being lost upon myogenic differentiation.CONCLUSION: We propose a model in which the D4Z4 array may play a critical chromatin function as an orchestrator of in cis chromatin loops, thus suggesting that this repeat may play a role in coordinating gene expression."

Wnt/beta-catenin signaling stimulates association of the beta-catenin coactivator complex with two Wnt responsive enhancers (WREs) located in close proximity to MYC gene boundaries. Each enhancer directly binds members of the TCF/Lef family of transcription factors that, in turn, recruit beta-catenin. In a previous report, we showed that the downstream MYC enhancer (MYC 3' WRE) cooperated with the upstream enhancer (MYC 5' WRE) to activate expression of a heterologous reporter gene in response to Wnt/beta-catenin and mitogen signaling. Here we use chromatin conformation capture (3C) to show that the MYC 5' and 3' WREs are juxtaposed at the genomic MYC locus during active transcription. This MYC 5'3' chromatin loop is present in HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells that contain high levels of nuclear beta-catenin and is absent in HEK293 cells that contain trace amounts of nuclear beta-catenin. Depletion of functional beta-catenin/TCF complexes blocks formation of the MYC 5'3 chromatin loop. Furthermore, we find that the chromatin loop is absent in quiescent cells, but is rapidly and transiently induced by serum mitogens in a beta-catenin-dependent manner. Thus, we propose that a distinct chromatin architecture coordinated by beta-catenin/TCF-bound WREs accompanies transcriptional activation of MYC gene expression."

Fifty-seven molecularly unsolved BPES patients underwent high-resolution copy number screening and targeted sequencing of CNCs. Apart from three larger distant deletions, a de novo deletion as small as 7.4 kb was found at 283 kb 5' to FOXL2. The deletion appeared to be triggered by an H-DNA-induced double-stranded break (DSB). In addition, it disrupts a novel long non-coding RNA (ncRNA) PISRT1 and 8 CNCs.

Briefly, chromatin is fixed with formaldehyde in vivo to cross-link interacting sites, digested with a restriction enzyme and ligated at a low DNA concentration so that ligation between cross-linked fragments is favored over ligation between random fragments. Ligation products are then analyzed and quantified by PCR. So far, semi-quantitative PCR methods were widely used to estimate the ligation frequencies. However, it is often important to estimate the ligation frequencies more precisely which is only possible by using the real-time PCR. At the same time, it is equally necessary to monitor the specificity of PCR amplification. That is why the real-time PCR with TaqMan probes is becoming more and more popular in 3C studies. In this chapter, we describe the general protocol for 3C analysis with the subsequent estimation of ligation frequencies by using the real-time PCR technology with TaqMan probes. We discuss in details all steps of the experimental procedure paying special attention to weak points and possible ways to solve the problems. A special attention is also paid to the problems in interpretation of the results and necessary control experiments.

An element located within a DNase I-hypersensitive site (DHS) 10 kb into the first intron was previously shown to augment CFTR promoter activity in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we reveal the mechanism by which this element influences CFTR transcription. We employed a high-resolution method of mapping DHS using tiled microarrays to accurately locate the intron 1 DHS. Transfection of promoter-reporter constructs demonstrated that the element displays classical tissue-specific enhancer properties and can independently recruit factors necessary for transcription initiation. In vitro DNase I footprinting analysis identified a protected region that corresponds to a conserved, predicted binding site for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1). We demonstrate by electromobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that HNF1 binds to this element both in vitro and in vivo.

The transcriptional regulation of such a multisubunit, multichromosomal, and bigenomic enzyme is mechanistically challenging. Transcription factories have been proposed as one mechanism by which genes from different genomic loci congregate to transcribe functionally related genes, and chromosome conformation capture (3C) is a means by which such interactions can be revealed. Thus far, however, only loci from the same chromosome or at most two chromosomes have been co-localized by 3C. The present study used 3C to test our hypothesis that not only the 10 genomic loci from nine chromosomes encoding the 10 nuclear subunits of COX, but also genes from three chromosomes encoding mitochondrial transcription factors A and B (Tfam, Tfb1m, and Tfb2m) critical for the transcription of the three mitochondria-encoded COX subunit genes all occupy common intranuclear sites in the murine neuronal nuclei. The pairing of various COX subunit genes and Tf genes indicates that interactions are present among all of them. On the other hand, genes for a non-mitochondrial protein (calreticulin) as well as a mitochondrial enzyme (citrate synthase) did not interact with COX genes. Furthermore, interactions between COX subunit and Tf genes were up-regulated by depolarizing stimulation and down-regulated by impulse blockade in primary neurons. Thus, a viable mechanism is in place for a synchronized, coordinated transcriptional regulation of this multisubunit, bigenomic COX enzyme in neurons."

Using a modification of the chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique, we examined long-range chromatin interactions of the imprinted human IGF2 gene. We demonstrate that numerous intrachromosomal interactions occur along both parental alleles in normal tissues, where the IGF2 is paternally expressed, as well as in normal liver where gene expression is biallelic. Long-range and allele-specific interactions occur between the IGF2/H19 imprinting control region-1 (ICR1) and ICR2, a region which regulates an imprinted gene cluster nearly a megabase distant from IGF2. Loss of genomic imprinting is a common epigenetic event in cancer, and long-range interactions have not been examined in malignant cells. In cancer cell lines in which IGF2 imprinting is maintained (MOI), essentially all of the 3C interactions seen in normal cells were preserved. However, in cells in which IGF2 imprinting was lost (LOI), nearly all of the long-range chromatin interactions involving IGF2 were abrogated. A three-dimensional computer model depicts the physical interactions between the IGF2 promoter and ICR1 in MOI cells, while the model of LOI lung cancer cells is flattened with few long-range interactions. This dramatic change in the three-dimension configuration of the chromatin at the IGF2 locus in LOI cancer cells suggests that the loss of imprinting may lead to a variety of changes in gene expression in addition to changes in IGF2 transcription."

On a global scale, its function is evident in processes like metaphase and chromosome segregation. On a detailed level, long-range interactions between regulatory elements and promoters are essential for proper gene regulation. Microscopic techniques like FISH can detect chromatin contacts, although the resolution is generally low making detection of enhancer-promoter interaction difficult. The 3C methodology allows for high-resolution analysis of chromatin interactions. 3C is now widely used and has revealed that long-range looping interactions between genomic elements are widespread. However, studying chromatin interactions in large genomic regions by 3C is very labor intensive. This limitation is overcome by the 5C technology. 5C is an adaptation of 3C, in which the concurrent use of thousands of primers permits the simultaneous detection of millions of chromatin contacts. The design of the 5C primers is critical because this will determine which and how many chromatin interactions will be examined in the assay. Starting material for 5C is a 3C template. To make a 3C template, chromatin interactions in living cells are cross-linked using formaldehyde. Next, chromatin is digested and subsequently ligated under conditions favoring ligation events between cross-linked fragments. This yields a genome-wide 3C library of ligation products representing all chromatin interactions in vivo. 5C then employs multiplex ligation-mediated amplification to detect, in a single assay, up to millions of unique ligation products present in the 3C library. The resulting 5C library can be analyzed by microarray analysis or deep sequencing. The observed abundance of a 5C product is a measure of the interaction frequency between the two corresponding chromatin fragments.

LNO2 (nitrolinoleic acid) induces expression of HO-1 (haem oxygenase-1), an enzyme that catabolizes haem into products exhibiting potent anti-inflammatory properties. In the present manuscript, the molecular mechanisms underlying HO-1 induction by LNO2 were examined in HAEC (human aortic endothelial cells), HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney 293) cells, and in transcription factor-deficient MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblasts). LNO2 induced HO-1 expression in Nrf2 [NF-E2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2)-related factor 2]-deficient MEF and in HEK-293 cells transfected with Nrf2-specific shRNA (small-hairpin RNA), supporting the fact that LNO2-mediated HO-1 induction can be regulated by Nrf2-independent mechanisms. LNO2 activated expression of a -4.5 kb human HO-1 promoter construct, whereas a -4.0 kb construct with deletion of 500 bp from the 5' region was unresponsive. Site-directed mutagenesis of a CRE (cAMP-response element) or of a downstream NF-E2/AP-1 (activating protein-1) element, individually, within this 500 bp region modestly reduced activation of the HO-1 promoter by LNO2. Mutations of both the CRE and the NF-E2/AP-1 site also attenuated LNO2-mediated HO-1 promoter expression, whereas the addition of a third mutation in the proximal E-box sequence completely abolished LNO2-induced HO-1 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed CREB (CRE-binding protein)-1 binding to the CRE (located at -4.0 kb) and E-box regions (located at -44 bp) of the human HO-1 promoter. A 3C (Chromosome Conformation Capture) assay of intact cells showed LNO2-induced interactions between the CRE- and E-box- containing regions. These observations indicate that regulation of human HO-1 expression by LNO2 requires synergy between CRE, AP-1 and E-box sequences and involves the participation of CREB-1."

On the linear chromatin template these elements can be located hundreds of kilobases away from their target gene and for a long time it was a mystery how these elements communicate. For example, in the beta-globin locus the main regulatory element, the Locus Control Region (LCR), is located up to 40-60 kb away from the beta-globin genes. Recently it was demonstrated that the LCR resides in close proximity to the active beta-globin genes while the intervening inactive chromatin loops out. Thus the chromatin fibre of the beta-globin locus adopts an erythroid-specific spatial organization referred to as the Active Chromatin Hub (ACH). This observation for the first time demonstrated a role for chromatin folding in transcriptional regulation. Since this first observation in the beta-globin locus, similar chromatin interactions between regulatory elements in several other gene loci have been observed. Chromatin loops also appear to be formed between promoters and 3'UTRs of genes and even trans-interactions between loci on different chromosomes have been reported. Although the occurrence of long-range chromatin contacts between regulatory elements is now firmly established it is still not clear how these long-range contacts are set up and how the transcriptional output of genes is modified by the proximity of cis-regulatory DNA elements. In this review I will discuss the relevance of interactions between cis-regulatory DNA elements in relation to transcription while using the beta-globin locus as a guideline."

It is flanked by two genes ASZ1 [ankyrin repeat, SAM (sterile alpha-motif) and basic leucine zipper] and CTTNBP2 (cortactin-binding protein 2), which have very different expression profiles. CFTR is expressed primarily in specialized epithelial cells, whereas ASZ1 is transcribed exclusively in the testis and ovary, and CTTNBP2 is highly expressed in the brain, kidney and pancreas, with lower levels of expression in other tissues. Despite its highly regulated pattern of expression, the promoter of the CFTR gene apparently lacks the necessary elements to achieve this. We previously suggested that cis-acting regulatory elements elsewhere in the locus, both flanking the gene and within introns, were required to co-ordinate regulated, tissue-specific expression of CFTR. We identified a number of crucial elements, including enhancer-blocking insulators flanking the locus, intronic tissue-specific enhancers and also characterized some of the interacting proteins. We recently employed a high-resolution method of mapping DHS (DNase I-hypersensitive sites) using tiled microarrays. DHS are often associated with regulatory elements and use of this technique generated cell-specific profiles of potential regulatory sequences in primary cells and cell lines. We characterized a set of cis-acting elements within the CFTR locus and demonstrated direct physical interaction between them and the CFTR promoter, by chromosome conformation capture (3C). These results provide the first insight into the three-dimensional structure of the active CFTR gene."

Here, we have mapped the ends of the loop domain that contains the Ifng (interferon-gamma) gene in primary and cultured murine T-lymphocytes. To determine whether the ends of the loop are located in close proximity to each other in the nuclear space, the 3C (chromosome conformation capture) technique, which detects protein-mediated DNA-DNA interactions, was utilized. A strong interaction was demonstrated between the two ends of the loop, which were close enough to become cross-linked in vivo in the presence of paraformaldehyde. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with the 3C technique demonstrated that topoisomerase IIalpha and MeCP2, but not topoisomerase IIbeta, heterochromatin-associated protein HP1 or CTCF, were involved in this interaction. The present findings have important implications in terms of mechanisms of illegitimate recombination that can result in chromosomal translocations and deletions."

We have previously shown that IL-1beta-induced lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (Lef1) regulates the transcription of its target genes COX2 and MMP13 in mouse chondrocytes by binding to the Lef1 binding sites located in the 3' region. In this study, we investigated how the 3' region-bound Lef1 regulates expression of target genes. IL-1beta stimulation induced gene looping in COX2 and MMP13 genomic loci, which is mediated by the physical interaction of Lef1 with its binding partners, including beta-catenin, AP-1, and NF-kappaB. As shown by chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay, the 5' and 3' genomic regions of these genes were juxtaposed in an IL-1beta-stimulation dependent manner. Lef1 played a pivotal role in this gene looping; Lef1 knockdown decreased the incidence of gene looping, while Lef1 overexpression induced it. Physical interactions between the 3' region-bound Lef1 and promoter-bound transcription factors AP-1 or NF-kappaB in COX2 and MMP13, respectively, were increased upon stimulation, leading to synergistic up-regulation of gene expression. Knockdown of RelA or c-Jun decreased the formation of gene loop and down-regulated cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) or matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) transcription levels. However, overexpression of RelA or c-Jun along with Lef1 increased the looping and their expression levels. Our results indicate a novel function of Lef1, as a mediator of gene looping between 5' and 3' regions. Gene looping may serve to delineate the transcription unit in the inducible gene transcription of mammalian cells."

We report DNase I and micrococcal nuclease hypersensitivity, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses for histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, and 3C (chromatin conformation capture) assays of the normal and mutant beta-globin loci, which demonstrate that nucleosomes at the DNase I hypersensitive sites of the LCR could be either depleted or retained depending on the stages of development. Furthermore, MNase sensitivity and 3C assays suggest that the LCR chromatin is more open in embryonic erythroblasts than in definitive erythroblasts at the primary- and secondary-structure levels; however, the LCR chromatin is packaged more tightly in embryonic erythroblasts than in definitive erythroblasts at the tertiary chromatin level. Our study provides the first evidence that the occupancy of nucleosomes at a DNase I hypersensitive site is a developmental stage-related event and that embryonic and adult cells possess distinct chromatin structures of the LCR."

These unique ligation products (ULPs) are typically quantified by gel-based methods, which are practically inefficient. Taqman probes may be used, but are expensive. Cycle threshold (Ct) determined using SYBR Green, an inexpensive alternative, is hampered by non-specific products and/or background fluorescence, both due to high template/ULP ratio. SYBR Green melting curve analysis (MCA) is a well-known qualitative tool for assessing PCR specificity. Here we present for the first time MCA as a quantitative tool (qMCA) to compare template concentrations across different samples and apply it to 3C to assess looping among remote elements identified by STAT1 and IRF1 ChIP-chip at the interferon-gamma responsive CIITA and SOCS1 loci. This rapid, inexpensive approach provided highly reproducible identification and quantification of ULPs over a significant linear range. Therefore, qMCA is a robust method to assess chromatin looping in vivo, and overcomes several drawbacks associated with other approaches.

The oocytes were then reconstructed by fusion of one karyoplast with 1, 2, 3 or 4 cytoplasts (K + 1C, K + 2C, K + 3C and K + 4C, respectively). Reconstructed oocytes, karyoplasts without fusion of any cytoplast (K) and zona-free M-II oocytes (control) were used for experiments. The rates of female pronucleus formation after parthenogenetic activation in all groups of reconstructed oocytes (58.2-77.4%) were not different from those of the K and control groups (58.2% and 66.0%, respectively). In vitro fertilization was carried out to assay the fertilization ability and subsequent embryonic development of the reconstructed oocytes. The cytoplast : karyoplast ratio did not affect the fertilization status (penetration and male pronuclear formation rates) of the oocytes. A significantly high monospermy rate was found in K oocytes (p &lt; 0.05, 61.6%) compared with the other groups (18.2-32.8%). Blastocyst formation rates increased significantly as the number of the cytoplasts fused with karyoplasts increased (p &lt; 0.05, 0.0-15.3%). The blastocyst rate in the K + 4C group (15.3%) was comparable with that of the control (17.8%). Total cell numbers in both the K + 3C and K + 4C groups (16.0 and 15.3 cells, respectively) were comparable with that of the control (26.2 cells). Our results demonstrate that a serial centrifugation and fusion (Centri-Fusion) is an effective method for producing M-II chromosome transferred oocytes with normal fertilization ability and in vitro development. It is suggested that the number of cytoplasts fused with a karyoplast plays a critical role in embryonic development."

Analysis of chromatin in vitro has suggested that under near physiological conditions chromatin fibers can become highly compact and that the level of compaction can be modulated by histone modifications. However, less is known about the organization of chromatin fibers in living cells. Here, we combine chromosome conformation capture (3C) data with distance measurements and polymer modeling to determine the in vivo mass density of a transcriptionally active 95-kb GC-rich domain on chromosome III of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to previous reports, we find that yeast does not form a compact fiber but that chromatin is extended with a mass per unit length that is consistent with a rather loose arrangement of nucleosomes. Analysis of 3C data from a neighboring AT-rich chromosomal domain indicates that chromatin in this domain is more compact, but that mass density is still well below that of a canonical 30 nm fiber. Our approach should be widely applicable to scale 3C data to real spatial dimensions, which will facilitate the quantification of the effects of chromatin modifications and transcription on chromatin fiber organization."

Recently developed 3C and 4C technology allowed us to test the importance of transcription for nuclear architecture. We demonstrate that upon transcription inhibition binding of RNA polymerase II to gene regulatory elements is severely reduced. However, contacts between regulatory DNA elements and genes in the beta-globin locus are unaffected and the locus still interacts with the same genomic regions elsewhere on the chromosome. This is a general phenomenon since the great majority of intra- and interchromosomal interactions with the ubiquitously expressed Rad23a gene are also not affected. Our data demonstrate that without transcription the organization and modification of nucleosomes at active loci and the local binding of specific trans-acting factors is unaltered. We propose that these parameters, more than transcription or RNA polymerase II binding, determine the maintenance of long-range DNA interactions."

Regulatory elements can act at large genomic distances by engaging in direct physical interactions with their target genes resulting in the formation of chromatin loops. Thus, genes and their regulatory elements come in close spatial proximity irrespective of their relative genomic positions. Analysis of interactions between genes and elements will reveal which elements regulate each gene, and will provide fundamental insights into the spatial organization of chromosomes in general. Long-range cis- and trans- interactions can be studied at high resolution using chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology. 3C employs formaldehyde crosslinking to trap physical interactions between loci located throughout the genome. Crosslinked cells are solubilized and chromatin is digested with a restriction enzyme. Chromatin is subsequently ligated under conditions that favor intramolecular ligation. After reversal of the crosslinks, the DNA is purified and interaction frequencies between specific chromosomal loci are determined by quantifying the amounts of corresponding ligation products using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Here, we examine the role of higher order chromatin structure across the 100-kb region of the mouse X-inactivation center (Xic) and map domains of specialized chromatin in vivo. By hypersensitive site mapping and chromosome conformation capture (3C), we identify two domains of higher order chromatin structure. Xite makes looping interactions with Tsix, while Xist makes contacts with Jpx/Enox, another non-coding gene not previously implicated in XCI. These regions interact in a developmentally-specific and sex-specific manner that is consistent with a regulatory role in XCI. We propose that dynamic changes in three-dimensional architecture leads to formation of separate chromatin hubs in Tsix and Xist that together regulate the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation."
"18727509";"3C";"(3C AND chromosome)";"Adv Exp Med Biol";24;2008;"Deregulation of the centrosome cycle and the origin of chromosomal instability in cancer.";"Although we have begun to tap into the mechanisms behind Boveri's initial observation that supernumerary centrosomes cause chromosome missegregation in sea urchin eggs, there is still much left to discover with regard to chromosomal instability in cancer. Many of the molecular players involved in regulation of the centrosome and cell cycles, and the coupling of the two cycles to produce a bipolar mitotic spindle have been identified. One theme that has become apparent is that cross talk and interrelatedness of the pathways serve to provide redundant mechanisms to maintain genomic integrity. In spite of this, cells occasionally fall prey to insults that initiate and maintain the chromosomal instability that results in viable malignant tumours. Deregulation of centrosome structure is an integral aspect of the origin of chromosomal instability in many cancers. There are numerous routes to centrosome amplification including: environmental insults such as ionising radiation and exposure to estrogen (Li et al., 2005); failure of cytokinesis; and activating mutations in key regulators of centrosome structure and function. There are two models for initiation of centrosome amplification (Figure 2). In the first, centrosome duplication and chromosome replication remain coupled and cells enter G2 with 4N chromosomes and duplicated centrosomes. However, these cells may fail to complete mitosis, and thus reenter G1 as tetraploid cells with amplified centrosomes. In the second, the centrosome cycle is uncoupled from chromosome replication and cells go through one or more rounds of centriole/centrosome duplication in the absence of chromosome replication. If these cells then go through chromosome replication accompanied by another round of centrosome duplication, cells complete G2 with 4N chromosomes and more than 2 centrosomes, and therefore are predisposed to generate multipolar mitotic spindles. Fragmentation of centrosomes due to ionising radiation is a variation of the second model. Once centrosome amplification is present, even in a diploid cell, that cell has the potential to yield viable aneuploid progeny. The telophase cell in Figure 3C illustrates this scenario. In a normal telophase configuration, the total number of chromosomes is 92 (resulting from the segregation of 46 pairs of chromatids), with each daughter nucleus containing 46 individual chromosomes. Based on the number of kinetochore signals present, the lower nucleus in Figure 3C has approximately 28 chromosomes, and the elongate upper nucleus has approximately 60, for a total of 88. Due to superimposition of kinetochores in this maximum projection image, 88 is an underestimate of the actual number of kinetochores and is not significantly different from the expected total of 92. A cell resulting from the lower nucleus with only around 28 chromosomes would probably not be viable, much as Boveri's experiments indicated. However, the upper nucleus with at least 60 chromosomes could be viable. This cell would enter G1 as hypotriploid (69 chromosomes = triploid) with 2 centrosomes. During S and G2, the centrosomes and chromosomes would double, and the following mitosis could be tetrapolar with a 6N chromosome content. When centrosome amplification is accompanied by permissive lapses in cell cycle checkpoints, the potential for malignant growth is present. These lapses could result from specific genetic mutations and amplifications, epigenetic gene silencing, or from massive chromosomal instability caused by the centrosome amplification. Centrosome amplification, therefore, can serve to exacerbate and/or generate genetic instabilities associated with cancers."

As several recent reports document, this limitation has been overcome by exploiting a circular intermediate in a variant of the 3C method, termed 4C (for circular 3C). The strategic positioning of primers within the bait enables the identification of unknown interacting sequences, which form part of the circular DNA. Here, we describe a protocol for our 4C method, which produces a high-resolution interaction map potentially suitable for the analysis of cis-regulatory elements and for comparison with chromatin marks obtained by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip at the sites of interaction.

To study the conformation of this imprint switch, we performed a systematic structural analysis across the 140 kb of the mouse Igf2-H19 region, which includes enhancers located both between the two genes as well as downstream of H19, by using a scanning chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique. Our results suggest that on the active paternal Igf2 allele, the various enhancers have direct access to the Igf2 promoters, whereas the imprinted silent maternal Igf2 allele assumes a complex three-dimensional knotted loop that keeps the enhancers away from the Igf2 promoters and allows them to interact with the H19 promoter. This complex DNA looping of the maternal allele is formed by interactions involving differentially methylated region 1, the ICR, and enhancers. Binding of CTC-binding factor to the maternal, unmethylated ICR in conjunction with the presence of multicomplex components including interchromosomal interactions, create a barrier blocking the access of all enhancers to Igf2, thereby silencing the maternal Igf2. This silencing configuration exists in newborn liver, mouse embryonic fibroblast, and embryonic stem cells and persists during mitosis, conferring a mechanism for epigenetic memory."

In Plastic mice, where the DNA-binding region of Ikaros is disrupted by a point mutation, there is concomitant marked down-regulation of HBB, and up-regulation of HBG expression. We show for the first time Ikaros and its family member Eos, bind to critical cis elements implicated in haemoglobin switching and deletional hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin (HPFH). Chromatin conformation capture (3C) data demonstrated that Ikaros facilitates long-distance DNA looping between the LCR and a region upstream of HBD. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of stage-specific assembly of the beta-globin ACH, and HPFH."

For larger-scale applications, chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) combines 3C with ligation-mediated amplification (LMA) to simultaneously quantify hundreds of thousands of physical DNA contacts by microarray or ultra-high-throughput DNA sequencing. 5C allows the mapping of extensive networks of physical interactions among large sets of genomic elements throughout the genome. Such networks can provide important biological insights, e.g., by identifying relationships between regulatory elements and their target genes. This unit describes 5C for large-scale analysis of cis- and trans-chromatin interactions in mammalian cells."

Real-time PCR with TaqMan probes was employed to estimate the frequencies of cross-linking of different restriction fragments within the domain. In differentiated cultured erythroblasts and in 10-day chick embryo erythrocytes expressing 'adult' alpha(A) and alpha(D) globin genes the following elements of the domain were found to form an 'active' chromatin hub: upstream Major Regulatory Element (MRE), -9 kb upstream DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS), -4 kb upstream CpG island, alpha(D) gene promoter and the downstream enhancer. The alpha(A) gene promoter was not present in the 'active' chromatin hub although the level of alpha(A) gene transcription exceeded that of the alpha(D) gene. Formation of the 'active' chromatin hub was preceded by the assembly of multiple incomplete hubs containing MRE in combination with either -9 kb DHS or other regulatory elements of the domain. These incomplete chromatin hubs were present in proliferating cultured erythroblasts which did not express globin genes. In lymphoid cells only the interaction between the alpha(D) promoter and the CpG island was detected."

Primary failure of tooth eruption (PFE) is associated with several syndromes primarily affecting skeletal development, but it is also known as a nonsyndromic autosomal-dominant condition. Teeth in the posterior quadrants of the upper and lower jaw are preferentially affected and usually result in an open bite extending from anterior to posterior. In this study, we show that familial, nonsyndromic PFE is caused by heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the G protein-coupled receptor for parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHR1). Three distinct mutations, namely c.1050-3C &gt; G, c.543+1G &gt; A, and c.463G &gt; T, were identified in 15 affected individuals from four multiplex pedigrees. All mutations truncate the mature protein and therefore should lead to a functionless receptor, strongly suggesting that haplo-insufficiency of PTHR1 is the underlying cause of nonsyndromic PFE. Although complete inactivation of PTHR1 is known to underlie the autosomal-recessive Blomstrand osteochondrodysplasia (BOCD), a lethal form of short-limbed dwarfism, our data now imply that dominantly acting PTHR1 mutations that lead to haplo-insufficiency of the receptor result in a nonsyndromic phenotype affecting tooth development with high penetrance and variable expressivity."

All affected individuals presented with typical, clinical and radiographic features of DGI-II, but without bilateral progressive high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. To investigate the mutated molecule, a positional candidate approach was used to determine the mutated gene in this family. Genomic DNA was obtained from 24 affected individuals, 18 unaffected relatives of the family and 50 controls. Haplotype analysis was performed using leukocyte DNA for 6 short tandem repeat (STR) markers present in chromosome 4 (D4S1534, GATA62A11, DSPP, DMP1, SPP1 and D4S1563). In the critical region between D4S1534 and DMP1, the dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) gene (OMIM *125485) was considered as the strongest candidate gene. The first four exons and exon/intron boundaries of the gene were analyzed using DNA from 24 affected individuals and 18 unaffected relatives of the same family. DNA sequencing revealed a heterozygous deletion mutation in intron 2 (at positions -3 to -25), which resulted in a frameshift mutation, that changed the acceptor site sequence from CAG to AAG (IVS2-3C--&gt;A) and may also have disrupted the branch point consensus sequence in intron 2. The mutation was found in the 24 affected individuals, but not in the 18 unaffected relatives and 50 controls. The deletion was identified by allele-specific sequencing and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis. We conclude that the heterozygous deletion mutation contributed to the pathogenesis of DGI-II."

DNA binding proteins may play an important role in the looping formation. NF-E2 is one of the key transcription factors in beta-globin gene transcriptional activation. To shed light on whether NF-E2 is involved in this process, DS19MafKsiRNA cell pools were established by specifically knocked down the expression of MafK/NF-E2 p18, one subunit of NF-E2 heterodimer. In the above cell pools, it was observed that the occupancy efficiency of NF-E2 on beta-globin gene locus and the expression level of beta-globin genes were decreased. H3 acetylation, H3-K4 methylation and the deposition of RNA polymerase II, but not the recruitment of GATA-1, were also found reduced at the beta-globin gene cluster. Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) assay showed that the cross-linking frequency between the main NF-E2 binding site HS2 and downstream structural genes was reduced compared to the normal cell.

Subsets of lines were grown in up to six environments. An indirect analysis method was applied, in which the total genetic effect was first partitioned into G and GE by using the mixed linear-model approach, and then QTL (quantitative trait locus) analyses on these effects were conducted separately. At least 18 QTLs for PN in rice were detected and identified on 9 of 12 rice chromosomes. A single QTL effect (a + ae) ranging from -1.5 to 1.2 was divided into two components, additive effect (a) and additive x environment interaction effect (ae). A total number of 9 and 16 QTLs were identified with a ranging from -0.4 to 0.6 and ae ranging from -1.0 to 0.6, respectively, the former being stable but the latter unstable across environments. Three types of QTLs were suggested according to their effects expressed. Two QTLs (Pn-1b and Pn-6d) expressed stably across environments due to the association with only a, nine QTLs (Pn-1a, Pn-3c, Pn-3d, Pn-4, Pn-6a, Pn-6b, Pn-8, Pn-9 and Pn-12) with only ae were unstable, and the remaining seven of QTLs were identified with both a and ae, which also were unstable across environments. This is the first report on the detection of QE (QTL-by-environment interaction effect) of QTLs with SSSLs. Our results illustrate the efficiency of characterizing QTLs and analyzing action of QTLs through SSSLs, and further demonstrate that QE is an important property of many QTLs.

The use of human whole-chromosome painting probes to detect regions of homology in the karyotypes of the rodent index species, the mouse and rat, has been hindered by the highly rearranged nature of their genomes. In contrast, recent studies have demonstrated that non-murid rodents display more conserved genomes, underscoring their suitability for comparative genomic and higher-order systematic studies. Here we provide the first comparative chromosome maps between human and representative rodents of three major rodent lineages Castoridae, Pedetidae and Dipodidae. A comprehensive analysis of these data and those published for Sciuridae show (1) that Castoridae, Pedetidae and Dipodidae form a monophyletic group, and (2) that the European beaver Castor fiber (Castoridae) and the birch mouse Sicista betulina (Dipodidae) are sister species to the exclusion of the springhare Pedetes capensis (Pedetidae), thus resolving an enduring trifurcation in rodent higher-level systematics. Our results together with published data on the Sciuridae allow the formulation of a putative rodent ancestral karyotype (2n = 50) that is thought to comprise the following 26 human chromosomal segments and/or segmental associations: HSA1pq, 1q/10p, 2pq, 2q, 3a, 3b/19p, 3c/21, 4b, 5, 6, 7a, 7b/16p, 8p/4a/8p, 8q, 9/11, 10q, 12a/22a, 12b/22b, 13, 14/15, 16q/19q, 17, 18, 20, X and Y.

In rabbit uterine epithelial cells, RUSH-1alpha (113 kDa) is the progesterone-dependent splice variant and RUSH-1beta (95 kDa) is the oestrogen-dependent splice variant. Rabbit RUSH/SMARCA3 mRNA is primarily regulated at the proximal promoter (-162/+90) via a PRE (progesterone-response element) half-site/overlapping Y-box domain (-38/-26) and two Sp (specificity protein) 3 sites centred at -128 and -58. We investigated hormone regulation by exploring binding of transcription factors to a putative RUSH/SMARCA3 site (-616/-611) and the distal Sp3 (-131/-126) site. In response to progesterone, RUSH-1alpha binds the RUSH site and the Sp3 site becomes a functional binding site for Egr-1 (early growth-response gene product 1)/Sp (specificity protein)1/3/MAZ (Myc-associated zinc-finger protein)/MZF1 (myeloid zinc finger 1)/c-Rel. TransSignal TF-TF Interaction Arrays, supershift assays and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) analyses confirmed strong physical interactions between RUSH and Egr-1/c-Rel. Higher-order long-range interactions between RUSH and the Egr-1/c-Rel derivative of the anisotropic flexibility of the intervening DNA sequence were shown with 3C (chromosome conformation capture) assays. Transient transfection assays with mutant constructs showed the co-operative interaction between RUSH and Egr-1 mediates repression by c-Rel. Thus DNA-bound RUSH/SMARCA3 communicates with its own proximal promoter by looping the intervening DNA. Moreover, progesterone-dependent DNA looping is an adjunct to progesterone induction of the RUSH/SMARCA3 gene because the availability of RUSH isoforms and relevant binding partners is progesterone-regulated."

Here, we have analyzed the role of 5'HS5 in the three dimensional organization of the beta-gene locus using the Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) technique. The results show that when 5'HS5 is deleted from the locus, both remote and internal regulatory elements are still able to interact with each other in a three-dimensional configuration termed the Active Chromatin Hub. Thus, the absence of 5'HS5 does not have an appreciable effect on the three dimensional organization of the beta-globin locus. This rules out models in which 5'HS5 nucleates interactions with remote and/or internal regulatory elements. We also determined the binding of CTCF, the only defined insulator protein in mammalian cells, to 5'HS5 by using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We detect low levels of CTCF binding to 5'HS5 in primitive erythroid cells, in which it functions as a border element. Surprisingly, we also observe binding levels of CTCF to 5'HS5 in definitive erythroid cells. Thus, binding of CTCF to 5'HS5 per se does not render it a functional border element. This is consistent with the previous data suggesting that CTCF has dual functionality."

The widely used chromatin conformation capture (3C) assay allows determination of the in vivo structural organization of an active endogenous locus. However, unpredicted chromatin associations within a given genomic locus can not be identified by 3C. Here, we describe a new strategy, quantitative associated chromatin trap (QACT), which incorporates a modified 3C method and a quantitative assay tool, to capture and quantitatively analyzes all possible associated chromatin partners (ACPs) of a given chromatin fragment. Using QACT, we have analyzed the chromatin conformation of the mouse alpha-globin gene cluster and proved the extensive interaction between HS26 and alpha-globin genes. In addition, we have identified a candidate alpha1-globin gene specific silencer 475A8 which shows the differentiation-stage specific DNase I hypersensitivity. Functional analysis suggests that 475A8 may regulate the alpha1-globin gene during terminal differentiation of committed erythroid progenitor cells. ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) and cotransfection assays demonstrate that GATA-1, a hemopoietic specific transcriptional factor, may increase alpha1-globin gene expression by suppressing the function of 475A8 in terminally differentiated erythroid cells."

Accurate measurements of crosslinking frequencies require the best quantification techniques. We recently adapted the real-time TaqMan PCR technology to the analysis of 3C assays, resulting in a method that more accurately determines crosslinking frequencies than current semiquantitative 3C strategies that rely on measuring the intensity of ethidium bromide-stained PCR products separated by gel electrophoresis.

As part of the mechanisms involved, PREs are thought to mediate this transcriptional memory function by building up higher-order structures in the nucleus. To address this question, we analysed in vivo the three-dimensional structure of the homeotic locus bithorax complex (BX-C) by combining chromosome conformation capture (3C) with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and FISH immunostaining (FISH-I) analysis. We found that, in the repressed state, all major elements that have been shown to bind PcG proteins, including PREs and core promoters, interact at a distance, giving rise to a topologically complex structure. We show that this structure is important for epigenetic silencing of the BX-C, as we find that major changes in higher-order structures must occur to stably maintain alternative transcription states, whereas histone modification and reduced levels of PcG proteins determine an epigenetic switch that is only partially heritable."

Isochore domains differ in gene expression levels, replication timing, levels of meiotic recombination and chromatin structure. The molecular basis for these differences is poorly understood.RESULTS: We have compared GC- and AT-rich isochores of yeast with respect to chromatin conformation, histone modification status and transcription. Using 3C analysis we show that, along chromosome III, GC-rich isochores have a chromatin structure that is characterized by lower chromatin interaction frequencies compared to AT-rich isochores, which may point to a more extended chromatin conformation. In addition, we find that throughout the genome, GC-rich and AT-rich genes display distinct levels of histone modifications. Interestingly, elimination of the histone deacetylase Rpd3p differentially affects conformation of GC- and AT-rich domains. Further, deletion of RPD3 activates expression of GC-rich genes more strongly than AT-rich genes. Analyses of effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, global patterns of Rpd3p binding and effects of deletion of RPD3 on histone H4 acetylation confirmed that conformation and activity of GC-rich chromatin are more sensitive to Rpd3p-mediated deacetylation than AT-rich chromatin.CONCLUSION: We find that GC-rich and AT-rich chromatin domains display distinct chromatin conformations and are marked by distinct patterns of histone modifications. We identified the histone deacetylase Rpd3p as an attenuator of these base composition-dependent differences in chromatin status. We propose that GC-rich chromatin domains tend to occur in a more active conformation and that Rpd3p activity represses this propensity throughout the genome."

We found that beta-catenin enhanced the expression of a CRP mRNA in concert with p50 subunit. Protein-protein interaction between p50 and beta-catenin was important for CRP expression and their interactions to CRP promoter were induced after TNF-a treatment. Since gene expression depends upon the proximity of promoters and distal regulatory sites, we explored the long-range genomic interaction at the CRP locus by chromosome conformation capture (3C). We identified a binding site for beta-catenin in the downstream of CRP gene by 3C and confirmed TNF-alpha-induced association of beta-catenin and p50 by chromatin immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation assays.

Semi-quantitative PCR was used to analyze the chromosome conformation of the whole human alpha-globin gene locus in fetal liver and fetal brain cells.RESULTS: When HS40 fragment was used as the fixed fragment, in fetal brain cells, the ligation frequencies of HS40 fragment with other fragments were decreased as the linear distances to HS40 fragment were increasing; while in fetal liver cells, two active genes (alpha1 and alpha2) fragments showed higher ligation frequencies with HS40 fragment than other fragments.

The active beta-globin locus in fetal liver preferentially contacts transcribed, but not necessarily tissue-specific, loci elsewhere on chromosome 7, whereas the inactive locus in fetal brain contacts different transcriptionally silent loci. A housekeeping gene in a gene-dense region on chromosome 8 forms long-range contacts predominantly with other active gene clusters, both in cis and in trans, and many of these intra- and interchromosomal interactions are conserved between the tissues analyzed. Our data demonstrate that chromosomes fold into areas of active chromatin and areas of inactive chromatin and establish 4C technology as a powerful tool to study nuclear architecture."

Here we present a high-throughput 3C approach, 3C-Carbon Copy (5C), that employs microarrays or quantitative DNA sequencing using 454-technology as detection methods. We applied 5C to analyze a 400-kb region containing the human beta-globin locus and a 100-kb conserved gene desert region. We validated 5C by detection of several previously identified looping interactions in the beta-globin locus. We also identified a new looping interaction in K562 cells between the beta-globin Locus Control Region and the gamma-beta-globin intergenic region. Interestingly, this region has been implicated in the control of developmental globin gene switching. 5C should be widely applicable for large-scale mapping of cis- and trans- interaction networks of genomic elements and for the study of higher-order chromosome structure."

Using a modification of chromosome conformation capture (3C) and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that one allele of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2)/H19 imprinting control region (ICR) on chromosome 7 colocalized with one allele of Wsb1/Nf1 on chromosome 11. Omission of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) or deletion of the maternal ICR abrogated this association and altered Wsb1/Nf1 gene expression. These findings demonstrate that CTCF mediates an interchromosomal association, perhaps by directing distant DNA segments to a common transcription factory, and the data provide a model for long-range allele-specific associations between gene regions on different chromosomes that suggest a framework for DNA recombination and RNA trans-splicing."

As fibroblasts play an important role in the maintenance of alveolar structure, a change in fibroblast phenotype could be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. In a previous study we found a reduced in vitro proliferation rate and number of population doublings of parenchymal lung fibroblasts from patients with emphysema and we hypothesized that these findings could be related to a premature cellular aging of these cells. In this study, we therefore compared cellular senescence markers and expression of respective genes between lung fibroblasts from patients with emphysema and control patients without COPD.METHODS: Primary lung fibroblasts were obtained from 13 patients with moderate to severe lung emphysema (E) and 15 controls (C) undergoing surgery for lung tumor resection or volume reduction (n = 2). Fibroblasts (8E/9C) were stained for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal). In independent cultures, DNA from lung fibroblasts (7E/8C) was assessed for mean telomere length. Two exploratory 12 k cDNA microarrays were used to assess gene expression in pooled fibroblasts (3E/3C). Subsequently, expression of selected genes was evaluated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in fibroblasts of individual patients (10E/9C) and protein concentration was analyzed in the cell culture supernatant.RESULTS: The median (quartiles) percentage of fibroblasts positive for SA-beta-Gal was 4.4 (3.2;4.7) % in controls and 16.0 (10.0;24.8) % in emphysema (p = 0.001), while telomere length was not different. Among the candidates for differentially expressed genes in the array (factor &gt; or = 3), 15 were upregulated and 121 downregulated in emphysema. qPCR confirmed the upregulation of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 and IGFBP-rP1 (p = 0.029, p = 0.0002), while expression of IGFBP-5, -rP2 (CTGF), -rP4 (Cyr61), FOSL1, LOXL2, OAZ1 and CDK4 was not different between groups. In line with the gene expression we found increased cell culture supernatant concentrations of IGFBP-3 (p = 0.006) in emphysema.CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that premature aging of lung fibroblasts occurs in emphysema, via a telomere-independent mechanism. The upregulation of the senescence-associated IGFBP-3 and -rP1 in emphysema suggests that inhibition of the action of insulin and insulin-like growth factors could be involved in the reduced in vitro-proliferation rate."

The coding sequence is flanked by a 1,144-nucleotide 5' nontranslated leader sequence and a 317-nucleotide 3' nontranslated region, followed by a poly(A) tail. The three major structural proteins, VP1 (44 kDa), VP2 (32 kDa), and VP3 (28 kDa), were identified, and their genes were mapped to the N-terminal section of the polyprotein. The C-terminal part of the polyprotein contains sequence motifs typical of well-characterized picornavirus nonstructural proteins: an RNA helicase, a chymotrypsin-like 3C protease, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The genome organization, capsid morphology, and sequence comparison data indicate that DWV is a member of the recently established genus Iflavirus."

To investigate the roles of hexokinases in rice growth and development, we analyzed rice sequence databases and isolated ten rice hexokinase cDNAs, OsHXK1 (Oryza sativa Hexokinase 1) through OsHXK10. With the exception of the single-exon gene OsHXK1, the OsHXKs all have a highly conserved genomic structure consisting of nine exons and eight introns. Gene expression profiling revealed that OsHXK2 through OsHXK9 are expressed ubiquitously in various organs, whereas OsHXK10 expression is pollen-specific. Sugars induced the expression of three OsHXKs, OsHXK2, OsHXK5, and OsHXK6, in excised leaves, while suppressing OsHXK7 expression in excised leaves and immature seeds. The hexokinase activity of the OsHXKs was confirmed by functional complementation of the hexokinase-deficient yeast strain YSH7.4-3C (hxk1, hxk2, glk1). OsHXK4 was able to complement this mutant only after the chloroplast-transit peptide was removed. The subcellular localization of OsHXK4 and OsHXK7, observed with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs, indicated that OsHXK4 is a plastid-stroma-targeted hexokinase while OsHXK7 localizes to the cytosol."

Such long-range regulation in vivo involves spatial interaction between transcriptional elements, with intervening chromatin looping out. It has been proposed that the clustering of the HS sites of the LCR, the active globin genes, as well as the remote 5' hypersensitive sites (HSs) (HS-60/-62 in mouse, HS-110 in human) and 3'HS1 forms a specific spatial chromatin structure, termed active chromatin hub (ACH). Here we report the effects of the HS3 deletions of the LCR on the spatial chromatin structure of the beta-globin locus as revealed by the chromatin conformation capture (3C) technology. The small HS3 core deletion (0.23 kb), but not the large HS3 deletion (2.3 kb), disrupted the spatial interactions among all the HS sites of the LCR, the beta-globin gene and 3'HS1. We have previously demonstrated that the large HS3 deletion barely impairs the structure of the LCR holocomplex, while the structure is significantly disrupted by the HS3 core deletion. Taken together, these results suggest that the formation of the ACH is dependent on a largely intact LCR structure. We propose that the ACH indeed is an extension of the LCR holocomplex."

Six genes, Drs-lC, Drs-lD, Drs-lE, Drs-lF, Drs-lG and Drs-lI, show homology to the Drs form in a multigene family on the 3rd chromosome of D. melanogaster. It is the first experimental demonstration that the six members in the Drs family act as functional genes. To further delineate the functional divergence of these six members, their cDNA sequences were cloned respectively into the pET-3C vector and expressed in the E. coli. The antifungal activity of the expression products was assayed using the Cerletti's method. The results showed a difference among the six isoforms in antifungal activity against the tested fungal strains: in which Drs was most effective and showed antifungal activity to all seven fungal strains, whereas isoform Drs-lC was effective to six strains, Drs-lD was effective to five strains, Drs-lG was effective to four strains, and Drs-lE and Drs-lF were effective to only three strains. Drs-lI had no activity against any tested fungal strains. By comparing the variable residue sites of these six isoforms to that of Drosomycin in the three-dimensional structure, we suggested that the reduction in the antifungal activity was due to the variable residues that were not in the alpha-helix. In addition, two inserted residues (RV) in Drs-lI may affect the dimensional structure and resulted in a functional change. These results may explain the evolution of the Drosomycin multigene family and its functional divergence."

The preprotein monomer is composed of a 19-amino acid signal peptide followed by a 2749-amino acid polypeptide. In the last decade, several mutations in the thyroglobulin gene were reported.

The longest continuous open reading frame comprises 66 exons encoding a novel 4,074 aa multidomain integral membrane protein (polyductin/fibrocystin) of unknown function. Various alternatively spliced transcripts may additionally result in different isoproteins. Overall, the large size of PKHD1, its complex pattern of splicing, multiple allelism and lack of knowledge of the encoded protein's/proteins' functions pose significant challenges to DNA-based diagnostic testing. Nucleotide substitutions, particularly if residing in regulatory elements or introns outside the splice consensus sites, are often difficult to assess without further functional analyses and cannot be unambiguously classified as disease-associated. Investigations on the transcript level, however, are hampered as PKHD1 is not widely expressed in blood lymphocytes. We thus determined the functional significance of the novel splice site mutation c.53-3C&gt;A in intron 2 by RNA analyses by minigene-construction. The mutant allele was shown to cause skipping of exon 3. Thus, given the minigene results together with 400 control chromosomes negative for this change, segregation of the mutation with the phenotype, and a significant lowering of the strength of the splice site by bioinformatics, the mutant allele is most likely pathogenic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that defines the consequences of a PKHD1 splice mutation and underlines the relevance of functional analyses in determining the pathogenicity of changes of unknown significance."

TPMT activity is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and several mutations in the TPMT gene have been identified which correlate with a low activity phenotype. A variable number of tandem repeat within the TPMT promoter has been reported to modulate the levels of this enzyme activity. The allelic variants of the TPMT gene were analyzed in ethnic groups living in Spain.SUBJECTS AND METHOD: The frequency of 4 allelic variants of the TPMT gene as well as the genotype in the promoter region were analyzed in 138 Spanish blood donors, 95 gypsies and 51 Basque subjects.RESULTS: In the group of 138 blood donors, we identified: 13 carriers of a mutated TPMT allele (*3A, *3B, *3C), one homozygous TPMT*3B and a compound heterozygote (TPMT*3A/TPMT*3B). In the Basque group, 3 subjects were TPMT*3A carriers and one case was a TPMT*3B heterozygote. In the gypsy group one subject carried a TPMT*3A allele and 3 were compound heterozygotes TPMT*3A/TPMT*3B. The TMPT*3A was the most frequent mutant alelle. As for the polymorphic tandem repeat in the 5' flanking region of the TPMT gene, alleles with 4 or 5 repeats made up the vast majority (96%) of the chromosomes in the control group of Spanish subjects. This figure decreased to 75% in Basques and to 62% in gypsies, in whom 37% of the alleles contained more than 5 tandem repeats.CONCLUSIONS: The frequencies of the mutant TPMT alleles observed in the 3 groups are similar to those reported in Caucasian populations."

Here, we examined the mechanism for DNA looping at the beta-globin locus. By using chromosome conformation capture (3C), we show that the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 and its cofactor FOG-1 are required for the physical interaction between the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) and the beta-major globin promoter. Kinetic studies reveal that GATA-1-induced loop formation correlates with the onset of beta-globin transcription and occurs independently of new protein synthesis. GATA-1 occupies the beta-major globin promoter normally in fetal liver erythroblasts from mice lacking the LCR, suggesting that GATA-1 binding to the promoter and LCR are independent events that occur prior to loop formation. Together, these data demonstrate that GATA-1 and FOG-1 are essential anchors for a tissue-specific chromatin loop, providing general insights into long-range enhancer function."

There is considerable clinical overlap between these children and individuals with the Ritscher-Schinzel (or cranio-cerebello-cardiac (3C)) syndrome (OMIM #220210). Clinical features of 3C syndrome include craniofacial anomalies (macrocephaly, prominent forehead and occiput, foramina parietalia, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, ocular colobomas, depressed nasal bridge, narrow or cleft palate, and low-set ears), cerebellar malformations (variable manifestations of a Dandy-Walker malformation with moderate mental retardation), and cardiac defects (primarily septal defects). Since the original report, over 25 patients with 3C syndrome have been reported. Recessive inheritance has been postulated based on recurrence in siblings born to unaffected parents and parental consanguinity in two familial cases. Molecular and cytogenetic mapping of the 6p deletions in these three families with subtelomeric deletions of chromosome 6p have defined a 1.3 Mb minimally deleted critical region. To determine if 6p deletions are common in 3C syndrome, we analyzed seven unrelated individuals with 3C syndrome for deletions of this region. Three forkhead genes (FOXF1 and FOXQ1 from within the critical region, and FOXC1 proximal to this region) were evaluated as potential candidate disease genes for this disorder.

Both endosperm and embryo showed a typical Rabl configuration and a degree of non-homologous centromere association and the endosperm also showed extensive telomere association. Wheat endosperm is initially triploid and during its development a percentage of the nuclei increase their DNA content to 6C and 12C. 6C nuclei showed twice as many centromeres as 3C nuclei and the centromere number increased further in 12C nuclei. The higher the C-content of a nucleus the more the telomeres associated in endosperm. The vast majority of 12C nuclei showed six rye chromosome arms, although a few showed three associated groups of rye chromosome arms. This means that during endosperm development wheat nuclei show both polyploidization and polytenization."

Four Arabidopsis genes in the ecotype Columbia potentially encode proteins that could catalyze these reactions. MAM1 and MAML are adjacent genes on chromosome 5 at the Gsl-elong locus, while MAML-3 and MAML-4 are at opposite ends of chr 1. The isopropylmalate synthase activity of each member of the MAM-like gene family was investigated by heterologous expression in an isopropylmalate synthase-null Escherichia coli mutant. Only the expression of MAML-3 restored the ability of the mutant to grow in the absence of Leu. A MAML knockout line (KO) lacked long-chain aliphatic GSLs, which were restored when the KO was transformed with a functional MAML gene. Variation in expression of MAML did not alter the total levels of Met-derived GSLs, but just the ratio of chain lengths. MAML overexpression in Columbia led to an increase in long-chain GSLs, and an increase in 3C GSLs. Moreover, plants overexpressing MAML contained at least two novel amino acids. One of these was positively identified via MS/MS as homo-Leu, while the other, with identical mass and fragmentation patterns, was likely to be homo-Ile. A MAML-4 KO did not exhibit any changes in GSL profile, but had perturbed soluble amino acid content."

We have studied the prevalence of SLC6A8 mutations in a panel of 290 patients with nonsyndromic XLMR archived by the European XLMR Consortium. The full-length open reading frame and splice sites of the SLC6A8 gene were investigated by DNA sequence analysis. Six pathogenic mutations, of which five were novel, were identified in a total of 288 patients with XLMR, showing a prevalence of at least 2.1% (6/288). The novel pathogenic mutations are a nonsense mutation (p.Y317X) and four missense mutations. Three missense mutations (p.G87R, p.P390L, and p.P554L) were concluded to be pathogenic on the basis of conservation, segregation, chemical properties of the residues involved, as well as the absence of these and any other missense mutation in 276 controls.

The exceptionally high frequency of chromosome aberrations in NLJ-003 and NL3-001 loci suggests that multiple TSG(s) involved in different malignancies are located very near to these markers. Precise mapping of 15 independent HDs in the LUCA region allowed us to establish the smallest HD region in 3p21.3C located between D3S1568 (CACNA2D2 gene) and D3S4604 (SEMA3F gene). This region contains 17 genes. Mapping of 19 HDs in the AP20 region resulted in the localization of the minimal region to the interval flanked by D3S1298 and D3S3623 markers. Only four genes were discovered in this interval, namely, APRG1, ITGA9, HYA22 and VILL."

Here we provide additional evidence of the tumor suppressor function of NPRL2/G21. The gene has highly conserved homologs/orthologs ranging from yeast to humans. The yeast ortholog, NPR2, shows three highly conserved regions with 32 to 36% identity over the whole length. By sequence analysis, the main product of NPRL2/G21 encodes a soluble protein that has a bipartite nuclear localization signal, a protein-binding domain, similarity to the MutS core domain, and a newly identified nitrogen permease regulator 2 domain with unknown function. The gene is highly expressed in many tissues. We report inactivating mutations in a variety of tumors and cancer cell lines, growth suppression of tumor cells with tet-controlled NPRL2/G21 transgenes on plastic Petri dishes, and suppression of tumor formation in SCID mice. Screening of 7 renal, 5 lung, and 7 cervical carcinoma cell lines showed homozygous deletions in the 3' end of NPRL2 in 2 renal, 3 lung, and 1 cervical (HeLa) cell line. Deletions in the 3' part of NPRL2 could result in improper splicing, leading to the loss of the 1.8 kb functional NPRL2 mRNA. We speculate that the NPRL2/G21 nuclear protein may be involved in mismatch repair, cell cycle checkpoint signaling, and activation of apoptotic pathway(s). The yeast NPR2 was shown to be a target of cisplatin, suggesting that the human NPRL2/G21 may play a similar role. At least two homozygous deletions of NPRL2/G21 were detected in 6 tumor biopsies from various locations and with microsatellite instability. This study, together with previously obtained results, indicates that NPRL2 is a multiple tumor suppressor gene."

We here show that the native, porous structure of the heterochromatin in the interphase nucleus requires both K(+) and Mg(2+) in concentrations, which are known to support transcription in isolated nuclei, thus providing a functional state of the chromatin. When these cations are acting separately, the chromatin is more condensed by Mg(2+) and decondensed by K(+). Comparison with published values of the free electrostatic energy of DNA in chromatin shows that this state of compaction is the result of a balance between the different aggregative properties of K(+) and Mg(2+) at a high degree of charge shielding."

PAH nucleotide sequence analysis revealed 39 different mutations, including ten novel mutations. The novel mutations consisted of nine missense mutations (P69S, G103S, N207D, T278S, P281A, L293M, G332V, S391I, and A447P) and a novel splice site variant (IVS10-3C&gt;G). R243Q, IVS4-1G&gt;A, and E6-96A&gt;G were the most prevalent mutations, as they accounted for 32% of the total mutant alleles in this study. Although some common characteristics of allele frequency and distribution were identified among oriental populations, several distinctive characteristics were revealed in Korean patients. Although the R413P allele is the most prevalent form (30.5%) in Japanese, we detected it in only five chromosomes from 158 independent chromosomes (3.2%). The A259T allele, which has not yet been found in oriental populations, was frequently found in this study. We also observed that tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) responsiveness was associated with specific genotypes (R53H, R241C, and R408Q), suggesting there are some correlations between phenotype and genotype."

In dominant NSSHI hearing loss is typically biased towards the high frequencies while low-frequency hearing loss is unusual. Only two NSHHI loci, DFNA1 and DFNA6/14/38, are associated with predominantly low-frequency loss. We mapped the loci harboring the gene responsible for autosomal dominant low-frequency hearing loss in a multigenerational family. The pedigree of a Swiss family with low-frequency hearing loss was established. Using genomic DNA, DFNA1 and DFNA6/14/38 were excluded by linkage analysis or by direct sequencing of the responsible gene. Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed using commercially available microsatellite markers. Two-point linkage analysis demonstrated linkage to chromosome 5q31, the locus for DFNA15, with a lod score of 6.32 at recombination fraction theta=0 for marker D5S436. Critical recombinations were seen at markers D5S1972 and D5S410. Sequencing of the corresponding gene POU4F3 yielded no pathogenic mutation segregating with the affected members. In addition to Wolfram syndrome gene 1 (DFNA6/14/38) and diaphanous (DFNA1) there is evidence for a third gene involved in low-frequency hearing loss located at DFNA15. Because of the differences in auditory phenotype and the absence of pathogenic mutation in the coding region of POU4F3 it is likely that there is a second gene in 5q31, designated DFNA54, associated with NSHHI."

The AAT activity zymograms of subcellular fractions isolated from T. aestivum seedlings made it possible to establish that the AAT-1 zone is located in the mitochondria, AAT-2 in the chloroplasts and AAT-3 in the cytoplasm. Most of the total AAT activity from wheat leaves arises from the chloroplasts and cytoplasm. The AAT-3 zone exhibited the lowest electrophoretic mobility, but 3 isoenzymes occurring within were the most visibly separated. The occurrence of a single band in this zone at the AAT-3a position (closest to the anode) for the aneuploid CS3ASDt AABBDD line (the absence of long arms of the 3rd pair of homologous chromosomes in the A genome) and at the AAT-3c position for Ae. umbellulata (genome UU), as well as three bands in the whole zone for T. durum (AABB) and T. aestivum (AABBDD) each, made it possible to evaluate the subunit composition of isoenzymes in the AAT-3 zone. The band at the AAT-3a position in the zymogram is formed from bb dimers, AAT-3b from ab and AAT-3c from aa. By comparing the distribution of isoenzyme bands intensities (the result of enzymatic activity) with the mathematical models, the frequencies of the occurrence of the a and b subunits within AAT-3 zone were evaluated.

In addition, two STS markers (NLJ-003 and NL3-001) located in the 3p21.3 telomeric (3p21.3T) and 3p21.3 centromeric (3p21.3C) regions, respectively, were used for quantitative real-time PCR as TaqMan probes. We show that quantitative real-time PCR is reliable and sensitive and allows discriminating between 0, 1 and 2 marker copies per human genome. For the first time, frequent (five of 32 cases, i.e. 15.6%) homozygous deletions were demonstrated in CCs in both 3p21.3T and 3p21.3C regions. The smallest region homozygously deleted in 3p21.3C was located between D3S1568 (CACNA2D2 gene) and D3S4604 (SEMA3F gene) and contains 17 genes previously defined as lung cancer candidate Tumor suppressor genes (TSG(s)). The smallest region homozygously deleted in 3p21.3T was flanked by D3S1298 and NL1-024 (D3S4285), excluding DLEC1 and MYD88 as candidate TSGs involved in cervical carcinogenesis. Overall, this region contains five potential candidates, namely GOLGA4, APRG1, ITGA9, HYA22 and VILL, which need to be analysed. The data showed that aberrations of either NLJ-003 or NL3-001 were detected in 29 cases (90.6%) and most likely have a synergistic effect (P&lt;0.01). The study also demonstrated that aberrations in 3p21.3 were complex and in addition to deletions, may involve gene amplification as well. The results strongly suggest that 3p21.3T and 3p21.3C regions harbor genes involved in the origin and/or development of CCs and imply that those genes might be multiple TSG(s)."

By genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis, three T. aestivum-L. mollis translocation lines (WM-10, WM-43 and WM-47) and three deletion lines (WM-18, WM-43 and WM-44) were selected from 59 F2 plants derived from a cross combination of T. aestivum-L. mollis substitution line M8724-8-13 x T. aestivum-Ae. triunicalis 3C chromosome addition line. The frequency of translocation lines produced and total frequency of chromosome structural variation occurred were 5.08% and 8.47%, respectively. Two of the three translocation lines, WM-10 and WM-43 all were heterozygous translocation lines carrying one T. aestivum-L. mollis Robertsonian translocation chromosome, but the translocation chromosome in the two lines were different in morphology.

Transient expression in these cells of the wild-type 3C protein encoded by EV71 induced morphological alterations typical of apoptosis, including generation of apoptotic bodies. Degradation of cellular DNA in nucleosomes was also observed. When two of the amino acids in the catalytic motif of 3C were changed by mutagenesis, the 3C protein not only lost its proteolytic activity, but also its ability to induce apoptosis in the SF268 cells. Twenty-four hours after 3C transfection, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a DNA repair enzyme, was cleaved, indicating that caspases were activated by the expression of EV71 3C. The 3C-induced apoptosis was blocked by the caspase inhibitors DEVD-fmk and VAD-fmk.

We combined 3C with chromosome 1R of rye (Secale cereale L.) in a common wheat line to know how efficiently 3C induces transfers of small 1R segments to wheat. In the 811 progeny of this wheat line, we found five wheat chromosomes (2A, 2D, 3D, 5D and 7D) carrying segments of the 1R satellite. Wheat plants carrying these translocations were tested for the presence of a storage protein locus Sec-1 and a cluster of resistance genes for wheat rust diseases, Sr31, Lr26 and Yr9. The 2A and 2D translocations had the Sec-1 and three rust resistance loci. The 3D and 5D translocations had Sr31, Lr26 and Yr9 but not Sec-1. The 7D translocation lacked Sec-1, Lr26 and Yr9, but the presence of Sr31 in this translocation was not determined. This showed that the translocation points fell into three regions of the 1R satellite, namely, proximal to Sec-1, between Sec-1 and the rust resistance loci, and distal to the rust resistance loci. Thus, the 3C gametocidal system was demonstrated to be effective in transferring small rye chromosome segments."

One of these factors was purified as a homologue of nm23. The nm23 gene was isolated as a metastasis-suppressor gene that exhibits low expression in high-level metastatic cancer cells. The nm23 gene was overexpressed in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells and a higher level of nm23-H1 expression was correlated with a poor prognosis in AML. Multivariate analysis of putative prognostic factors revealed that elevated nm23-H1 mRNA levels significantly contributed to the prognosis of patients with AML. The overexpression of nm23-H1 was also observed in various hematological neoplasms. To use nm23 overexpression to determine the prognosis for lymphoma, we established an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique to determine the serum level of nm23-H1 protein. This assay is far simpler than that used to determine nm23 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using this system, we measured nm23-H1 protein levels in many hematological malignancies. Serum nm23-HI levels were significantly higher in patients with all of the hematological neoplasms tested (AML, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, (ALL) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and malignant lymphomas) than in normal controls. An elevated serum nm23-H1 protein concentration predicted a poor outcome for AML and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Especially in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), seram nm23-H1 protein levels were an important prognostic factor in planning an appropriate treatment strategy for DLBCL. The serum nm23-H I protein levels probably depend on the total mass of malignant cells overexpressing nm23-H1."

All three are hypothesized to function as transcriptional transactivators, but little is known about their precise mechanism of action or their role in EBV pathogenesis. We have cloned and studied the three EBNA-3 homologues from a closely related lymphocryptovirus (LCV) which naturally infects rhesus monkeys. The rhesus LCV EBNA-3A, -3B, and -3C homologues have 37, 40, and 36% amino acid identity with the EBV genes, respectively. Function, as measured by in vitro assays, also appears to be conserved with the EBV genes, since the rhesus LCV EBNA-3s can interact with the transcription factor RBP-Jkappa and the rhesus LCV EBNA-3C encodes a Q/P-rich domain with transcriptional activation properties. In order to better understand the relationship between these EBV and rhesus LCV latent infection genes, we asked if the rhesus LCV EBNA-3 locus could be recombined into the EBV genome and if it could substitute for the EBV EBNA-3s when assayed for human B-cell immortalization. Recombination between the EBV genome and rhesus LCV DNA was reasonably efficient. However, these studies suggest that the rhesus LCV EBNA-3 locus was not completely interchangeable with the EBV EBNA-3 locus for B-cell immortalization and that at least one determinant of the species restriction for LCV-induced B-cell immortalization maps to the EBNA-3 locus. The overall conservation of EBNA-3 structure and function between EBV and rhesus LCV indicates that rhesus LCV infection of rhesus monkeys can provide an important animal model for studying the role of the EBNA-3 genes in LCV pathogenesis."

In this report, we demonstrate a novel cleavage activity of PLPD-1. Expression, deletion, and mutagenesis studies showed that the product encoded between nucleotides 2548 and 8865 was further cleaved by PLPD-1 at the Gly(2265)-Gly(2266) dipeptide bond to release an N-terminal 195-kDa and a C-terminal 41-kDa cleavage product. Characterization of the cleavage activity revealed that the proteinase is active on this scissile bond when expressed in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and can act on the same substrate in trans when expressed in intact cells. Both the N- and C-terminal cleavage products were detected in virus-infected cells and were found to be physically associated. Glycosidase digestion and site-directed mutagenesis studies of the 41-kDa protein demonstrated that it is modified by N-linked glycosylation at the Asn(2313) residue encoded by nucleotides 7465 to 7467. By using a region-specific antiserum raised against the IBV sequence encoded by nucleotides 8865 to 9786, we also demonstrated that a 33-kDa protein, representing the 3C-like proteinase (3CLP), was specifically immunoprecipitated from the virus-infected cells. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression studies showed that a previously predicted cleavage site (Q(2583)-G(2584)) located within the 41-kDa protein-encoding region was not utilized by 3CLP, supporting the conclusion that the 41-kDa protein is a mature viral product."

Previously, Csw has been demonstrated to function throughout the Drosophila life cycle and, among the RTKs tested, Csw is essential in the Torso, Sevenless, EGF, and Breathless/FGF RTK pathways. While the biochemical function of Csw remains to be unambiguously elucidated, current evidence suggests that Csw plays more than one role during transduction of the RTK signal and, further, the molecular mechanism of Csw function differs depending upon the RTK in question. The isolation and characterization of a new, spontaneously arising, viable allele of csw, csw(lf), has allowed us to undertake a genetic approach to identify loci required for Csw function. The rough eye and wing vein gap phenotypes exhibited by adult flies homo- or hemizygous for csw(lf) has provided a sensitized background from which we have screened a collection of second and third chromosome deficiencies to identify 33 intervals that enhance and 21 intervals that suppress these phenotypes. We have identified intervals encoding known positive mediators of RTK signaling, e.g., drk, dos, Egfr, E(Egfr)B56, pnt, Ras1, rolled/MAPK, sina, spen, Src64B, Star, Su(Raf)3C, and vein, as well as known negative mediators of RTK signaling, e.g., aos, ed, net, Src42A, sty, and su(ve). Of particular interest are the 5 lethal enhancing intervals and 14 suppressing intervals for which no candidate genes have been identified."

We describe a method that combines two independent nonradioactive PCR assays: determination of the relative ratio of the SMN1 and SMN2 genes using a primer extension assay and of the total SMN copy number using competitive PCR. Consistency of the results of two independent approaches ensures the reliability of the deduced genotype and thus avoids false interpretation of borderline results that can occur in quantitative assays. In all, 135 subjects were tested, including 91 normal controls and 44 SMA-affected children or SMA carriers. Two main genotypes were observed in controls: 2T/2C (45%) and 2T/1C (32%). A wide variability at the SMN locus is observed with nine different genotypes and up to six SMN genes. SMA carriers showed three frequent genotypes, 1T/2C (50%), 1T/3C (29%), and 1T/1C (18%). Normal chromosomes with two SMN1 genes per chromosome are not infrequent and thus, about 3% of SMA carriers are not detected using SMN1 copy number quantitation. Finally, as this method does not detect point mutations (4% of SMN1 gene mutations), reliability ranges from 93% to 100% depending on data available from the propositus."

Mutation analysis was performed in 6 presymptomatic individuals younger than 30 years; clinical features were analyzed in 4 of these family H members.INTERVENTIONS: Hearing was measured by pure-tone audiometry and speech audiometry on all participating relatives of family H. Immittance testing (tympanometry and acoustic reflexes), auditory brainstem response, and otoacoustic emissions were done in a selected patient population.RESULTS: The patients presented with progressive high-tone sensorineural hearing impairment, which became apparent between ages 18 and 30 years. The hearing impairment became more severe with time, eventually causing significant hearing loss across the spectrum at all frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that POU4F3 mutation-associated deafness cannot be identified through clinical evaluation, but only through molecular analysis. Intrafamilial variability suggests that other genetic or environmental factors may modify the age at onset and rate of progression."
