We modeled in-utero and intra-partum HIV transmissions to investigate the preventive role of various antiretroviral treatments interventions.METHODS: We analysed data from 3,759 women-infant pairs enrolled in 3 randomized clinical trials evaluating (1) zidovudine monotherapy, (2) zidovudine plus perinatal single-dose nevirapine or (3) zidovudine plus lopinavir/ritonavir for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Thailand. All infants were formula-fed. Non-linear mixed effect modeling was used to express the viral load evolution under antiretroviral treatments and the probability of transmission.RESULTS: Median viral load was 4 log10 copies/mL (Interquartile range: 3.36-4.56) before antiretroviral treatments initiation. An Emax model described the viral load time-course during pregnancy. Half of the maximum effect of zidovudine (28% decrease) and lopinavir/ritonavir (72% decrease) were achieved after 98 and 12 days, respectively. Adjusted on viral load at baseline (Odds ratio = 1.50 [95% confidence interval: 1.34, 1.68] per log10 copies/mL increment), antiretroviral treatments duration (OR = 0.80 [0.75, 0.84] per week increment) but not the nature of antiretroviral treatments were associated with in-utero transmission. Adjusted on gestational age at delivery (&lt;37 weeks, OR = 2.37 [1.37, 4.10]), baseline CD4 (Odds ratio = 0.79 [0.72, 0.88] per 100 cells/mm3 increment) and predicted viral load at delivery (OR = 1.47 [1.25, 1.64] per log10 copies/mL increment), single-dose nevirapine considerably reduced intra-partum transmission (OR = 0.32 [0.2, 0.51]).CONCLUSION: These models determined the respective contributions of various antiretroviral strategies on prevention of mother-to-child transmission. This can help predict the efficacy of new antiretroviral treatments and/or prevention of mother-to-child transmission strategies particularly for women with no or late antenatal care who are at high risk of transmitting HIV to their offspring.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This analysis is based on secondary data obtained from three clinical trials.

Most of the anti-cancer therapies trigger apoptosis induction and related cell death networks to eliminate malignant cells. However, in cancer, de-regulated apoptotic signaling, particularly the activation of an anti-apoptotic systems, allows cancer cells to escape this program leading to uncontrolled proliferation resulting in tumor survival, therapeutic resistance and recurrence of cancer. This resistance is a complicated phenomenon that emanates from the interactions of various molecules and signaling pathways. In this comprehensive review we discuss the various factors contributing to apoptosis resistance in cancers. The key resistance targets that are discussed include (1) Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins; (2) autophagy processes; (3) necrosis and necroptosis; (4) heat shock protein signaling; (5) the proteasome pathway; (6) epigenetic mechanisms; and (7) aberrant nuclear export signaling. The shortcomings of current therapeutic modalities are highlighted and a broad spectrum strategy using approaches including (a) gossypol; (b) epigallocatechin-3-gallate; (c) UMI-77 (d) triptolide and (e) selinexor that can be used to overcome cell death resistance is presented. This review provides a roadmap for the design of successful anti-cancer strategies that overcome resistance to apoptosis for better therapeutic outcome in patients with cancer."

In this study we carry out a modelling analysis of water yields in the Chubut River basin, located in one of the driest districts of Patagonia, Argentina. We focus on the uncertainty around precipitation data, a driver of paramount importance for water yield. The objectives of this study are to: i) explore the spatial and numeric differences among six widely used global precipitation datasets for this region, ii) test them against data from independent ground stations, and iii) explore the effects of precipitation data uncertainty on simulations of water yield. The simulations were performed using the ecosystem services model InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) with each of the six different precipitation datasets as input. Our results show marked differences among datasets for the Chubut watershed region, both in the magnitude of precipitations and their spatial arrangement. Five of the precipitation databases overestimate the precipitation over the basin by 50% or more, particularly over the more humid western range. Meanwhile, the remaining dataset (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission - TRMM), based on satellite measurements, adjusts well to the observed rainfall in different stations throughout the watershed and provides a better representation of the precipitation gradient characteristic of the rain shadow of the Andes. The observed differences among datasets in the representation of the rainfall gradient translate into large differences in water yield simulations. Errors in precipitation of +30% (-30%) amplify to water yield errors ranging from 50 to 150% (-45 to -60%) in some sub-basins. These results highlight the importance of assessing uncertainties in main input data when quantifying and mapping ecosystem services with biophysical models and cautions about the undisputed use of global environmental datasets."

First, we show analytically that the work distributions for bosonic and fermionic working fluids are identical for cycles driven by harmonic trapping potentials. Subsequently, in the case of nonharmonic potentials, we find that the interplay between different energy level spacings and particle statistics strongly affects the performances of the engine cycle. To demonstrate this, we examine three trapping potentials which induce different (single-particle) energy level spacings: monotonically decreasing with the level number, monotonically increasing, and the case in which the level spacing does not vary monotonically."

In this study, a series of lipophilic, highly flexible, disulfide dendritic wedges (generations 0-4), based on 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid, was designed to bind Au nanoparticles with a thiolate bond. By controlling the solvent evaporation rate, the corresponding dendron-capped Au hybrids were found to self-organize into hexagonal close-packed (hcp) superlattices. The interparticular spacing was progressively varied from 2.2 to 6.3 nm with increasing dendritic generation, covering a range that is intermediate between commercial ligands and DNA-based ligand shells. Dual mixtures made from some of these dendronized hybrids (i.e., same inner core size but different dendritic covering) yielded binary superlattice structures of unprecedented single inorganic components, which are isostructural with NaZn13 and CaCu5 crystals."

This phenomenon is expected to occur in both diploid (XY, ZW) and haploid (UV) sexual systems, with slightly different consequences for UV sexual systems because of the absence of masking during the haploid phase (when sex is expressed) and because there is no homozygous sex in these systems. Despite a considerable amount of theoretical work on PAR genetics and evolution, these genomic regions have remained poorly characterized empirically. We show here that although the pseudoautosomal regions of the U/V sex chromosomes of the brown alga Ectocarpus recombine at a similar rate to autosomal regions of the genome, they exhibit many genomic features typical of non-recombining regions. The pseudoautosomal regions were enriched in clusters of genes that are preferentially, and often exclusively, expressed during the sporophyte generation of the life cycle, and many of these genes appear to have evolved since the Ectocarpales diverged from other brown algal lineages. A modelling-based approach was used to investigate possible evolutionary mechanisms underlying this enrichment in sporophyte-biased genes. Our results are consistent with the evolution of the PAR in haploid systems being influenced by differential selection pressures in males and females acting on alleles that are advantageous during the sporophyte generation of the life cycle."

This study assessed the effects of energy deficiency on various bone and hormonal parameters. The interrelationships between energy deficiency and bone remodelling, glucose homeostasis and adipokines underscore the importance of preventing energy deficiency to limit demineralisation and hormonal alterations in AN patients.INTRODUCTION: Low areal bone mineral density (aBMD) is a well-known consequence of AN. However, the impact of reduced energy expenditure on bone metabolism is unknown. This study assessed the effects of energy deficiency on bone remodelling and its potential interactions with glucose homeostasis and adipose tissue-derived hormones in AN, a clinical model for reduced energy expenditure.METHODS: Fifty women with AN and 50 age-matched controls (mean age 18.1 ± 2.7 and 18.0 ± 2.1 years, respectively) were enrolled. aBMD was determined with DXA. Resting energy expenditure (REEm), a marker of energy status, was indirectly assessed by calorimetry. Bone turnover markers, undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC), parameters of glucose homeostasis, adipokines and growth factors were concomitantly evaluated.RESULTS: AN patients presented low aBMD at all bone sites. REEm, bone formation markers, ucOC, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, leptin and IGF-1 were significantly reduced, whereas the bone resorption marker, leptin receptor (sOB-R) and adiponectin were elevated in AN compared with CON. In AN patients, REEm was positively correlated with weight, BMI, whole body (WB) fat mass, WB fat-free soft tissue, markers of bone formation, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, leptin and IGF-1 and negatively correlated with the bone resorption marker and sOB-R. Biological parameters, aBMD excepted, appeared more affected by the weight variation in the last 6 months than by the disease duration.CONCLUSIONS: The strong interrelationships between REEm and bone remodelling, glucose homeostasis and adipokines underscore the importance of preventing energy deficiency to limit short- and long-term bone demineralisation and hormonal alterations in AN patients."

To determine if ZDV monotherapy selects for HIV resistance in antiretroviral-naive women during pregnancy, specimens from 50 individuals were examined using pyrosequencing. ZDV-resistance mutations were detected at delivery in seven women (14%, 95% confidence interval 6.6-26.5%). These data raise the question whether women administered ZDV monotherapy for prevention of mother-to-child-transmission could have higher risk of virologic failure when later started on combination antiretroviral therapy, as has been demonstrated following single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis."

Two-dimensional ultrasonic-measurement-integrated (2D-UMI) simulation can correctly reproduce an intravascular blood flow field and hemodynamics by feeding back an ultrasonic measurement to the numerical blood flow simulation. In this method it is critically important to give the correct cross-sectional average inflow velocity (inflow velocity) as the boundary condition. However, systematic study has not been done on the relative validity and effectiveness of existing inflow velocity estimation methods for various target flow fields. The aim of this study was to examine the existing methods systematically and to establish a method to accurately estimate inflow velocities for various vessel geometries and flow conditions in 2D-UMI simulations. A numerical experiment was performed for 2D-UMI simulation of blood flow models in a straight vessel with inflow velocity profiles symmetric and asymmetric to the vessel axis using existing evaluation functions based on Doppler velocity error for the inflow velocity estimation. As a result, it was clarified that a significantly large estimation error occurs in the asymmetric flow due to a nonfeedback domain near the downstream end of the calculation domain. Hence, a new inflow velocity estimation method of 2D-UMI simulation is proposed in which the feedback and evaluation domains are extended to the downstream end. Further numerical experiments of 2D-UMI simulation for two realistic vessel geometries of a healthy blood vessel and a stenosed one confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Here, we take advantage of a combination of large environmental data sets on Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), an environmentally persistent microorganism associated to freshwater ecosystems and present in a large variety of aquatic hosts, to characterize abiotic and biotic factors driving the dynamics of this pathogen in two regions of Cameroon. We find that MU dynamics are largely driven by seasonal climatic factors and certain physico-chemical conditions in stagnant and slow-flowing ecosystems, with an important role of pH as limiting factor. Furthermore, water conditions can modify the effect of abundance and diversity of aquatic organisms on MU dynamics, which suggests a different contribution of two MU transmission routes for aquatic hosts (trophic vs environmental transmission) depending on local abiotic factors."
"26215161";"UMI";"UMI";"BMC biology";0;2015;"Kinetic discrimination of self/non-self RNA by the ATPase activity of RIG-I and MDA5.";"BACKGROUND: The cytoplasmic RIG-like receptors are responsible for the early detection of viruses and other intracellular microbes by activating the innate immune response mediated by type I interferons (IFNs). RIG-I and MDA5 detect virus-specific RNA motifs with short 5'-tri/diphosphorylated, blunt-end double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and &gt;0.5-2 kb long dsRNA as canonical agonists, respectively. However, in vitro, they can bind to many RNA species, while in cells there is an activation threshold. As SF2 helicase/ATPase family members, ATP hydrolysis is dependent on co-operative RNA and ATP binding. Whereas simultaneous ATP and cognate RNA binding is sufficient to activate RIG-I by releasing autoinhibition of the signaling domains, the physiological role of the ATPase activity of RIG-I and MDA5 remains controversial.RESULTS: A cross-analysis of a rationally designed panel of RNA binding and ATPase mutants and truncated receptors, using type I IFN promoter activation as readout, allows us to refine our understanding of the structure-function relationships of RIG-I and MDA5. RNA activation of RIG-I depends on multiple critical RNA binding sites in its helicase domain as confirmed by functional evidence using novel mutations. We found that RIG-I or MDA5 mutants with low ATP hydrolysis activity exhibit constitutive activity but this was fully reverted when associated with mutations preventing RNA binding to the helicase domain. We propose that the turnover kinetics of the ATPase domain enables the discrimination of self/non-self RNA by both RIG-I and MDA5. Non-cognate, possibly self, RNA binding would lead to fast ATP turnover and RNA disassociation and thus insufficient time for the caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) to promote downstream signaling, whereas tighter cognate RNA binding provides a longer time window for downstream events to be engaged.CONCLUSIONS: The exquisite fine-tuning of RIG-I and MDA5 RNA-dependent ATPase activity coupled to CARD release allows a robust IFN response from a minor subset of non-self RNAs within a sea of cellular self RNAs. This avoids the eventuality of deleterious autoimmunity effects as have been recently described to arise from natural gain-of-function alleles of RIG-I and MDA5."

We identify three dominant modes of SSS variability. The first two, which have been discussed in previous studies, represent the seasonal and the interannual variations of the freshwater plumes over the continental shelf. The third mode of SSS variability, which has not been discussed hitherto, represents the salinity exchanges between the shelf and the deep ocean. A diagnostic study using floats and passive tracers identifies the pathways taken by the freshwater plumes. During the austral winter (JJA), the plumes leave the shelf region north of the BMC. During the austral summer (DJF), the plumes are entrained more directly into the BMC. A sensitivity study indicates that the high-frequency component of the wind stress forcing controls the vertical structure of the plumes while the low-frequency component of the wind stress forcing and the interannual variations of the RdlP discharge controls the horizontal structure of the plumes. Dynamical analysis reveals that the cross-shelf flow has a dominant barotropic structure and, therefore, the SSS anomalies detected by Aquarius represent net mass exchanges between the shelf and the deep ocean. The net cross-shelf volume flux is 1.21 Sv. This outflow is largely compensated by an inflow from the Patagonian shelf."

Away from the tropics, these exchanges cause the largest SSS variability throughout the South Atlantic. The data reveal a well-defined seasonal pattern of SSS during the analyzed period and of the location of the export of low-salinity shelf waters. In spring and summer, low-salinity waters over the shelf expand offshore and are transferred to the open ocean primarily southeast of the river mouth (from 36°S to 37°30'S). In contrast, in fall and winter, low-salinity waters extend along a coastal plume and the export path to the open ocean distributes along the offshore edge of the plume. The strong seasonal SSS pattern is modulated by the seasonality of the along-shelf component of the wind stress over the shelf.

The insertion comprised 31 amino-acids for the majority of patients; 3 patients had 27 amino-acids insertions and 1 had a 12 amino-acids insertion. Sequence identity between the 31 amino-acids insertions and the V3 domain ranged from 48 to 96% with E-values above 4e(-5), thus illustrating sequence homology and a partial gene duplication event that to our knowledge has never been reported in HCV. Moreover we showed the presence of the duplication at the time of infection and its persistence at least during 12 years in the entire quasispecies. No association was found with extrahepatic diseases. Conversely, patients with cirrhosis were two times more likely to have HCV with this genetic characteristic (p=0.04). Moreover, its prevalence increased with liver disease severity (from 3.0% in patients without cirrhosis to 9.4% in patients with both cirrhosis and HCC, p for trend=0.045).CONCLUSIONS: We identified a duplicated V3 domain in the HCV-1b NS5A protein for the first time. The duplication may be associated with unfavorable evolution of liver disease including a possible involvement in liver carcinogenesis."

Our objective was to assess gender differences in (1) adherence to ART and (2) virologic failure, immune reconstitution, mortality, and disease progression adjusting for adherence.METHODS: Cohort study among 459 ART-naive patients followed up 24 months after initiation in 2006-2010 in 9 rural district hospitals. Adherence to ART was assessed using (1) a validated tool based on multiple patient self-reports and (2) antiretroviral plasma concentrations. The associations between gender and the outcomes were assessed using multivariate mixed models or accelerated time failure models.RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five patients (29.4%) were men. At baseline, men were older, had higher body mass index and hemoglobin level, and received more frequently efavirenz than women. Gender was not associated with self-reported adherence (P = 0.872, 0.169, and 0.867 for moderate adherence, low adherence, and treatment interruption, respectively) or with antiretroviral plasma concentrations (P = 0.549 for nevirapine/efavirenz). In contrast, male gender was associated with virologic failure [odds ratio: 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31 to 3.62, P = 0.003], lower immunologic reconstitution (coefficient: -58.7 at month 24, 95% CI: -100.8 to -16.6, P = 0.006), and faster progression to death (time ratio: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.78, P = 0.014) and/or to World Health Organization stage 4 event (time ratio: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.79, P = 0.017).CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides important evidence that African men are more vulnerable to ART failure than women and that the male vulnerability extends beyond adherence issues. Additional studies are needed to determine the causes for this vulnerability to optimize HIV care. However, personalized adherence support remains crucial."

In a novel mechanism, AN2690 (5-fluoro-1,3-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole) blocks fungal cytoplasmic LeuRS by covalently trapping tRNA(Leu) in the editing site of the enzyme's CP1 domain. However, some resistant mutation sites are located outside of the CP1 hydrolytic editing active site. Thus, their mode of action that undermines drug inhibition was not understood. A combination of X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics, metadynamics, biochemical experiments, and mutational analysis of a distal benzoxaborole-resistant mutant uncovered a eukaryote-specific tyrosine &quot;switch&quot; that is critical to tRNA-dependent post-transfer editing. The tyrosine &quot;switch&quot; has three states that shift between interactions with a lysine and the 3'-hydroxyl of the tRNA terminus, to inhibit or promote post-transfer editing. The oxaborole's mechanism of action capitalizes upon one of these editing active site states. This tunable editing mechanism in eukaryotic and archaeal LeuRSs is proposed to facilitate precise quality control of aminoacylation fidelity. These mechanistic distinctions could also be capitalized upon for development of the benzoxaboroles as a broad spectrum antibacterial."

"26154304";"UMI";"UMI";"Proteomics";0;2015;"Identification of proteins involved in desiccation tolerance in the red seaweed Pyropia orbicularis (Rhodophyta, Bangiales).";"Extreme reduction in cellular water content leads to desiccation, which, if persistent, affects the physiology of organisms, mainly through oxidative stress. Some organisms are highly tolerant to desiccation, including resurrection plants and certain intertidal seaweeds. One such species is Pyropia orbicularis, a rhodophycean that colonizes upper intertidal zones along the Chilean coast. Despite long, daily periods of air exposure due to tides, this alga is highly tolerant to desiccation. The present study examined the proteome of P. orbicularis by 2DE and LC-MS/MS analyses to determine the proteins associated with desiccation tolerance (DT). The results showed that, under natural conditions, there were significant changes in the protein profile during low tide as compared to naturally hydrated plants at high tide. These changes were mainly in newly appeared proteins spots such as chaperones, monodehydroascorbate reductase, and manganese superoxide dismutase, among others. Previously undescribed proteins under desiccation conditions included phycobiliproteins, glyoxalase I, and phosphomannomutase. These changes evidenced that several physiological responses involved in DT are activated during low tide, including decreased photosynthetic activity, increased antioxidant capacity, and the preservation of cell physiology by regulating water content, cell wall structure, and cell volume. Similar responses have been observed in resurrection plants and bryophytes exposed to desiccation. Therefore, the coordinated activation of different desiccation tolerance pathways in P. orbicularis could explain the successful biological performance of this seaweed in the upper intertidal rocky zones."
"26136820";"UMI";"UMI";"Evolutionary applications";0;2015;"Evolutionary perspective of cancer: myth, metaphors, and reality.";"The evolutionary perspective of cancer (which origins and dynamics result from evolutionary processes) has gained significant international recognition over the past decade and generated a wave of enthusiasm among researchers. In this context, several authors proposed that insights into evolutionary and adaptation dynamics of cancers can be gained by studying the evolutionary strategies of organisms. Although this reasoning is fundamentally correct, in our opinion, it contains a potential risk of excessive adaptationism, potentially leading to the suggestion of complex adaptations that are unlikely to evolve among cancerous cells. For example, the ability of recognizing related conspecifics and adjusting accordingly behaviors as in certain free-living species appears unlikely in cancer. Indeed, despite their rapid evolutionary rate, malignant cells are under selective pressures for their altered lifestyle for only few decades. In addition, even though cancer cells can theoretically display highly sophisticated adaptive responses, it would be crucial to determine the frequency of their occurrence in patients with cancer, before therapeutic applications can be considered. Scientists who try to explain oncogenesis will need in the future to critically evaluate the metaphorical comparison of selective processes affecting cancerous cells with those affecting organisms. This approach seems essential for the applications of evolutionary biology to understand the origin of cancers, with prophylactic and therapeutic applications."

Ecology meets personalized medicine.";"For an increasing number of biologists, cancer is viewed as a dynamic system governed by evolutionary and ecological principles. Throughout most of human history, cancer was an uncommon cause of death and it is generally accepted that common components of modern culture, including increased physiological stresses and caloric intake, favor cancer development. However, the precise mechanisms for this linkage are not well understood. Here, we examine the roles of ecological and physiological disturbances and resource availability on the emergence of cancer in multicellular organisms. We argue that proliferation of 'profiteering phenotypes' is often an emergent property of disturbed, resource-rich environments at all scales of biological organization. We review the evidence for this phenomenon, explore it within the context of malignancy, and discuss how this ecological framework may offer a theoretical background for novel strategies of cancer prevention. This work provides a compelling argument that the traditional separation between medicine and evolutionary ecology remains a fundamental limitation that needs to be overcome if complex processes, such as oncogenesis, are to be completely understood."

Here, we combine experimental and theoretical tools to demonstrate that the surface roughness at the nanometer scale of pSi can be tuned in a controlled fashion using partial thermal oxidation followed by removal of the resulting silicon oxide layer with hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution. Such a process is shown to smooth the pSi surface by means of nitrogen adsorption, electron microscopy, and small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering. Statistical mechanics Monte Carlo simulations, which are consistent with the experimental data, support the interpretation that the pore surface is initially rough and that the oxidation/oxide removal procedure diminishes the surface roughness while increasing the pore diameter. As a specific example considered in this work, the initial roughness ξ ∼ 3.2 nm of pSi pores having a diameter of 7.6 nm can be decreased to 1.0 nm following the simple procedure above. This study allows envisioning the design of pSi samples with optimal surface properties toward a specific process."

For this purpose, incorporate the expertise from applied mathematicians, biologists and physicians is highly desirable. Despite the existence of a very wide range of models, involving many stages in cancer progression, few models have been proposed to take into account all relevant processes in tumor progression, in particular the effect of systemic treatments and angiogenesis. Composite biological experiments, both in vitro and in vivo, in addition with mathematical modelling can provide a better understanding of theses aspects. In this work we proposed that a rational experimental design associated with mathematical modelling could provide new insights into cancer progression. To accomplish this task, we reviewed mathematical models and cancer biology literature, describing in detail the basic principles of mathematical modelling. We also analyze how experimental data regarding tumor cells proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro may fit with mathematical modelling in order to reconstruct in vivo tumor evolution. Additionally, we explained the mathematical methodology in a comprehensible way in order to facilitate its future use by the scientific community."

Phosphorylation of the essential NMD effector UPF1 by the phosphoinositide-3-kinase-like kinase (PIKK) SMG-1 is a key step in NMD and occurs when SMG-1, its two regulatory factors SMG-8 and SMG-9, and UPF1 form a complex at a terminating ribosome. Electron cryo-microscopy of the SMG-1-8-9-UPF1 complex shows the head and arm architecture characteristic of PIKKs and reveals different states of UPF1 docking. UPF1 is recruited to the SMG-1 kinase domain and C-terminal insertion domain, inducing an opening of the head domain that provides access to the active site. SMG-8 and SMG-9 interact with the SMG-1 C-insertion and promote high-affinity UPF1 binding to SMG-1-8-9, as well as decelerated SMG-1 kinase activity and enhanced stringency of phosphorylation site selection. The presence of UPF2 destabilizes the SMG-1-8-9-UPF1 complex leading to substrate release. Our results suggest an intricate molecular network of SMG-8, SMG-9 and the SMG-1 C-insertion domain that governs UPF1 substrate recruitment and phosphorylation by SMG-1 kinase, an event that is central to trigger mRNA decay."

Cases were incident cases of lung cancer diagnosed between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2011. All cancer cases were validated and histological types identified when available. Three controls were randomly selected by incidence density sampling using calendar time as the time axis, with individual matching on cohort, age (± 5 years), route of HIV acquisition, sex and hospital. Analyses were performed using conditional logistic regression adjusted for nadir CD4 cell count and smoking status. Ritonavir and protease inhibitors exposures were represented in separate models using categorical variables (never exposed, ever exposed). Several sensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS: This study performed in 1447 persons living with HIV with a smoking history (383 lung cancer cases and 1064 control patients) did not evidence any association between lung cancer risk and protease inhibitors exposure including ritonavir.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the risk of lung cancer is not influenced by pharmacologically induced P450 cytochrome protease inhibitors inhibition among smokers or ex-smokers."

We quantify tree vigor at the individual tree level, based on the difference between expected and observed growth. The available methods to join nonlinear tree growth and mortality processes are not commonly used by forest ecologists so that we develop an inference methodology based on an MCMC approach, allowing us to sample the parameters of the growth and mortality model according to their posterior distribution using the joint model likelihood. We apply our framework to a set of data on the 20-year dynamics of a forest in Paracou, French Guiana, taking advantage of functional trait-based growth and mortality models already developed independently. Our results showed that growth and mortality are intimately linked and that the vigor estimator is an essential predictor of mortality, highlighting that trees growing more than expected have a far lower probability of dying. Our joint model methodology is sufficiently generic to be used to join two longitudinal and punctual linked processes and thus may be applied to a wide range of growth and mortality models. In the context of global changes, such joint models are urgently needed in tropical forests to analyze, and then predict, the effects of the ongoing changes on the tree dynamics in hyperdiverse tropical forests."

The H1N1pdm09 virus caused the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century which resulted in at least 18500 deaths. Based on laboratory-confirmed primary-care case reports we investigated the role of weather conditions and socio-demographic variables in its initial spread and subsequent presence in France. Our findings suggest that low relative humidity and high population density were determinants in shaping the early spread of the virus at the national level. Those conditions also favoured the persistence of viral presence throughout the first 33 weeks of the pandemic. Additionally this persistence was significantly favoured by low insolation. These results confirm the increasingly recognized role of humidity in influenza dynamics and underlie the concomitant effect of insolation. Therefore climatic factors should be taken into account when designing influenza control and prevention measures."

Mathematical models indicate that niche differences between ploidy phases may be a necessary condition for the evolution and maintenance of these life cycles. Nevertheless, experimental support for this prediction remains elusive. In the present work, we explored this hypothesis in natural populations of the brown alga Ectocarpus. Consistent with the life cycle described in culture, Ectocarpus crouaniorum in NW France and E. siliculosus in SW Italy exhibited an alternation between haploid gametophytes and diploid sporophytes. Our field data invalidated, however, the long-standing view of an isomorphic alternation of generations. Gametophytes and sporophytes displayed marked differences in size and, conforming to theoretical predictions, occupied different spatiotemporal niches. Gametophytes were found almost exclusively on the alga Scytosiphon lomentaria during spring whereas sporophytes were present year-round on abiotic substrata. Paradoxically, E. siliculosus in NW France exhibited similar habitat usage despite the absence of alternation of ploidy phases. Diploid sporophytes grew both epilithically and epiphytically, and this mainly asexual population gained the same ecological advantage postulated for haploid-diploid populations. Consequently, an ecological interpretation of the niche differences between haploid and diploid individuals does not seem to satisfactorily explain the evolution of the Ectocarpus life cycle."

This family of triads consists of two side-on pending triphenylene mesogens, acting as the electron-donating groups (D), laterally connected through short lipophilic spacers to a central perylenediimide (PI), benzo[ghi]perylenediimide (BI), or coronenediimide (CI) molecular unit, respectively, playing the role of the electron acceptor (A). All D-A-D triads self-organize to form a lamello-columnar oblique mesophase, with a highly segregated donor-acceptor (D-A) heterojunction organization, consequent to efficient molecular self-sorting. The structure consists in the regular alternation of two disrupted rows of triphenylene columns and a continuous row of diimine species. High-resolution STM images demonstrate that PI-TP2 forms stable 2D self-assembly nanostructures with some various degrees of regularity, whereas the other triads do not self-organize into ordered architectures. The electron-transport mobility of CI-TP2, measured by time-of-flight at 200 °C in the mesophase, is one order of magnitude higher than the hole mobility. By means of this specific molecular designing idea, we realized and demonstrated for the first time the so-called p-n heterojunction at the molecular level in which the electron-rich triphenylene columns act as the hole transient pathways, and the coronenediimide stacks form the electron-transport channels."

However, modeling accurately the future spread of an epidemic requires context-specific parameters that are difficult to estimate because of lack of data. Our objective is to propose a methodology to estimate context-specific parameters using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)-like data that can be used in mathematical modeling of short-term HIV spreading.METHODS AND FINDINGS: The model splits the population according to sex, age, HIV status, and antiretroviral treatment status. To estimate context-specific parameters, we used individuals' histories included in DHS-like data and a statistical analysis that used decomposition of the Poisson likelihood. To predict the course of the HIV epidemic, sex- and age-specific differential equations were used. This approach was applied to recent data from Kenya. The approach allowed the estimation of several key epidemiological parameters. Women had a higher infection rate than men and the highest infection rate in the youngest age groups (15-24 and 25-34 years) whereas men had the highest infection rate in age group 25-34 years. The immunosuppression rates were similar between age groups. The treatment rate was the highest in age group 35-59 years in both sexes. The results showed that, within the 15-24 year age group, increasing male circumcision coverage and antiretroviral therapy coverage at CD4 ≤ 350/mm3 over the current 70% could have short-term impacts.CONCLUSIONS: The study succeeded in estimating the model parameters using DHS-like data rather than literature data. The analysis provides a framework for using the same data for estimation and prediction, which can improve the validity of context-specific predictions and help designing HIV prevention campaigns."

Here we show that a simple synthetic &quot;T-channel&quot; forms a directional pore with its carbonyl moieties solvated by chiral helical water wires. Atom-scale simulations and experimental crystallographic assays reveal a dynamical structure of water and electrolyte solutions (alkali metal chlorides) confined in these organic T-channels. Oscillations in the dipole orientation, which correspond to alternative ordering (dipole up-dipole down) of the water molecules with a period of about 4.2 Å (imposed by the distance between two successive carbonyl groups) are observed. When ions are added to the system, despite the strong Coulombic water/ion interaction, confined water remains significantly ordered in the T-channel and still exhibits surface-induced polarization. Cation permeation can be achieved through alternated hydration-dehydration occurring along strongly oriented water wires. The T-channel, which exhibits chirality with strong water orientation, provides an opportunity to unravel novel water-channel systems that share many interesting properties of biomolecular systems."

Here, we suggest that the evolution of partial resistance, as well as bypass, to manipulation (PRM and BPM, respectively) represents new, seldom-explored options for parasitized hosts. Natural selection could favor hosts that partially resist certain manipulative dimensions to postpone their death and perform additional reproductive episodes (PRM). Alternatively, manipulated hosts may express novel traits that do not alter the manipulation per se but that alleviate its detrimental fitness consequences (BPM). If effective, PRM and BPM have many implications for the ecology and evolution of hosts and their parasites, especially the evolution of multidimensional manipulations."

Studies on efficacy of antimalarial treatments usually follow the WHO standardized protocol in which severely malnourished children are systematically excluded. Few studies have assessed the efficacy of chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and quinine in severe acute malnourished children. Overall, efficacy of these treatments appeared to be reduced, attributed to lower immunity and for some antimalarials altered pharmacokinetic profiles and lower drug concentrations. However, similar research on the efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiles of artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) and especially artemether-lumefantrine in malnourished children is currently lacking. The main objective of this study is to assess whether artemether-lumefantrine is less efficacious in children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) compared to non-SAM children, and if so, to what extent this can be attributed to a sub-optimal pharmacokinetic profile.DESIGN: In two sites, Ouelessebougou, Mali and Maradi, Niger, children with uncomplicated microscopically-confirmed P. falciparum malaria aged between 6 and 59 months will be enrolled. Two non-SAM children will be enrolled after the enrolment of each SAM case. Children with severe manifestations of malaria or complications of acute malnutrition needing intensive treatment will be excluded. Treatment intakes will be supervised and children will be followed-up for 42 days, according to WHO guidance for surveillance of antimalarial drug efficacy. Polymerase Chain Reaction genotyping will be used to distinguish recrudescence from re-infection. SAM children will also benefit from the national nutritional rehabilitation program. Outcomes will be compared between the SAM and non-SAM populations. The primary outcome will be adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28 after PCR correction, estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of lumefantrine, a sparse sampling approach will be used with randomized allocation of sampling times (5 per child). A total of 180 SAM children and 360 non-SAM children will be recruited during the 2013 and 2014 malaria seasons.DISCUSSION: This study will provide important information that is currently lacking on the effect of SAM on therapeutic efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of artemether-lumefantrine. If it shows lower therapeutic efficacy and decreased lumefantrine concentrations, it would inform dose optimization studies in SAM children.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01958905."

A high throughput sequencing technology (454 GS-FLX Titanium technology, Roche) was then used to identify the Plasmodium species present within each positive sample. Overall, we identified with confidence only three species infecting humans in Gabon: P. falciparum, P. malariae and P. ovale. None of the species known to infect non-human primates in Central Africa was found. Our study shows that ape Plasmodium parasites of the subgenus Laverania do not constitute a frequent source of infection for humans. It also suggests that some strong host genetic barriers must exist to prevent the cross species transmission of ape Plasmodium in a context of ever increasing contacts between humans and wildlife."

The objective of this study was to determine its prevalence and its influence on self-rated health among people living in rural areas of Senegal. This cross-sectional study was conducted over a two-week period in the rural communities of Labgar and Lougré Thiolly, located in the central northern region of Senegal, in an agricultural area. Randomly recruited volunteers were questioned during direct individual interviews about socio-demographic (age, sex, marital status, education, occupation) and lifestyle data (smoking or alcohol, physical activity). Clinical data (medical history, weight, height, blood pressure, course of treatment) were also collected. Self-rated health (SRH) was assessed by asking if they felt their health was bad or good. We included 627 patients with a mean age of 40.93 ± 17.2 years (range: 15-100 years), 59.9% of them women. Illiteracy and overweight were more common among women than among men, and smoking and alcohol consumption more frequent in men. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 23.4% and did not differ significantly between men (24.9%) and women (22.4%)(P = 0.50). Self-rated health was similar in men and women (with respectively 66.9% and 72.9% reporting good health, P = 0.10). On univariate analysis, the factors associated with perceived health status were age (OR = 1.34, P = 0.04), smoking (OR = 2.16, P = 0.03), educational level (OR = 1.21, P = 0.04), and the presence of hypertension (OR = 0.63, P = 0.05). The multivariate regression analysis showed that among women, advanced age (≥50 years) and hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg) were associated with poorer perceived health, whereas for men, only smoking was significantly correlated with poor health status (OR = 0.41, P = 0.01). This study shows that hypertension is common in this rural area of Senegal and is significantly associated with a lower self-rated health in women but not men. In the absence of longitudinal studies in these populations and given the predictive value of SRH, this correlation suggests higher morbidity and mortality in women with hypertension."

These two species have been extensively studied and are well represented in culture collections, whereas cultures of other species of this family are lacking. We report on three new strains of Gephyrocapsa isolated into culture from samples from the Chilean coastal upwelling zone using a novel flow cytometric single-cell sorting technique. The strains were characterized by morphological analysis using scanning electron microscopy and phylogenetic analysis of 6 genes (nuclear 18S and 28S rDNA, plastidial 16S and tufA, and mitochondrial cox1 and cox3 genes). Morphometric features of the coccoliths indicate that these isolates are distinct from G. oceanica and best correspond to G. muellerae. Surprisingly, both plastidial and mitochondrial gene phylogenies placed these strains within the E. huxleyi clade and well separated from G. oceanica isolates, making Emiliania appear polyphyletic. The only nuclear sequence difference, 1bp in the 28S rDNA region, also grouped E. huxleyi with the new Gephyrocapsa isolates and apart from G. oceanica. Specifically, the G. muellerae morphotype strains clustered with the mitochondrial β clade of E. huxleyi, which, like G. muellerae, has been associated with cold (temperate and sub-polar) waters. Among putative evolutionary scenarios that could explain these results we discuss the possibility that E. huxleyi is not a valid taxonomic unit, or, alternatively the possibility of past hybridization and introgression between each E. huxleyi clade and older Gephyrocapsa clades. In either case, the results support the transfer of Emiliania to Gephyrocapsa. These results have important implications for relating morphological species concepts to ecological and evolutionary units of diversity."

Here, molecular simulation is employed to study the structural and dynamical properties of a typical ionic liquid confined in a realistic molecular model of amorphous chalcogenide with various pore sizes and surface chemistries. Using molecular dynamics in the isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble, we consider confinement conditions relevant to real samples. Both the structure and self-dynamics of the confined phase are found to depend on the surface-to-volume ratio of the host confining material. Consequently, most properties of the confined ionic liquid can be written as a linear combination of surface and bulk-like contributions, arising from the ions in contact with the surface and the ions in the pore center, respectively. On the other hand, collective dynamical properties such as the ionic conductivity remain close to their bulk counterpart and almost insensitive to pore size and surface chemistry. These results, which are in fair agreement with available experimental data, provide a basis for the development of novel applications using hybrid organic-inorganic solids consisting of ionic liquids confined in porous chalcogenides."

The strategy was validated using strains with known sequences. Then, 8 clinical strains displaying antifungal resistance and 23 sequential isolates collected from 10 patients receiving antifungal therapy were analysed.RESULTS: A total of 391 SNPs were detected, among which 6 coding SNPs were reported for the first time. Novel genetic alterations were detected in both azole and echinocandin resistance genes. A C. glabrata strain, which was resistant to echinocandins but highly susceptible to azoles, harboured an FKS2 S663P mutation plus a novel presumed loss-of-function CgPDR1 mutation. This isolate was from a patient with deep-seated and urinary candidiasis. Another C. glabrata isolate, with an MDR phenotype, carried a new FKS2 S663A mutation and a new putative gain-of-function CgPDR1 mutation (T370I); this isolate showed mutated (80%) and WT (20%) populations and was collected after 75 days of exposure to caspofungin from a patient who underwent complicated abdominal surgery.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that NGS can be used for extensive assessment of genetic mutations involved in antifungal resistance.

We present cryo-EM and X-ray structures of, respectively, apo- and vRNA bound La Crosse orthobunyavirus (LACV) polymerase that give atomic-resolution insight into how such RNPs perform RNA synthesis. The complementary 3' and 5' vRNA extremities are sequence specifically bound in separate sites on the polymerase. The 5' end binds as a stem-loop, allosterically structuring functionally important polymerase active site loops. Identification of distinct template and product exit tunnels allows proposal of a detailed model for template-directed replication with minimal disruption to the circularised RNP. The similar overall architecture and vRNA binding of monomeric LACV to heterotrimeric influenza polymerase, despite high sequence divergence, suggests that all sNSV polymerases have a common evolutionary origin and mechanism of RNA synthesis. These results will aid development of replication inhibitors of diverse, serious human pathogenic viruses."

Real time PCR for CMV DNA quantification is considered as a useful diagnostic tool, but its place in the diagnostic strategy is not clearly defined. To describe the clinical and paraclinical features of apparently immunocompetent patients with CMV gastrointestinal disease diagnosed by quantitative PCR results. In this retrospective study conducted in a 1500-bed tertiary care center, we have reviewed the case records of apparently immunocompetent patients with positive finding of CMV DNA in gastrointestinal biopsies with compatible symptoms and endoscopic findings. A total of 13 patients were included between January 2007 and December 2010. The median age was 81 years and 54% of patients had underlying immune modulating conditions. Diarrhea, hematochezia and dysphagia were the main reported symptoms and ulcers were the main endoscopic findings. The mean value of CMV DNA load in gastrointestinal biopsies was 3845 copies/μg total DNA (range, 15-15500). The highest values were found in two patients who were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in the following course of CMV infection. Clinical features were similar to previous series in which diagnosis was based on histopathological analysis. Elderly people are more commonly affected and a link with immune senescence is possible. Quantification of CMV DNA seems to be a useful tool for diagnosis when combined with clinical and endoscopic findings, but further studies are necessary to interpret quantitative values."

Remarkably, even without multipartite correlations, these states do violate Bell inequalities showing that there is no classical, i.e., local realistic model describing their properties."

Superior anticancer efficacy was observed through synergistic combination of promoted siRNA and DOX release upon irradiating the nanoplex formulation with 665 nm light. Our antitumor study shows that the synergistic effect of AuNRs nanoplex formulation with 665 nm light treatment is able to inhibit the in vivo tumor volume growth rate by 90%. The antitumor effect is contributed from the inactivation of K-Ras gene and thereby causing a profound synthesis (S) phase arrest in treated Panc-1 cells. Our study shows that the percentage of Panc-1 cells treated by nanoplex formulation with S phase is determined to be 35% and it is 17% much higher than that of Panc-1 cells without any treatments. The developed nanotherapy formulation here, that combines chemotherapy, RNA silencing and NIR window light-mediated therapy, will be seen to be the next natural step to be taken in the clinical research for improving the therapeutic outcomes of the pancreatic adenocarcinoma treatment."

During maturation, viral polyproteins are typically cleaved into the constituent proteins with different biological functions by highly specific proteases, and structural analyses at defined stages of this maturation process can provide clues for antiviral intervention strategies. Recombinant polyproteins that use similar mechanisms are emerging as powerful tools for producing hitherto inaccessible protein targets such as the influenza polymerase, for high-resolution structure determination by X-ray crystallography. Conversely, covalent linking of individual protein subunits into single polypeptide chains are exploited to overcome sample preparation bottlenecks. Moreover, synthetic polyproteins provide a promising tool to dissect dynamic folding of polypeptide chains into three-dimensional architectures in single-molecule structure analysis by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The recent use of natural and synthetic polyproteins in structural biology and major achievements are highlighted in this contribution."

Extending the control of absorption down to very low light levels and eventually to the single-photon regime is of great interest and yet remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate the coherent absorption of single photons in a deeply subwavelength 50% absorber. We show that while the absorption of photons from a travelling wave is probabilistic, standing wave absorption can be observed deterministically, with nearly unitary probability of coupling a photon into a mode of the material, for example, a localized plasmon when this is a metamaterial excited at the plasmon resonance. These results bring a better understanding of the coherent absorption process, which is of central importance for light harvesting, detection, sensing and photonic data processing applications."

In order to measure, understand, and categorize these correlations we extend the framework of the adiabatic elimination method. We show that, for the same parameters and times, two-time correlations can display two distinct behaviors depending on the observable considered: a fast exponential decay or a much slower dynamics. We exemplify these findings by studying strongly interacting bosons in a double well subjected to phase noise. While the single-particle correlations decay exponentially fast with time, the density-density correlations display slow aging dynamics. We also show that this slow relaxation regime is robust against particle losses. Additionally, we use the developed framework to show that the dynamic properties of dissipatively engineered states can be drastically different from their Hamiltonian counterparts."

However, over recent decades, there has been an expansion of schistosomiasis foci towards urban areas faced with a rapid and disordered urbanization. In Bamako, Mali, the impact of environmental change on vector-borne diseases such as schistosomiasis is not well known. This study sought to identify the presence of schistosomiasis transmission hotspots in Bamako. Using this perspective, we aimed to describe the risk factors of the endemization and maintenance of schistosomiasis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the six municipalities (communes) in Bamako. Environmental information was obtained from earth observation satellites in order to maximize ecological contrasts. Twenty-nine blocks of 200 m x 200 m were identified. We selected a school inside or nearest to each block for urine and stool samples examination. The study cohort was school children aged between eight and 15 years. The Kato-Katz technique and filtration were used for Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium ova research in stools and urine, respectively. The schools and snail breeding sites were georeferenced. Four malacological surveys were conducted between October 2011 and February 2012. Bivariate analysis was used to identify independent predictors of being infected with schistosomiasis.RESULTS: The prevalence rate of S. haematobium was 14.7% (n = 1,761) and that of S. mansoni 1.5% (n = 1,491). Overall, the urinary form was endemic in 76.6% of schools. The infection significantly varied between the municipalities (p &lt; 0.001). It was also more prevalent on the left side of the Niger River than the right side (17.4% vs. 9.5% respectively; p &lt; 0.001). The vicinity to snail breeding sites (OR = 3.677; 95% IC [2.765-4.889]; p &lt; 10 (-3) ) and parents' occupations (OR = 7.647; 95% IC [2.406-24.305]; p &lt; 0.001) were the most important risk factors associated with S. haematobium infection exposure. Biomphalaria pfeifferi, Bulinus truncatus, and B. globosus were the intermediate hosts captured. The schistosome natural infection rates (SNIRs), which were low or nil in October and November, rose to 2.8% in January and 8.3% in February for B. pfeifferi and B. truncatus, respectively.CONCLUSION: Our findings show that there is a high transmission risk for schistosomiasis in Bamako. Appropriate integrated control measures need to be introduced to control the transmission of this disease in the study area."

The spread of the mosquito Aedes albopictus in Europe is emblematic, because of its major role in the emergence and transmission of arboviruses such as dengue or chikungunya. Here, we modeled the spread of this mosquito species in France through a statistical framework taking advantage of a long-term surveillance dataset going back to the first observation of Ae. albopictus in the Metropolitan area. After validating the model, we show that human activities are especially important for mosquito dispersion while land use is a major factor for mosquito establishment. More importantly, we show that Ae. albopictus invasion is accelerating through time in this area, resulting in a geographic range extending further and further year after year. We also show that sporadic &quot;jump&quot; of Ae. albopictus in a new location far from the colonized area did not succeed in starting a new invasion front so far. Finally, we discuss on a potential adaptation to cooler climate and the risk of invasion into Northern latitudes."

Efforts to eliminate onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis in Central Africa through mass drug administration have been suspended because of ivermectin-associated serious adverse events, including death, in patients infected with the filarial parasite Loa loa. To safely administer ivermectin for onchocerciasis or lymphatic filariasis in regions co-endemic with L. loa, a strategy termed &quot;test and (not) treat&quot; has been proposed whereby those with high levels of L. loa microfilariae (&gt;30,000/ml) that put them at risk for life-threatening serious adverse events are identified and excluded from mass drug administration. To enable this, we developed a mobile phone-based video microscope that automatically quantifies L. loa microfilariae in whole blood loaded directly into a small glass capillary from a fingerprick without the need for conventional sample preparation or staining. This point-of-care device automatically captures and analyzes videos of microfilarial motion in whole blood using motorized sample scanning and onboard motion detection, minimizing input from health care workers and providing a quantification of microfilariae per milliliter of whole blood in under 2 min. To validate performance and usability of the mobile phone microscope, we tested 33 potentially Loa-infected patients in Cameroon and confirmed that automated counts correlated with manual thick smear counts (94% specificity; 100% sensitivity). Use of this technology to exclude patients from ivermectin-based treatment at the point of care in Loa-endemic regions would allow resumption/expansion of mass drug administration programs for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis in Central Africa."

The decade of follow-up enabled prognosis studies, an important step beyond association studies. In brief, left ventricular hypertrophy by cardiac MRI predicted incident heart failure and stroke. In the MESA Study, coronary artery calcium was a better predictor of coronary artery disease end points than the non-contrast-enhanced MRI scan. In the ICELAND MI substudy of the AGES-Reykjavik Study, a contrast-enhanced MRI scan detected many more unrecognized myocardial infarctions (MIs) (UMIs) than detected by electrocardiography and documented these UMI had adverse prognostic significance.

However, they may influence the outcome in patients with less effective pegylated interferon (pegIFN)-ribavirin (RBV) backbones. Using hepatitis C virus (HCV) population sequence analysis, we retrospectively investigated the prevalence of baseline nonstructural 3 (NS3) RAVs in a multicenter cohort of poor IFN-RBV responders (i.e., prior null responders or patients with a viral load decrease of &lt;1 log IU/ml during the pegIFN-RBV lead-in phase). The impact of the presence of these RAVs on the outcome of triple therapy was studied. Among 282 patients, the prevalances (95% confidence intervals) of baseline RAVs ranged from 5.7% (3.3% to 9.0%) to 22.0% (17.3% to 27.3%), depending to the algorithm used. Among mutations conferring a &gt;3-fold shift in 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for telaprevir or boceprevir, T54S was the most frequently detected mutation (3.9%), followed by A156T, R155K (0.7%), V36M, and V55A (0.35%). Mutations were more frequently found in patients infected with genotype 1a (7.5 to 23.6%) than 1b (3.3 to 19.8%) (P = 0.03). No other sociodemographic or viroclinical characteristic was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of RAVs. No obvious effect of baseline RAVs on viral load was observed. In this cohort of poor responders to IFN-RBV, no link was found with a sustained virological response to triple therapy, regardless of the algorithm used for the detection of mutations. Based on a cross-study comparison, baseline RAVs are not more frequent in poor IFN-RBV responders than in treatment-naive patients and, even in these difficult-to-treat patients, this study demonstrates no impact on treatment outcome, arguing against resistance analysis prior to treatment."

Using a new TDF formulation, we compared the pharmacokinetics of the standard dose with a dose of 150 mg once daily in HIV-infected adults.METHODS: This was an open-label pharmacokinetic study. Virologically suppressed HIV-infected adults with a creatinine clearance 30 to &lt;50 mL/minute receiving TDF 300 mg every 48 hours as part of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)- or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based regimen were enrolled. Intensive 48-hour blood sampling for pharmacokinetic assessment was performed at enrollment, after which the TDF dose was changed to 150 mg once daily. Two weeks later, 24-hour blood sampling was performed; subjects then returned to the standard dose. Tenofovir (TFV) pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a noncompartmental analysis.RESULTS: Forty adults (55% female) were enrolled: 20 receiving NNRTI-based and 20 receiving LPV/r-based treatment. Median age was 56 years (range, 44-65 years), weight 51 kg (range, 38-80 kg), and creatinine clearance 43.9 mL/minute (range, 30.9-49.7 mL/minute). The TFV geometric mean ratio of the area under the curve (AUC0-48h) for every 24 hours vs every 48 hours was 1.09 (90% confidence interval [CI], .98-1.22) and 1.00 (90% CI, .92-1.09) for patients receiving NNRTI- and LPV/r-based treatment, respectively. Concomitant LPV/r use markedly increased TFV plasma concentrations, and AUC0-48h was 67% higher with the standard dose, whereas no differences in intracellular TFV diphosphate concentrations were observed. All subjects remained virologically suppressed, and no drug-related adverse events were reported.CONCLUSIONS: TDF 150 mg every 24 hours provides comparable systemic exposure to the standard dose of 300 mg every 48 hours in patients with moderate renal impairment.CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01671982."

The patients received once-daily treatment (375 mg aprepitant or placebo by oral administration) for 2 weeks and were followed off drug for 4 weeks.RESULTS: There were no significant changes in the plasma viremia or CD4(+) T cells during the dosing period. Aprepitant treatment was associated with significant decreases of median within patient change in percentages of CD4(+) T cells expressing programmed death 1 (-4.8%; P = 0.04), plasma substance P (-34.0 pg/ml; P = 0.05) and soluble CD163 (-563 ng/ml; P = 0.02), with no significant changes in the placebo arm. Mean peak aprepitant plasma concentration on day 14 was 7.6 ± 3.1 μg/ml. The use of aprepitant was associated with moderate increases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein (median change = +31 mg/dl, P = 0.01; +26 mg/dl, P = 0.02; +3 mg/dl, P = 0.02, respectively).CONCLUSION: Aprepitant was safe and well tolerated. At the dose used in this proof-of-concept phase IB study, aprepitant did not show a significant antiviral activity. Aprepitant-treated patients had decreased numbers of CD4(+) programmed death 1-positive cells and decreased plasma levels of substance P and soluble CD163, suggesting that blockade of the neurokinin 1 receptor pathway has a role in modulating monocyte activation in HIV infection. Prospective studies in virologically-suppressed individuals are warranted to evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of aprepitant. Exposures exceeding those attained in this trial are more likely to elicit clinical benefit."

Here, we use molecular simulation and statistical mechanics to show that continuum description--Darcy's law--fails to predict transport in shales nanoporous matrix (kerogen). The non-Darcy behaviour arises from strong adsorption in kerogen and the breakdown of hydrodynamics at the nanoscale, which contradict the assumption of viscous flow. Despite this complexity, all permeances collapse on a master curve with an unexpected dependence on alkane length. We rationalize this non-hydrodynamic behaviour using a molecular description capturing the scaling of permeance with alkane length and density. These results, which stress the need for a change of paradigm from classical descriptions to nanofluidic transport, have implications for shale gas but more generally for transport in nanoporous media."

Disentangling their respective contributions is currently seen as a fundamental gap in our knowledge. Here, we take the advantage of a rare semi-natural experiment context provided by the emergence of the West Nile Virus (WNV) in North America. Focusing on the pathogen emergence period, we combine datasets from (i) wild birds exposed to WNV in an urban zoo to evaluate the species intrinsic receptivity to WNV infection in an environment where exposure to WNV vectors can be assumed to be relatively homogenous for all captive species, and (ii) from free-ranging birds in their natural habitat where species ecological traits is expected to influence their exposure to WNV vectors. We show that ecological trait and intrinsic receptivity to infection both contribute similarly to the species variation in WNV seroprevalence, but considering only one of them can lead to erroneous conclusions. We then argue that degree of pathogen host specialization could be a fundamental factor for the respective contribution of species exposure and receptivity for numerous pathogens."

Gabon constitutes an important part of the range of western central African great ape subspecies (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla), but has not been studied so far. In the present study, the diversity of Plasmodium species circulating in great apes in Gabon was analysed.METHODS: The analysis of 1,261 faecal samples from 791 chimpanzees and 470 gorillas collected from 24 sites all over Gabon was performed. Plasmodium infections were characterized by amplification and sequencing of a portion of the Plasmodium cytochrome b gene.RESULTS: The analysis of the 1,261 samples revealed that at least six Plasmodium species circulate in great apes in Gabon (Plasmodium praefalciparum, Plasmodium gorA (syn Plasmodium adleri), Plasmodium gorB (syn Plasmodium blacklocki) in gorillas and Plasmodium gaboni, P. reichenowi and Plasmodium billcollinsi in chimpanzees). No new phylogenetic lineages were discovered. The average infection rate was 21.3% for gorillas and 15.4% for chimpanzees. A logistic regression showed that the probability of infection was significantly dependent on the freshness of the droppings but not of the host species or of the average pluviometry of the months of collection."

We estimated the incidence of new-onset diabetes and assessed the association between individual ARVs and ARV combinations, and diabetes in a large cohort in Thailand.METHODS: We selected all HIV-1-infected, nondiabetic, antiretroviral-naive adults enrolled in the Program for HIV Prevention and Treatment cohort (NCT00433030) between January 2000 and December 2011. Diabetes was defined as confirmed fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL or random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL. Incidence was the number of cases divided by the total number of person-years of follow-up. Association between ARVs and ARV combinations, and new-onset diabetes was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: Overall, 1594 HIV-infected patients (76% female) were included. Median age at antiretroviral therapy initiation was 32.5 years. The incidence rate of diabetes was 5.0 per 1000 person-years of follow-up (95% confidence interval: 3.8 to 6.6) (53 cases). In analyses adjusted for potential confounders, exposure to stavudine + didanosine [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 3.9; P = 0.001] and cumulative exposure ≥1 year to zidovudine (aHR = 2.3 vs. no exposure; P = 0.009) were associated with a higher risk of diabetes. Conversely, cumulative exposure ≥1 year to tenofovir (aHR = 0.4 vs. no exposure; P = 0.02) and emtricitabine (aHR = 0.4 vs. no exposure; P = 0.03) were associated with a lower risk.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of diabetes in this predominantly female, young, lean population was relatively low. Although stavudine and didanosine have now been phased out in most antiretroviral therapy programs, our analysis suggests a higher risk of diabetes with zidovudine, frequently prescribed today in resource-limited settings."

Moreover, the early biting transmission and increased resistance to insecticides might compromise strategies relying on vector control. Consequently, monitoring of vector behaviour and insecticide efficacy is needed to assess the effectiveness of strategies aiming at malaria control. This eventually led to an entomological survey in two villages with high malaria prevalence in this region.METHODS: During rainy, 2011 and dry season 2012, mosquitoes were collected in Engari and Kigorogoro, Kazo subcounty, using human landing collection, morning indoor resting collection, pyrethrum spray collection and larval collection. Circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in female Anopheles mosquitoes was detected using ELISA assay. Bioassays to monitor Anopheles resistance to insecticides were performed.RESULTS: Of the 1,021 female Anopheles species captured, 62% (632) were Anopheles funestus and 36% (371) were Anopheles gambiae s.l. The most common species were Anopheles gambiae s.l. in Engari (75%) and A. funestus in Kigorogoro (83%). Overall, P. falciparum prevalence was 2.9% by ELISA. The daily entomological inoculation rates were estimated at 0.17 and 0.58 infected bites/person/night during rainy and dry season respectively in Engari, and 0.81 infected bites/person/night in Kigorogoro during dry season. In both areas and seasons, an unusually early evening biting peak was observed between 6 - 8 p.m. In Engari, insecticide bioassays showed 85%, 34% and 12% resistance to DDT during the rainy season, dry season and to deltamethrin during the dry season, respectively. In Kigorogoro, 13% resistance to DDT and to deltamethrin was recorded. There was no resistance observed to bendiocarb and pirimiphos methyl.CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity of mosquito distribution, entomological indicators and resistance to insecticides in villages with high malaria prevalence highlight the need for a long-term vector control programme and monitoring of insecticide resistance in Uganda. The early evening biting habits of Anopheles combined with resistance to DDT and deltamethrin observed in this study suggest that use of impregnated bed nets alone is insufficient as a malaria control strategy, urging the need for additional interventions in this area of high transmission."

We find that the shear strength is independent of the size span, but unexpectedly, it declines with increasing shape polydispersity. At the same time, the solid fraction is an increasing function of both the size span and the shape polydispersity. Hence, the densest and loosest packings have the same shear strength. At the scale of the particles and their contacts, we analyze the connectivity of particles, force transmission, and friction mobilization as well as their anisotropies. We show that stronger forces are carried by larger particles and propped by an increasing number of small particles. The independence of shear strength with regard to size span is shown to be a consequence of contact network self-organization, with the falloff of contact anisotropy compensated by increasing force anisotropy."

This model employs statistical mechanics to upscale molecular simulation and describe adsorption and transport at larger time and length scales. Using atom-scale simulations, which capture the changes in adsorption and transport with temperature, pressure, pore size, etc., this approach does not assume any adsorption or flow type. Moreover, by relating the local chemical potential μ(r) and density ρ(r), the present model accounts for adsorption effects and possible changes in the confined fluid state upon transport. This model constitutes a bottom-up framework of adsorption and transport in multiscale materials as it (1) describes the adsorption-transport interplay, (2) accounts for the hydrodynamics breakdown at the nm scale, and (3) is multiscale."

It is important to identify risk factors for second-line regimen failure.METHODS: HIV-infected children initiating protease inhibitor (PI)-containing second-line ART within the Program for HIV Prevention and Treatment observational cohort study in Thailand between 2002 and 2010 were included. Treatment failure was defined as confirmed HIV type 1 RNA load &gt;400 copies/mL after at least 6 months on second-line regimen or death. Adherence was assessed by drug plasma levels and patient self-report. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for failure.RESULTS: A total of 111 children started a PI-based second-line regimen, including 59 girls (53%). Median first-line ART duration was 1.9 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.4-3.3 years), and median age at second-line initiation was 10.7 years (IQR, 6.3-13.4 years). Fifty-four children (49%) experienced virologic failure, and 2 (2%) died. The risk of treatment failure 24 months after second-line initiation was 41%. In multivariate analyses, failure was independently associated with exposure to first-line ART for &gt;2 years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.8; P = .03), age &gt;13 years (aHR, 2.9; P &lt; .001), body mass index-for-age z score &lt; -2 standard deviations at second-line initiation (aHR, 2.8; P = .03), and undetectable drug levels within 6 months following second-line initiation (aHR, 4.5; P &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS: Children with longer exposure to first-line ART, entry to adolescence, underweight, and/or undetectable drug levels were at higher risk of failing second-line ART and thus should be closely monitored."

Despite increased vigilance and preparedness, HFRS outbreaks in 2010, 2011, and 2012 were larger than ever, with a total of 3,938 confirmed HFRS cases and 88 deaths in 2010 and 2011.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data on HFRS cases and weather were collected monthly from 2005 to 2012, along with active rodent monitoring. Wavelet analyses were performed to assess the temporal relationship between HFRS incidence, rodent density and climatic factors over the study period. Results showed that HFRS cases correlated to rodent density, rainfall, and temperature with 2, 3 and 4-month lags, respectively. Using a Bayesian time-series Poisson adjusted model, we fitted the HFRS outbreaks among humans for risk assessment in Xi'an. The best models included seasonality, autocorrelation, rodent density 2 months previously, and rainfall 2 to 3 months previously. Our models well reflected the epidemic characteristics by one step ahead prediction, out-of-sample.CONCLUSIONS: In addition to a strong seasonal pattern, HFRS incidence was correlated with rodent density and rainfall, indicating that they potentially drive the HFRS outbreaks. Future work should aim to determine the mechanism underlying the seasonal pattern and autocorrelation. However, this model can be useful in risk management to provide early warning of potential outbreaks of this disease."

The structure consists of a graphene nanoribbon, Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), which exhibits a strongly resonant transmission of electrons of specific energies. In the first regime of operation (that of a linear photodetector), low intensity light couples two resonant energy levels, resulting in scattering and differential transmission of current with an external quantum efficiency of up to 5.2%. In the second regime of operation, full current switching is caused by the phase decoherence of the current due to a strong photon flux in one or both of the interferometer arms in the same MZI structure. Graphene QI photodetectors have several distinct advantages: they are of very small size, they do not require p- and n-doped regions, and they exhibit a high external quantum efficiency."

Spectral analysis of the data sets reveals large and abrupt changes in sea surface and bottom water conditions with a ~70-year cyclicity, associated with the Mertz Glacier Tongue calving and regrowth dynamics. Geological data and atmospheric reanalysis, however, suggest that sea ice conditions in the polynya were also very sensitive to changes in surface winds in relation to the recent intensification of the Southern Annular Mode."

In rural and suburban areas, traditional rice farming and intensive pig breeding provide an ideal environment for both mosquito development and the transmission of JEV among human beings. Combining surveillance data for mosquito vectors, human JE cases, and environmental conditions in Changsha, China, 2004-2009, generalized threshold models were constructed to project the mosquito and JE dynamics. Temperature and rainfall were found to be closely associated with mosquito density at 1, and 4month lag, respectively. The two thresholds, maximum temperature of 22-23°C for mosquito development and minimum temperature of 25-26°C for JEV transmission, play key roles in the ecology of JEV. The model predicts that, in the upper regime, a 1g/m(3) increase in absolute humidity would on average increase human cases by 68-84%. A shift in mosquito species composition in 2007 was observed, and possibly caused by a drought. Effective predictive models could be used in risk management to provide early warnings for potential JE transmission."

The statistical scatter of compressive strength is well described by the Weibull distribution function with a shape parameter varying from 6 to 10 depending on cell shape distribution. We show that this distribution may be understood in terms of percolating critical intercellular contacts. We propose a random-walk model of critical contacts that leads to particle size dependence of the compressive strength in good agreement with our simulation data."

Under these conditions, no background reaction took place (i.e., control experiment without DNA). Both heteroaromatic aldehydes (e.g., 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde) and aromatic aldehydes bearing strong or moderate electron-withdrawing groups reacted satisfactorily with nitromethane obeying first order kinetics and affording the corresponding β-nitroalcohols in good yields within 24 h. In contrast, aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes having electron-donating groups either did not react or were poorly converted. Moreover, we discovered that a number of metal-free organic buffers efficiently promote the Henry reaction when they were used as reaction media without adding external catalysts. This constitutes an important observation because the influence of organic buffers in chemical processes has been traditionally underestimated."

Eighteen-month HIV-free survival of infants HIV-negative at 2 weeks of age was assessed by feeding patterns (replacement feeding from birth, BFC &lt;3 months, BFC ≥3 months).RESULTS: Of the 753 infants alive and HIV-negative at 2 weeks, 28 acquired infection and 47 died by 18 months. Overall HIV-free survival at 18 months was 0.91 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-0.93]. In the short-course ARV arm, HIV-free survival (0.88; CI: 0.84-0.91) did not differ by feeding patterns. In the triple ARV arm, overall HIV-free survival was 0.93 (CI: 0.90-0.95) and BFC &lt;3 months was associated with lower HIV-free survival than BFC ≥3 months (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.36; CI: 0.15-0.83) and replacement feeding (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.20; CI: 0.04-0.94). In the triple ARV arm, 4 of 9 transmissions occurred after reported BFC (and 5 of 19 in the short-course arm), indicating that some women continued breastfeeding after interruption of ARV prophylaxis.CONCLUSIONS: In resource-constrained settings, early weaning has previously been associated with higher infant mortality. We show that, even with maternal triple-ARV prophylaxis during breastfeeding, early weaning remains associated with lower HIV-free survival, driven in particular by increased mortality."

This method however entails significant drawbacks such as scarce availability and poor reproducibility of the sample, low sampling rate, and tedious assay setup.METHODS: The objective of the present work is to propose an alternative method that overcomes these issues by integrating an experimental model of the skin (artificial stratum corneum) and online optical sensors into a microfluidic device.RESULTS: The measurement of the diffusion profile followed by the calculation of the permeability coefficients and time lag were performed on seven different molecules and obtained data positively fit with those available from literature on human skin penetration. The coating of the lipid mixture to generate the artificial stratum corneum also proved robust and reproducible. The results show that the proposed device is able to give fast, real-time, accurate, and reproducible data in a user-friendly manner, and can be produced at a large scale.CONCLUSION: These assets should help both the cosmetics and pharmaceutics fields where the skin is the target or a pathway of a formulated compound, by allowing more candidate molecules or formulations to be assessed during the various stages of their development."

We hypothesized that contrast-enhanced ultrasound with microbubbles (MBs) targeted to GP IIb/IIIa could be used to detect and quantify activated platelets on the surface of advanced plaques.METHODS AND RESULTS: A mouse model of advanced atherosclerosis was generated by maintaining apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice on a hypercholesterolemic diet (HCD). The three other experimental groups consisted of ApoE(-/-) and wild-type (C57BL/6) mice fed a normal chow diet and C57BL/6 mice on an HCD diet. Plaque formation was confirmed by histological and immunohistochemical methods using light, fluorescence, and electron microscopy.

While crystallization in the atomistically smooth pore consists in a surface-induced phase transition occurring at a temperature larger than the bulk, crystallization in the disordered pores, which is only partial as it is spatially restricted to the pore center, occurs through homogeneous crystallization. These results shed light on solidification in pores by showing that there is a crossover between surface-induced and homogeneous crystallization upon increasing the surface disorder of the host material. In the latter case, the Gibbs-Thomson equation, in which crystallization is assumed to occur when the crystal size equals the pore size corrected for the thickness of the unfreezable layer at the pore surface, is in reasonable agreement with the observed freezing temperature."

However, the task of determining whether or not an image of an experimental system is hyperuniform is experimentally challenging due to finite-resolution, noise, and sample-size effects that influence characterization measurements. Here we explore these issues, employing video optical microscopy to study hyperuniformity phenomena in disordered two-dimensional jammed packings of soft spheres. Using a combination of experiment and simulation we characterize the possible adverse effects of particle polydispersity, image noise, and finite-size effects on the assignment of hyperuniformity, and we develop a methodology that permits improved diagnosis of hyperuniformity from real-space measurements. The key to this improvement is a simple packing reconstruction algorithm that incorporates particle polydispersity to minimize the free volume. In addition, simulations show that hyperuniformity in finite-sized samples can be ascertained more accurately in direct space than in reciprocal space. Finally, our experimental colloidal packings of soft polymeric spheres are shown to be effectively hyperuniform."

In other words, despite side-side contacts tending to hinder relative particle rotations, the solid fraction under quasistatic shear coincides with that of isotropic random close packings of pentagonal particles. Properties of polygonal grains are thus similar to those of disks in that respect. We argue that continuous reshuffling of the force-bearing network leads to frequent collapsing events at the microscale, thereby causing the macroscopic dilatancy to vanish. Despite such rearrangements, the shear flow favors an anisotropic structure that is at the origin of the ability of the system to sustain shear stress."

However, the impact of variability in adherence to ART on the immunovirological response does not seem to have been investigated yet.METHODS: Monthly adherence data (November 1999 to April 2009) from 317 HIV-1 infected patients enrolled in the Senegalese ART initiative were analyzed. Latent-class trajectory models were used to build typical trajectories for the average adherence and the standardized variance of adherence. The relationship between the standardized variance of adherence and each of the change in CD4 cell count, the change in viral load, and mortality were investigated using, respectively, a mixed linear regression, a mixed logistic regression, and a Cox model with time-dependent covariates. All the models were adjusted on the average adherence.RESULTS: Three latent trajectories for the average adherence and three for the standardized variance of adherence were identified. The increase in CD4 cell count and the increase in the percentage of undetectable viral loads were negatively associated with the standardized variance of adherence but positively associated with the average adherence. The risk of death decreased significantly with the increase in the average adherence but increased significantly with the increase of the standardized variance of adherence.CONCLUSIONS: The impacts of the level and the variability of adherence on the immunovirological response and survival justify the inclusion of these aspects into the process of patient education: adherence should be both high and constant."

Methods addressing this problem commonly search for clusters of pattern occurrences that are statistically significant. A measure of statistical significance is the P-value of a number of pattern occurrences, i.e. the probability to find at least S occurrences of words from a pattern in a random text of length N generated according to a given probability model. All words of the pattern are supposed to be of same length.RESULTS: We present a novel algorithm SufPref that computes an exact P-value for Hidden Markov models (HMM). The algorithm is based on recursive equations on text sets related to pattern occurrences; the equations can be used for any probability model. The algorithm inductively traverses a specific data structure, an overlap graph. The nodes of the graph are associated with the overlaps of words from . The edges are associated to the prefix and suffix relations between overlaps. An originality of our data structure is that pattern need not be explicitly represented in nodes or leaves. The algorithm relies on the Cartesian product of the overlap graph and the graph of HMM states; this approach is analogous to the automaton approach from JBCB 4: 553-569. The gain in size of SufPref data structure leads to significant improvements in space and time complexity compared to existent algorithms. The algorithm SufPref was implemented as a C++ program; the program can be used both as Web-server and a stand alone program for Linux and Windows. The program interface admits special formats to describe probability models of various types (HMM, Bernoulli, Markov); a pattern can be described with a list of words, a PSSM, a degenerate pattern or a word and a number of mismatches. It is available at http://server2.lpm.org.ru/bio/online/sf/. The program was applied to compare sensitivity and specificity of methods for TFBS prediction based on P-values computed for Bernoulli models, Markov models of orders one and two and HMMs. The experiments show that the methods have approximately the same qualities."

When the associated elastic energy cost is not too expensive, this high potential can be enhanced by the existence of an omnipresent magnetoelastic coupling. Here we report experimental and theoretical evidence of a nonnegligible magnetoelastic coupling in one of these fascinating materials, SrCu2(BO3)2 (SCBO). First, using pulsed-field transversal and longitudinal magnetostriction measurements we show that its physical dimensions, indeed, mimic closely its unusually rich field-induced magnetism. Second, using density functional-based calculations we find that the driving force behind the magnetoelastic coupling is the CuOCu superexchange angle that, due to the orthogonal Cu(2+) dimers acting as pantographs, can shrink significantly (0.44%) with minute (0.01%) variations in the lattice parameters. With this original approach we also find a reduction of ∼ 10% in the intradimer exchange integral J, enough to make predictions for the highly magnetized states and the effects of applied pressure on SCBO."

At this threshold, the sensitivity of ELISA was 97.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 90.0-99.9%), its specificity was 91.3% (95% CI 85.0-95.5%), and HCV seroprevalence rate was 7.3% (56/762) (95% CI 5.6-9.4%). Among 57 HCV-seropositive patients with available INNO-LIA results, false reactivity was identified in 14 (24.6%), resolved HCV infection in two (3.5%), possible acute HCV infections in nine (15.8%) and likely chronic HCV infections in 32 (56.1%) patients. HCV core Ag was undetectable in 14/15 (93.3%) specimens that tested negative for HCV RNA whereas it was quantified in 34 (out of 39, 87.2%) samples that tested positive for HCV RNA.CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides comprehensive guidance for HCV testing in Gabon, and will help greatly clinicians to improve case definitions for both the notification and surveillance of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV."

The monosaccharide is non-enzymatically converted to 4-deoxy-L-ery thro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid (DEH), then reduced to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate (KDG) by a specific reductase, and metabolized through the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Recently, the NADPH-dependent reductase A1-R that belongs to short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) superfamily was identified as the DEH-reductase in Sphingomonas sp. A1. We have subsequently noticed that an SDR-like enzyme gene, flred, occurred in the genome of an alginolytic bacterium Flavobacterium sp. strain UMI-01. In the present study, we report on the deduced amino-acid sequence of flred and DEH-reducing activity of recombinant FlRed. The deduced amino-acid sequence of flred comprised 254 residues and showed 34% amino-acid identities to that of A1-R from Sphingomonas sp. A1 and 80%-88% to those of SDR-like enzymes from several alginolytic bacteria. Common sequence motifs of SDR-superfamily enzymes, e.g., the catalytic tetrad Asn-Lys-Tyr-Ser and the cofactor-binding sequence Thr-Gly-x-x-x-Gly-x-Gly in Rossmann fold, were completely conserved in FlRed. On the other hand, an Arg residue that determined the NADPH-specificity of Sphingomonas A1-R was replaced by Glu in FlRed. Thus, we investigated cofactor-preference of FlRed using a recombinant enzyme. As a result, the recombinant FlRed (recFlRed) was found to show high specificity to NADH. recFlRed exhibited practically no activity toward variety of aldehyde, ketone, keto ester, keto acid and aldose substrates except for DEH. On the basis of these results, we conclude that FlRed is the NADH-dependent DEH-specific SDR of Flavobacterium sp. strain UMI-01."

Follow-up of creatinine variation in HIV-positive adults remains a challenge in order to prevent renal complications.OBJECTIVES: To determine the long term RCV of creatinine in HIV-positive adults receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) according to the use of tenofovir or ritonavir.DESIGN AND METHODS: Longitudinal study of 24 months that include 124 HIV-positive patients followed in HIV outpatient unit. Plasma creatinine was measured at 0, 6, 12 and 24 months in order to calculate the RCV.RESULTS: In the whole group, a 24-month RCV of creatinine was 22.5%. Whatever the ART, the index of individuality was &lt;0.6. Significantly higher RCV of creatinine was observed in patients receiving the association tenofovir and ritonavir (28%) compared to the patients receiving i) tenofovir without ritonavir (21.9%), ii) no tenofovir but ritonavir (22.2%), and iii) no tenofovir and no ritonavir (19.7%).CONCLUSIONS: The low value of index of individuality pinpointed that RCV should be used to identify critical change in serial creatinine results in HIV-positive adults. RCV of creatinine under ART was around 20% but reached 28% in case of association of tenofovir and ritonavir."

We evaluated the association of this parameter with 10-year outcome within the APROCO-COPILOTE cohort.METHODS: Prospective data from 1281 HIV-1-infected patients who started a first protease inhibitor-containing regimen in 1997-1999 were analyzed. Patients with baseline plasma viral load (pVL) &gt; 500 copies per milliliter and at least 2 pVL measures from the eighth month of follow-up were selected. VCY was calculated individually over the follow-up as the area under the pVL curve. Multivariate Cox models analyzed the relation between all-cause mortality and the following variables: age, sex, geographical origin, transmission group, HIV infection duration, ART-naive, pVL at baseline, time-dependent CD4 count, and VCY.RESULTS: Nine hundred seventy-nine patients were followed up for a median of 10 years (interquartile range: 5-11.5). At baseline, median (interquartile range) values for duration of HIV infection, pVL, and CD4 cell count were 43 (4-95) months, 4.6 (3.9-5.2) log10 copies per milliliter, and 278 (125-416) cells per cubic millimeter, respectively. At censoring date, 77 patients (8%) had died. VCY &gt;1.4 log10 copies × yrs/mL was an independent predictor of death (hazard ratio: 2.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 3.5), which was no longer the case after adjustment for the latest pVL value [risk ratio (RR): 1.2 for 1 additional log10 copies per milliliter; 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 1.4].CONCLUSIONS: VCY was associated with mortality in HIV-infected patients under combined antiretroviral therapy but did not overweigh the predictive value of the latest pVL. VCY might be more useful as a marker of persistent viral replication than for routine clinical care."

The objectives of the present substudy were to assess the relationship between trough concentrations of tenofovir in plasma collected after 24 h (C24) and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) calculated by the different formulae that are available.METHODS: The criteria for eligibility were those of the DAYANA trial, recruiting naive patients. The four tenofovir regimens were: Group 1, tenofovir/emtricitabine/nevirapine; Group 2, tenofovir/lopinavir/ritonavir; Group 3, tenofovir/emtricitabine/zidovudine; and Group 4, tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz. The C24 of tenofovir was determined using LC-MS/MS. The eGFR was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formulae.RESULTS: The median C24 of tenofovir was 42 ng/mL. The C24 of tenofovir was higher with lopinavir/ritonavir than with the other three regimens: at Week 4, 84 ng/mL versus 25 ng/mL; and at Week 48, 81 ng/mL versus 52 ng/mL. The baseline merged eGFR was 98.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2) with the CKD-EPI equation. Only the mean changes in eGFR in Group 2 differed from the absolute value of zero (-8.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) with the CKD-EPI equation between baseline and Week 48. The Cockcroft-Gault formula is inappropriate for these African patients because it underestimated the baseline eGFR and overestimated the changes in eGFR between baseline and Week 48.CONCLUSIONS: In this population of mostly female HIV-1-infected African patients, tenofovir plasma overexposure was associated with PI/ritonavir and a time-dependent decrease in eGFR, probably via an inhibition of MRP2/MRP4 efflux transporters. The close monitoring over time of the eGFR using MDRD or CKD-EPI calculations and by using other biomarkers of renal disorder should be proposed as an alternative to therapeutic drug monitoring in resource-limited countries."

"24710426";"UMI";"UMI";"Nature communications";13;2014;"Structural basis for oligomerization of auxin transcriptional regulators.";"The plant hormone auxin is a key morphogenetic regulator acting from embryogenesis onwards. Transcriptional events in response to auxin are mediated by the auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors and the Aux/IAA (IAA) transcriptional repressors. At low auxin concentrations, IAA repressors associate with ARF proteins and recruit corepressors that prevent auxin-induced gene expression. At higher auxin concentrations, IAAs are degraded and ARFs become free to regulate auxin-responsive genes. The interaction between ARFs and IAAs is thus central to auxin signalling and occurs through the highly conserved domain III/IV present in both types of proteins. Here, we report the crystal structure of ARF5 domain III/IV and reveal the molecular determinants of ARF-IAA interactions. We further provide evidence that ARFs have the potential to oligomerize, a property that could be important for gene regulation in response to auxin."

Here we explore the genomic basis of P. falciparum adaptation to human hosts by fully sequencing the genome of the closely related chimpanzee parasite species P. reichenowi, and obtaining partial sequence data from a more distantly related chimpanzee parasite (P. gaboni). The close relationship between P. reichenowi and P. falciparum is emphasized by almost complete conservation of genomic synteny, but against this strikingly conserved background we observe major differences at loci involved in erythrocyte invasion. The organization of most virulence-associated multigene families, including the hypervariable var genes, is broadly conserved, but P. falciparum has a smaller subset of rif and stevor genes whose products are expressed on the infected erythrocyte surface. Genome-wide analysis identifies other loci under recent positive selection, but a limited number of changes at the host-parasite interface may have mediated host switching."

BU emergence and distribution is linked to aquatic ecosystems in tropical and subtropical countries, especially to swampy and flooded areas. Aquatic animal organisms are likely to play a role either as host reservoirs or vectors of the bacilli. However, information on MU ecological dynamics, both in space and time, is dramatically lacking. As a result, the ecology of the disease agent, and consequently its mode of transmission, remains largely unknown, which jeopardizes public health attempts for its control. The objective of this study was to gain insight on MU environmental distribution and colonization of aquatic organisms through time.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Longitudinal sampling of 32 communities of aquatic macro-invertebrates and vertebrates was conducted from different environments in two BU endemic regions in Cameroon during 12 months. As a result, 238,496 individuals were classified and MU presence was assessed by qPCR in 3,084 sample-pools containing these aquatic organisms. Our study showed a broad distribution of MU in all ecosystems and taxonomic groups, with important regional differences in its occurrence. Colonization dynamics fluctuated along the year, with the highest peaks in August and October. The large variations observed in the colonization dynamics of different taxonomic groups and aquatic ecosystems suggest that the trends shown here are the result of complex ecological processes that need further investigation.PERSPECTIVES: This is the largest field study on MU ecology to date, providing the first detailed description of its spatio-temporal dynamics in different aquatic ecosystems within BU endemic regions. We argue that coupling this data with fine-scale epidemiological data through statistical and mathematical models will provide a major step forward in the understanding of MU ecology and mode of transmission."
"24935946";"UMI";"UMI";"The EMBO journal";6;2014;"The physiological target for LeuRS translational quality control is norvaline.";"The fidelity of protein synthesis depends on the capacity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) to couple only cognate amino acid-tRNA pairs. If amino acid selectivity is compromised, fidelity can be ensured by an inherent AARS editing activity that hydrolyses mischarged tRNAs. Here, we show that the editing activity of Escherichia coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase (EcLeuRS) is not required to prevent incorrect isoleucine incorporation. Rather, as shown by kinetic, structural and in vivo approaches, the prime biological function of LeuRS editing is to prevent mis-incorporation of the non-standard amino acid norvaline. This conclusion follows from a reassessment of the discriminatory power of LeuRS against isoleucine and the demonstration that a LeuRS editing-deficient E. coli strain grows normally in high concentrations of isoleucine but not under oxygen deprivation conditions when norvaline accumulates to substantial levels. Thus, AARS-based translational quality control is a key feature for bacterial adaptive response to oxygen deprivation. The non-essential role for editing under normal bacterial growth has important implications for the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents targeting the LeuRS editing site."

Here, we explore the possibility of using networks of ecological interactions among potential host species to identify the particular disease-source species to target to break down transmission of such pathogens. We fit a mathematical model on prevalence data of Mycobacterium ulcerans in western Africa and we show that removing the most abundant taxa for this category of pathogen is not an optimal strategy to decrease the transmission of the mycobacterium within aquatic ecosystems. On the contrary, we reveal that the removal of some taxa, especially Oligochaeta worms, can clearly reduce rates of pathogen transmission and should be considered as a keystone organism for its transmission because it leads to a substantial reduction in pathogen prevalence regardless of the network topology. Besides its potential application for the understanding of M. ulcerans ecology, we discuss about how networks of species interactions can modulate transmission of multi-host pathogens."

These observations suggest that the capacity to mount Ab responses to the 2F5 epitope is mitigated by tolerance, but such capacity may be latent in the pretolerance and/or anergic B cell pools. In this study, we use B cell tetramer reagents to track the frequencies of B cells that recognize the HIV-1 2F5 epitope (SP62): in C57BL/6 mice, SP62-binding transitional B cells are readily identified in bone marrow but are lost during subsequent development. Unsurprisingly then, immunization with SP62 immunogen does not elicit significant humoral responses in normal C57BL/6 mice. Reconstitution of Rag1(null) mice with normal congenic B cells that have matured in vitro restores the capacity to mount significant serum Ab and germinal center responses to this HIV-1 epitope. These B cell cultures are permissive for the development of autoreactive B cells and support the development of SP62-specific B cell compartments normally lost in 2F5 Ab knockin mice. The recovery of humoral responses to the 2F5/SP62 epitope of HIV-1 by reconstitution with B cells containing forbidden, autoreactive clones provides direct evidence that normal C57BL/6 mice latently possess the capacity to generate humoral responses to a conserved, neutralizing HIV-1 epitope."

The D4/A20 heterodimer is the DNA polymerase co-factor whose function is essential for processive DNA synthesis. Genetic and biochemical data have established that residues located in the N-terminus of A20 are critical for binding to D4. However, no information regarding the residues of D4 involved in A20 binding is yet available. We expressed and purified the complex formed by D4 and the first 50 amino acids of A20 (D4/A20₁₋₅₀). We showed that whereas D4 forms homodimers in solution when expressed alone, D4/A20₁₋₅₀ clearly behaves as a heterodimer. The crystal structure of D4/A20₁₋₅₀ solved at 1.85 Å resolution reveals that the D4/A20 interface (including residues 167 to 180 and 191 to 206 of D4) partially overlaps the previously described D4/D4 dimer interface. A20₁₋₅₀ binding to D4 is mediated by an α-helical domain with important leucine residues located at the very N-terminal end of A20 and a second stretch of residues containing Trp43 involved in stacking interactions with Arg167 and Pro173 of D4. Point mutations of the latter residues disturb D4/A20₁₋₅₀ formation and reduce significantly thermal stability of the complex. Interestingly, small molecule docking with anti-poxvirus inhibitors selected to interfere with D4/A20 binding could reproduce several key features of the D4/A20₁₋₅₀ interaction. Finally, we propose a model of D4/A20₁₋₅₀ in complex with DNA and discuss a number of mutants described in the literature, which affect DNA synthesis. Overall, our data give new insights into the assembly of the poxvirus DNA polymerase cofactor and may be useful for the design and rational improvement of antivirals targeting the D4/A20 interface."
"25176635";"UMI";"UMI";"Current biology : CB";3;2014;"A haploid system of sex determination in the brown alga Ectocarpus sp.";"BACKGROUND: A common feature of most genetic sex-determination systems studied so far is that sex is determined by nonrecombining genomic regions, which can be of various sizes depending on the species. These regions have evolved independently and repeatedly across diverse groups. A number of such sex-determining regions (SDRs) have been studied in animals, plants, and fungi, but very little is known about the evolution of sexes in other eukaryotic lineages.RESULTS: We report here the sequencing and genomic analysis of the SDR of Ectocarpus, a brown alga that has been evolving independently from plants, animals, and fungi for over one giga-annum. In Ectocarpus, sex is expressed during the haploid phase of the life cycle, and both the female (U) and the male (V) sex chromosomes contain nonrecombining regions. The U and V of this species have been diverging for more than 70 mega-annum, yet gene degeneration has been modest, and the SDR is relatively small, with no evidence for evolutionary strata. These features may be explained by the occurrence of strong purifying selection during the haploid phase of the life cycle and the low level of sexual dimorphism. V is dominant over U, suggesting that femaleness may be the default state, adopted when the male haplotype is absent.CONCLUSIONS: The Ectocarpus UV system has clearly had a distinct evolutionary trajectory not only to the well-studied XY and ZW systems but also to the UV systems described so far. Nonetheless, some striking similarities exist, indicating remarkable universality of the underlying processes shaping sex chromosome evolution across distant lineages."

We isolated dominant bacteria, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus intestinalis, Clostridium innocuum and a novel Fusobacterium spp., from the intestinal contents of conventional suckling rats and transferred them in different combinations into germfree (GF) adult rats. Animals were investigated after various times up to 21 days. Proliferative cell markers (Ki67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, phospho-histone H3, cyclin A) were higher in rats monocolonized with E. coli than in GF at all time points, but not in rats monocolonized with E. faecalis. The mucin content of goblet cells declined shortly after E. coli administration whereas the mucus layer doubled in thickness. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses revealed that E. coli resides in this mucus layer. The epithelial mucin content progressively returned to baseline, following an increase in KLF4 and in the cell cycle arrest-related proteins p21(CIP1) and p27(KIP1). Markers of colonic differentiated cells involved in electrolyte (carbonic anhydrase II and slc26A3) and water (aquaglyceroporin3 (aqp3)) transport, and secretory responses to carbachol were modulated after E. coli inoculation suggesting that ion transport dynamics were also affected. The colonic responses to simplified microbiotas differed substantially according to whether or not E. coli was combined with the other four bacteria. Thus, proliferation markers increased substantially when E. coli was in the mix, but very much less when it was absent. This work demonstrates that a pioneer strain of E. coli elicits sequential epithelial remodeling affecting the structure, mucus layer and ionic movements and suggests this can result in a microbiota-compliant state."

A total of 1056 clones were sequenced for Cyt-b and COI gene libraries, which contained 50 and 56 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively. BLAST research revealed that the OTUs belonged to 32 families from 5 orders (Diptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Orthoptera). While ants were not detected by this method, the consumption of flies, beetles, moths, mosquitoes and termites was evident in these samples.

Between 2009 and 2011, we collected paired plasma-DBS samples from treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected adults in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Senegal, Togo, Thailand, and Vietnam. The DBS were stored at an ambient temperature for 2 to 4 weeks and subsequently at -20°C before testing. VL testing was performed on the plasma samples and DBS using locally available methods: the Abbott m2000rt HIV-1 test, generic G2 real-time PCR, or the NucliSENS EasyQ version 1.2 test. In the case of virological failure (VF), i.e., a plasma VL of ≥1,000 copies/ml, HIVDR genotyping was performed on paired plasma-DBS samples. Overall, we compared 382 plasma-DBS sample pairs for DBS VL testing accuracy. The sensitivities of the different assays in different laboratories for detecting VF using DBS varied from 75% to 100% for the m2000rt test in labs B, C, and D, 91% to 93% for generic G2 real-time PCR in labs A and F, and 85% for the NucliSENS test in lab E. The specificities varied from 82% to 97% for the m2000rt and NucliSENS tests and reached only 60% for the generic G2 test. The NucliSENS test showed good agreement between plasma and DBS VL but underestimated the DBS VL. The lowest agreement was observed for the generic G2 test. Genotyping was successful for 96/124 (77%) DBS tested, and 75/96 (78%) plasma-DBS pairs had identical HIVDR mutations. Significant discrepancies in resistance interpretations were observed in 9 cases, 6 of which were from the same laboratory.

However, the selection of an adequate VL measurement method and the definition of the VF threshold should be considered, and laboratory performance should be monitored."

Reported cases account for 90% of the total number of global cases. By 2010, approximately 1.4 million HFRS cases had been reported in China. This study aimed to explore the effect of the rodent reservoir, and natural and socioeconomic variables, on the transmission pattern of HFRS.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data on monthly HFRS cases were collected from 2006 to 2010. Dynamic rodent monitoring data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, climate data, and socioeconomic data were also obtained. Principal component analysis was performed, and the time-lag relationships between the extracted principal components and HFRS cases were analyzed. Polynomial distributed lag (PDL) models were used to fit and forecast HFRS transmission. Four principal components were extracted. Component 1 (F1) represented rodent density, the NDVI, and monthly average temperature. Component 2 (F2) represented monthly average rainfall and monthly average relative humidity. Component 3 (F3) represented rodent density and monthly average relative humidity. The last component (F4) represented gross domestic product and the urbanization rate. F2, F3, and F4 were significantly correlated, with the monthly HFRS incidence with lags of 4 months (r = -0.289, P&lt;0.05), 5 months (r = -0.523, P&lt;0.001), and 0 months (r = -0.376, P&lt;0.01), respectively. F1 was correlated with the monthly HFRS incidence, with a lag of 4 months (r = 0.179, P = 0.192). Multivariate PDL modeling revealed that the four principal components were significantly associated with the transmission of HFRS.CONCLUSIONS: The monthly trend in HFRS cases was significantly associated with the local rodent reservoir, climatic factors, the NDVI, and socioeconomic conditions present during the previous months. The findings of this study may facilitate the development of early warning systems for the control and prevention of HFRS and similar diseases."

This SCM is particularly persistent in the Western Arctic Ocean, which is strongly salinity stratified. The recent loss of multiyear sea ice and increased particulate-rich river discharge in the Arctic Ocean results in a greater volume of fresher water that may displace nutrient-rich saltier waters to deeper depths and decrease light penetration in areas affected by river discharge. Here, we surveyed microbial eukaryotic assemblages in the surface waters, and within and below the SCM. In most samples, we detected the pronounced SCM that usually occurs at the interface of the upper mixed layer and Pacific Summer Water (PSW). Poorly developed SCM was seen under two conditions, one above PSW and associated with a downwelling eddy, and the second in a region influenced by the Mackenzie River plume. Four phylogenetically distinct communities were identified: surface, pronounced SCM, weak SCM and a deeper community just below the SCM. Distance-decay relationships and phylogenetic structure suggested distinct ecological processes operating within these communities. In the pronounced SCM, picophytoplanktons were prevalent and community assembly was attributed to water mass history. In contrast, environmental filtering impacted the composition of the weak SCM communities, where heterotrophic Picozoa were more numerous. These results imply that displacement of Pacific waters to greater depth and increased terrigenous input may act as a control on SCM development and result in lower net summer primary production with a more heterotroph dominated eukaryotic microbial community."

The abundance of Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera and a natural inhabitant of aquatic environments, fluctuates according to abiotic, and biotic factors. Among the biotic factors, the zooplankton community dynamics has been suggested to play a pivotal role in the survival, persistence, and natural competence of V. cholerae. However, factors regulating V. cholerae population structure and seasonal dynamics are still not fully understood. Investigation of the temporal shifts and variability in aquatic community composition in relation to the occurrence or abundance of V. cholerae appears very promising yet remained underexplored. Recent advances in metagenomics, facilitated by high-throughput ultra deep sequencing, have greatly improved our ability for a broader and deeper exploration of microbial communities including an understanding of community structure, function, as well as inter- and intra-specific competitions. Here, we discuss possible areas of research focusing how combination of community ecology and metagenomic approaches could be applied to study the cholera system."

This article discusses the relevance, feasibility, and effectiveness of national screening campaigns conducted between 2006 and 2010 in Burkina Faso.METHODOLOGY: An analysis of all data regarding testing uptake from 2006 to 2010 was conducted, along with interviews of key participants in the process.RESULTS: The results show that the 8 screening campaigns led to HIV testing of 487,727 people, that is, 50% of the total number of people tested and 24.6 % of HIV+ people diagnosed during this period. Campaigns succeeded in testing populations that are difficult to reach (especially young people), at a low cost.CONCLUSIONS: This strategy is relevant and useful for identifying HIV+ people. Its utility for HIV prevention campaigns requires further study. Campaigns are effective and cost-effective even in this country with a low disease prevalence. These results underline the importance of the synergy between community-based organizations and health services in the provision of counseling and testing."

These changes are directly related to the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, primarily CO2. Assessing seasonal forest growth responses to climate is of utmost importance because woody tissues, produced by photosynthesis from atmospheric CO2, water and light, constitute the main component of carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystem. In this paper, we combine intra-annual tree growth measurements from published tree growth data and the corresponding monthly climate data for 25 pan-tropical forest sites. This meta-analysis is designed to find the shared climate drivers of tree growth and their relative importance across pan-tropical forests in order to improve carbon uptake models in a global change context. Tree growth reveals significant intra-annual seasonality at seasonally dry sites or in wet tropical forests. Of the overall variation in tree growth, 28.7% was explained by the site effect, i.e. the tree growth average per site. The best predictive model included four climate variables: precipitation, solar radiation (estimated with extrasolar radiation reaching the atmosphere), temperature amplitude and relative soil water content. This model explained more than 50% of the tree growth variations across tropical forests. Precipitation and solar radiation are the main seasonal drivers of tree growth, causing 19.8% and 16.3% of the tree growth variations. Both have a significant positive association with tree growth. These findings suggest that forest productivity due to tropical tree growth will be reduced in the future if climate extremes, such as droughts, become more frequent."

Changing the local rheology or the nanotextured surface of substrates has proved an efficient approach to improve cell lineage differentiation, to control cell migration properties and to understand environmental sensing processes. However, introducing substrate surface textures often alters the ability to image cells with high precision, compromising our understanding of molecular mechanisms at stake in environmental sensing. In this paper, we demonstrate how nano/microstructured surfaces can be molded from an elastomeric material with a refractive index matched to the cell culture medium. Once made biocompatible, contrast imaging (differential interference contrast, phase contrast) and high-resolution fluorescence imaging of subcellular structures can be implemented through the textured surface using an inverted microscope. Simultaneous traction force measurements by micropost deflection were also performed, demonstrating the potential of our approach to study cell-environment interactions, sensing processes and cellular force generation with unprecedented resolution."

We show that high genome content variability in Emiliania relates to erosion of 1N-specific genes and loss of the ability to form flagellated cells. Analysis of 185 E. huxleyi strains isolated from world oceans suggests that loss of flagella occurred independently in lineages inhabiting oligotrophic open oceans over short evolutionary timescales. This environmentally linked physiogenomic change suggests life cycling is not advantageous in very large/diluted populations experiencing low biotic pressure and low ecological variability. Gene loss did not appear to reflect pressure for genome streamlining in oligotrophic oceans as previously observed in picoplankton. Life-cycle modifications might be common in plankton and cause major functional variability to be hidden from traditional taxonomic or molecular markers."

The Arctic Ocean is at additional risk of accelerated ocean acidification (OA) because of freshwater inputs from sea ice and rivers, which influence the carbonate system. Winter conditions in the Arctic are of interest because of both cold temperatures and limited CO2 venting to the atmosphere when sea ice is present. Earlier OA experiments on Arctic microbial communities conducted in the absence of ice cover, hinted at shifts in taxa dominance and diversity under lowered pH. The Catlin Arctic Survey provided an opportunity to conduct in situ, under-ice, OA experiments during late Arctic winter. Seawater was collected from under the sea ice off Ellef Ringnes Island, and communities were exposed to three CO2 levels for 6 days. Phylogenetic diversity was greater in the attached fraction compared to the free-living fraction in situ, in the controls and in the treatments. The dominant taxa in all cases were Gammaproteobacteria but acidification had little effect compared to the effects of containment. Phylogenetic net relatedness indices suggested that acidification may have decreased the diversity within some bacterial orders, but overall there was no clear trend. Within the experimental communities, alkalinity best explained the variance among samples and replicates, suggesting subtle changes in the carbonate system need to be considered in such experiments. We conclude that under ice communities have the capacity to respond either by selection or phenotypic plasticity to heightened CO2 levels over the short term."

To this end, microbe-associated molecular patterns are detected by dedicated receptors. Among them, the RIG-I-like receptors RIG-I and MDA5 activate IFN gene expression upon sensing viral RNA in the cytoplasm. While MDA5 forms long filaments in vitro upon activation, RIG-I is believed to oligomerize after RNA binding in order to transduce a signal. Here, we show that in vitro binding of synthetic RNA mimicking that of Mononegavirales (Ebola, rabies and measles viruses) leader sequences to purified RIG-I does not induce RIG-I oligomerization. Furthermore, in cells devoid of endogenous functional RIG-I-like receptors, after activation of exogenous Flag-RIG-I by a 62-mer-5'ppp-dsRNA or by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, a dsRNA analogue, or by measles virus infection, anti-Flag immunoprecipitation and specific elution with Flag peptide indicated a monomeric form of RIG-I. Accordingly, when using the Gaussia Luciferase-Based Protein Complementation Assay (PCA), a more sensitive in cellula assay, no RIG-I oligomerization could be detected upon RNA stimulation. Altogether our data indicate that the need for self-oligomerization of RIG-I for signal transduction is either dispensable or very transient."

One simple approach for preventing SAEs is to identify and exclude individuals at risk from MDA. Here, we describe a repurposed hand-held automated cell counter (Scepter 2.0; HHAC) as a rapid, point-of-care method for quantifying microfilariae (mf) in the blood of infected individuals.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The quantification of microfilarial levels in blood of naturally infected humans, experimentally infected baboons, or mf-spiked human blood was tested using a microfluidic-based automated counter and compared to traditional calibrated thick-smears. We demonstrate that mf can be quantified in 20 µl of whole blood following lysis with 10% saponin within a minute of obtaining blood. There was a highly significant concordance between the counts obtained by the HHAC and those by microscopy for mf densities of &gt;5,000 (p&lt;0.0001, r(c) = 0.97) or &gt;30,000 per ml (p&lt;0.0001, r(c) = 0.90). Preliminary proof of concept field studies in Cameroon with 20 µl of blood from L. loa infected humans (n = 22) and baboons (n = 4) also demonstrated a significantly high concordance (p&lt;0.0001, r(c) = 0.89) with calibrated thick blood smears counts.SIGNIFICANCE: A repurposed HHAC is a portable, sensitive, rapid, point-of-care and quantitative tool to identify individuals with high levels of L. loa mf that put them at risk for SAEs following MDA. In addition, it provides ease of data storage and accessibility."

FlAlyA showed a single band of ~30 kDa on SDS-PAGE and exhibited the optimal temperature and pH at 55 °C and pH 7.7, respectively. Analyses for substrate preference and reaction products indicated that FlAlyA was an endolytic poly(mannuronate) lyase (EC 4.2.2.3). A gene fragment encoding the amino-acid sequence of 288 residues for FlAlyA was amplified by inverse PCR. The N-terminal region of 21 residues except for the initiation Met in the deduced sequence was predicted as the signal peptide and the following region of six residues was regarded as propeptide, while the C-terminal region of 260 residues was regarded as the polysaccharide-lyase-family-7-type catalytic domain. The entire coding region for FlAlyA was subjected to the pCold I-Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) expression system and ~eight times higher yield of recombinant FlAlyA (recFlAlyA) than that of native FlAlyA was achieved. The recFlAlyA recovered in the periplasmic fraction of E. coli had lost the signal peptide region along with the N-terminal 3 residues of propeptide region. This suggested that the signal peptide of FlAlyA could function in part in E. coli."

Superfast flows in carbon nanotubes, nonlinear electrokinetic transport, slippage over smooth surfaces, nanobubble stability, etc. are the most striking phenomena that have been unveiled over the past few years, and some of them are still awaiting an explanation. One may anticipate that new nanofluidic effects will be discovered in the future, but at the moment, the technological barrier is high. Fabrication of nanochannels is most often a tour de force, slow and costly. However, with the accumulation of technological skills along with the use of new nanofluidic materials (like nanotubes), nanofluidics is becoming increasingly accessible to experimentalists. Among the technological challenges faced by the field, fabricating devices mimicking natural nanometric systems, such as aquaporins, ionic pumps or kidney osmotic filtering, seems the most demanding in terms of groundbreaking ideas. Nanoflow characterization remains delicate, although considerable progress has been achieved over the past years. The targeted application of nanofluidics is not only in the field of genomics and membrane science--with disruptive developments to be expected for water purification, desalination, and energy harvesting--but also for oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs. Today, in view of the markets that are targeted, nanofluidics may well impact the industry more than microfluidics; this would represent an unexpected paradox. These successes rely on using a variety of materials and technologies, using state-of-the-art nanofabrication, or low-tech inexpensive approaches. As a whole, nanofluidics is a fascinating field that is facing considerable challenges today. It possesses a formidable potential and offers much space for creative groundbreaking ideas."

They have experienced in their evolution an additional third-round whole genome duplication just after the divergence of their lineage, which endowed them with an extra adaptability to invade various aquatic habitats. Thus their physiology is also extremely diverse compared with other vertebrate groups as exemplified by the many patterns of body fluid regulation or osmoregulation. The key osmoregulatory organ for teleosts, whose body fluid composition is similar to mammals, is the gill, where ions are absorbed from or excreted into surrounding waters of various salinities against concentration gradients. It has been shown that the underlying molecular physiology of gill ionocytes responsible for ion regulation is highly variable among species. This variability is also seen in the endocrine control of osmoregulation where some hormones have distinct effects on body fluid regulation in different teleost species. A typical example is atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP); ANP is secreted in response to increased blood volume and acts on various osmoregulatory organs to restore volume in rainbow trout as it does in mammals, but it is secreted in response to increased plasma osmolality, and specifically decreases NaCl, and not water, in the body of eels. The distinct actions of other osmoregulatory hormones such as growth hormone, prolactin, angiotensin II, and vasotocin among teleost species are also evident. We hypothesized that such diversity of ionocytes and hormone actions among species stems from their intrinsic differences in body fluid regulation that originated from their native habitats, either fresh water or seawater. In this review, we summarized remarkable differences in body fluid regulation and its endocrine control among teleost species, although the number of species is still limited to substantiate the hypothesis."

This drug kills Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae (mf) present in the skin and the eyes (microfilaricidal effect) and prevents for 3-4 months the release of new mf by adult female worms (embryostatic effect). In some Ghanaian communities, the long-term use of IVM was associated with a more rapid than expected skin repopulation by mf after treatment. Here, we assessed whether the embryostatic effect of IVM on O. volvulus has been altered following frequent treatment in Cameroonian patients.METHODOLOGY: Onchocercal nodules were surgically removed just before (D0) and 80 days (D80) after a standard dose of IVM in two cohorts with different treatment histories: a group who had received repeated doses of IVM over 13 years, and a control group with no history of large-scale treatments. Excised nodules were digested with collagenase to isolate adult worms. Embryograms were prepared with females for the evaluation of their reproductive capacities.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Oocyte production was not affected by IVM. The mean number of intermediate embryos (morulae and coiled mf) decreased similarly in the two groups between D0 and D80. In contrast, an accumulation of stretched mf, either viable or degenerating, was observed at D80. However, it was observed that the increase in number of degenerating mf between D0 and D80 was much lower in the frequently treated group than in the control one (Incidence Rate Ratio: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.10-0.63; p = 0.003), which may indicate a reduced sequestration of mf in the worms from the frequently treated group.SIGNIFICANCE: IVM still had an embryostatic effect on O. volvulus, but the effect was reduced in the frequently treated cohort compared with the control population."

Here, we estimated the frequency of small for gestational age and gender (SGAG) among neonates born to HIV-infected or uninfected mothers and assessed the contribution, if any, of maternal HIV to the risk of SGAG.METHODS: The data used were obtained from the ANRS-Pediacam cohort in Cameroon. Pairs of newborns, one to a HIV-infected mother and the other to an uninfected mother, were identified during the first week of life, and matched on gender and recruitment site from 2007-2010. SGAG was defined in line with international recommendations as a birth weight Z-score adjusted for gestational age at delivery and gender more than two standard deviations below the mean (-2SD). Considering the matched design, logistic regression modeling was adjusted on site and gender to explore the effect of perinatal HIV exposure on SGAG.RESULTS: Among the 4104 mother-infant pairs originally enrolled, no data on birth weight and/or gestational age were available for 108; also, 259 were twins and were excluded. Of the remaining 3737 mother-infant pairs, the frequency of SGAG was 5.3% (95%CI: 4.6-6.0), and was significantly higher among HIV-infected infants (22.4% vs. 6.3%; p&lt;.001) and lower among HIV-unexposed uninfected infants (3.5% vs. 6.3%; p&lt;.001) than among HIV-exposed uninfected infants. Similarly, SGAG was significantly more frequent among HIV-infected infants (aOR: 4.1; 2.0-8.1) and less frequent among HIV-unexposed uninfected infants (aOR: 0.5; 0.4-0.8) than among HIV-exposed uninfected infants. Primiparity (aOR: 1.9; 1.3-2.7) and the presence of any disease during pregnancy (aOR: 1.4; 1.0-2.0) were identified as other contributors to SGAG.CONCLUSION: Maternal HIV infection was independently associated with SGAG for HIV-exposed uninfected infants. This provides further evidence of the need for adapted monitoring of pregnancy in HIV-infected women, especially if they are symptomatic, to minimize additional risk factors for SGAG."

Not all of the interviewees complained, though some had clearly visible lipodystrophy. The hypertrophic form seems better tolerated when perceived as overweight, a sign of excess wealth. Atrophic forms sometimes go unnoticed in lean people, but others experience it as stigma, avoid appearing in public, and express significant suffering, especially when symptoms jeopardize their social status. Healthcare systems should take better account of lipodystrophy and its psychosocial effects because they weaken adherence and reduce patients' quality of life."

In this article, I present different analytical models exploring selection acting on a 'sex modifier locus' (that affects the relative investment into asexual and sexual reproduction) in a finite population. Two forms of selective forces act on the modifier: direct selection due to intrinsic costs associated with sexual reproduction and indirect selection generated by one or two other loci affecting fitness. The results show that indirect selective forces differ from those acting on a recombination modifier even in the case of a haploid population: in particular, a single selected locus generates indirect selection for sex, while two loci are required in the case of a recombination modifier. This effect stems from the fact that modifier alleles increasing sex escape more easily from low-fitness genetic backgrounds than alleles coding for lower rates of sex. Extrapolating the results from three-locus models to a large number of loci at mutation-selection balance indicates that in the parameter range where indirect selection is strong enough to outweigh a substantial cost of sex, interactions between selected loci have a stronger effect than the sum of individual effects of each selected locus. Comparisons with multilocus simulation results show that such extrapolations may provide correct predictions for the evolutionarily stable rate of sex, unless the cost of sex is high."

The N,N-dimesityl imidazolylidene (NHC) does not react with isocyanides, whereas anti-Bredt di(amino)carbene (pyr-NHC), cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC), acyclic di(amino)carbene (ADAC), and acyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (AAAC) give rise to the corresponding ketenimines. NHCs are known to promote the benzoin condensation, and we found that the CAAC, pyr-NHC, and ADAC react with benzaldehyde to give the ketone tautomer of the Breslow intermediate, whereas the AAAC first gives the corresponding epoxide and ultimately the Breslow intermediate, which can be isolated. Addition of excess benzaldehyde to the latter does not lead to benzoin but to a stable 1,3-dioxolane. Depending on the electronic properties of carbenes, different products are also obtained with methyl acrylate as a substrate. The critical role of the carbene electrophilicity on the outcome of reactions is discussed."
"24584106";"UMI";"UMI";"AIDS reviews";1;2014;"Origin and diversity of human retroviruses.";"Simian immunodeficiency viruses, simian T‑cell lymphotropic viruses, and simian foamy viruses from nonhuman primates have crossed the species barrier to humans at several time points, leading to the HIV and human T lymphotropic virus epidemic and to sporadic cases of human infections with simian foamy viruses, respectively. Efficient infection and spread in humans differs between simian foamy virus, simian lymphotropic virus, and simian immunodeficiency virus, but seems also to differ among the different viruses from the same simian lineage, as illustrated by the different spread of HIV‑1 M, N O, P or for the different HIV‑2 groups. Among the four HIV‑1 groups, only HIV‑1 group M has spread worldwide, and the actual diversity within HIV‑1 M (subtypes, circulating recombinants) is the result of subsequent evolution and spread in the human population. HIV‑2 only spread to some extent in West Africa, and similarly as for HIV‑1, the nine HIV‑2 groups have also a different epidemic history. Four types of human T lymphotropic virus, type 1 to 4, have been described in humans and for three of them simian counterparts (simian T lymphotropic virus‑1, ‑2, ‑3) have been identified in multiple nonhuman primate species. The majority of human infections are with human T lymphotropic virus‑1, which is present throughout the world as clusters of high endemicity. Humans are susceptible to a wide variety of simian foamy viruses and seem to acquire these viruses more readily than simian immunodeficiency viruses or simian T lymphotropic viruses, but neither signs of disease in humans nor human‑to‑human transmission of simian foamy virus have been documented yet. The current HIV‑1 M epidemic illustrates the impact of a single cross‑species transmission. The recent discovery of HIV‑1 P, HIV‑2 I, new human T lymphotropic virus‑1 and ‑3 variants, as well as simian foamy virus infections in humans in Central Africa, show that our knowledge of genetic diversity and cross‑species transmissions of simian retroviruses is still incomplete."

A better understanding of this process would improve the medical treatment of bone alteration and its long-term consequences.OBJECTIVE: The first aim was to model the bone mass acquisition in young women with AN. The second aim was to identify the clinical and biological factors associated with bone demineralization and investigate the potential role of sclerostin and dickkopf-1 protein (DKK-1).POPULATION AND METHODS: Ninety-eight AN patients (mean age 18.2 ± 2.6 years) and 63 age-matched controls were enrolled in this study. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers, sclerostin, DKK-1, and growth factors were concomitantly evaluated.RESULTS: The aBMD was significantly reduced at all bone sites in AN patients vs controls (range, -3.3% at the radius to -12.1% for total proximal femur). Bone formation markers IGF-1 and DKK-1 were significantly decreased in AN patients, whereas PTH, sclerostin, and the bone resorption markers were increased. In patients, the AN duration, amenorrhea, weight, body mass index, fat mass, and fat-free soft tissue were negatively correlated with aBMD, whereas the age of AN onset was positively correlated. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the duration of amenorrhea was the independent factor most negatively associated with aBMD at all bone sites except the radius.CONCLUSION: This case-control study demonstrated a dramatic reduction in aBMD, reinforced for the first time by our models, and indicates the need for early, systematic, and adapted bone mass monitoring. Moreover, appropriate treatment should be started early in patients with AN. Increased secretion of sclerostin suggests that it may be a target for pharmacological action."

Utilizing a novel motor learning paradigm in which the hands of two - individuals are physically connected without their conscious awareness, we investigated how the interaction forces from a partner adapt the motor behavior in physically interacting humans. We observed the motor adaptations during physical interactions to be mutually beneficial such that both the worse and better of the interacting partners improve motor performance during and after interactive practice. We show that these benefits cannot be explained by multi-sensory integration by an individual, but require physical interaction with a reactive partner. Furthermore, the benefits are determined by both the interacting partner's performance and similarity of the partner's behavior to one's own. Our results demonstrate the fundamental neural processes underlying human physical interactions and suggest advantages of interactive paradigms for sport-training and physical rehabilitation."

A linear regression analysis predicted that weight for age was positively associated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to tetanus toxoid in children born during the rainy season or at the beginning of the dry season. A relationship between village, time of visits, and levels of antibodies to tetanus showed that environmental factors played a role in modulating humoral immunity to tetanus vaccine over time. Moreover, a whole-blood stimulation assay highlighted that the production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in response to tetanus toxoid was compromised in stunted children. However, the absence of cytokine modulation in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis-purified protein derivatives and phytohemagglutinin suggests that the overall ability to produce IFN-γ was preserved in stunted children. Therefore, these results show that nutritional status can specifically alter the efficacy of long-lasting immunity to tetanus."

The aim of this study is to estimate prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension in Dakar (Senegal). This study was carried out between January and June 2009 on a population sample of 600 individuals living in the department of Dakar. This sample was constructed using the quota method in order to strive for representativeness. Sociodemographic characteristics, hypertension, hypertension awareness, treatment and control, and body mass index of individuals were collected during face-to-face interviews. Statistical analyses used were χ2-tests and binary logistic regressions. Prevalence of hypertension was 27.50%. Prevalence of awareness, treatment and control among hypertensives were 27.88%, 16.97% and 5.45%, respectively. Logistic regression showed that the prevalence, awareness and treatment of hypertension increased with increasing age. Overweight and obese subjects were more often hypertensive but did not differ from others in awareness and treatment. This could be linked to the social valorization of stoutness in West Africa, which explains that excess weight is not perceived as a risk factor for hypertension. In conclusion, given the very low rates of awareness, treatment and control in our sample, developing strategies for averting a hypertension epidemic must be a priority objective."

However current methods of using cell free DNA require amplification, which leads to allelic dropout and bias especially when starting with small amounts of DNA. Here we describe an amplification-free method for sequencing of cell-free DNA, even from low levels of starting material. We evaluated this method in the context of prenatal diagnosis of fetal aneuploidy and compared it with a PCR-based library preparation method as well as a recently described method using unique molecular identifiers (UMI). All methods performed well, however coverage was increased by the amplification-free method and GC-induced bias was reduced by both the amplification-free method and the UMI method. Future diagnostic applications including whole genome sequencing of cell-free DNA will benefit from amplification-free sequencing."

Biological diagnosis is classically based on the detection of mumps-specific IgM, but the ability of serological tests to confirm mumps infection seems to be limited among vaccinated patients.OBJECTIVES: We aim to report a mumps outbreak in an engineering school in Grenoble, France, from February to June 2013 and results of the biological testing.STUDY DESIGN: WHO definitions were used to define cases. Mumps--specific IgM and IgG were assessed by a commercially available EIA. Mumps RNA detection by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCR) and mumps genotyping were performed by the French National Reference Centre for Paramyxoviridae.RESULTS: Sixty two mumps patient-cases were identified using WHO case definitions, 20 being biologically explored, of which 17 were confirmed by biological tests. Vaccination status was documented for 27 patients/62: 4 (14.8%) patients had received one dose of MMR vaccine, and 23 (85.2) two doses of MMR vaccine. Among the biologically explored patients, 83% had a positive RT PCR at the first sampling whereas only 45% had positive or equivocal IgM. All the genotyped strains were genotype G.CONCLUSIONS: Mumps laboratory diagnosis in a highly vaccinated population is challenging. Serological tests among vaccinated patients should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed by RT-PCR tests at the beginning of a mumps outbreak."

However, this global effort would be even more profitable if the access to laboratory services especially in decentralized settings was strengthened. We report the virological outcome and HIV-1 drug resistance in three West African countries using dried blood spots (DBS) samples.METHODS: We included HIV-1-infected adults on ART ≥6 months and followed up in capital cities and decentralized sites in Senegal, Mali and Guinea-Conakry. Patients were consecutively enrolled and DBS were collected in field conditions and kept at ambient temperature before transfer to the reference laboratory. Viral load (VL) was quantified using the NucliSENS EasyQ HIV-1 v1.2. Genotyping of HIV-1 pol gene was performed using in-house protocol.RESULTS: Of the 407 participants, 119, 152 and 136 were from Senegal, Mali and Guinea-Conakry, respectively. The median treatment duration was 36 months [IQR: 6-136]. Virological failure (VF) (VL≥3log10 copies/mL) was observed in 26% (95% confidence interval (CI), 18-35; n=31), 11% (95% CI, 6-17; n=16) and 24% (95% CI, 17-32; n=33) of patients in Senegal, Mali and Guinea-Conakry, respectively (p=0.001). Of samples presenting VL≥3log10 copies/mL (n=80), 70 were successfully genotyped. At least one drug resistance mutation (DRM) was detected in the following proportions: 70% (95% CI, 50-86; n=19), 93% (95% CI, 68-100; n=14) and 68% (95% CI, 48-84; n=19) in Senegal, Mali and Guinea-Conakry, respectively (p=0.22). Twenty-six per cent (26%; 95% CI, 16-38; n=18) of patients in VF harboured wild-type viruses, which is likely indicative of weak adherence. Phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of CRF02_AG subtype (73%; 95% CI, 61-83; n=51).CONCLUSIONS: We describe the ART outcome in capital and rural settings of Senegal, Mali and Guinea-Conakry. Our results in all of the three countries highlight the need to reinforce the ART adherence in order to minimize the occurrence of drug resistance. In addition, these findings provide additional evidence that the use of DBS as a sampling support could assist virological monitoring of patients on ART in remote areas."

Here we have studied the light chain usage of human and rhesus macaque antibodies targeted to a dominant region of the HIV-1 envelope second variable (V2) region involving lysine (K) 169, the site of immune pressure in the RV144 vaccine efficacy trial. We found that humans and rhesus macaques used orthologous lambda variable gene segments encoding a glutamic acid-aspartic acid (ED) motif for K169 recognition. Structure determination of an unmutated ancestor antibody demonstrated that the V2 binding site was preconfigured for ED motif-mediated recognition prior to maturation. Thus, light chain usage for recognition of the site of immune pressure in the RV144 trial is highly conserved across species. These data indicate that the HIV-1 K169-recognizing ED motif has persisted over the diversification between rhesus macaques and humans, suggesting an evolutionary advantage of this antibody recognition mode."

In the singlet state, they possess a lone pair of electrons and a vacant orbital and therefore exhibit Lewis acidic and Lewis basic properties, which explains their very high reactivity. Following the preparation by our group in 1988 of the first representative, a variety of stable carbenes are now available, the most popular being the cyclic diaminocarbenes. In this Account, we discuss another class of stable cyclic carbenes, namely, cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs), in which one of the electronegative and π-donor amino substituents of diaminocarbenes is replaced by a σ-donating but not π-donating alkyl group. As a consequence, CAACs are more nucleophilic (σ-donating) but also more electrophilic (π-accepting) than diaminocarbenes. Additionally, the presence of a quaternary carbon in the position α to the carbene center provides steric environments that differentiate CAACs dramatically from all other ligands. We show that the peculiar electronic and steric properties of CAACs allow for the stabilization of unusual diamagnetic and paramagnetic main group element species. As examples, we describe the preparation of room temperature stable phosphorus derivatives in which the heteroatom is in the zero oxidation state, nucleophilic boron compounds, and phosphorus-, antimony-, boron-, silicon-, and even carbon-centered neutral and cationic radicals. CAACs are also excellent ligands for transition metal complexes. The most recent application is their use for the stabilization of paramagnetic complexes, in which the metal is often in a formal zero oxidation state. Indeed, bis(CAAC)M complexes in which the metal is gold, copper, cobalt, iron, nickel, manganese, and zinc have been isolated. Depending on the metal, the majority of spin density can reside either on the metal or on the carbene carbons and the nitrogen atoms of the CAAC ligand. In contrast to diaminocarbenes, the higher basicity of CAACs makes them poor leaving groups, and thus they cannot be used for classical organocatalysis. However, because of their superior electrophilicity and smaller singlet-triplet gap, CAACs can activate small molecules at room temperature, such as CO, H2, and P4, as well as enthalpically strong bonds, such as B-H, Si-H, N-H, and P-H. Lastly, excellent results have been obtained in palladium, ruthenium, and gold catalysis. CAAC-metal complexes are extremely thermally robust, which allows for their utilization in harsh conditions. This property has been used to perform a variety of gold-catalyzed reactions in the presence of basic amines, including ammonia and hydrazine, which usually deactivate catalysts."

Phylogeographic and population genetic analyses demonstrated that the cultivated red alga Gracilaria chilensis colonised the Chilean coast from New Zealand. Combining archaeological observations with phylogeographic data provided evidence that exchanges between New Zealand and Chile have occurred at least before the Holocene, likely at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and we suggest that migration probably occurred via rafting. Furthermore, the remarkably low microsatellite diversity found in the Chilean populations compared to those in New Zealand is consistent with a recent genetic bottleneck as a result of over-exploitation of natural populations and/or the process of domestication. Therefore, the aquaculture of this seaweed, based essentially on clonal propagation, is occurring from genetically depressed populations and may be driving the species to an extinction vortex in Chile."

Here, we characterized the full-length genome of a virus infecting a naturally infected captive C. tantalus from Cameroon by amplifying and sequencing sub-genomic PCR fragments. The isolate (SIVagmTAN-CM545) is 9923bp long and contained all canonical genes of a functional SIV. SIVagmTAN-CM545 showed a mosaic structure, with gag, pol, nef and accessory genes closely related to SIVagmSAB infecting Chlorocebus sabaeus monkeys from west Africa, and the env gene, closely related to SIVagmTAN infecting tantalus monkeys from Central Africa. Thus SIVagmTAN-CM545 is SIVagmSAB/SIVagmTAN recombinant. These unexpected findings suggest that the evolution of SIVagm is more complex than previously thought and warrant further studies."

However, a few reports of life-threatening events in newborn infants during skin-to-skin care have prompted suggestions that SpO2 monitoring may be of value in the delivery room. The present study compared SpO2 monitoring with standard clinical practices during skin-to-skin care in the delivery room. The midwife's opinion and the mother's anxiety level were assessed for both procedures.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The midwife's opinion was measured on a Likert scale and the mother's anxiety level was measured on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Y-A and Y-B scales. Two procedures (standard clinical practice vs. SpO2 monitoring) were compared prospectively in two consecutive 3-month periods.RESULTS: Seventy case report forms were completed for the &quot;standard clinical practice&quot; group and 62 were completed for the &quot;SpO2 monitoring&quot; group. The care procedure was considered to be satisfactory or quite satisfactory in 60 cases (96.8%) in the &quot;SpO2 monitoring&quot; group and in 57 cases (81.4%; P&lt;0.05) in the &quot;standard clinical practice&quot; group.

Information on epidemiology, diagnosis and susceptibility profile to antifungal drugs, are scarce in Cameroon. Authors evaluated the diagnosis possibilities of the cryptococcal meningitis in Cameroon, and studied the antifungal susceptibility of isolated strains to fluconazole, used as first line treatment of the disease in Cameroon. Between December 2009 and July 2011, 146 cerebrospinal fluids obtained from HIV patients with suspicion of meningitis were analysed. The diagnosis procedure involved macroscopic and cyto-chemical analysis, India ink test, culture on Sabouraud chloramphenicol medium and antigen latex agglutination test. Antifungal susceptibility testing of isolated strains to fluconazole was done by the E-test(®) method. The diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis gave 28.08% positive cases. Among these patients, 80% were at stages III and IV and 20% at stage I of the HIV infection, according to the WHO previous classification. Cyto-chemical analysis showed current findings in the case of cryptococcal meningitis. India ink test and latex agglutination test exhibited very high sensitivity and specificity (&gt;94%). Fluconazole antifungal susceptibility testing gave MICs lower than 32μg/mL to 92.7% of isolated strains and MICs greater than this value to 7.3% of isolates. These results showed that cryptococcal meningitis remains a real problem among HIV infected patients in Yaoundé. The emergence of fluconazole reduced susceptibility strains is worrying. Nevertheless, efficacy of rapid detection tests is interesting because this will help in rapid diagnosis and treatment of patients."

This system of GRP neurons is sexually dimorphic, being prominent in male rats but vestigial or absent in females. It is suggested that the sexually dimorphic GRP/GRPR system in the lumbosacral spinal cord plays a critical role in the regulation of male sexual function. In parallel, it has been reported that the somatosensory GRP/GRPR system in the spinal cord contributes to the regulation of itch specific transmission independently of the pain transmission. Interestingly, these two distinct functions in the same spinal region are both regulated by the neuropeptide, GRP.

By applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. Many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; Mycobacterium bolletii, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum. The genus Treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. Using specific real-time PCR on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria Bartonella spp. Borrelia spp., Coxiella burnetii and Tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. We estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. Therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence."

The aim of this study was to determine if a baseline analysis of the NS3 region using ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS) can help to predict an SVR. Serum samples from 40 patients with previously nonresponding genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C who were retreated with triple therapy, including a PI, were analyzed. Baseline UDPS of the NS3 gene was performed on plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Mutations conferring resistance to PIs were sought. The overall diversity of the quasispecies was evaluated by calculating the Shannon entropy (SE). Resistance mutations were found in plasma and PBMC but were not discriminating enough to predict an SVR. NS3 quasispecies heterogeneity was significantly lower at baseline in patients achieving an SVR than in those not achieving an SVR (SE of 26.98 ± 16.64 × 10(-3) versus 44.93 ± 19.58 × 10(-3), P = 0.0047). With multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of an SVR were fibrosis of stage F ≤2 (odds ratio [OR], 13.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25 to 141.096; P &lt; 0.03) and SE below the median (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.22 to 23.87; P &lt; 0.03). More than the presence of minor mutations at the baseline in plasma or in PBMC, the NS3 viral heterogeneity determined by UDPS is an independent factor for an SVR in previously treated patients receiving triple therapy that includes a PI."

The enhanced photoluminescence effect in monolayer MoS2 was discovered and, as a strong tool, was employed for strain and defect analysis in MoS2. Recently, large-size monolayer MoS2 has been produced by chemical vapour deposition, but has not yet been fully explored. Here we systematically characterize chemical vapour deposition-grown MoS2 by photoluminescence spectroscopy and mapping and demonstrate non-uniform strain in single-crystalline monolayer MoS2 and strain-induced bandgap engineering. We also evaluate the effective strain transferred from polymer substrates to MoS2 by three-dimensional finite element analysis. Furthermore, our work demonstrates that photoluminescence mapping can be used as a non-contact approach for quick identification of grain boundaries in MoS2."

Although molecular simulations are an attractive tool for assigning liquid degrees of freedom to OKE spectra, the accurate modeling of the OKE and the motions that contribute to it relies on the use of a realistic and computationally tractable molecular polarizability model. Here we explore how the OKE spectrum of liquid benzene, and the underlying dynamics that determines its shape, are affected by the polarizability model employed. We test a molecular polarizability model that uses a point anisotropic molecular polarizability and three other models that distribute the polarizability over the molecule. The simplest and most computationally efficient distributed polarizability model tested is found to be sufficient for the accurate simulation of the many-body polarizability dynamics of this liquid. We further find that the atomic-to-molecular polarizability transformation approximation [Hu et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2008, 112, 7837-7849], used in conjunction with this distributed polarizability model, yields OKE spectra whose shapes differ negligibly from those calculated without this approximation, providing a substantial increase in computational efficiency."

We show, in particular, that by using this double modulation it is possible to study Hubbard models with asymmetric hopping, which, contrary to the standard Hubbard model, present insulating phases with both parity and string order. Moreover, double modulation allows for the simulation of lattice models in unconventional parameter regimes, as we illustrate for the case of the spin-1/2 Fermi-Hubbard model with correlated hopping, a relevant model for cuprate superconductors."

When plant roots are added into the soil, water transfer between the soil and the outside environment is even more complicated. Indeed, plants provide an additional process of water transfer. Water is pumped by the roots, channeled to the leaf surface, and released into the surrounding air by a process called transpiration. Prediction of the evapotranspiration of water over time in the presence of roots helps keep track of the amount of water that remains in the soil. Using a controlled visual setup of a two-dimensional model soil consisting of monodisperse glass beads, we perform experiments on actual roots grown under different relative humidity conditions. We record the total water mass loss in the medium and the position of the evaporating front that forms within the medium. We then develop a simple analytical model that predicts the position of the evaporating front as a function of time as well as the total amount of water that is lost from the medium due to the combined effects of evaporation and transpiration. The model is based on fundamental principles of evaporation fluxes and includes empirical assumptions on the quantity of open stomata in the leaves, where water transpiration occurs. Comparison between the model and experimental results shows excellent prediction of the position of the evaporating front as well as the total mass loss from evapotranspiration in the presence of roots. The model also provides a way to predict the lifetime of a plant."

Using controlled experiments, we analyze the finger instabilities that develop from the wetting front as a function of fundamental granular (particle size) and fluid properties (rainfall, viscosity). These finger instabilities act as precursors for water channels, which serve as outlets for water drainage. We look into the characteristics of the homogeneous wetting front and channel size as well as estimate relevant time scales involved in the instability formation and the velocity of the channel fingertip. We compare our experimental results with that of the well-known prediction developed by Parlange and Hill [D. E. Hill and J. Y. Parlange, Soil Sci. Soc. Am. Proc. 36, 697 (1972)]. This model is based on linear stability analysis of the growth of perturbations arising at the interface between two immiscible fluids. Results show that, in terms of morphology, experiments agree with the proposed model. However, in terms of kinetics we nevertheless account for another term that describes the homogenization of the wetting front. This result shows that the manner we introduce the fluid to a porous medium can also influence the formation of finger instabilities. The results also help us to calculate the ideal flow rate needed for homogeneous distribution of water in the soil and minimization of runoff, given the grain size, fluid density, and fluid viscosity. This could have applications in optimizing use of irrigation water."

Our hypothesis was that progression of the disease is associated with a decrease in function with time. A total of 22 patients (44 shoulders; 17 women, 5 men, (mean age 63)) with rheumatoid arthritis were followed for eight years. All shoulders were assessed using the Constant score, anteroposterior radiographs (Larsen score, Upward-Migration-Index (UMI)) and ultrasound (US). At final follow-up, the Short Form-36, disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) Score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and use of anti-rheumatic medication were determined. The mean Constant score was 72 points (50 to 88) at baseline and 69 points (25 to 100) at final follow-up. Radiological evaluation showed progressive destruction of the peri-articular structures with time. This progression of joint and rotator cuff destruction was significantly associated with the Constant score. However, at baseline only the extent of rotator cuff disease and the UMI could predict the Constant score at final follow-up. A plain anteroposterior radiograph of the shoulder is sufficient to assess any progression of rheumatoid disease and to predict functional outcome in the long term by using the UMI as an indicator of rotator cuff degeneration."

In this article we investigate provider and client perceptions of ethical issues, including whether they think that accessibility of counseling and testing sites during campaigns may hinder confidentiality.METHODS: To examine how campaigns have functioned in Burkina Faso, we undertook a qualitative study based on individual interviews and focus group discussions with 52 people (providers and clients tested during or outside campaigns and individuals never tested). Thematic analysis was performed on discourse about perceptions and experiences of HIV-testing campaigns, quality of care and individual rights.RESULTS: Respondents value testing accessibility and attractiveness during campaigns; clients emphasize convenience, ripple effect, the sense of not being alone, and the anonymity resulting from high attendance. Confronted with numerous clients, providers develop context-specific strategies to ensure consent, counseling, confidentiality and retention in the testing process, and they adapt to workplace arrangements, local resources and social norms. Clients appreciate the quality of care during campaigns. However, new ethical issues arise about confidentiality and accessibility. Confidentiality of HIV-status may be jeopardized due to local social norms that encourage people to share their results with others, when HIV-positive people may not wish to do so. Providers' ethical concerns are consistent with WHO norms known as the '5 Cs,' though articulated differently. Clients and providers value the accessibility of testing for all during campaigns, and consider it an ethical matter. The study yields insights on the way global norms are adapted or negotiated locally.CONCLUSIONS: Future global recommendations for HIV testing and counseling campaigns should consider accessibility and propose ways for testing services to respond to new ethical issues related to high demand."

A total of 154 HIV-infected pregnant women receiving either 400/100 mg (standard) or 600/150 mg (increased) twice daily had lopinavir plasma concentration data available. Population parameters were estimated using non-linear mixed-effects regression models. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the probability of achieving target lopinavir trough concentrations (&gt;1.0 mg/L) with standard and increased doses of lopinavir/ritonavir during pregnancy.RESULTS: The median (range) age, weight and gestational age were 28 years (18-43), 62 kg (45-123) and 33 weeks (29-38), respectively. Body weight influenced lopinavir oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F). Population estimates of lopinavir CL/F and V/F were 6.21 L/h/70 kg and 52.6 L/70 kg, respectively. Based on simulations, the highest risk of subtherapeutic trough concentrations was for women weighing &gt;100 kg using the standard dose (∼ 7%), while the risk was &lt;2% with the 600/150 mg dose for women weighing 40-130 kg.

Dioecy has often been used as a proxy for the mating system in these organisms. Yet, dioecy does not prevent the fusion of gametes from male and female gametophytes originating from the same sporophyte. This is likely a common occurrence when spores from the same parent are dispersed in clumps and recruit together. This pattern of clumped spore dispersal has been hypothesized to explain significant heterozygote deficiency in the dioecious haploid-diploid seaweed Chondrus crispus. Fronds and cystocarps (structures in which zygotes are mitotically amplified) were sampled in two 25 m(2) plots located within a high and a low intertidal zone and genotyped at 5 polymorphic microsatellite loci in order to explore the mating system directly using paternity analyses. Multiple males sired cystocarps on each female, but only one of the 423 paternal genotypes corresponded to a field-sampled gametophyte. Nevertheless, larger kinship coefficients were detected between males siring cystocarps on the same female in comparison with males in the entire population, confirming restricted spermatial and clumped spore dispersal. Such dispersal mechanisms may be a mode of reproductive assurance due to nonmotile gametes associated with putatively reduced effects of inbreeding depression because of the free-living haploid stage in C. crispus."

Here, by using single-particle-resolution video microscopy of colloidal films of diameter-tunable microspheres, we show that transitions between square and triangular lattices occur via a two-step diffusive nucleation pathway involving liquid nuclei. The nucleation pathway is favoured over the direct one-step nucleation because the energy of the solid/liquid interface is lower than that between solid phases. We also observed that nucleation precursors are particle-swapping loops rather than newly generated structural defects, and that coherent and incoherent facets of the evolving nuclei exhibit different energies and growth rates that can markedly alter the nucleation kinetics. Our findings suggest that an intermediate liquid should exist in the nucleation processes of solid-solid transitions of most metals and alloys, and provide guidance for better control of the kinetics of the transition and for future refinements of solid-solid transition theory."

Yet the results are unconvincing, and their interpretation has remained a matter of debate. We have now presented prospective data on the effect of EBV infection combined with survival in patients enrolled in a prospective study.METHODS: We assessed 85 BC patients over an 87-month follow-up period to determine whether EBV infection, evaluated by qPCR in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumor biopsies, interacted with host cell components that modulate the evolution parameters of BC. We also examined the EBV replicating form by the titration of serum anti-ZEBRA antibodies. Immunological studies were performed on a series of 35 patients randomly selected from the second half of the survey, involving IFN-γ and TNF-α intracellular immunostaining tests performed via flow cytometry analysis in peripheral NK and T cells, in parallel with EBV signature. The effect of the EBV load in the blood or tumor tissue on patient survival was analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses, combined with an analysis of covariance.RESULTS: Our study represents the first ever report of the impact of EBV on the clinical outcome of BC patients, regardless of tumor histology or treatment regimen. No correlation was found between: (i) EBV detection in tumor or PBMCs and tumor characteristics; (ii) EBV and other prognostic factors. Notably, patients exhibiting anti-ZEBRA antibodies at high titers experienced poorer overall survival (p = 0.002). Those who recovered from their disease were found to have a measurable EBV DNA load, together with a high frequency of IFN-γ and TNF-α producing PBMCs (p = 0.04), which indicates the existence of a Th1-type polarized immune response in both the tumor and its surrounding tissue.CONCLUSIONS: The replicative form of EBV, as investigated using anti-ZEBRA titers, correlated with poorer outcomes, whereas the latent form of the virus that was measured and quantified using the EBV tumor DNA conferred a survival advantage to BC patients, which could occur through the activation of non-specific anti-tumoral immune responses."

The system automatically generated a 2D computational domain based on ultrasound color Doppler imaging and performed a UMI simulation of blood flow field to visualize hemodynamics in the domain. In the UMI simulation, compensation of errors was applied by adding feedback signals proportional to the differences between Doppler velocities by measurement and computation while automatically estimating the cross-sectional average inflow velocity. The necessity of adjustment of the feedback gain was examined by analyzing blood flow in five carotid arteries: three healthy, one sclerosed, and one stenosed. The same feedback gain was generally applicable for the 2D-UMI simulation in all carotid arteries, depending on target variables. Thus, the present system was shown to be versatile in the sense that the parameter is patient independent.

One feature of count and binary data modeled by Poisson or logistic regression is that the variance depends on the mean; hence, the within-group variability changes from one group to another depending on the mean trajectory level. Mixture modeling could be used here for classification though its main purpose is to model the data. The results obtained may change according to the main objective. This article presents an extension of the k-means algorithm that takes into account the features of count and binary data by using the deviance as distance metric. This approach is justified by its analogy with the classification likelihood. Two applications are presented with binary and count data to show the differences between the classifications obtained with the usual Euclidean distance versus the deviance distance."

In the recent CAMELIA clinical trial in Cambodia, the inclusion criteria included a negative pregnancy test and signature of the consent form confirming commitment to double contraceptive use as patients were given drugs contra-indicated in case of pregnancy. But despite precautions and the requirement stated in the informed consent form, 19 out of 236 enrolled women became pregnant during the trial. The current paper describes the frictions and subjectivities that emerge as new medical technologies travel to resource-poor settings--and more specifically, how trial researchers, health workers, and research subjects involved in the CAMELIA trial negotiate the injunction to avoid pregnancy while using a teratogenic drug."

Six hydrogels (Mn-LG, Mn-HG, Co-LG, Co-HG, Cu-LG and Cu-HG) were synthesized and studied by spectromechanical analyses. On one hand, Cu-HG, Cu-LG and Co-HG behaved as viscoelastic solids: the elastic contribution was higher than the dissipative component in all the frequency range studied (G'&gt;G&quot;). No flow zone (G&quot;&gt;G') was detected even at very low values of the shearing frequency. On the other, Mn-HG, Mn-LG and Co-LG presented a spectromechanical behavior that resembled that observed classically for entangled polymers. Indeed, at high frequency, these latter materials could be compared to a viscoelastic solid but at low frequency, the flow zone was described and the viscous character became prevalent with finite relaxation time. Very good correlations with the microscopic structurations of the network were evidenced (rubbery vs. flow zone and fibrillar vs. complex morphology respectively)."

Existing reports of acousto-optic Bragg imaging based on transmission of acoustic fields through obstructions exhibit strong acoustic impedance mismatches manifested by poor image quality and missing details of physical structures of obstructions. In this work, the image quality was improved to exhibit detailed physical structures of an object by using an improved Bragg imaging system described in Sec. III below. This paper investigates the possibility of extending an acoustic Bragg imaging technique in transmission mode to image animal or plant tissues; a small azalea leaf is used as an illustration in this case. The Bragg image produced clearly shows the veins of the vascular azalea leaf serving as a proof of concept for cost-effective potential application of acoustic Bragg imaging of biological objects in the medical field. Moreover, acousto-optic Bragg imaging is potentially harmless to biological cells and is sensitive to density and elastic variations in the tissue."

Inbreeding depression is thought to be the major force maintaining SI; however, inbreeding depression is a dynamical variable that depends in particular on the mating system. In this article we use multilocus, individual-based simulations to examine the coevolution of SI and inbreeding depression within finite populations. We focus on the conditions for the maintenance of SI when self-compatible (SC) mutants are introduced in the population by recurrent mutation, and compare simulation results with predictions from an analytical model treating inbreeding depression as a fixed parameter (thereby neglecting effects of purging within the SC subpopulation). In agreement with previous models, we observe that the maintenance of SI is associated with high inbreeding depression and is facilitated by high rates of self-pollination. Purging of deleterious mutations by SC mutants has little effect on the spread of those mutants as long as most deleterious alleles have weak fitness effects: in this case, the genetic architecture of inbreeding depression has little effect on the maintenance of SI. By contrast, purging may greatly enhance the spread of SC mutants when deleterious alleles have strong fitness effects."

However, besides major successes achieved worldwide in infectious diseases control, most elimination/control programs remain frustrating in many tropical countries where specific biological and socio-economical features prevented implementation of disease control over broad spatial and temporal scales. Emblematic examples include malaria, yellow fever, measles and HIV. There is consequently an urgent need to develop affordable and sustainable disease control strategies that can target the core of infectious diseases transmission in highly endemic areas.DISCUSSION: Meanwhile, although most pathogens appear so difficult to eradicate, it is surprising to realize that human activities are major drivers of the current high rate of extinction among upper organisms through alteration of their ecology and evolution, i.e., their &quot;niche&quot;. During the last decades, the accumulation of ecological and evolutionary studies focused on infectious diseases has shown that the niche of a pathogen holds more dimensions than just the immune system targeted by vaccination and treatment. Indeed, it is situated at various intra- and inter- host levels involved on very different spatial and temporal scales. After developing a precise definition of the niche of a pathogen, we detail how major advances in the field of ecology and evolutionary biology of infectious diseases can enlighten the planning and implementation of infectious diseases control in tropical countries with challenging economic constraints.SUMMARY: We develop how the approach could translate into applied cases, explore its expected benefits and constraints, and we conclude on the necessity of such approach for pathogen control in low-income countries."

SIVmus and SIVgsn were sequenced from mustached and greater spot nosed monkeys in Cameroon and SIVmon from mona monkeys in Cameroon and Nigeria. In order to further document the genetic diversity of SIVmus, we analyzed two full-length genomes of new strains identified in Gabon. The whole genomes obtained showed the expected reading frames for gag, pol, vif, vpr, tat, rev, env, nef, and also for a vpu gene. Analyses showed that the Gabonese SIVmus strains were closely related and formed a monophyletic clade within the SIVmus/mon/gsn lineage. Nonetheless, within this lineage, the position of both new SIVmus differed according to the gene analyzed. In pol and nef gene, phylogenetic topologies suggested different evolutions for each of the two new SIVmus strains whereas in the other nucleic fragments studied, their positions fluctuated between SIVmon, SIVmus-1, and SIVgsn. In addition, in C1 domain of env, we identified an insertion of seven amino acids characteristic for the SIVmus/mon/gsn and HIV‑1/SIVcpz/SIVgor lineages. Our results show a high genetic diversity of SIVmus in mustached monkeys and suggest cross-species transmission events and recombination within SIVmus/mon/gsn lineage.

HIV-DNA was measured using a real-time PCR assay. Mixed-model analysis was used to analyse the factors associated with change in HIV-DNA concentration.RESULTS: The study included 121 children infected with HIV-1. The median age at inclusion was 6 years (IQR: 3.5-9) and children were at an advanced stage of HIV disease (46.6% and 20.3% presenting CDC stage B and CDC stage C, respectively). At baseline, the median HIV-DNA concentration was 3.4 log₁₀ copies/10(6) PBMCs (IQR: 3.1-3.6). Fifty-four children were initiated on ART during follow-up. After 24 months of ART, HIV-DNA load decreased by 0.32 (IQR: 0.08-0.57) log₁₀ copies/10(6) PBMCs. The only factor associated with the HIV-DNA decrease was a concomitant low HIV-RNA viral load result. Children with efficient ART had a 0.51 log₁₀ copies (IQR: 0.40-0.86) HIV-DNA decrease per million PBMCs.CONCLUSIONS: HIV-DNA concentrations decreased following ART initiation in a large African paediatric cohort. This decline was exclusively associated with the decrease in ongoing replication level achieved. Our study points out that a strong adherence is needed for ART to be efficient on the viral reservoirs, and further reinforces that adherence support is also essential to diminish the reservoir."

Cutaneous leishmaniasis, a common form of the disease, is most often caused by the transmission of Leishmania major to humans by female phlebotomine sand ﬂies. Apes are increasingly being seen as a source of zoonotic diseases, including malaria and rickettsiosis. To examine whether gorillas harbor Leishmania species, we screened fecal samples from wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Cameroon for the presence of these pathogens. Of 91 wild gorilla fecal samples, 12 contained Leishmania parasites, and 4 contained phlebotomine sand fly vectors. The molecular identity was determined by running 3 different polymerase chain reaction tests for detection of L. major. Next, fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to visualize L. major parasites in fecal samples from the gorillas. Both promastigote and amastigote forms of the parasite were found. This work strongly suggests that wild gorillas carry pathogenic Leishmania parasites."

We studied the epidemiology of LF in an endemic village in the Republic of Congo.METHODS: Dependent variables were Wuchereria bancrofti antigenemia (ICT card test) and microfilaremia (night blood smears). The following factors were investigated: sex, age, bed net, latrines, source of water, uptake of anthelmintic drugs, hunting/fishing activities, and occasionally sleeping in the bush. Mixed multivariate logistic regression models were used.RESULTS: 134 of 774 subjects aged ≥ 5 years (17.3%) had W. bancrofti antigenemia and 41 (5.3%) had microfilaremia (mf). Infection rates increased with age up to roughly 20 years and remained stable thereafter. Multivariate analysis of antigenemia demonstrated an increased risk for males (OR = 2.0 [1.3-3.0]) and for people who hunt or fish (OR = 1.5 [1.0-2.4]) and a protective effect of latrines (OR = 0.5 [0.4-0.8]). Among males, those hunting or fishing at night had an increased risk for antigenemia (OR = 1.9 [1.1-3.5]), and use of latrines was protective (OR = 0.5 [0.3-0.9]). For females, bed nets were protective (OR = 0.4 [0.1-0.9]), and there was a strong household effect (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.24). When mf was used as the dependent variable, males had a higher risk for infection (OR = 5.4 [2.1-13.4]), latrines had a protective effect (OR = 0.4 [0.1-0.9]) and there was a marked household effect (ICC = 0.49).CONCLUSIONS: Age, sex, and occupation-dependent exposure to mosquitoes were important risk factors for infection with W. bancrofti in this study. It is likely that men often acquire infection in high transmission areas outside of the village, while children and women are infected in areas with lower transmission inside or near the village. Additional studies are needed to determine whether these findings apply to other areas in Central Africa."

We present two complementary research approaches that reveal a significant increase in public demand for conservation within tropical developing countries as those countries reach upper-middle-income (UMI) status. We highlight UMI tropical countries because they contain nearly four-fifths of tropical primary forests, which are rich in biodiversity and stored carbon. The first approach is a set of statistical analyses of various cross-country conservation indicators, which suggests that protective government policies have lagged behind the increase in public demand in these countries. The second approach is a case study from Malaysia, which reveals in a more integrated fashion the linkages from rising household income to increased household willingness to pay for conservation, nongovernmental organization activity, and delayed government action. Our findings suggest that domestic funding in UMI tropical countries can play a larger role in (i) closing the funding gap for tropical forest conservation, and (ii) paying for supplementary conservation actions linked to international payments for reduced greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in tropical countries."

In 2010, 'informed choice' was withdrawn in favour of antiretroviral prophylaxis with breastfeeding. A 2010-11 ethnographic study conducted in Senegal among HIV-positive mothers revealed three broad responses to the withdrawal of choice and formula provision: 'resistance' from association members claiming the health system was responsible for providing formula to ensure efficient prevention; 'compliance' among mothers adopting 'protected breastfeeding' without complaints; and 'self-reliance' among women trying to obtain formula through other means without mentioning choice. These three responses shed light on the meanings attributed to choice and on the social impact of formula provision during the 'informed choice era.' The analysis shows that the top-down introduction of 'informed choice' as an ethical and management imperative was appropriated and re-signified locally, making space for new forms of sociality within medical and associative social spaces. These social forms could not easily be maintained after the withdrawal of formula provision; women who continue to exert choice do so silently. By focusing on the upheaval of social care arrangements after the introduction of prophylaxis by pharmaceuticals, this paper sheds light on the understudied local consequences of changes in public health policies and the social framing of 'choice' in low-income countries' health systems."

Multivariate regression analyses were then used to test for associations between the characteristics of parental pesticide exposure during pregnancy and the corresponding birth outcomes. Maternal occupational exposure was associated with an elevated risk of low birth weight (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval]: 4.2 [1.2, 15.4]). Paternal occupational exposure to pesticides was associated with a lower than average gestational age at birth (-0.7 weeks; p = 0.0002) and an elevated risk of prematurity (OR: 3.7 [1.4, 9.7]). Levels of domestic exposure to veterinary antiparasitics and to pesticides for indoor plants were both associated with a low birth weight (-70 g; p = 0.02 and -160 g; p = 0.005, respectively). Babies born to women living in urban areas had a lower birth length and a higher risk of low birth length (-0.4 cm, p = 0.006 and OR: 2.9 [1.5, 5.5], respectively).

The strain UMI-21 can produce polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) from starch, maltotriose, or maltose as a sole carbon source. Taxonomic studies and 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that strain UMI-21 was phylogenetically related to species of the genus Massilia. The PHA content under the cultivation condition using a 10-L jar fermentor was 45.5% (w/w). This value was higher than that obtained after cultivation in a flask, suggesting the possibility of large-scale PHA production by UMI-21 from starch. A major issue for the industrial production of microbial PHAs is the very high production cost. Starch is a relatively inexpensive substrate that is also found in abundant seaweeds such as Ulva. Therefore, the strain isolated in this study may be very useful for producing PHA from seaweeds containing polysaccharides such as starch. In addition, a 3.7-kbp DNA fragment containing the whole PHA synthase gene (phaC) was obtained from the strain UMI-21. The results of open reading frame (ORF) analysis suggested that the DNA fragment contained two ORFs, which were composed of 1740 (phaC) and 564 bp (phaR). The deduced amino acid sequence of PhaC from strain UMI-21 shared high similarity with PhaC from Ralstonia eutropha, which is a representative PHA-producing bacterium with a class I PHA synthase.

In particular, the contribution of dispersal and its exact impact on local community composition is still unclear. For example, dispersing cells may not thrive in recipient environments, but may still remain part of the local species pool. Here, we experimentally tested if marine bacteria can be retrieved from freshwater communities (pelagic and sediment) and the atmosphere by exposing bacteria from three lakes, that differ in their proximity to the Norwegian Sea, to marine conditions. We found that the percentage of freshwater taxa decreased with increasing salinities, whereas marine taxa increased along the same gradient. Our results further showed that this increase was stronger for lake and sediment compared with air communities. Further, significant increases in the average niche breadth of taxa were found for all sources, and in particular lake water and sediment communities, at higher salinities. Our results therefore suggests that marine taxa can readily grow from freshwater sources, but that the response was likely driven by the growth of habitat generalists that are typically found in marine systems. Finally, there was a greater proportion of marine taxa found in communities originating from the lake closest to the Norwegian Sea. In summary, this study shows that the interplay between bacterial dispersal limitation and dispersal from internal and external sources may have an important role for community recovery in response to environmental change."

We found that the interlayer friction for insulating BNNTs results in ultrahigh viscous-like dissipation that is proportional to the contact area, whereas for the semimetallic CNTs the sliding friction vanishes within experimental uncertainty. We ascribe this difference to the ionic character of the BN, which allows charge localization. The interlayer viscous friction of BNNTs suggests that BNNT membranes could serve as extremely efficient shock-absorbing surfaces."

The parent pesticides were rarely present and were only found at very low concentrations, except for the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and cypermethrin, which were found in 7.6% of meconium samples at concentrations of between 43.8 and 480 ng/g. The most frequently detected contaminant was the organophosphate metabolite dimethyl thiophosphate detected in 49.1% of the samples and quantified with a median concentration of 344 ng/g. These data evidence significant foetal exposure to organophosphate pesticides, pyrethroids and carbamates."

We assume that fish can migrate from MPA to fishing area at a very fast time scale and fish spatial organisation can change from small to large clusters of school at a fast time scale. The growth of the fish population and the catch are assumed to occur at a slow time scale. The complete model is a system of five ordinary differential equations with three time scales. We take advantage of the time scales using aggregation of variables methods to derive a reduced model governing the total fish density and fishing effort at the slow time scale. We analyze this aggregated model and show that under some conditions, there exists an equilibrium corresponding to a sustainable fishery. Our results suggest that in small pelagic fisheries the yield is maximum for a fish population distributed among both small and large clusters of school."

This peculiar sorption pattern can be captured via the formulation of thermodynamic isotherms, providing a direct enthalpic and entropic view of the gate-opening process. Relying on such an approach, an energy barrier with preferential enthalpic nature for CO2 adsorption/desorption in the gate-opening region could be unveiled. Moreover, the elastic energy involved during the gate-opening process was revisited to 1.4-2.8 kJ mol(-1) of solid in the temperature range 273-323 K, matching the value measured by isostatic compression of a ZIF-7_lp sample filled with DMF and showing a dominant entropic contribution."

As a consequence of the study of the large population limit, global existence of a nonnegative weak solution to a multidimensional parabolic strongly coupled model of competing species is proved. The main new feature of the corresponding integro-differential equation is the nonlocal nonlinearity appearing in the diffusion terms, which may depend on the spatial densities of all population types. Moreover, the diffusion matrix is generally not strictly positive definite and the cross-diffusion effect allows for influences growing linearly with the subpopulations' sizes. We prove uniqueness of the finite measure-valued solution and give conditions under which the solution takes values in a functional space. We then make the competition kernels converge to a Dirac measure and obtain the existence of a solution to a locally competitive version of the previous equation. The techniques are essentially based on the underlying stochastic flow related to the dispersive part of the dynamics, and the use of suitable dual distances in the space of finite measures."

We conducted the first prospective study on intestinal parasites, including opportunistic protozoa, in newly diagnosed HIV infected patients, with or without diarrhea. The aims were to describe the spectrum of infections, to determine their prevalence and to assess their associations with diarrhea, CD4 cell count, place of residence and living conditions.METHODOLOGY: One to three stool samples over consecutive days were obtained from 137 patients. The Kato thick smear method, formalin-ethyl concentration and specific stains for coccidia and microsporidia diagnosis were performed on 260 stool samples. Baseline characteristics regarding relevant demographics, place of residence and living conditions, clinical features including diarrhea, were collected using a standardized questionnaire.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The 137 patients were young (median age: 36 years) and severely immunocompromised (83.9% at WHO stage 3 or 4, median CD4 cell count: 41/mm3). Diarrhea was present in 43.0% of patients. Parasite infection was found in 78.8% of patients, infection with at least two species in 49.6%. Prevalence rates of protozoan and helminth infections were similar (54.7% and 58.4% respectively). Blastocystis sp. was the most frequent protozoa (26.3%). Cryptosporidium sp., Cytoisospora belli and microsporidia, found at low prevalence rates (6.6%, 4.4%, 2.9%, respectively), were described for the first time in Laos. Cryptosporidium sp. was associated with persistent diarrhea. Strongyloides stercoralis was the most prevalent helminth following Opisthorchis viverrini (20.4% and 47.5% respectively). The most immunocompromised patients, as assessed by a CD4 count ≤ 50 cells/mm3, were more likely to be infected with intestinal parasites.SIGNIFICANCE: HIV infection was mainly diagnosed at an advanced stage of immunosuppression in Lao patients. Intestinal parasite infections were highly prevalent regardless of their diarrheal status. Opportunistic infections were reported. Improving the laboratory diagnosis of intestinal parasite infections and the knowledge on their local risk factors is warranted."

The present study sought to determine whether or not changes in smooth muscle contractility and the thickness of the proximal, dilated bowel wall can be reversed following relief of the obstruction.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups of seven male Wistar rats were studied. In 8-week-old animals in a control group and a sham-operated group, a small segment of bowel (designated as R1 for controls and R2 for shams) was resected 5.0 cm from the cecum. In the third (operated) group, a narrow, isoperistaltic intestinal loop was created proximal to an end-to-end anastomosis of the ileum in 4-week-old animals. When these animals were 6 weeks old, the loop was re-anastomosed to the distal small bowel (after resection of the loop's distal portion, referred to as R3). Two weeks later, a small segment of bowel was resected proximal to the anastomosis (R4). We evaluated the thickness of the smooth muscle layers and the in vitro contractile responses of circular smooth muscle ileal strips (R1-R4) to electrical stimulation and pharmacological stimulation (with KCl, acetylcholine (ACh), substance P, N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and histamine).RESULTS: The amplitudes of contraction in response to electrical and Ach-mediated stimulation were higher for R3 than for R4 (P&lt;0.001), R1 and R2 (both P&lt;0.05). Compared with R1 and R2, the smooth muscle layer was three times as thick in R3 (P&lt;0.001) and 2.5 times as thick in R4 (P&lt;0.01).CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence of the possible recovery of intestinal motility (in response to neurotransmitters involved in gut function) after the relief of an obstruction. If ileal motility can conceivably return to normal values, conservative surgical procedures in pediatric patients should be preferred (in order to leave a sufficient length of bowel and avoid short bowel syndrome)."

These materials explain the underlying principles or rationale that guide the functioning of verifications.RESULTS: An illustration of this proposal is made using a medical protocol defining guidelines for the monitoring and prevention of nosocomial infections. Such infections, which are acquired in the hospital, increase morbidity and mortality and add noticeably to economic burden. An evaluation of the use of the graphical verification found that this method aids in the improvement of both clinical knowledge and the quality of actions made.DISCUSSION: As conceptual graphs, representations based on diagrams can be translated into computational tree logic. However, diagrams are much more natural and explicitly human, emphasizing a theoretical and practical consistency.CONCLUSION: The proposed approach allows for the visual modeling of temporal reasoning and a formalization of knowledge that can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of nosocomial infections and some clinical problems. This is the first time that one emphasizes the temporal situation modeling in conceptual graphs. It will also deliver a formal verification method for clinical guideline analyses."

Our measurements suggest that amplification takes place only if the seed pulse-trains are perfectly synchronized in time with the driving laser field in the amplifier. Varying the delay, we estimate the durations of the individual extreme ultraviolet pulses within the train to be on the order of 0.2 fs. Our results demonstrate that strong-field parametric amplification can be a suitable tool to amplify weak attosecond pulses from non-destructive pump-probe experiments and it is an important step towards designing amplifiers for realization of energetic XUV pulses with sub-femtosecond duration using compact lasers fitting in university laboratories."

We assessed the association between gender and virologic failure among adult patients treated in a public routine clinic (one of the largest in West Africa) in Burkina Faso.METHODS: We performed a case-control study between July and October 2012 among patients who had received ART at the Bobo Dioulasso Day Care Unit. Patients were eligible if they were 15 years or older, positive for HIV-1 or HIV-1+2, and on first-line ART for at least six months. Cases were all patients with two consecutive HIV loads &gt;1000 copies/mL (Biocentric Generic or Abbott Real Time assays), or one HIV load &gt;1000 copies/mL associated with immunologic or clinical failure criteria. Controls were all patients who only had HIV loads &lt;300 copies/mL. The association between gender and virologic failure was assessed using a multivariate logistic regression, adjusted on age, level of education, baseline CD4+ T cell count, first and current antiretroviral regimens and time on ART.RESULTS: Of 2303 patients (74.2% women; median age: 40 years; median time on ART: 34 months), 172 had virologic failure and 2131 had virologic success. Among the former, 130 (75.6%) had confirmed virologic failure, 38 (22.1%) had viro-immunologic failure, and four (2.3%) had viro-clinical failure. The proportion of men was significantly higher among the cases than among the controls (37.2% vs. 24.9%; p&lt;0.001). Compared to controls, cases were also younger, more immunodeficient at ART initiation, less likely to receive a protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimen and had spent a longer period of time on ART. After adjustment, male gender remained strongly associated with virologic failure (odds ratio 2.52, 95% CI: 1.77-3.60; p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Men on ART appeared more vulnerable to virologic failure than women. Additional studies are needed to confirm the poorer prognosis of men in this setting and to determine the causes for their vulnerability in order to optimize HIV care. From now on, efforts should be made to support the adherence of men to ART in the African setting."

Bis-alkylguanidines have been designed to mimic choline, resulting in the inhibition of plasmodial de novo phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Despite potent in vitro antiplasmodial and in vivo antimalarial activities, a major drawback of these compounds for further clinical development is their low oral bioavailability. To solve this issue, various modulations were performed on bis-alkylguanidines. The introduction of N-disubstituents on the guanidino motif improved both in vitro and in vivo activities. On the other hand, in vivo pharmacological evaluation in a mouse model showed that the N-hydroxylated derivatives constitute the first oral bioprecursors in bis-alkylguanidine series.

Because it reflects the current status of hyperglycemia, urinary myo-inositol (UMI) may be useful. We evaluated UMI as a screening tool for glucose intolerance.DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, community-based population study of 1057 Japanese residents. 173 with an FPG level between 5.5 and 6.9 mmol/L and an HbA1c under 6.5% had an oral glucose tolerance test. We measured UMI level before (fasting UMI) and 2h after (2h-UMI) glucose ingestion. Δ-UMI was defined as the difference between fasting UMI and 2h-UMI.RESULTS: Δ-UMI, 2h-UMI and HbA1c levels significantly increased as glucose intolerance worsened. Δ-UMI level was significantly positively correlated with 2h-UMI level (r=0.896, p&lt;0.001). Using cutoff levels from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, the sensitivity of Δ-UMI (82.1%) and 2h-UMI (79.3%) were higher than that of HbA1c (48.3%).

"23292512";"UMI";"UMI";"Nature";20;2013;"The architecture of human general transcription factor TFIID core complex.";"The initiation of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II is regulated by a plethora of proteins in human cells. The first general transcription factor to bind gene promoters is transcription factor IID (TFIID). TFIID triggers pre-initiation complex formation, functions as a coactivator by interacting with transcriptional activators and reads epigenetic marks. TFIID is a megadalton-sized multiprotein complex composed of TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Despite its crucial role, the detailed architecture and assembly mechanism of TFIID remain elusive. Histone fold domains are prevalent in TAFs, and histone-like tetramer and octamer structures have been proposed in TFIID. A functional core-TFIID subcomplex was revealed in Drosophila nuclei, consisting of a subset of TAFs (TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF9 and TAF12). These core subunits are thought to be present in two copies in holo-TFIID, in contrast to TBP and other TAFs that are present in a single copy, conveying a transition from symmetry to asymmetry in the TFIID assembly pathway. Here we present the structure of human core-TFIID determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 11.6 Å resolution. Our structure reveals a two-fold symmetric, interlaced architecture, with pronounced protrusions, that accommodates all conserved structural features of the TAFs including the histone folds. We further demonstrate that binding of one TAF8-TAF10 complex breaks the original symmetry of core-TFIID. We propose that the resulting asymmetric structure serves as a functional scaffold to nucleate holo-TFIID assembly, by accreting one copy each of the remaining TAFs and TBP."

Here, we describe a novel selective Mcl-1 SMI inhibitor, 2 (UMI-77), developed by structure-based chemical modifications of the lead compound 1 (UMI-59). We have characterized the binding of UMI-77 to Mcl-1 by using complementary biochemical, biophysical, and computational methods and determined its antitumor activity against a panel of pancreatic cancer cells and an in vivo xenograft model. UMI-77 binds to the BH3-binding groove of Mcl-1 with Ki of 490 nmol/L, showing selectivity over other members of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family. UMI-77 inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, accompanied by cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that UMI-77 blocks the heterodimerization of Mcl-1/Bax and Mcl-1/Bak in cells, thus antagonizing the Mcl-1 function. The Bax/Bak-dependent induction of apoptosis was further confirmed using murine embryonic fibroblasts that are Bax- and Bak-deficient. In an in vivo BxPC-3 xenograft model, UMI-77 effectively inhibited tumor growth. Western blot analysis in tumor remnants revealed enhancement of proapoptotic markers and significant decrease of survivin. Collectively, these promising findings show the therapeutic potential of Mcl-1 inhibitors against pancreatic cancer and warrant further preclinical investigations."

"23555270";"UMI";"UMI";"PLoS pathogens";11;2013;"Monomeric nucleoprotein of influenza A virus.";"Isolated influenza A virus nucleoprotein exists in an equilibrium between monomers and trimers. Samples containing only monomers or only trimers can be stabilized by respectively low and high salt. The trimers bind RNA with high affinity but remain trimmers, whereas the monomers polymerise onto RNA forming nucleoprotein-RNA complexes. When wild type (wt) nucleoprotein is crystallized, it forms trimers, whether one starts with monomers or trimers. We therefore crystallized the obligate monomeric R416A mutant nucleoprotein and observed how the domain exchange loop that leads over to a neighbouring protomer in the trimer structure interacts with equivalent sites on the mutant monomer surface, avoiding polymerisation. The C-terminus of the monomer is bound to the side of the RNA binding surface, lowering its positive charge. Biophysical characterization of the mutant and wild type monomeric proteins gives the same results, suggesting that the exchange domain is folded in the same way for the wild type protein. In a search for how monomeric wt nucleoprotein may be stabilized in the infected cell we determined the phosphorylation sites on nucleoprotein isolated from virus particles. We found that serine 165 was phosphorylated and conserved in all influenza A and B viruses. The S165D mutant that mimics phosphorylation is monomeric and displays a lowered affinity for RNA compared with wt monomeric NP.

The monomer structure could be used for finding new anti influenza drugs because compounds that stabilize the monomer may slow down viral infection."

In vitro, SRB1 inhibition by ITX5061 impedes HCV replication.METHODS: Multicenter study to assess safety/activity of ITX5061 in previously untreated, noncirrhotic, HCV genotype 1 infected adults. Design included sequential cohorts of 10 subjects with ITX5061 (n = 8) or placebo (n = 2) to escalate duration (3 to 14 to 28 days) or deescalate dose (150 to 75 to 25 mg) based on predefined criteria for safety and activity (≥ 4 of 8 subjects with HCV RNA decline ≥ 1 log10 IU/mL).RESULTS: Thirty subjects enrolled in 3 cohorts: ITX5061 150 mg/day by mouth for 3 (A150), 14 (B150), and 28 (C150) days. Six subjects had grade ≥ 3 adverse events (one in placebo); none were treatment related. One of the 7 C150 subjects (14.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI], .7%-55.4%) had ≥ 1 log10 IU/mL decline in HCV RNA (1.49 log10 IU/mL), whereas none of the 6 placebo, 8 A150 or 8 B150 subjects showed such decline.CONCLUSIONS: Oral ITX5061 150 mg/day for up to 28 days was safe and well tolerated.

Although some of the enveloped viruses recruit the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) to catalyze the final fission reaction, many enveloped viruses seem to bud in an ESCRT-independent manner. Here we describe the principles that govern membrane fission reactions in general and review progress in the understanding of ESCRT-mediated membrane fission. We relate ESCRT function to budding of single stranded RNA viruses and discuss alternative ways to mediate membrane fission that may govern ESCRT-independent budding."

To date, no immunization regimen in animals or humans has produced HIV-1 neutralizing MPER-specific antibodies. We immunized llamas with gp41-MPER proteoliposomes and selected a MPER-specific single chain antibody (VHH), 2H10, whose epitope overlaps with that of mAb 2F5. Bi-2H10, a bivalent form of 2H10, which displayed an approximately 20-fold increased affinity compared to the monovalent 2H10, neutralized various sensitive and resistant HIV-1 strains, as well as SHIV strains in TZM-bl cells. X-ray and NMR analyses combined with mutagenesis and modeling revealed that 2H10 recognizes its gp41 epitope in a helical conformation. Notably, tryptophan 100 at the tip of the long CDR3 is not required for gp41 interaction but essential for neutralization. Thus bi-2H10 is an anti-MPER antibody generated by immunization that requires hydrophobic CDR3 determinants in addition to epitope recognition for neutralization similar to the mode of neutralization employed by mAbs 2F5 and 4E10."

Sub-optimal responses to the drug have been reported in Ghanaian communities under long-term treatment. We assessed, in two Cameroonian foci, whether the microfilaricidal and/or embryostatic effects of ivermectin on Onchocerca volvulus have been altered after several years of drug pressure.METHODS: We compared the dynamics of O. volvulus skin microfilarial densities after ivermectin treatment in two cohorts with contrasting exposure to this drug: one received repeated treatment for 13 years whereas the other had no history of large-scale treatments (referred to as controls). Microfilarial densities were assessed 15, 80 and 180 days after ivermectin in 122 multiply treated and 127 ivermectin-naïve individuals. Comparisons were adjusted for individual factors related to microfilarial density: age and number of nodules.FINDINGS: Two weeks post ivermectin, microfilarial density dropped equally (98% reduction) in the ivermectin-naïve and multiply treated groups. Between 15 and 180 days post ivermectin, the proportion of individuals with skin microfilariae doubled (from 30.8% to 67.8%) in controls and quadrupled (from 19.8% to 76.9%) in multiply treated individuals but the mean densities remained low in both sites. In fact, between 15 and 80 days, the repopulation rate was significantly higher in the multiply treated individuals than in the controls but no such difference was demonstrated when extending the follow-up to 180 days. The repopulation rate by microfilariae was associated with host factors: negatively with age and positively with the number of nodules.CONCLUSION: These observations may indicate that the worms from the multi-treated area recover mf productivity earlier but would be less productive than the worms from the ivermectin-naïve area between 80 and 180 days after ivermectin. Moreover, they do not support the operation of a strong cumulative effect of repeated treatments on the fecundity of female worms as previously described."

Here, we show that Lsm2 and Lsm3 bridge the interaction between the C-terminus of Pat1 (Pat1C) and the Lsm1-7 complex. The Lsm2-3-Pat1C complex and the Lsm1-7-Pat1C complex stimulate decapping in vitro to a similar extent and exhibit similar RNA-binding preference. The crystal structure of the Lsm2-3-Pat1C complex shows that Pat1C binds to Lsm2-3 to form an asymmetric complex with three Pat1C molecules surrounding a heptameric ring formed by Lsm2-3. Structure-based mutagenesis revealed the importance of Lsm2-3-Pat1C interactions in decapping activation in vivo. Based on the structure of Lsm2-3-Pat1C, a model of Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex is constructed and how RNA binds to this complex is discussed."

This study presents levels and trends in maternal mortality in Agincourt, a rural subdistrict of South Africa, under long-term health and sociodemographic surveillance.METHODS: All deaths of women aged 15 years-49 years occurring in the study area between 1992 and 2010 were investigated, and causes of death were assessed by verbal autopsy. Two case definitions were used: &quot;obstetrical&quot; (direct) causes, defined as deaths caused by conditions listed under O00-O95 in International Classification of Diseases-10; and &quot;pregnancy-related deaths&quot;, defined as any death occurring during the maternal risk period (pregnancy, delivery, 6 weeks postpartum), irrespective of cause.RESULTS: The case definition had a major impact on levels and trends in maternal mortality. The obstetric mortality ratio averaged 185 per 100,000 live births over the period (60 deaths), whereas the pregnancy-related mortality ratio averaged 423 per 100,000 live births (137 deaths). Results from both calculations increased over the period, with a peak around 2006, followed by a decline coincident with the national roll-out of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV and antiretroviral treatment programs. Mortality increase from direct causes was mainly due to hypertension or sepsis. Mortality increase from other causes was primarily due to the rise in deaths from HIV/AIDS and pulmonary tuberculosis.CONCLUSION: These trends underline the major fluctuations induced by emerging infectious diseases in South Africa, a country undergoing rapid and complex health transitions. Findings also pose questions about the most appropriate case definition for maternal mortality and emphasize the need for a consistent definition in order to better monitor and compare trends over time and across settings."

The Schizosaccharomyces pombe τA subcomplex comprises subunits Sfc1, Sfc4 and Sfc7. The crystal structure of the Sfc1/Sfc7 heterodimer reveals similar domains and overall domain architecture to the Pol II-specific general transcription factor TFIIF Rap30/Rap74. The N-terminal Sfc1/Sfc7 dimerization module consists of a triple β-barrel similar to the N-terminal TFIIF Rap30/Rap74 dimerization module, whereas the C-terminal Sfc1 DNA-binding domain contains a winged-helix domain most similar to the TFIIF Rap30 C-terminal winged-helix domain. Sfc1 DNA-binding domain recognizes single and double-stranded DNA by an unknown mechanism. Several features observed for A-box recognition by τA resemble the recognition of promoters by bacterial RNA polymerase, where σ factor unfolds double-stranded DNA and stabilizes the non-coding DNA strand in an open conformation. Such a function has also been proposed for TFIIF, suggesting that the observed structural similarity between Sfc1/Sfc7 and TFIIF Rap30/Rap74 might also reflect similar functions."

Despite some support in humans, this assertion does not hold over the range of different natural animal species where cancer incidence is known. Explaining the so-called 'Peto's paradox' is likely to increase our understanding of how cancer defense mechanisms are shaped by natural selection. Here, we study how body mass may affect the evolutionary dynamics of tumor suppressor gene (TSG) inactivation and oncogene activation in natural animal species. We show that the rate of TSG inactivation should evolve to lower values along a gradient of body mass in a nonlinear manner, having a threshold beyond which benefits to adaptive traits cannot overcome their costs. We also show that oncogenes may be frequently activated within populations of large organisms. We then propose experimental settings that can be employed to identify protection mechanisms against cancer. We finally highlight fundamental species traits that natural selection should favor against carcinogenesis. We conclude on the necessity of comparing genomes between populations of a single species or genomes between species to better understand how evolution has molded protective mechanisms against cancer development and associated mortality."

Steady-state PK profiles were performed during the second (optional) and third trimesters and at 6-12 weeks post-partum. PK targets were the estimated 10(th) percentile IDV AUC (12.9 μg ml(-1)h) in non-pregnant historical Thai adults and a trough concentration of 0.1 μg ml(-1), the suggested minimum target.RESULTS: Twenty-six pregnant women were enrolled; thirteen entered during the second trimester. Median (range) age was 29.8 (18.9-40.8) years and weight 60.5 (50.0-85.0) kg at the third trimester PK visit. The 90% confidence limits for the geometric mean ratio of the indinavir AUC(0,12 h) and Cmax during the second trimester and post-partum (ante : post ratios) were 0.58 (0.49, 0.68) and 0.73 (0.59, 0.91), respectively; third trimester/post-partum AUC(0,12 h) and Cmax ratios were 0.60 (0.53, 0.68) and 0.63 (0.55, 0.72), respectively. IDV/r was well tolerated and 21/26 women had a HIV-1 viral load &lt; 40 copies ml(-1) at delivery.

Human UPF2 comprises three tandem MIF4G domains and a C-terminal UPF1 binding region. MIF4G-3 binds UPF3b, but the specific functions of MIF4G-1 and MIF4G-2 are unknown. Crystal structures show that both MIF4G-1 and MIF4G-2 contain N-terminal capping helices essential for stabilization of the 10-helix MIF4G core and that MIF4G-2 interacts with MIF4G-3, forming a rigid assembly. The UPF2/UPF3b/SMG1 complex is thought to activate the kinase SMG1 to phosphorylate UPF1 in vivo. We identify MIF4G-3 as the binding site and in vitro substrate of SMG1 kinase and show that a ternary UPF2 MIF4G-3/UPF3b/SMG1 complex can form in vitro. Whereas in vivo complementation assays show that MIF4G-1 and MIF4G-2 are essential for NMD, tethering assays reveal that UPF2 truncated to only MIF4G-3 and the UPF1-binding region can still partially accomplish NMD. Thus UPF2 MIF4G-1 and MIF4G-2 appear to have a crucial scaffolding role, while MIF4G-3 is the key module required for triggering NMD."

Androgen organization involves promotion of masculine body features, usually by acting through androgen receptors (ARs). We have recently demonstrated that the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) system in the lumbar spinal cord also mediates spinal centers promoting penile reflexes during male sexual behavior in rats. Testosterone may induce sexual differentiation of this spinal GRP system during development and maintain its activation in adulthood. In the present study, we examined the role of ARs in the nervous system regulating the development of the sexually dimorphic GRP system. For this purpose, we used a conditional mouse line selectively lacking the AR gene in the nervous system. AR floxed males carrying (mutants) or not (controls) the nestin-Cre transgene were castrated in adulthood and supplemented with physiological amounts of testosterone. Loss of AR expression in the nervous system resulted in a significant decrease in the number of GRP neurons compared to control littermates. Consequently, the intensity of GRP axonal projections onto the lower lumbar and upper sacral spinal cord was greater in control males than in mutant males. These results suggest that ARs expressed in the nervous system play a significant role in the development of the GRP system in the male lumbar spinal cord. The AR-deletion mutation may attenuate sexual behavior and activity of mutant males via spinal GRP system-mediated neural mechanisms."

Treatment histories from 1999 to 2009 were reviewed. Treatment changes were categorized as: drug substitution (within class), switch across drug class (non nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) to/from protease inhibitor (PI)), and to salvage therapy (dual PI or PI and NNRTI). Antiretroviral drug costs were calculated in 6-month cycles (US$ 2009 prices). Predictors of high drug cost including characteristics at start of ART (baseline), initial regimen, treatment change, and duration on ART were assessed using mixed-effects regression models.RESULTS: Five hundred seven children initiated ART with a median 54 (interquartile range, 36-72) months of follow-up. Fifty-two percent had a drug substitution, 21% switched across class, and 2% to salvage therapy. When allowing for drug substitution, 78% remained on their initial regimen. Mean drug cost increased from $251 to $428 per child per year in the first and fifth year of therapy, respectively. PI-based and salvage regimens accounted for 16% and 2% of treatments prescribed and 33% and 5% of total costs, respectively. Predictors of high cost include baseline age ≥ 8 years, non nevirapine-based initial regimen, switch across drug class, and to salvage regimen (P &lt; 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: At 5 years, 21% of children switched across drug class and 2% received salvage therapy.

Our study aims to describe the factors involved in the success or failure of the community-directed intervention (CDI) approach through control programmes, which aims to achieve consistent high coverage at affordable and sustainable costs in endemic areas.METHODS: The CDI approach was carried out from December 2007 to October 2008 in ten villages of the district of Diéma, Mali. At inclusion, each child part of the study's sample was interviewed and submitted for a physical examination. The study focused on: data collection, treatment of the eligible population, evaluation of the treatment coverage, performance of community drug distributors (CDDs), and the involvement and perception of populations.RESULTS: A total of 8,022 eligible people were studied with a mean coverage rate of 76.7%. Using multiple regression, it was determined that receiving praziquantel as treatment was associated with five factors: belonging to the Fulani or Moorish ethnic minority versus the Bambara/Soninke, use of the central versus the house-to-house drug distribution mode, the ratio of the population to the number of CDDs, the lack of supervision and belonging to the age group of 15 years or above (p&lt;0.05). As well as that, it was found that the presence of parallel community-based programmes (HIV, tuberculosis) that provide financial incentives for community members discouraged many CDDs (who in most cases are volunteers) to participate in the CDI approach due to a lack of incentives.CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the success of the CDI approach depends on, amongst other things, the personal characteristics of the respondents, as well as on community factors."

These mechanisms operate simultaneously but their relative importance and interactions are difficult to unravel experimentally. Thus, niche differentiation and facilitation have been lumped together and separated from the sampling effect. Here, we propose three hypotheses about interactions among the three mechanisms and test them using a simulation model. The model simulated water movement through soil and vegetation, and net primary production mimicking the Patagonian steppe. Using the model, we created grass and shrub monocultures and mixtures, controlled root overlap and grass water-use efficiency (WUE) to simulate gradients of biodiversity, resource partitioning and facilitation. The presence of shrubs facilitated grass growth by increasing its WUE and in turn increased the sampling effect, whereas root overlap (resource partitioning) had, on average, no effect on sampling effect. Interestingly, resource partitioning and facilitation interacted so the effect of facilitation on sampling effect decreased as resource partitioning increased. Sampling effect was enhanced by the difference between the two functional groups in their efficiency in using resources. Morphological and physiological differences make one group outperform the other; once these differences were established further differences did not enhance the sampling effect. In addition, grass WUE and root overlap positively influence the biodiversity effect but showed no interactions."

We first implemented a qualitative study (April 2007) to identify local representations of body weight among Bamiléké using semi-structured interviews. We then quantitatively assessed body size perceptions among a representative sample of Bamiléké (May to June 2007), employing a body image assessment scale and a questionnaire that included declarative body weight self-satisfaction, health status, and attempts to reduce weight. Results indicate Desired Body Size (DBS) for women, and particularly for men, was situated in the overweight category. Qualitative analyses show that overweight is considered as a normal and healthy body size in the Bamiléké. On the other hand, the quantitative study reveals that high rates of obesity, especially in women (40.8% obese), are associated with high blood pressure. Moreover, subjects who had a negative perception of their health status wanted to lose weight (p &lt; 0.01). Unlike males, females have a DBS lower than their Current Body Size (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, subjects (particularly males) who felt they were too lean, were older than those who felt too fat. We therefore conclude that the social valorisation of stoutness exposes Bamiléké, particularly males, to obesity. Although the women stated a desire to lose weight and present aesthetic criteria more oriented towards slimness, the attitude of the Bamiléké remained oriented toward stoutness appreciation.

Thirty faecal samples collected in the forests of south-east Cameroon (Mambele area) from 2003 to 2011 were preserved in RNAlater at -80 °C and analysed for their parasite content. We identified and counted parasitic elements and assessed their shape, size and morphology in relation to the storage time of the samples. We found that parasite elements were identifiable in RNAlater preserved samples after as many as 7 years, showing that RNAlater could be an effective and reliable preservation medium for coprology. Thus, its use could be an interesting way to optimise sample collection for several types of studies (parasitology and bacteriology/virology) at once, especially considering the logistically challenging and time-consuming field campaigns needed to obtain these faecal samples."

Selected individuals must be over the age of 15 years and resided in the area. Cluster sampling helped recruit individuals. Collected information related to digestive pathology (yes or no), periodontal status (plate index, inflammation, bleeding, loss of attachment, the depth of pocket and the CPITN.) Dental status was evaluated by the DMFT. The data analyzed with software R and the Student's t test used to compare the averages of the indices in both groups at the threshold of 5%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to isolate the final model with a threshold of 5%.RESULTS: Averages of dental and periodontal index were broadly equal in both groups (sick and not sick). The DMF and missing teeth were significantly associated with the digestive pathology after adjustment on gender, age, BMI, marital status, the number of cigarettes smoked and the depth of pocket.CONCLUSION: This study revealed a significant association between dental status and digestive pathology. The comprehensive care of patients therefore raises the interest of collaboration between surgeons, dentists and gastroenterologists for effective and adequate treatment."

Assessment tools to identify high risk individuals may improve the harm versus benefit profile of screening ECGs. In particular, people with unrecognized myocardial infarction (UMI) have elevated risk for cardiovascular events and death.METHODS: Using logistic regression, we developed a basic assessment tool among 16,653 participants in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study using demographics, self-reported medical history, blood pressure, and body mass index and an expanded assessment tool using information on 51 potential variables. UMI was defined as electrocardiogram evidence of myocardial infarction without a self-reported history (n = 740).RESULTS: The basic assessment tool had a c-statistic of 0.638 (95% confidence interval 0.617-0.659) and included age, race, smoking status, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and self-reported history of transient ischemic attack, deep vein thrombosis, falls, diabetes, and hypertension. A predicted probability of UMI &gt; 3% provided a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 30%. The expanded assessment tool had a c-statistic of 0.654 (95% confidence interval 0.634-0.674). Because of the poor performance of these assessment tools, external validation was not pursued.CONCLUSIONS: Despite examining a large number of potential correlates of UMI, the assessment tools did not provide a high level of discrimination. These data suggest defining groups with high prevalence of UMI for targeted screening will be difficult."

The prevalence of cardioprotective medication use and blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control among individuals with UMI is unknown.METHODS: Participants from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study who were recruited between May 2004 and October 2007 received baseline twelve-lead electrocardiograms (n = 21,036). Myocardial infarction (MI) status was characterized as no MI, UMI (electrocardiogram abnormalities consistent with MI without self-reported history; n = 949; 4.5%), and RMI (self-reported history of MI; n = 1574; 7.5%).RESULTS: For participants with no MI, UMI, and RMI, prevalence of use was 38.4%, 44.4%, and 75.7% for aspirin; 18.0%, 25.8%, and 57.2% for beta blockers; 31.7%, 38.7%, and 55.0% for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers; and 28.1%, 33.9%, and 64.1% for statins, respectively.

This issue is usually tackled using either organic solvents or surfactants to promote emulsification, making industrial processes expensive and not environmentally friendly. As an alternative, Pickering emulsions using solid particles with tailored designed surface properties can promote phase contact within intrinsically biphasic systems. Here we show that amphiphilic silica nanoparticles bearing a proper combination of alkyl and strong acidic surface groups can generate stable Pickering emulsions of the glycerol/dodecanol system in the temperature range of 35-130°C. We also show that such particles can perform as Pickering Interfacial Catalysts for the acid-catalyzed etherification of glycerol with dodecanol at 150°C. Our findings shed light on some key parameters governing emulsion stability and catalytic activity of Pickering interfacial catalytic systems. This understanding is critical to pave the way toward technological solutions for biomass upgrading able to promote eco-efficient reactions between immiscible organic reagents with neither use of solvents nor surfactants."

Dosing is based on body weight bands or body surface area under FDA approval and only body surface area by the EMA. This can lead to a different recommended dose. In addition, weight band-based dosing has not been formally studied in the target population. We evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LPV/r in children, administered twice daily according to the FDA weight bands, using pediatric tablets.METHODS: Fifty-three HIV-infected children were included in the PK substudy of the Paediatric European Network for the Treatment of AIDS 18 trial (KONCERT). In this study, children were randomized to receive LPV/r twice or once daily, according to FDA weight bands. A PK assessment was performed in 17, 16 and 20 children in the 15-25 kg, ≥ 25-35 kg and &gt;35 kg weight band, respectively, while children took the tablets twice daily. Rich sampling was performed, and PK parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis. Given the high percentage of Asian children, it was also tested whether there was a difference in PK parameters between Asian and non-Asian children.RESULTS: For the total group, LPV geometric mean AUC0-12, Cmax and C12 were 106.9 h × mg/L, 12.0 mg/L and 4.9 mg/L, respectively. There were no significant differences in LPV PK parameters between the weight bands. In addition, weight was not found to be associated with variability in Cmax, C12 or AUC0-12 for the LPV PK parameters.CONCLUSIONS: FDA weight band-based dosing recommendations provide adequate exposure to LPV when using LPV/r pediatric tablets."

We sought to establish whether transient ANS dysfunction (as assessed by heart rate variability) is associated with the occurrence of GER events in neonates during sleep and wakefulness.METHODS: Nineteen neonates with suspected GER underwent simultaneous, synchronized 12-hour polysomnography and esophageal multichannel impedance-pH monitoring. We compared changes in HRV parameters during three types of periods (control and prior to and during reflux) with respect to the vigilance state.RESULTS: The vigilance state influenced the distribution of GER events (P&lt;0.001), with 53.4% observed during wakefulness, 37.6% observed during active sleep and only 9% observed during quiet sleep. A significant increase in the sympathovagal ratio (+32%, P=0.013) was observed in the period immediately prior to reflux (due to a 15% reduction in parasympathetic activity (P=0.017)), relative to the control period. This phenomenon was observed during both wakefulness and active sleep.CONCLUSION: Our results showed that GER events were preceded by a vigilance-state-independent decrease in parasympathetic tone. This suggests that a pre-reflux change in ANS activity is one of the factors contributing to the mechanism of reflux in neonates."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of training intensity on salivary adiponectin levels and assess a possible role of salivary adiponectin levels as a predictive factor of reproductive dysfunction and bone mass acquisition in elite RGs. The study included 80 elite female RGs participating in the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championship tournament held in Montpellier, France on September 2011. Anthropometric values were assessed, training data and menstrual pattern were recorded, bone mass was measured with Broadband ultrasound attenuation (dB/Mhz) and baseline salivary adiponectin levels were determined. The athletes were classified as intensely and very intensely trained, considering the mean training intensity (40.84h/week). Moreover, considering their reproductive status, they were divided into RG's with normal menstruation, primary amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea. All comparisons were adjusted to age, BMI and body fat percentage differences. Very intensely trained RGs showed higher salivary adiponectin levels (p=0.05). Moreover, salivary adiponectin levels showed significant correlation with training intensity (r=0.409, p=0.003). On the other hand, no association of salivary adiponectin levels was documented with either reproductive function or bone mass acquisition. The results of the present study suggest that, in elite RGs, salivary adiponectin levels are associated with the intensity of training, possibly reflecting the deterioration of energy balance rather than the training stress. On the other hand, a predictive role of salivary adiponectin levels in reproductive dysfunction or bone mass acquisition could not be supported."

Gabon continues to have a high prevalence of HIV, estimated in 2011 at 5.2%. Overall, 22 253 PLWHA (people living with HIV/AIDS) - adults and children - are being treated, including 9976 on ARVs (antiretroviral drugs). The procedures for ARV initiation are very long, ARVs are frequently out of stock, and treatment in care centers for PLWHA is stigmatized: all these factors favor the development of alternative medicine for HIV care in Gabon.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of alternative medicine in the treatment of PLWHA in Gabon.METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional survey was conducted during a total of four months between May 2009 and September 2010 among PLWHA older than 18 years who had been receiving ARVs for at least 6 months and consented to participate (7 centers) and among physicians and other caregivers of these centers (8 centers). We used a simple random sample method. Epidata software was used for data collection, and the analyses were performed with SAS™ software.RESULTS: Of the 5752 patients on ARVs followed at the 7 study sites, 422 PLWHA were interviewed (58.3% of them women): 284 (67.29%) in Libreville and 138 (38.7) in the provinces. Christians accounted for 90.5% (including 21.5% from Protestant evangelical churches), and Muslins for 5.68%, while 4% stated that they had no religion. 12.5% of doctors referred their patients to religious or spiritual groups.CONCLUSION: Our study showed that half of PLWHA did not know the procedures for access to ARV treatment and that beliefs about HIV/AIDS differed strongly according to place of residence. Finally, the cultural context related to alternative medicine is very present in the PLWHA treatment settings in Gabon. Although PLWHAs have easy access to ARVs, their association with organized and controlled alternative medicine can be beneficial."

The data usually come in the form of a list of metabolites whose concentrations significantly changed under some conditions, and are thus not easy to interpret without being able to precisely visualize how such metabolites are interconnected.RESULTS: We present a method that enables to organize the data from any metabolomics experiment into metabolic stories. Each story corresponds to a possible scenario explaining the flow of matter between the metabolites of interest. These scenarios may then be ranked in different ways depending on which interpretation one wishes to emphasize for the causal link between two affected metabolites: enzyme activation, enzyme inhibition or domino effect on the concentration changes of substrates and products. Equally probable stories under any selected ranking scheme can be further grouped into a single anthology that summarizes, in a unique subnetwork, all equivalently plausible alternative stories. An anthology is simply a union of such stories. We detail an application of the method to the response of yeast to cadmium exposure. We use this system as a proof of concept for our method, and we show that we are able to find a story that reproduces very well the current knowledge about the yeast response to cadmium. We further show that this response is mostly based on enzyme activation. We also provide a framework for exploring the alternative pathways or side effects this local response is expected to have in the rest of the network. We discuss several interpretations for the changes we see, and we suggest hypotheses that could in principle be experimentally tested. Noticeably, our method requires simple input data and could be used in a wide variety of applications.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code for the method presented in this article is available at http://gobbolino.gforge.inria.fr."

In some cases, the unfavorable -I effect of nitrogen surpasses its beneficial +M effect, and amidiniums become less stable than iminiums. It is shown that although 1-aza-3-azonia[3.3.1]bicyclo-non-2-enes can be isolated, they feature a nonclassical reactivity, which is more typical for iminium than amidinium salts, such as pronounced electrophilicity and azomethineylide instead of carbene formation."

Because the amplitude of a bounded beam is not constant along its wave front, a specific beam profile is formed that influences the local efficiency of energy conversion of incident sound into Lamb waves or Rayleigh waves. Understanding this phenomenon is important for ultrasonic immersion experiments of objects because the quality of such experiments highly depends on the amount of energy transmitted into the object. This paper shows by means of experiments based on monochromatic Schlieren photography that the area within the bounded beam responsible for Lamb wave generation differs from that responsible for Rayleigh wave generation. Furthermore it provides experimental verification of an earlier numerical study concerning Rayleigh wave generation."

Accompanying major progress in science and technology, the state of knowledge of cyanotoxins has dramatically increased over the last two decades. The bibliometric approach applied in this study shows the evolution of research and identifies major gaps to be filled by future work. Although the publication rate has gradually increased from one hundred to three hundred articles per year since the 1990s, half of the literature available focuses on microcystins and another quarter on saxitoxins. Other cyanotoxins such as beta-N-methylamino-l-alanine or cylindrospermopsin remain vastly disregarded. Moreover, most of the publications deal with toxicity and ecology while other research areas, such as environmental and public health, require additional investigation. The analysis of the literature highlights the main journals for the communication of knowledge on cyanotoxins but also reveals that 90% of the research is originated from only ten countries. These countries are also those with the highest H-index and average number of citation per article. Nonetheless, the ranking of these countries is significantly altered when the amount of publications is normalized based on the population, the number of universities, the national gross domestic product or the government revenue. However, the lower amount of publications from Eastern Europe, Africa and South America could also reflect the lack of monitoring campaigns in these regions. This lack could potentially lead to the underestimation of the prevalence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms and the diversity of toxins worldwide."

In this study we analyzed to what extent dual infections with different HIV-1 variants occur in a population group with high risk behaviour, high HIV-1 prevalence and in an area where multiple HIV-1 subtypes and Circulating Recombinant Forms (CRFs) co-circulate. We studied 69 MSM with our recently developed multi-region hybridization assay (MHA), based on fluorescent probe detection for eight common variants circulating in West and West Central Africa. At least 11 (15.9%) of the 69 patients were simultaneously infected with two different HIV-1 subtypes and/or CRFs. Among the 29 samples identified as subtype C by MHA in gag, 15 (57.7%) reacted with both C1 and C2 probes. Sequence analysis suggests that the majority of the samples reactive with C1 and C2 probes are most likely infected with two different subtype C clades. Single genome amplification and DNA dilutions confirmed dual infection with subtype D and C for MSM1193, triple infection with two different C subtype strains and one CRF02_AG strain in MSM1157 and showed that MSM3017 is at least co-infected with CRF06_cpx and CRF02_AG and another strain that could not be classified. Comparison of all subtype C sequences from the MSM population and from the general population from this and previous studies confirmed the intermixing of HIV-1 variants between low-risk women and high-risk men as shown by the intermixing of subtype C variants from MSM1157 and a female patient (02SN-HALD478). Comparison of dual infection rates between the general population and MSM in Senegal, show also clearly the importance of high HIV prevalence and high risk behavior in dual infections and subsequent intermixing of HIV-1 variants which can lead to emergence and spread of new recombinants (CRFs)."

The method is based on pitch-catch measurements of Lamb waves combined with a baseline subtraction technique in the frequency-wavenumber domain. Small amplitude converted modes, generated during the interaction of propagating waves with damage, can thus be detected with minimal a priori information regarding their expected location in the frequency-wavenumber plane. This method is applied in the present paper to a case of notches with varied depth. Finite element simulations are carried out in the temporal domain to mimic results obtainable in real-world experiments. Two cases are studied, namely when each of the two pure fundamental modes are incident on a notch. The advantages of the method are detailed.

Infants born to HBsAg-positive women had HBsAg and HBV DNA tested at 4-6 months. HBV diversity within each HBV-infected mother-infant pair was analyzed by direct sequencing of amplified HBsAg-encoding gene and cloning of amplified products.RESULTS: Among 3312 HIV-1 infected pregnant women, 245 (7.4%) were HBsAg-positive, of whom 125 were HBeAg-positive. Of 230 evaluable infants born to HBsAg-positive women, 11 (4.8%) were found HBsAg and HBV DNA positive at 4-6 months; 8 were born to HBeAg-positive mothers. HBV genetic analysis was performed in 9 mother-infant pairs and showed that 5 infants were infected with maternal HBV variants harboring mutations within the HBsAg &quot;a&quot; determinant, and four were infected with wild-type HBV present in highly viremic mothers.CONCLUSIONS: HBV-MTCT still occurs when women have high HBV DNA load and/or are infected with HBV variants.

Whereas preventing mother to child transmission (PMTCT) programs should result in 700,000 annual disclosures regarding infants born to HIV-positive mothers in Africa, the actual figures are much lower and the conditions for disclosure implementation and its social dimensions in the field are not precisely documented. The aims of this article are to describe and analyze the experience of HIV status disclosure for infants and children on the basis of interviews held with mothers and PMTCT teams in Burkina Faso. The method was based on repeated interviews with 37 mothers and with health workers. Their discourses show the complexity of disclosure in a context characterized by uncertainty. They show delays due to difficulties in venipuncture and in methods for laboratory diagnosis and information management in health services. HIV disclosure is implemented by PMTCT physicians and also other professionals, sometimes in other services. The mother plays a key role, sometimes by requesting disclosure; the father is generally informed only secondarily, in spite of his legal responsibility for the child. Interactions analysis reveals some ambiguities of disclosure, regarding information that doctors keep secret, reciprocal expectations of communication between doctors and mothers, mothers' interpretation of apparent signs regarding their child's health, and uncertain information being given. The information often contains guilt-inducing elements for mothers; communication about follow-up does not reduce this effect. These results encourage the elaboration of a model for specific counseling that should provide mothers with general information, and personalized interaction and support that they need in order to receive and manage disclosure of their child's HIV status."

Previous studies have revealed that UMI simulation accurately reproduces the velocity field of a target blood flow, but that the reproducibility of the pressure field is not necessarily satisfactory. In the present study, the reproduction of the pressure field by UMI simulation was investigated. The effect of feedback on the pressure field was first examined by theoretical analysis, and a pressure compensation method was devised. When the divergence of the feedback force vector was not zero, it influenced the pressure field in the UMI simulation while improving the computational accuracy of the velocity field. Hence, the correct pressure was estimated by adding pressure compensation to remove the deteriorating effect of the feedback. A numerical experiment was conducted dealing with the reproduction of a synthetic three-dimensional steady flow in a thoracic aneurysm to validate results of the theoretical analysis and the proposed pressure compensation method. The ability of the UMI simulation to reproduce the pressure field deteriorated with a large feedback gain. However, by properly compensating the effects of the feedback signals on the pressure, the error in the pressure field was reduced, exhibiting improvement of the computational accuracy. It is thus concluded that the UMI simulation with pressure compensation allows for the reproduction of both velocity and pressure fields of blood flow."

Directly interrogating the molecules is a promising direction to clarify the noisy response of conventional assays arising from simultaneous different reactions. Besides sophisticated biophysical instrument such as the atomic force microscope, this paper proposes silicon nanotweezers (SNT) as a new microsystem for molecular manipulation. SNT can trap molecules and sense their biomechanical and bioelectrical response in minute operations. In this review SNT characteristics are overviewed; their operation modes are illustrated by molecule and cell trapping, manipulation and characterization in air and in solution. As they are tiny and can be mass produced by highly parallel microsystem technology, SNT can be seen as a potential molecular and cellular probe for routine analysis and bio detection."

It is to fill each missing data with more plausible values, via a Gibbs sampling procedure, specifying an imputation model for each missing variable. This imputation method is implemented in several softwares that offer imputation models steered by the shape of the variable to be imputed, but all these imputation models make an assumption of linearity on covariates effect. However, this assumption is not often verified in practice as the covariates can have a nonlinear effect. Such a linear assumption can lead to a misleading conclusion because imputation model should be constructed to reflect the true distributional relationship between the missing values and the observed values. To estimate nonlinear effects of continuous time invariant covariates in imputation model, we propose a method based on B-splines function. To assess the performance of this method, we conducted a simulation study, where we compared the multiple imputation method using Bayesian splines imputation model with multiple imputation using Bayesian linear imputation model in survival analysis setting. We evaluated the proposed method on the motivated data set collected in HIV-infected patients enrolled in an observational cohort study in Senegal, which contains several incomplete variables. We found that our method performs well to estimate hazard ratio compared with the linear imputation methods, when data are missing completely at random, or missing at random."

Elderly people affected with dementia progressively lose their autonomy as they encounter problems in their Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Hence, they need supervision and assistance from their family members or professional caregivers, which can often lead to underestimated psychological and financial stress for all parties. The use of Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) technologies aims to empower people with dementia and relieve the burden of their caregivers.The aim of this paper is to present the approach we have adopted to develop and deploy a system for ambient assistive living in an operating nursing home, and evaluate its performance and usability in real conditions. Based on this approach, we emphasise on the importance of deployments in real world settings as opposed to prototype testing in laboratories.METHODS: We chose to conduct this work in close partnership with end-users (dementia patients) and specialists in dementia care (professional caregivers). Our trial was conducted during a period of 14 months within three rooms in a nursing home in Singapore, and with the participation of eight dementia patients and two caregivers. A technical ambient assistive living solution, consisting of a set of sensors and devices controlled by a software platform, was deployed in the collaborating nursing home. The trial was preceded by a pre-deployment period to organise several observation sessions with dementia patients and focus group discussions with professional caregivers. A process of ground truth and system's log data gathering was also planned prior to the trial and a system performance evaluation was realised during the deployment period with the help of caregivers. An ethical approval was obtained prior to real life deployment of our solution.RESULTS: Patients' observations and discussions allowed us to gather a set of requirements that a system for elders with mild-dementia should fulfil. In fact, our deployment has exposed more concrete requirements and problems that need to be addressed, and which cannot be identified in laboratory testing. Issues that were neither forecasted during the design phase nor during the laboratory testing surfaced during deployment, thus affecting the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Results of the system performance evaluation show the evolution of system precision and uptime over the deployment phases, while data analysis demonstrates the ability to provide early detection of the degradation of patients' conditions. A qualitative feedback was collected from caregivers and doctors and a set of lessons learned emerged from this deployment experience.CONCLUSION: Lessons learned from this study were very useful for our research work and can serve as inspiration for developers and providers of assistive living services. They confirmed the importance of real deployment to evaluate assistive solutions especially with the involvement of professional caregivers. They also asserted the need for larger deployments. Larger deployments will allow to conduct surveys on assistive solutions social and health impact, even though they are time and manpower consuming during their first phases."

The median length of the incision was 16.4 cm (range: 12-20 cm).The median operating time was 189 min (range: 54-305 min). The median postoperative hospital stay was 8 days (range: 6-17 days). One patient died in the postoperative period from heart failure. All other patients fully recovered and returned to their previous level of activity. Over a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 20-68 months), 25 complications (8.1%) developed. Seven wound infections (2.3%) occurred with no incisional hernia.CONCLUSIONS: The UMI can be used safely and effectively in conventional open surgery in various liver resections and should therefore be given priority as the first-line technique in living liver donors and patients with tumours measuring ≤ 5 cm."

Here, by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal analysis, we show that Ubinuclein-1 interacts with the 14-3-3ɛ protein both in HT29 colon cells, and AGS gastric cells. This interaction is mediated by an Ubinuclein-1 phosphoserine motif. We show that the arginine residues (R56, R60 and R132) which form the 14-3-3ɛ ligand binding site are responsible for the binding of 14-3-3ɛ to phosphorylated Ubinuclein-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in vitro Ubinuclein-1 can be directly phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. This in vitro phosphorylation allows binding of wildtype 14-3-3ɛ. Moreover, treatment of the cells with inhibitors of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, KT5720 or H89, modifies the subcellular localization of Ubinuclein-1. Indeed, KT5720 and H89 greatly increase the staining of Ubinuclein-1 at the tight junctions in AGS gastric cells. In the presence of the kinase inhibitor KT5720, the amount of Ubinuclein-1 in the NP40 insoluble fraction is increased, together with actin. Moreover, treatment of the cells with KT5720 or H89 induces the concentration of Ubinuclein-1 at tricellular intersections of MDCK cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate novel cell signaling trafficking by Ubinuclein-1 via association with 14-3-3ɛ following Ubinuclein-1 phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase-A."

They are implicated in silencing the genome instability threat posed by mobile genetic elements called transposons. Unlike other small RNAs, which use double-stranded precursors, piRNAs seem to arise from long single-stranded precursor transcripts expressed from discrete genomic regions. In mice, the Piwi pathway is essential for male fertility, and its loss-of-function mutations affect several distinct stages of spermatogenesis. While this small RNA pathway primarily operates post-transcriptionally, it also impacts DNA methylation of target retrotransposon loci, representing an intriguing model of RNA-directed epigenetic control in mammals. Remarkably the Piwi pathway components are specifically localized at germinal granule/nuage, an evolutionarily conserved but still enigmatic ribonucleoprotein compartment in the germline. The inaccessibility of the germline for easy experimental manipulation has meant that this class of RNAs has remained enigmatic. However, recent advances in the use of cell culture models and cell-free systems have greatly advanced our understanding. In this review, we briefly summarize our current understanding of the Piwi pathway, focusing on its developmental regulation, piRNA biogenesis and key function in male germline development from fetal spermatogonial stem cell stage to postnatal haploid spermiogenesis in mice."

Electrocardiography (ECG) has limited sensitivity for detecting unrecognized MI (UMI).OBJECTIVE: Determine prevalence and mortality risk for UMI detected by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging or ECG among older individuals.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: ICELAND MI is a cohort substudy of the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (enrollment January 2004-January 2007) using ECG or CMR to detect UMI. From a community-dwelling cohort of older individuals in Iceland, data for 936 participants aged 67 to 93 years were analyzed, including 670 who were randomly selected and 266 with diabetes.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and mortality of MI through September 1, 2011. Results reported with 95% confidence limits and net reclassification improvement (NRI).RESULTS: Of 936 participants, 91 had recognized MI (RMI) (9.7%; 95% CI, 8% to 12%), and 157 had UMI detected by CMR (17%; 95% CI, 14% to 19%), which was more prevalent than the 46 UMI detected by ECG (5%; 95% CI, 4% to 6%; P &lt; .001). Participants with diabetes (n = 337) had more UMI detected by CMR than by ECG (n = 72; 21%; 95% CI, 17% to 26%, vs n = 15; 4%; 95% CI, 2% to 7%; P &lt; .001). Unrecognized MI by CMR was associated with atherosclerosis risk factors, coronary calcium, coronary revascularization, and peripheral vascular disease. Over a median of 6.4 years, 30 of 91 participants (33%; 95% CI, 23% to 43%) with RMI died, and 44 of 157 participants (28%; 95% CI, 21% to 35%) with UMI died, both higher rates than the 119 of 688 participants (17%; 95% CI, 15% to 20%) with no MI who died. Unrecognized MI by CMR improved risk stratification for mortality over RMI (NRI, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.53). Adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, and RMI, UMI by CMR remained associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.06, absolute risk increase [ARI], 8%) and significantly improved risk stratification for mortality (NRI, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.31), but UMI by ECG did not (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.73; ARI, -2%; NRI, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.17 to 0.05). Compared with those with RMI, participants with UMI by CMR used cardiac medications such as statins less often (36%; 95% CI, 28% to 43%, or 56/157, vs 73%; 95% CI, 63% to 82%, or 66/91; P &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based cohort of older individuals, the prevalence of UMI by CMR was higher than the prevalence of RMI and was associated with increased mortality risk.

To understand the ecology of these multi-host pathogens and their response to environmental degradation and species extinctions, it is necessary to develop a theoretical framework that takes into account realistic community assemblages. Here, we present a multi-host species epidemiological model that includes empirically determined patterns of diversity and composition derived from community ecology studies. We use this framework to study the interaction between wildlife diversity and directly transmitted pathogen dynamics. First, we demonstrate that variability in community composition does not affect significantly the intensity of pathogen transmission. We also show that the consequences of community diversity can differentially impact the prevalence of pathogens and the number of infectious individuals. Finally, we show that ecological interactions among host species have a weaker influence on pathogen circulation than inter-species transmission rates. We conclude that integration of a community perspective to study wildlife pathogens is crucial, especially in the context of understanding and predicting infectious disease emergence events."

ESCRT-III proteins form polymers that constrict membrane tubes, leading to fission. We have used electron cryomicroscopy to determine the molecular organization of pleiomorphic ESCRT-III CHMP2A-CHMP3 polymers. The three-dimensional reconstruction at 22 Å resolution reveals a helical organization of filaments of CHMP molecules organized in a head-to-tail fashion. Protease susceptibility experiments indicate that polymerization is achieved via conformational changes that increase the protomer stability. Combinatorial siRNA knockdown experiments indicate that CHMP3 contributes synergistically to HIV-1 budding, and the CHMP3 contribution is ~ 10-fold more pronounced in concert with CHMP2A than with CHMP2B. This is consistent with surface plasmon resonance affinity measurements that suggest sequential CHMP4B-CHMP3-CHMP2A recruitment while showing that both CHMP2A and CHMP2B interact with CHMP4B, in agreement with their redundant functions in HIV-1 budding. Our data thus indicate that the CHMP2A-CHMP3 polymer observed in vitro contributes to HIV-1 budding by assembling on CHMP4B polymers."

Kaplan-Meier probability of survival was estimated up to 5 years of therapy. Factors associated with early (≤6 months) and long-term (&gt;6 months) mortalities were assessed using Cox regression analyses.RESULTS: A total of 1578 adults received HAART (74% women; median age, 33 years; CD4 cell count, 124/mL), with a median follow-up of 50 months (interquartile range, 41-66). Eighty-nine patients (6%) died (37 occurred ≤6 months and 52 occurred &gt;6 months) and 183 (12%) were lost to follow-up.

Common to all processes is the membrane recruitment of ESCRT-III that leads to membrane fission. Here, we show that CC2D1A is a novel regulator of ESCRT-III CHMP4B function. We demonstrate that CHMP4B interacts directly with CC2D1A and CC2D1B with nanomolar affinity by forming a 1:1 complex. Deletion mapping revealed a minimal CC2D1A-CHMP4B binding construct, which includes a short linear sequence within the third DM14 domain of CC2D1A. The CC2D1A binding site on CHMP4B was mapped to the N-terminal helical hairpin. Based on a crystal structure of the CHMP4B helical hairpin, two surface patches were identified that interfere with CC2D1A interaction as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Introducing these mutations into a C-terminal truncation of CHMP4B that exerts a potent dominant negative effect on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 budding revealed that one of the mutants lost this effect completely. This suggests that the identified CC2D1A binding surface might be required for CHMP4B polymerization, which is consistent with the finding that CC2D1A binding to CHMP4B prevents CHMP4B polymerization in vitro. Thus, CC2D1A might act as a negative regulator of CHMP4B function."

They associate with Argonaute proteins of the Piwi subfamily, forming ribonucleoprotein complexes that are involved in maintaining genome integrity. The N-terminal region of some Piwi proteins contains symmetrically dimethylated arginines. This modification is thought to enable recruitment of Tudor domain-containing proteins (TDRDs), which might serve as platforms mediating interactions between various proteins in the piRNA pathway. We measured the binding affinity of the four individual extended Tudor domains (TDs) of murine TDRD1 protein for three different methylarginine-containing peptides from murine Piwi protein MILI. The results show a preference of TD2 and TD3 for consecutive MILI peptides, whereas TD4 and TD1 have, respectively, lower and very weak affinity for any peptide. The affinity of TD1 for methylarginine peptides can be restored by a single-point mutation back to the consensus aromatic cage sequence. These observations were confirmed by pull-down experiments with endogenous Piwi and Piwi-associated proteins. The crystal structure of TD3 bound to a methylated MILI peptide shows an unexpected orientation of the bound peptide, with additional contacts of nonmethylated residues being made outside of the aromatic cage, consistent with solution NMR titration experiments. Finally, the molecular envelope of the four tandem Tudor domains of TDRD1, derived from small angle scattering data, reveals a flexible, elongated shape for the protein. Overall, the results show that TDRD1 can accommodate different peptides from different proteins, and can therefore act as a scaffold protein for complex assembly in the piRNA pathway."

Recent studies on retroviral infections in NHP bushmeat allowed for the identification of numerous Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses (SIV) and Simian T-cell Lymphotropic Viruses (STLV) to which humans are exposed. Nevertheless, today, data on simian retroviruses at the primate/hunter interface remain scarce. We conducted a pilot study on 63 blood and/or tissues samples derived from NHP bushmeat seized by the competent authorities in different locations across the country.RESULTS: SIV and STLV were detected by antibodies to HIV and HTLV antigens, and PCRs were performed on samples with an HIV or/and HTLV-like or indeterminate profile. Fourteen percent of the samples cross-reacted with HIV antigens and 44% with HTLV antigens. We reported STLV-1 infections in five of the seven species tested. STLV-3 infections, including a new STLV-3 subtype, STLV-1 and -3 co-infections, and triple SIV, STLV-1, STLV-3 infections were observed in red-capped mangabeys (C.torquatus). We confirmed SIV infections by PCR and sequence analyses in mandrills, red-capped mangabeys and showed that mustached monkeys in Gabon are infected with a new SIV strain basal to the SIVgsn/mus/mon lineage that did not fall into the previously described SIVmus lineages reported from the corresponding species in Cameroon. The same monkey (sub)species can thus be carrier of, at least, three distinct SIVs. Overall, the minimal prevalence observed for both STLV and SIV natural infections were 26.9% and 11.1% respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data, obtained from a restricted sampling, highlight the need for further studies on simian retroviruses in sub-Saharan Africa to better understand their evolutionary history and to document SIV strains to which humans are exposed. We also show that within one species, a high genetic diversity may exist for SIVs and STLVs and observe a high genetic diversity in the SIVgsn/mon/mus lineage, ancestor of HIV-1/SIVcpz/SIVgor."

It is increasingly evident, however, that T cells exhibit much more complex and flexible dynamic behaviors than initially appreciated, and that these behaviors influence the efficacy of T cell responses to immunological challenges. In this review, we discuss how new technologies for monitoring the dynamics of T cells are enhancing the resolution of the fine phenotypic and functional heterogeneity within populations of T cells and revealing how individual T cells transition among a continuum of states. Such insights into the dynamic properties of T cells should improve immune monitoring and inform strategies for therapeutic interventions."

This virus remains a significant threat for public health due to its potential use as a bioterrorism agent and requires further development of antiviral drugs. The viral genome replication machinery appears to be an ideal target, although very little is known about its structure. Vaccinia virus is the prototypic virus of the Orthopoxvirus genus and shares more than 97% amino acid sequence identity with variola virus. Here we studied four essential viral proteins of the replication machinery: the DNA polymerase E9, the processivity factor A20, the uracil-DNA glycosylase D4, and the helicase-primase D5. We present the recombinant expression and biochemical and biophysical characterizations of these proteins and the complexes they form. We show that the A20D4 polymerase cofactor binds to E9 with high affinity, leading to the formation of the A20D4E9 holoenzyme. Small-angle X-ray scattering yielded envelopes for E9, A20D4, and A20D4E9. They showed the elongated shape of the A20D4 cofactor, leading to a 150-Å separation between the polymerase active site of E9 and the DNA-binding site of D4. Electron microscopy showed a 6-fold rotational symmetry of the helicase-primase D5, as observed for other SF3 helicases. These results favor a rolling-circle mechanism of vaccinia virus genome replication similar to the one suggested for tailed bacteriophages."

Since then, the number of treated patients in Africa has substantially increased thanks to simplification in treatment management. Although good outcomes over the first years of ART have been observed in sub-Saharan Africa, little is known about the long-term (&gt;5 years) risks of virological failure and drug resistance and about second-line treatment response.METHODS: Patients from the ANRS-1215 cohort in Senegal, started with either one nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or indinavir, a first-generation nonboosted protease inhibitor, followed for &gt;6 months and having &gt;1 viral load (VL) measurement were included. Virological failure was defined as 2 consecutive VL measurements &gt;1000 copies/mL.RESULTS: Of the 366 patients included, 89% achieved a VL &lt;500 copies/mL. The risk of virological failure at 12, 24, and 60 months was 5%, 16%, and 25%, being higher in younger patients (P = 0.05), those receiving a protease inhibitor-containing regimen (P = 0.05), and those with lower adherence (P = 0.03). The risk of resistance to any drug at 12, 24, and 60 months was 3%, 11%, and 18%. After virological failure, 60% of the patients were switched to second-line treatments. Although 81% of the patients achieved virological success, the risk of virological failure was 27% at 24 months, mostly in patients with multiple resistances.CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, virological outcomes for first-line treatments were good compared with those from high-resource settings. However, the rate of virological failure for second-line treatment was high, probably because of accumulation of resistances."

Apes are also infected with other retroviruses, notably simian T-cell lymphotropic viruses (STLVs) and simian foamy viruses (SFVs), that can be transmitted to humans. We discuss the actual knowledge on SIV, STLV and SFV infections in chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos. We especially elaborate on how the recent development of non-invasive methods has allowed us to identify the reservoirs of the HIV-1 ancestors in chimpanzees and gorillas, and increased our knowledge of the natural history of SIV infections in chimpanzees. Multiple cross-species events with retroviruses from apes to humans have occurred, but only one transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees in south-eastern Cameroon spread worldwide, and is responsible for the actual HIV pandemic. Frequent SFV transmissions have been recently reported, but no human-to-human transmission has been documented yet. Because humans are still in contact with apes, identification of pathogens in wild ape populations can signal which pathogens may be cause risk for humans, and allow the development of serological and molecular assays with which to detect transmissions to humans. Finally, non-invasive sampling also allows the study of the impact of retroviruses and other pathogens on the health and survival of endangered species such as chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos."

Understanding the ecology of these pathogens is especially timely, given the continued anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity. Here, we integrate empirical scaling laws from community ecology within a theoretical reservoir-vector-pathogen framework to study the transmission consequences of host community structure and diversity within large assemblages. We show that heterogeneity in susceptibility of the reservoir species promotes transmission &quot;dilution,&quot; while a greater vector species richness &quot;amplifies&quot; it. These contrasting transmission impacts of vector and reservoir communities can yield very different epidemiological patterns. We demonstrate that vector and reservoir species richness can explain per se most of the pathogen transmission observed for West Nile virus in different parts of the United States, giving empirical support for the validity of these opposing theoretically predicted effects. We conclude that, in the context of disease emergence, the integration of a community perspective can provide critical insights into the understanding of pathogen transmission in wildlife."

Here, we used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering to depict VSV P as an ensemble of continuously exchanging conformers that captures the dynamic character of this protein. We discuss the implications of the dynamics and the large conformational space sampled by VSV P in the assembly and functioning of the viral transcription/replication machinery."

Resolving this paradox is a very promising research direction to understand mechanisms of cancer resistance. As of present, research has been focused on the consequences of these evolutionary pressures rather than of their causes.DISCUSSION: Here, we argue that evolution through natural selection may have shaped mechanisms of cancer resistance in wildlife species and that this can result in a threshold in body mass above which oncogenic and tumor suppressive mechanisms should be increasingly purified and positively selected, respectively.SUMMARY: We conclude that assessing wildlife species in their natural ecosystems, especially through theoretical modeling, is the most promising way to understand how evolutionary processes can favor one or the other pathway. This will provide important insights into mechanisms of cancer resistance."

The total procedure comprised 3 days for pre-intervention assessment, 5 days for the intervention, and 3 days for post-intervention assessment. Lavender exposure was compared with the absence of lavender (control). Information regarding the relaxing effect of aromas was provided to examine expectancy effects. Results showed that lavender aroma improved sleepiness at awakening after the intervention. Sex differences and daily variation in quality of sleep during the intervention period were not observed.

The study included 42 patients with cystic fibrosis: 24 who refused the vaccine and 18 who were vaccinated. The two groups differed quite substantially in their perceptions of vaccine- and disease-related risks. Those who refused the vaccine were motivated mainly by the fears it aroused and did not explicitly consider the 2009 A/H1N1 flu a potentially severe disease. People who were vaccinated explained their choice, first and foremost, as intended to prevent the flu's potential consequences on respiratory cystic fibrosis disease. Moreover, they considered vaccination to be an indirect collective prevention tool. Patients who refused the vaccine mentioned multiple, contradictory information sources and did not appear to consider the recommendation of their local health care provider as predominant. On the contrary, those who were vaccinated stated that they had based their decision solely on the clear and unequivocal advice of their health care provider.SIGNIFICANCE: These results of our survey led us to formulate three main recommendations for improving adhesion to new pandemic vaccines. (1) it appears necessary to reinforce patient education about the disease and its specific risks, but also general population information about community immunity. (2) it is essential to disseminate a clear and effective message about the safety of novel vaccines. (3) this message should be conveyed by local health care providers, who should be involved in implementing immunization."

However, there is no report about the involvement of mast cells in P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation. This study aimed at evaluating the role of mast cells in P. aeruginosa LPS-induced lung inflammation in rats. Mast cells stabilization was carried out by intraperitoneal injections of cromolyn. Lung inflammation was induced by the intratracheal instillation of P. aeruginosa LPS (5 μg/kg bw) and inflammatory status was evaluated 4 h post-LPS instillation. We found that activated mast cells could constitute a pivotal source of several inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. These cells might regulate polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) recruitment and be implicated in the alteration of alveolar-capillary permeability via the release of TNF-α and IL-1β. We also detected that activated mast cells could be involved in the alteration of the expression of two epithelial tight junction proteins (claudin-1 and occludin) during the acute phase of inflammation. Our results suggest that activated mast cells might play a critical role in P. aeruginosa LPS-induced lung inflammation. Therefore, mast cell stabilization may be a potential novel approach for the prevention and treatment of P. aeruginosa-induced lung infections."

The WB specimens were extracted using the QIAcube or MagNA Pure instrument; VL were quantified with the EBV R-gene quantification kit (Argene) or the artus EBV RG PCR kit (Qiagen) on the Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time analyzer; and the results were compared with those of a laboratory-developed PCR. DNA was extracted from the QCMD specimens by use of the QIAamp DNA minikit and was quantified by the three PCR assays. The extraction platforms and the PCR assays showed good correlation (R, &gt;0.9; P, &lt;0.0001), but as many as 10% discordant results were observed, mostly for low viral loads (&lt;3 log(10) copies/ml), and standard deviations reached as high as 0.49 log(10) copy/ml. In WB but not in QCMD samples, Argene PCR tended to give higher VL values than artus PCR or the laboratory-developed PCR (mean difference for the 200 WB VL, -0.42 or -0.36, respectively).

Pre- and postoperative assessment included: completion of the validated ICIQ-FLUTS questionnaire, POP-Q examination and urodynamics (UDS). The primary outcome was the assessment of symptoms at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included assessment of postoperative UDS findings and evaluation of differences in symptoms and UDS diagnosis between the TVT and TVT-O groups.RESULTS: Eighty-five women were included; 44 (49.2%) underwent TVT and 41 (51.8%) underwent TVT-O. Concomitant prolapse surgery was performed in 65 out of 85 patients (76.5%). At 12 months' follow-up there was a statistically significant reduction in stress urinary incontinence (p &lt; 0.001), urge urinary incontinence (p &lt; 0.001), urgency (p = 0.021) and frequency (p = 0.014). Depending on the symptom 10.6% to 24.7% of women reported deterioration of symptoms. UDS at 12 months revealed the absence of urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) in 82.4% of patients and no evidence of detrusor overactivity (DO) in 35.3%. No differences in symptoms were found between the TVT and TVT-O group, but the absence of DO was more common in the TVT group (48.5% vs 22.7%, p = 0.014).CONCLUSIONS: Placement of MUS alleviates incontinence and overactive bladder symptoms in patients with UMI. TVT causes similar subjective improvement to TVT-O, but resulted in higher resolution of DO. Our study provides data that could be helpful in informing patients preoperatively of the potential impact that the MUS may have on each individual symptom separately, including the likelihood of symptom deterioration."

Primary infection by EBV can lead to infectious mononucleosis, and EBV persistence is associated with several malignancies. Despite its importance for human health, little structural information is available on EBV. Here we report the purification of the EBV capsid by CsCl- or sucrose density-gradient centrifugation. Cryo-electron microscopy and image analysis resulted in two slightly different three-dimensional structures at about 20 Å resolution. These structures were compared with that of human herpesvirus 8, another gammaherpesvirus. CsCl-gradient purification leads to the removal of part of the triplex complex around the fivefold axes, whereas the complexes between hexons remained in place. This may be due to local differences in stability resulting from variation in quasi-equivalent interactions between pentons and hexons compared with those between hexons only."

We here analyzed 97 integrase sequences from HIV-1 non-B-infected individuals from African countries. Using currently available interpretation algorithms (ANRS, HIVdb, and Rega), we identified the presence of mutations at nine resistance-associated positions including L74M (3.1%), T97A (9.3%), K156N (2.1%), E157Q (5.2%), G163K (1.0%), T206S (48.5%), S230N (1.0%), D232N (1.0%), and R236K (1.0%). All but one (E157Q) were considered as accessory resistant mutation by the algorithms. E157Q identified in 5% of patients tested (5/97) was selected by the ANRS algorithm as a primary mutation, which alone can confer resistance to raltegravir. These results illustrated the need of further in vitro and clinical studies involving non-B viruses to better understand the real significance of observed mutations and harmonize interpretations."

The objective of this study was to document the incidence of AIDS-defining events and non-AIDS-defining diseases in African children receiving HAART.METHODS: Incidences rates (IRs) of AIDS-defining events and 10 other common diseases were estimated overall and by current CD4-strata (&lt;15%, 15 - &lt;25% and ≥25%) from 2 prospective cohorts of African children.RESULTS: One hundred eighty-eight children contributing to 355 children-years were included. The documented morbidity IRs per 100 children-years were upper respiratory infections, 100 (87-114); infectious diarrhea, 37 (31-44); World Health Organization (WHO) stage 2 events, 22.9 (18.2-28.1); and WHO stage 3/4 events, 12.3 (9.1-16.7). IRs of WHO stage 2 events, severe bacterial infections, infectious diarrhea and pneumonia decreased linearly across all CD4%-strata, whereas WHO stage 3/4 events and viral infections occurred mostly when CD4% &lt;15%. Overall, IRs decreased during the first 2 years on HAART except for upper respiratory infection, mycosis and oral candidiasis.CONCLUSION: This incidence of AIDS- and non-AIDS-defining diseases declined substantially after HAART in 2 African cohorts, although estimates remained high compared with high-resource settings. Without renewed efforts to increase antiretroviral scale-up, children in developing countries will continue to have a high burden of infections."

It increases current capabilities for the dispensing and distribution of MCMs and enhances local/regional preparedness and resilience. In the UMI, critical MCMs, especially those in routine medical use (&quot;dual utility&quot;) and those that must be administered soon after an incident before outside supplies can arrive, are stored at multiple medical facilities (including medical supply or distribution networks) across the United States. The medical facilities store a sufficient cache to meet part of the surge needs but not so much that the resources expire before they would be used in the normal course of business. In an emergency, these extra supplies can be used locally to treat casualties, including evacuees from incidents in other localities. This system, which is at the interface of local/regional and federal response, provides response capacity before the arrival of supplies from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and thus enhances the local/regional medical responders' ability to provide life-saving MCMs that otherwise would be delayed. The UMI can be more cost-effective than stockpiling by avoiding costs due to drug expiration, disposal of expired stockpiled supplies, and repurchase for replacement."

The predominance of recombinants strongly suggests that dual infections occur frequently. In the present study, we adapted the multi-region hybridization assay (MHA), previously developed to identify dual infections in geographic regions where few HIV-1 variants circulate, to identify HIV-1 variants and dual infections. We designed clade-specific probes in three genomic regions (gag p17, vpu, nef) to detect eight different variants that are common in this part of Africa (A, B/D, C, F, G, CRF02_AG, CRF06_cpx, CRF22_01A1). The assay was validated with 163 samples representing the corresponding HIV-1 variants. Depending on the genomic regions, the global sensitivity of the assay ranged from 86% to 94%, and the global specificity was between 85% and 96%. The assay was then applied on 156 antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Cameroon. The MHA assay identified 79%, 85% and 90% of the strains in nef, gag and vpu regions, respectively. The subtype/CRF distribution and the proportion of inter-region recombinants obtained by the new MHA assay were in accordance with known subtype/CRF distribution in Cameroon. Moreover, the MHA assay identified 35 (22.4%) patients as dually infected, from which 20 were reactive in more than one region and/or with concordant multigenomic recombination pattern. Despite the high genetic diversity, we successfully developed an hybridization assay allowing identification of eight common HIV-1 variants circulating in West and West Central Africa. We documented high rates of dual infection in a low-risk population group, illustrating that the global evolution of HIV diversity is driven by dual infections. This assay could become a useful screening tool for the global surveillance and monitoring of inter-subtype/CRF dual infections in West and West Central Africa."

The widespread use of fluconazole may lead to the emergence of isolates with reduced susceptibility. We studied C. neoformans isolates from HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Genotyping and antifungal testing were performed to assess the genetic diversity, occurrence of mixed infections and in vitro activity of antifungal agents. Isolates were recovered from cerebrospinal fluid prior to systemic antifungal treatment. Six isolates were studied for each sample (a total of 114 isolates from 19 patients). Serotyping was performed via LAC 1 and CAP 64 gene amplification and genotyping was performed using phage M13 core, (GACA)4 and (GTG)5 primers and restriction polymorphism analysis of the URA5 gene. Susceptibilities for amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole were tested by the Sensititre YeastOne® method. All strains were identified as C. neoformans var. grubii serotype A. We identified nine major genotypes. Up to two genotypes were identified in the same sample. None of the isolates were resistant to the studied drugs. However, 13 of 114 strains exhibited a reduced susceptibility to fluconazole and 13 of 114 strains exhibited a reduced susceptibility to flucytosine. No correlation was found between the genotype and susceptibility. This study confirms the prevalence of C. neoformans serotype A in Cameroon. Two genotypes may be responsible for a single episode of cryptococcosis. The possibility of mixed infection and diminished susceptibility to fluconazole or flucytosine must be considered for the management of cryptococcosis."

The aim of this work was to study their dietary, living, and hygiene habits and their oral health.METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional study included 300 individuals living in Tessekere and Widou Thiengoli, in the heart of the Great Green Wall of Senegal. These individuals were selected by cluster sampling and had lived in the area for over fifteen years. The 1997 WHO questionnaire was used to collect data from interviews and clinical observations. Information was collected specifically about eating habits, lifestyle and hygiene, dental caries (DMF) and periodontal treatment needs (CPITN). The coefficients of determination and correlation were used to explain and identify significant associations (defined by a p-value &lt;0.05).RESULTS: Milk was consumed by 96% of the population and tea by 90%;47% of the population smoked more than half a pack of tobacco a day, 11% drank &quot;boulfalé&quot; (Cologne water of 45°), and 88.6% used toothpicks for dental hygiene. Tooth cleaning frequency was negatively correlated with the DMF index and CPITN, and consumption of milk, fruit and cigarettes were positively correlated with the CPITN.CONCLUSION: Dietary factors, smoking and hygiene appear to influence the oral health of populations in Ferlo. Prevention programs should be established, focusing on simple information to induce behavioral change."

The analysis of death was based on 60 events during 6,573 person-years; 30/50 (60%) deaths with underlying cause ascertained were attributable to infections. Analysis of new ADE included 192 events during 5,865 person-years; TB and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia were the most commonly presented first new ADE (35% and 20% of cases, respectively). In multivariable analyses, low current CD4 count after starting cART was the strongest predictor of death and of new ADE. Even at CD4 above 200 cells/mm(3), survival improved steadily with CD4, with mortality rare at ≥ 500 cells/mm(3) (rate 1.1 per 1,000 person-years). Haemoglobin had a strong independent effect, while viral load was weakly predictive with poorer prognosis only observed at ≥ 100,000 copies/ml. Mortality risk increased following diagnosis of ADEs during cART. The decline in mortality rate with duration on cART (from 21.3 per 1,000 person-years within first 6 months to 4.7 per 1,000 person-years at ≥ 36 months) was accounted for by current CD4 count.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low CD4 count or haemoglobin require more intensive diagnostic and treatment of underlying causes. Maintaining CD4 ≥ 500 cells/mm(3) minimizes mortality. However, patient monitoring could potentially be relaxed at high CD4 count if resources are limited. Optimal ART monitoring strategies in low-income settings remain a research priority. Better understanding of the aetiology of anaemia in patients on ART could guide prevention and treatment."

We compared bone mineral density between HIV-infected patients and control subjects from Dakar, Senegal.METHODS: A total of 207 (134 women and 73 men) HIV-infected patients from an observational cohort in Dakar (ANRS 1215) and 207 age- and sex-matched controls from the general population were enrolled. Bone mineral density was assessed by quantitative ultrasound (QUS) at the calcaneus, an alternative to the reference method (i.e. dual X-absorptiometry), often not available in resource-limited countries.RESULTS: Mean age was 47.0 (±8.5) years. Patients had received ART for a median duration of 8.8 years; 45% received a protease inhibitor and 27% tenofovir; 84% had undetectable viral load. Patients had lower body mass index (BMI) than controls (23 versus 26 kg/m(2), P&lt;0.001). In unadjusted analysis, QUS bone mineral density was lower in HIV-infected patients than in controls (difference: -0.36 standard deviation, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.59;-0.12, P = 0.003). Adjusting for BMI, physical activity, smoking and calcium intake attenuated the difference (-0.27, CI: -0.53;-0.002, P = 0.05). Differences in BMI between patients and controls explained a third of the difference in QUS bone mineral density. Among patients, BMI was independently associated with QUS bone mineral density (P&lt;0.001). An association between undetectable viral load and QUS bone density was also suggested (β = 0.48, CI: 0.02;0.93; P = 0.04). No association between protease inhibitor or tenofovir use and QUS bone mineral density was found.CONCLUSION: Senegalese HIV-infected patients had reduced QUS bone mineral density in comparison with control subjects, in part related to their lower BMI.

An accurate estimation of prognosis is very important for haemorrhagic stroke patients. Impairment of motor function caused by pyramidal tract injury is common in these patients. In this study, we performed MR diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) to predict the impairment of motor function in patients with basal ganglion haemorrhage and explore its clinical value.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Diffusion tensor tractography was performed in 33 patients with basal ganglia haemorrhage within 2 weeks after onset to visualize the course of pyramidal tracts (PTs), and patients were classified into four groups according to the fibre ratio of PTs, calculated by dividing the PT number of the affected hemisphere by that of the unaffected hemisphere, as follows: type A, the fibre ratio was less than 1/4; type B, less than 1/2; type C, more than 1/2; and type D, more than 3/4. The upper extremity motricity index (UMI) was used to evaluate the motor function at onset and 6 months after onset. Upper extremity motricity index scores were compared among the different groups and a Spearman analysis was performed to correlate the UMI scores with different integrity of pyramidal tracts.RESULTS: There were no differences in the UMI scores at onset among the 4 groups (p&lt; 0.05). The UMI scores obtained at 6 months after onset were significantly unequal and were influenced by the DTT type (p &lt; 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the integrity of the pyramidal tracts and the UMI scores 6 months after onset (r = 0.7312, p&lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: There was a positive correlation between the integrity grade of pyramidal tracts and the motor function, showing that the more seriously were the pyramidal tracts damaged, the worse was the motor function. The DTT findings of the pyramidal tract in acute cerebral haemorrhage may valuably predict the motor function outcome."

The purpose of the present study was to get more insights on the binding partners of Ubn-1, notably those present in the epithelial junctions. Using an in vivo assay of fluorescent protein-complementation assay (PCA), we demonstrated that the N-terminal domains of the Ubn-1 and ZO-1 proteins triggered a functional interaction inside the cell. Indeed, expression of both complementary fragments of venus fused to the N-terminal parts of Ubn-1 and ZO-1 was able to reconstitute a fluorescent venus protein. Furthermore, nuclear expression of the chimeric Ubn-1 triggered nuclear localization of the chimeric ZO-1. We could localize this interaction to the PDZ2 domain of ZO-1 using an in vitro pull-down assay. More precisely, a 184-amino acid region (from amino acids 39 to 223) at the N-terminal region of Ubn-1 was responsible for the interaction with the PDZ2 domain of ZO-1. Co-imunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy experiments also revealed the tight junction protein cingulin as a new interacting partner of Ubn-1. A proteomic approach based on mass spectrometry analysis (MS) was then undertaken to identify further binding partners of GST-Ubn-1 fusion protein in different subcellular fractions of human epithelial HT29 cells. LYRIC (Lysine-rich CEACAM1-associated protein) and RACK-1 (receptor for activated C-kinase) proteins were validated as bona fide interacting partners of Ubn-1. Altogether, these results suggest that Ubn-1 is a scaffold protein influencing protein subcellular localization and is involved in several processes such as cell-cell contact signalling or modulation of gene activity."

The program increased active coping and decreased dependent behavior scores significantly in the stress management group, while decreasing assertive behavior scores in the wait-list group. A comparison of the education sub-groups showed that the first group had significantly increased assertiveness and decreased dependency scores. The second group had significantly decreased depression-anxiety scores. The data analyzed for men and women separately showed the stress management intervention significantly improved active coping and assertive behavior in men and dependent behavior in women. A brief one-time stress management program can be effective in improving active coping and assertive behaviors as well as reducing dependent behavior in hospital staffs.

Responsiveness was defined as the change divided by the standard deviation of each anthropometric indicator. Contrast was defined as the difference in responsiveness between dry and rainy seasons.SETTING: The study was conducted in Niakhar, a rural area of Senegal under demographic surveillance, with contrasted food and morbidity situations between rainy and dry seasons.SUBJECTS: Some 5000 children under 5 years of age were monitored at 6-month intervals in 1983–1984. The present analysis was carried out on a sub-sample of children aged 6–23 months with complete measures, totalling 2803 children-intervals.RESULTS: In both univariate and multivariate analysis, mid-upper arm circumference was found to be more responsive to nutritional stress than the commonly used weight-for-height Z-score (contrast = -0.64 for mid-upper arm circumference v. -0.53 for weight-for-height Z-score). Other discriminant indicators were: muscle circumference, weight-for-height, BMI and triceps skinfold. Height, head circumference and subscapular skinfold had no discriminating power for measuring the net effect of nutritional stress during the rainy season.CONCLUSIONS: The use of mid-upper arm circumference for assessing nutritional stress in community surveys should be considered and preferred to other nutritional indicators. Strict standardization procedures for measuring mid-upper arm circumference are required for optimal use."

The predominance of ballistic phonon transport appears as the best hypothesis to retrieve quantitative predictions despite the geometrical irregularity of the junction. The measurement is based on a MEMS structure including an electrostatic actuator that allows producing nanojunctions with the accuracy based on the resolution of a transmission electron microscope. The thermal conductance is measured by two integrated resistors that are simultaneously heating and measuring the local temperatures at the nearest of the nanojunction. The considerable thermal conductance of short nanojunctions constitutes a new key element in the design of nanosystems and in the understanding of the damaging of mechanical micronanocontacts. This conducting behavior is also paving the way for the development of nanoscale cooling devices as well as of the recent phononic information technology."

The primary goal is to enable persons with mild dementia to maximize their physical and mental functions through assistive technologies in order to be able to continue to participate in social networks and lead independent and purposeful lives. Persons with mild dementia usually have problems in performing activities of daily living due to episodic memory decline. These can include simple activities, such as bathing, changing clothes and preparing meals. Through extended field test trials involving end users, we have demonstrated that assistive technology that provides timely prompts, alarms and reminders can enable them to preserve their abilities and improve their quality of life. Understanding the user context, especially when targeting demented individuals, and providing the required personalized assistive services is the objective of our research work. Finding the appropriate user interface to interact with the provided services is often a barrier. Thus, we have adopted the approach of a multimodal interactive system with the living environment including a TV set, iPad-like tablets, sensors/actuators, and wireless speakers connected to a reasoning engine that is able to consider the complexity of the users' profile defined by his/her cognitive abilities. In this paper we will mainly focus on the interaction level with the system as well as on the validation stages performed to meet the users' requirements.

The present electromagnetic model decouples both shape forming contributions. In contrast to previously published work, it accounts for the particular operating mode of transient spectroscopy. The objective is to increase the time resolution by two approaches, by optimizing structural response and by deconvolving it from experimental data. The switch structure is represented by an effective transimpedance onto which the active material acts as current generator. As proof of concept, the response of a standard microstrip switch is modeled and deconvolved from experimental data acquired in GaAs, yielding a single exponential material response and hence supporting the validity of the approach. Beyond compensating for the response deterioration by the structure, switch architectures can be a priori optimized with respect to frequency response. As an example, it is shown that a microstrip gap that can be deposited on materials incompatible with standard lithography reduces pulse broadening by an order of magnitude if it is provided with transitions to coplanar access lines."

Nicotiana tabacum malonyltransferase 1 (NtMaT1) is a member of anthocyanin acyltransferase subfamily that uses malonyl-CoA (MLC) as donor catalyzing transacylation in a range of flavonoid and naphthol glucosides. To gain insights into the molecular basis underlying its catalytic mechanism and versatile substrate specificity, we resolved the X-ray crystal structure of NtMaT1 to 3.1 Å resolution. The structure comprises two α/β mixed subdomains, as typically found in the HXXXD acyltransferases. The partial electron density map of malonyl-CoA allowed us to reliably dock the entire molecule into the solvent channel and subsequently define the binding sites for both donor and acceptor substrates. MLC bound to the NtMaT1 occupies one end of the long solvent channel between two subdomains. On superimposing and comparing the structure of NtMaT1 with that of an enzyme from anthocyanin acyltransferase subfamily from red chrysanthemum (Dm3Mat3) revealed large architectural variation in the binding sites, both for the acyl donor and for the acceptor, although their overall protein folds are structurally conserved. Consequently, the shape and the interactions of malonyl-CoA with the binding sites' amino acid residues differ substantially. These major local architectural disparities point to the independent, divergent evolution of plant HXXXD acyltransferases in different species. The structural flexibility of the enzyme and the amendable binding pattern of the substrates provide a basis for the evolution of the distinct, versatile substrate specificity of plant HXXXD acyltransferases."

An optimal design is identified for a GaAs nanowire geometry with r = 155 nm and L~1.1 μm, where minimum gain at threshold (gth~13×10³ cm⁻¹) and large spontaneous emission factor (β~0.3) are simultaneously achieved. Modification of the directivity of the L3 photonic crystal cavity via the band-folding principle is employed to further optimize the far-field radiation pattern and to increase the directivity of the device.

However, there is to date no method to characterize this parameter on microscale surfaces. We propose here a simple method based on the resonance of capillary waves, which are naturally excited by thermal fluctuations, under one-dimensional spatial restrictions using single-beam dynamic light scattering. The principle was verified at methanol/air interfaces in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels having various widths. Characteristic comb-shape power spectra were experimentally obtained. Theoretical analysis showed that the spectral peaks correspond to the first or higher modes of the capillary wave resonance in the restricted space between the parallel channel walls. A useful relation between successive modes was derived to eliminate the effects of damping at the soft PDMS walls. Thus, for methanol, two values were calculated from three successive modes (24.8 and 21.2 mN/m); the literature value is 22.02 mN/m. For acetonitrile, the value obtained was 28.2 ± 5 mN/m, close to the literature value of 28.6 mN/m. Although accuracy and precision require further elucidation, this novel method is expected to become a powerful tool at the micro/nanoscale."

The mechanical strength and the concept of reworkable capabilities of the CNT interconnection bumps are investigated. Preliminary electrical characteristics show a linear relationship between current and voltage, suggesting that ohmic contacts are attained."

Patients were randomly assigned to CHX (UMI irrigated with 0.2% CHX), EO (UMI irrigated with EOs) or control (UMI irrigated with distilled water) groups. All treatments were performed in one session. For all groups, plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), position of gingival margin (PGM), pocket depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment level (CAL) and horizontal attachment level (HAL) scores were recorded at baseline and 1 and 3 months after therapy.RESULTS: In all groups, there were significant reductions in PI, GI, PD and BOP, increase in PGM scores and gain in CAL and HAL scores, at 1 and 3 months compared to baseline. Except in BOP scores, there were no significance differences among the groups at any time point. At 1 and 3 months, there were significant reductions in the BOP scores of the EO group compared with the CHX and control groups.CONCLUSION: Within the limits of this study, the use of EOs as a cooling liquid of UMI may promote slight adjunctive effects at FI compared to CHX and water."

The mechanism by which this specific association occurs, for both the segmented (s) and non-segmented (ns) viruses, has recently become clearer due to our expanding knowledge of N protein and nucleocapsid structures."

We aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of clinical monitoring alone (CLIN) in terms of non-inferiority to laboratory and clinical monitoring (LAB).METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial in nine rural district hospitals in Cameroon. Eligible participants were adults (≥18 years) infected with HIV-1 group M (WHO disease stage 3-4) who had not previously received antiretroviral therapy, and were followed-up for 2 years by health-care workers in routine activities. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to CLIN or LAB (counts of HIV viral load and CD4 cell every 6 months) groups with a computer-generated list. The primary outcome was non-inferiority of CLIN to LAB in terms of increase in CD4 cell count with a non-inferiority margin of 25%. We did all analyses in participants who attended at least one follow-up visit. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00301561.FINDINGS: 238 (93%) of 256 participants assigned to CLIN and 221 (93%) of 237 assigned to LAB were eligible for analysis. CLIN was not non-inferior to LAB; the mean increase in CD4 cell count was 175 cells per μL (SD 190, 95% CI 151-200) with CLIN and 206 (190, 181-231) with LAB (difference -31 [-63 to 2] and non-inferiority margin -52 [-58 to -45]). Furthermore, in the predefined secondary outcome of treatment changes, 13 participants (6%) in the LAB group switched to second-line regimens whereas no participants in the CLIN group did so (p&lt;0·0001). By contrast, other predefined secondary outcomes were much the same in both groups-viral suppression (&lt;40 copies per mL; 465 [49%] of 952 measurements in CLIN vs 456 [52%] of 884 in LAB), HIV resistance (23 [10%] of 238 participants vs 22 [10%] of 219 participants), mortality (44 [18%] of 238 vs 32 [14%] of 221), disease progression (85 [36%] of 238 vs 64 [29%] of 221), adherence (672 [63%] of 1067 measurements vs 621 [61%] of 1011), loss to follow-up (21 [9%] of 238 vs 17 [8%] of 221), and toxic effects (46 [19%] of 238 vs 56 [25%] of 221).INTERPRETATION: Our findings support WHO's recommendation for laboratory monitoring of antiretroviral therapy. However, the small differences that we noted between the strategies suggest that clinical monitoring alone could be used, at least temporarily, to expand antiretroviral therapy in low-resource settings.FUNDING: French National Agency for Research on AIDS (ANRS) and Ensemble pour une Solidarité Thérapeutique Hospitalière En Réseau (ESTHER)."

Here, we present the structural characterization of a soluble, heterodimeric complex between a variant of vesicular stomatitis virus N lacking its 21 N-terminal residues (N(Δ21)) and a peptide of 60 amino acids (P(60)) encompassing the molecular recognition element (MoRE) of P that binds RNA-free N (N(0)). The complex crystallized in a decameric circular form, which was solved at 3.0 Å resolution, reveals how the MoRE folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and N polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiment and NMR spectroscopy on the soluble complex confirms the binding of the MoRE and indicates that its flanking regions remain flexible in the complex. The structure of this complex also suggests a mechanism for the initiation of viral RNA synthesis."

A PB2 C-terminal domain rich in putative host adaptation residues has been shown to bind importin α nuclear import receptors. Adaptation has been proposed to involve binding of PB2 to importins of the new host. To date PB2-importin complexes have been characterized semiquantitatively with no precise measurement of binding parameters. To investigate the effects of adaptive mutations on importin interaction and selectivity, surface plasmon resonance was used to compare the binding rate constants and affinities of avian H5N1 and human H3N2 PB2 C-terminal variants with importin isoforms human α 1, 3, 5 and 7, and avian α 1. Using purified proteins eliminates host environment effects and permits measurement of intrinsic affinities and rates of complex formation and dissociation. Two effects were observed: first, adaptive mutations D701N, R702K, and S714R in the nuclear localization signal domain increased 2-4-fold the association rates with avian and human importins; second, measurement of different structural forms of the PB2 C terminus demonstrated that the upstream 627 domain reduced binding affinity, consistent with a steric clash predicted from crystal structures. From these kinetic data, structural analyses, and the data of others, a model is proposed in which an increase in charged surface residues during host adaptation increases the association rate of PB2 to cytoplasmic importins and where the C-terminal 627-nuclear localization signal domain may reorganize upon importin binding, consistent with a role in active polymerase assembly."

We present the crystal structure of an N-terminal fragment of the deubiquitinating enzyme AMSH (AMSHΔC) in complex with the C-terminal region of ESCRT-III CHMP3 (CHMP3ΔN). AMSHΔC folds into an elongated 90 Å long helical assembly that includes an unusual MIT domain. CHMP3ΔN is unstructured in solution and helical in complex with AMSHΔC, revealing a novel MIT domain interacting motif (MIM) that does not overlap with the CHMP1-AMSH binding site. ITC and SPR measurements demonstrate an unusual high-affinity MIM-MIT interaction. Structural analysis suggests a regulatory role for the N-terminal helical segment of AMSHΔC and its destabilization leads to a loss of function during HIV-1 budding. Our results indicate a tight coupling of ESCRT-III CHMP3 and AMSH functions and provide insight into the regulation of ESCRT-III."

In this review, we describe the use of one of these technologies, MultiBac, a baculovirus expression vector system that is particularly tailored for the production of eukaryotic multiprotein complexes.

In this complex, the N-terminal region (P(NTR)) of P prevents N from binding to cellular RNA and keeps it available for encapsidating viral RNA genomes. Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we show that an isolated peptide corresponding to the 60 first N-terminal residues of VSV P (P(60)) and encompassing P(NTR) has overall molecular dimensions and a dynamic behavior characteristic of a disordered protein but transiently populates conformers containing α-helices. The modeling of P(60) as a conformational ensemble by the ensemble optimization method using SAXS data correctly reproduces the α-helical content detected by NMR spectroscopy and suggests the coexistence of subensembles of different compactness. The populations and overall dimensions of these subensembles are affected by the addition of stabilizing (1M trimethylamine-N-oxide) or destabilizing (6M guanidinium chloride) cosolvents. Our results are interpreted in the context of a scenario whereby VSV P(NTR) constitutes a molecular recognition element undergoing a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to its partner when forming the N(0)-P complex."

While CdvB and CdvC are homologues of the eukaryotic ESCRT-III and Vps4 proteins, implicated in membrane fission processes during multivesicular body biogenesis, cytokinesis and budding of some enveloped viruses, little is known about the structure and function of CdvA. Here, we report the biochemical and biophysical characterization of the three Cdv proteins from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Metallospherae sedula.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and negative staining electron microscopy, we evidenced for the first time that CdvA forms polymers in association with DNA, similar to known bacterial DNA partitioning proteins. We also observed that, in contrast to full-lengh CdvB that was purified as a monodisperse protein, the C-terminally deleted CdvB construct forms filamentous polymers, a phenomenon previously observed with eukaryotic ESCRT-III proteins. Based on size exclusion chromatography data combined with detection by multi-angle laser light scattering analysis, we demonstrated that CdvC assembles, in a nucleotide-independent way, as homopolymers resembling dodecamers and endowed with ATPase activity in vitro. The interactions between these putative cell division partners were further explored. Thus, besides confirming the previous observations that CdvB interacts with both CdvA and CdvC, our data demonstrate that CdvA/CdvB and CdvC/CdvB interactions are not mutually exclusive.SIGNIFICANCE: Our data reinforce the concept that Cdv proteins are closely related to the eukaryotic ESCRT-III counterparts and suggest that the organization of the ESCRT-III machinery at the Crenarchaeal cell division septum is organized by CdvA an ancient cytoskeleton protein that might help to coordinate genome segregation."

Few studies have compared resistance patterns induced by efavirenz and nevirapine in patients infected with the CRF01_AE Southeast Asian HIV-subtype. We compared patterns of NNRTI- and NRTI-associated mutations in Thai adults failing first-line nevirapine- and efavirenz-based combinations, using bayesian statistics to optimize use of data.METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a treatment cohort of HIV-infected adults on NNRTI-based regimens, 119 experienced virologic failure (&gt;500 copies/mL), with resistance mutations detected by consensus sequencing. Mutations were analyzed in relation to demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables at time of genotyping. The Geno2Pheno system was used to evaluate second-line drug options. Eighty-nine subjects were on nevirapine and 30 on efavirenz. The NRTI backbone consisted of lamivudine or emtricitabine plus either zidovudine (37), stavudine (65), or tenofovir (19). The K103N mutation was detected in 83% of patients on efavirenz vs. 28% on nevirapine, whereas Y181C was detected in 56% on nevirapine vs. 20% efavirenz. M184V was more common with nevirapine (87%) than efavirenz (63%). Nevirapine favored TAM-2 resistance pathways whereas efavirenz selected both TAM-2 and TAM-1 pathways. Emergence of TAM-2 mutations increased with the duration of virologic replication (OR 1.25-1.87 per month increment). In zidovudine-containing regimens, the overall risk of resistance across all drugs was lower with nevirapine than with efavirenz, whereas in tenofovir-containing regimen the opposite was true.CONCLUSIONS: TAM-2 was the major NRTI resistance pathway for CRF01_AE, particularly with nevirapine; it appeared late after virological failure. In patients who failed, there appeared to be more second-line drug options when zidovudine was combined with nevirapine or tenofovir with efavirenz than with alternative combinations."

Their multiplication in a host cell requires three viral proteins in addition to the viral RNA genome. The nucleoprotein (N) tightly encapsidates the viral RNA, and the N-RNA complex serves as the template for both transcription and replication. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a two subunit complex that consists of a large subunit, L, and a non-catalytic cofactor, the phosphoprotein, P. P also acts as a chaperone of nascent RNA-free N by forming a N(0)-P complex that prevents N from binding to cellular RNAs and from polymerizing in the absence of RNA. Here, we discuss the recent molecular and structural studies of individual components and multi-molecular complexes that are involved in the transcription/replication complex of these viruses with regard to their implication in viral transcription and replication."

Almost sixty percent of the pathogens that have emerged in humans during the last 30-40 years are of animal origin and about sixty percent of them show an important variety of host species besides humans (3 or more possible host species). In this review, we focus on zoonotic infections with vector-borne transmission and dissect the contrasting effects that a multiplicity of host reservoirs and vectors can have on their disease dynamics. We discuss the effects exerted by host and vector species richness and composition on pathogen prevalence (i.e., reduction, including the dilution effect, or amplification). We emphasize that, in multiple host systems and for vector-borne zoonotic pathogens, host reservoir species and vector species can exert contrasting effect locally. The outcome on disease dynamics (reduced pathogen prevalence in vectors when the host reservoir species is rich and increased pathogen prevalence when the vector species richness increases) may be highly heterogeneous in both space and time. We then ask briefly how a shift towards a more systemic perspective in the study of emerging infectious diseases, which are driven by a multiplicity of hosts, may stimulate further research developments. Finally, we propose some research avenues that take better into account the multi-host species reality in the transmission of the most important emerging infectious diseases, and, particularly, suggest, as a possible orientation, the careful assessment of the life-history characteristics of hosts and vectors in a community ecology-based perspective."

In this study we provide evidence of the involvement of Calcineurin in this regulation. In C2C12 myoblasts, inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis by chloramphenicol decreases Calcineurin expression. Conversely, stimulation of this process by overexpressing the T3 mitochondrial receptor (p43) increases Calcineurin expression. Moreover, expression of a constitutively active Calcineurin (ΔCN) stimulates myoblast differentiation, whereas a Calcineurin antisense has the opposite effect. Lastly, ΔCN expression or stimulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis specifically increases slow myosin heavy chain expression. In conclusion, these data clearly suggest that, partly via Calcineurin expression, mitochondrial protein synthesis is involved in muscle development through the control of myoblast differentiation and probably the acquisition of the contractile and metabolic phenotype of muscle fibres."

The bone status of these patients is generally investigated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, but this technique does not reveal the pathophysiological mechanism underlying the bone loss. Bone cell activity can be indirectly evaluated by noninvasive techniques, including measurement of specific biochemical markers of bone formation (such as osteocalcin or bone-alkaline phosphatase) and resorption (such as procollagen type I N- or C-terminal propeptide). The bone loss in spinal cord injury is clearly due to an uncoupling of bone remodeling in favor of bone resorption, which starts just after the injury and peaks at about 1 to 4 months. Beyond 6 months, bone resorption activity decreases progressively but remains elevated for many years after injury. Conversely, bone formation is less affected. Antiresorptive treatment induces an early and acute reduction in bone resorption markers. Level of injury and health-related complications do not seem to be implicated in the intensity of bone resorption. During the acute phase, the hypercalcemic status is associated with the suppression of parathyroid hormone and vitamin D metabolites. The high sensitivity of these markers after treatment suggests that they can be used for monitoring treatment efficacy and patient compliance. The concomitant use of bone markers and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry may improve the physician's ability to detect patients at risk of severe bone loss and subsequent fractures."

The concomitant improvement in femoral bone geometry and strength suggested that this type of physical activity might have favourable clinical impact.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of artistic gymnastics (GYM) on areal bone mineral density (aBMD), femoral bone geometry and bone markers and its relationship with the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/rank-ligand (RANKL) system in peripubertal girls.METHODS: Forty-six girls (age 10-17.2 years) were recruited for this study: 23 elite athletes in the GYM group (training 12-30 h/week, age at start of training 5.3 years) and 23 age-matched (± 6 months; leisure physical activity ≤ 3 h/week) controls (CON). The aBMD at whole body, total proximal femur, lumbar spine, mid-radius and skull was determined using dual-X-ray absorptiometry. Hip structural analysis (HSA software) was applied at the femur to evaluate cross-sectional area (CSA, cm(2)), cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI, cm(4)), and the section modulus (Z, cm(3)) and buckling ratio at neck, intertrochanteric region and shaft. Markers of bone turnover and OPG/RANKL levels were also analysed.RESULTS: GYM had higher (5.5-16.4%) non-adjusted aBMD and adjusted aBMD for age, fat-free soft tissue and fat mass at all bone sites, skull excepted and the difference increased with age. In the three femoral regions adjusted for body weight and height, CSA (12.5-18%), CSMI (14-18%), Z (15.5-18.6%) and mean cortical thickness (13.6-21%) were higher in GYM than CON, while the buckling ratio (21-27.1%) was lower. Bone markers decreased with age in both groups and GYM presented higher values than CON only in the postmenarchal period. A similar increase in RANKL with age without OPG variation was observed for both groups.CONCLUSION: GYM is associated not only with an increase in aBMD but also an improvement in bone geometry associated with an increase in bone remodelling. These adaptations seem to be independent of the OPG/RANKL system."

The linear Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides have been successfully applied to evaluate venous, atrial, and arteriolar thrombi, but have thus far failed in the detection of arterial thrombi. Cyclic RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Cys) is a cyclic conformation of linear RGD peptides, which has much higher binding-affinity and selectivity for binding to the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor than its linear counterpart and thus is likely to be an optimal targeted molecular probe for ultrasound molecular imaging of arterial thrombi. In this study, we sought to assess the feasibility of a novel microbubble conjugated with cyclic RGD (Mb-cyclic RGD) in UMI of arterial thrombi in vitro and in vivo . As expected, Mb-cyclic RGD had greater GP IIb/IIIa-targeted binding capability in all shear stress conditions. In addition, the shear stress at half-maximal detachment of Mb-cyclic RGD was 5.7-fold higher than that of microbubbles with non-specific peptide (Mb-CON) (p&lt;0.05). Mb-cyclic RGD enhanced the echogenicity of the platelet-rich thrombus in vitro whereas Mb-CON did not produce enhancement. In the in vivo setting, optimal signal enhancement of the abdominal aortic thrombus was displayed with Mb-cyclic RGD in all cases. Mean video intensity of the abdominal aortic thrombi with Mb-cyclic RGD was 3.2-fold higher than that with Mb-CON (p&lt;0.05). The novel Mb-cyclic RGD facilitated excellent visualisation of arterial thrombi using UMI and showed great promise for clinical applications."

The pH and multichannel intraluminal impedance were measured during nocturnal polysomnography in 25 infants hospitalised for suspicion of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Two groups were constituted according to whether or not the infants displayed gastro-oesophageal reflux (i.e. a reflux group and a control group). There were no differences between the reflux and control groups in terms of sleep duration, sleep structure and sleep state change frequency. Vigilance states significantly influenced the gastro-oesophageal reflux pattern: the occurrence of gastro-oesophageal reflux episodes was greater during W (59 ± 32%) and active sleep (AS; 35 ± 30%) than during quiet sleep (QS; 6 ± 11%), whereas the mean duration of gastro-oesophageal reflux episodes was higher in QS than in W and AS. The percentage of retrograde bolus migrations of distal oesophageal acid content was significantly higher in AS (62 ± 26%) than in W (42 ± 26%) and QS (4.5 ± 9%). In neonates, gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred more frequently during W, whereas the physiological changes associated with sleep state increase the physiopathological impact of the gastro-oesophageal reflux. The duration of oesophagus-acid contact was greater during sleep; AS facilitated the retrograde migration of oesophageal acid content, and QS was characterised by the risk of prolonged acid mucosal contact."

The amount of grafted antibodies measured in situ on the monolith by ADECA (8.2±0.2μg of antibodies per milligram of monolith) was consistent with values obtained by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) after crushing the monolith. ADECA was shown to be less time-consuming and more versatile than BCA. The ADECA method was further implemented to thoroughly study and optimize the antibody grafting conditions (influence of pH and kinetics of the grafting step) on GMA-based monoliths and to check the covalent nature of the antibody/surface linking and its stability. Using the total amount of grafted antibodies and the amount of recognized antigen, we found that 65±6% of antibodies were able to capture their antigen. Finally, the grafting of Fab and F(ab')(2) fragments demonstrated that no significant improvement of the global binding capacity of the monolith was obtained."

Amongst these materials are calcium phosphates (CaPs), which are known for their biocompatibility and are widely commercially available. As with the majority of the materials investigated, CaPs have been shown to advance the healing of bone tunnel tissue in animal studies. Mechanical testing shows fixation strengths to be improved, particularly by the application of CaP-based cement in the bone tunnel. Significantly, CaP-based cements have been shown to produce improvements comparable to those induced by potentially more complex treatments such as biologics (including fibronectin and chitin) and cultured cells. Further investigation of CaP-based treatment in the bone tunnels during ACL replacement is therefore warranted in order to establish what improvements in healing and resulting clinical benefits may be achieved through its application."

This suggests that neural control of motor function of unaffected extremities might be changed following stroke. However, very little is known about this topic. Using functional MRI (fMRI), we investigated changes in neural control of motor function of the unaffected hand in hemiparetic patients with cerebral infarct. Thirty-five hemiparetic stroke patients were recruited for this study. fMRI was performed at 1.5T during either affected or unaffected hand flexion-extension movements. We evaluated motor function of the affected upper extremity using the upper Motricity index (UMI) and the medical research council (MRC) scale for finger extensor. From fMRI, LI (laterality index) was calculated for assessment of relative activity in the ipsilateral versus the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex. Positive correlation between LIs was observed during affected and unaffected hand movements (r=0.670, p=0.000). LI of unaffected hand movements was also correlated with the affected UMI (r=0.408, p=0.015) and MRC of the affected hand extensor (r=0.362, p=0.033).

In the absence of a benchmark method to calculate Tr--often considered to be the same as the air incubator temperature-errors could have a considerable impact on the thermal management of neonates. We compared Tr using two conventional methods (measurement with a black-globe thermometer and a radiative &quot;view factor&quot; approach) and two methods based on nude thermal manikins (a simple, schematic design from Wheldon and a multisegment, anthropometric device developed in our laboratory). By taking the Tr estimations for each method, we calculated metabolic heat production values by partitional calorimetry and then compared them with the values calculated from V(O2) and V(CO2) measured in 13 preterm neonates. Comparisons between the calculated and measured metabolic heat production values showed that the two conventional methods and Wheldon's manikin underestimated R, whereas when using the anthropomorphic thermal manikin, the simulated versus clinical difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, there is a need for a safety standard for measuring TR in a closed incubator. This standard should also make available estimating equations for all avenues of the neonate's heat exchange considering the metabolic heat production and the modifying influence of the thermal insulation provided by the diaper and by the mattress. Although thermal manikins appear to be particularly appropriate for measuring Tr, the current lack of standardized procedures limits their widespread use."

The second method is based on logistic regression. It assumes that the age pattern of fertility is constant over short periods of time. Both methods were applied to fertility trends in several African countries (Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Zambia). The two methods were found to predict similar values of cumulative fertility, to produce consistent slopes, to document fertility trends the same way, and to characterize fertility stalls with similar statistical evidence.

Weaning male Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with saline or iron sucrose [15 mg kg(-1) body weight (bw), 3 times per week, 4 weeks]. They were then intratracheally injected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 μg kg(-1) bw) or saline. Inflammatory indices were evaluated 4 or 18 h post-LPS/saline injection. At 4 h, LPS-treated groups revealed significant increases in the majority of inflammatory parameters (LPS-binding protein (LBP), immune cell recruitment, inflammatory cytokine synthesis, myeloperoxidase activity, and alteration of alveolar-capillary permeability), as compared with control groups. At 18 h, these parameters reduced strongly with the exception for LBP content and interleukin (IL)-10. In parallel, iron acted as a modulator of immune cell recruitment; LBP, tumor necrosis factor-α, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 3, and IL-10 synthesis; and alveolar-capillary permeability. Therefore, P. aeruginosa LPS may only act as an acute lung inflammatory molecule, and iron overload may modulate lung inflammation by enhancing different inflammatory parameters. Thus, therapy for iron overload may be a novel and efficacious approach for the prevention and treatment of bacterial lung inflammations."

Liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin (LEH), an oxygen-carrying blood substitute originally designed for short-term perfusion, may be a good candidate as an oxygen carrier to cultured liver cells. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of maintaining long term hepatocyte cultures using LEH. Primary fetal and adult rat liver cells were directly exposed to LEH for 6 to 14 days in static culture or in a perfused flat plate bioreactor. The functions and viability of adult rat hepatocytes exposed to LEH were not adversely affected in static monolayer culture and were even improved in the bioreactor. However, some cytotoxicity of LEH was observed with fetal rat liver cells after 4 days of culture. LEH, though a suitable oxygen carrier for long-term culture of mature hepatocytes, is not suitable in its present form for perfusing fetal hepatocyte cultures in direct contact with the liposomes; either the LEH will have to be made less toxic or a more sophisticated bioreactor that prevents the direct contact between hepatocytes and perfusates will have to be designed if fetal cells are to be used for liver tissue engineering."

Here we report surgical recommendations based on our experience with the use of UMIs in this context. The celiac axis (CA) depth ratio (the depth-to-width ratio for the trunk at the CA) was measured to define the shape of the abdominal cavity. A questionnaire was used to assess satisfaction and cosmetic outcomes in this population of donors. One hundred forty-one of the grafts (98.6%) were right grafts or extended right grafts; there were no donor deaths. The mean time of the operation up to graft retrieval in 141 right side grafts was 3 hours 1 minute. All donors recovered fully and returned to their previous activities. Major complications occurred in 9 patients (6.4%) and included reoperation due to bleeding (4), the insertion of a percutaneous drain (4), and rhabdomyolysis (1). Male sex, a large graft (&gt;900 kg), a fatty liver (large fatty changes ≥ 10%), and a deep truncal cavity (a CA depth ratio &gt; 0.35) were significant risk factors for a long graft retrieval time. The use of a wound protector significantly reduced wound complications. The cosmetic outcomes were more satisfactory when a UMI preceded partial hepatectomy instead of a conventional J-shaped incision (P = 0.01). In conclusion, a UMI without laparoscopic assistance can be safely used for LDPH, regardless of the graft type or the donor characteristics. However, the procedure after a UMI is more difficult in male donors with large fatty livers and deep truncal cavities. Accordingly, these features can be used as exclusion criteria for surgeons not accustomed to this modified procedure."

The temperature accuracy was proved by inducing the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP) in a few NIH-3T3 cells through a confined and precise temperature rise. Our device is therefore effective to locally induce a heat shock response with almost single-cell resolution. Furthermore, we show that cells heated at a higher temperature than the one of heat shock remain alive without producing HSP. Electrode deposition being one of the most common engineering processes, the fabrication of electrode arrays with a simple control circuit is clearly within reach for parallel testing. This should enable the study of several key mechanisms such as cell heat shock, death or signaling.

N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a marker of heart failure, and troponin I (TnI) is a marker of myocardial injury. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether NT-proBNP plasma levels (in addition to ejection fraction) differed in patients with UMI scars compared with normal participants. The second aim was to compare whether the TnI levels differed in those two groups.METHODS: Data from the Prospective Investigation of Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors study were used. The participants who had undergone cardiac MRI were included in this study (n=248). Patients were divided into three groups depending on the existence of a myocardial infarction (MI) scar in DE-MRI and their earlier history of MI. In all the patients, a peripheral blood sample was collected and the plasma levels of NT-proBNP and TnI were determined.RESULTS: Patients with UMI had higher plasma levels of NT-proBNP (median 140.2 ng/l; 25th-75th percentiles: 79-225.5) than no-MI participants (median 94.9 ng/l; 25th-75th percentiles: 59.2-144.2; P=0.01) and lower levels than patients with recognized MI (median 310.4 ng/l; 25th-75th percentiles: 122.6-446.5; P=0.02). Plasma TnI values did not differ among the three groups.CONCLUSION: Patients with UMI scars detected by DE-MRI have increased plasma levels of NT-proBNP that is known to correlate with an increased risk of future cardiovascular adverse events."

Env interactions with cellular receptors trigger refolding of gp41, which induces close apposition of viral and cellular membranes leading to membrane fusion. The energy released during refolding is used to overcome the kinetic barrier and drives the fusion reaction. Here, we report the crystal structure at 2 A resolution of the complete extracellular domain of gp41 lacking the fusion peptide and the cystein-linked loop. Both the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR) and the membrane proximal external region (MPER) form helical extensions from the gp41 six-helical bundle core structure. The lack of regular coiled-coil interactions within FPPR and MPER splay this end of the structure apart while positioning the fusion peptide towards the outside of the six-helical bundle and exposing conserved hydrophobic MPER residues. Unexpectedly, the section of the MPER, which is juxtaposed to the transmembrane region (TMR), bends in a 90 degrees-angle sideward positioning three aromatic side chains per monomer for membrane insertion. We calculate that this structural motif might facilitate the generation of membrane curvature on the viral membrane. The presence of FPPR and MPER increases the melting temperature of gp41 significantly in comparison to the core structure of gp41. Thus, our data indicate that the ordered assembly of FPPR and MPER beyond the core contributes energy to the membrane fusion reaction. Furthermore, we provide the first structural evidence that part of MPER will be membrane inserted within trimeric gp41. We propose that this framework has important implications for membrane bending on the viral membrane, which is required for fusion and could provide a platform for epitope and lipid bilayer recognition for broadly neutralizing gp41 antibodies."

The 2.77 A crystal structure of the BST-2/tetherin extracellular core presented here reveals a parallel 90 A long disulfide-linked coiled-coil domain, while the complete extracellular domain forms an extended 170 A long rod-like structure based on small-angle X-ray scattering data. Mutagenesis analyses indicate that both the coiled coil and the N-terminal region are required for retention of HIV-1, suggesting that the elongated structure can function as a molecular ruler to bridge long distances. The structure reveals substantial irregularities and instabilities throughout the coiled coil, which contribute to its low stability in the absence of disulfide bonds. We propose that the irregular coiled coil provides conformational flexibility, ensuring that BST-2/tetherin anchoring both in the plasma membrane and in the newly formed virus membrane is maintained during virus budding."

Here we present the crystal structure of the HK20 Fab in complex with a gp41 mimetic 5-Helix at 2.3 Å resolution. HK20 employs its heavy chain CDR H2 and H3 loops to bind into a conserved hydrophobic HR1 pocket that is occupied by HR2 residues in the gp41 post fusion conformation. Compared to the previously described HR1-specific mAb D5, HK20 approaches its epitope with a different angle which might favor epitope access and thus contribute to its higher neutralization breadth and potency. Comparison of the neutralization activities of HK20 IgG, Fab and scFv employing both single cycle and multiple cycle neutralization assays revealed much higher potencies for the smaller Fab and scFv over IgG, implying that the target site is difficult to access for complete antibodies. Nevertheless, two thirds of sera from HIV-1 infected individuals contain significant titers of HK20-inhibiting antibodies. The breadth of neutralization of primary isolates across all clades, the higher potencies for C-clade viruses and the targeting of a distinct site as compared to the fusion inhibitor T-20 demonstrate the potential of HK20 scFv as a therapeutic tool."

Here we have provided the identification of a novel UBD, the UMI (UIM- and MIU-related UBD), present in RNF168, and characterized the interaction surface with ubiquitin, centered on two Leu residues. We have demonstrated that integrity of the UMI, in addition to the MIUs, is necessary for the proper localization of RNF168 and for ubiquitination of nuclear proteins, including histone H2A. Finally, we have shown that simultaneous inactivation of UMI and MIUs prevents the recruitment to DDR foci of the crucial downstream mediator 53BP1."

Spectacular results in this area have been achieved using cyclic diaminocarbenes (NHCs) as a result of their strong σ-donor properties. Although it is possible to cursorily tune the structure of NHCs, any diversity is still far from matching their phosphorus-based counterparts, which is one of the great strengths of the latter. A variety of stable acyclic carbenes are known, but they are either reluctant to bind metals or they give rise to fragile metal complexes. During the last five years, new types of stable cyclic carbenes, as well as related carbon-based ligands (which are not NHCs), and which feature even stronger σ-donor properties have been developed. Their synthesis and characterization as well as the stability, electronic properties, coordination behavior, and catalytic activity of the ensuing complexes are discussed, and comparisons with their NHC cousins are made."

Two activities are required for this cap-snatching activity: specific binding of the cap structure and an endonuclease activity. Recent work has shown that the cap-binding site is situated in the central part of the PB2 subunit and that the endonuclease activity is situated in the N-terminal domain of the PA subunit (PA-Nter). The influenza endonuclease is a member of the PD-(D/E)XK family of nucleases that use divalent metal ions for nucleic acid cleavage. Here we analyze the metal binding and endonuclease activities of eight PA-Nter single-point mutants. We show by calorimetry that the wild-type active site binds two Mn(2+) ions and has a 500-fold higher affinity for manganese than for magnesium ions. The endonuclease activity of the isolated mutant domains are compared with the cap-dependent transcription activities of identical mutations in trimeric recombinant polymerases previously described by other groups. Mutations that inactivate the endonuclease activity in the isolated PA-Nter knock out the transcription but not replication activity in the recombinant polymerase. We confirm the importance of a number of active-site residues and identify some residues that may be involved in the positioning of the RNA substrate in the active site. Our results validate the use of the isolated endonuclease domain in a drug-design process for new anti-influenza virus compounds."

In order to improve yield, solubility or crystallisability of a protein, it is common to subclone shorter genetic constructs corresponding to single- or multi-domain fragments. However, it is not always clear where domain boundaries are located, especially when working on novel targets with little or no sequence similarity to other proteins. Several methods have been described employing aspects of directed evolution to the recombinant expression of challenging proteins. These combine the construction of a random library of genetic constructs of a target with a screening or selection process to identify solubly expressing protein fragments. Here we review several datasets from the ESPRIT (Expression of Soluble Proteins by Random Incremental Truncation) technology to provide a view on its capabilities. Firstly, we demonstrate how it functions using the well-characterised NF-kappaB p50 transcription factor as a model system. Secondly, application of ESPRIT to the challenging PB2 subunit of influenza polymerase has led to several novel atomic resolution structures; here we present an overview of the screening phase of that project.

The World Health Organization recommends nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens as initial ART. However, their efficacy may be compromised by resistance mutations selected by single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) used to prevent mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1. There is no simple and efficient method to detect such mutations at the initiation of ART.METHODS: One hundred eighty-one women who were participating in a clinical trial to prevent mother-to-child transmission and who started NVP-ART after they had received sdNVP or a placebo were included in the study. One hundred copies of each patient's HIV-1 DNA were tested for NVP-resistance point-mutations (K103N, Y181C, and G190A) with a sensitive oligonucleotide ligation assay that was able to detect mutants even at low concentrations (&gt; or = 5% of the viral population). Virologic failure was defined as confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;50 copies/mL after 6 to 18 months of NVP-ART.RESULTS: At initiation of NVP-ART, resistance mutations were identified in 38 (26%) of 148 participants given sdNVP (K103N in 19 [13%], Y181C in 8 [5%], G190A in 28 [19%], and &gt; or = 2 mutations in 15 [10%]), at a median 9.3 months after receipt of sdNVP. The risk of virologic failure was 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.77) in women with &gt; or = 1% resistance mutation, compared with a risk of 0.25 (95% CI, 0.17-0.35) in those without detectable resistance mutations (P &lt; .001). Failure was independently associated with resistance, an interval of &lt;6 months between sdNVP and NVP-ART initiation, and a viral load higher than the median at NVP-ART initiation.CONCLUSIONS: Access to simple and inexpensive assays to detect low concentrations of NVP-resistant HIV-1 DNA before the initiation of ART could help improve the outcome of first-line ART."

Antibodies binding to epitopes overlapping the CD4-binding site on gp120 are potent inhibitors of HIV entry, such as the llama heavy chain antibody fragment V(HH) D7, which has cross-clade neutralizing properties and competes with CD4 and mAb b12 for high affinity binding to gp120. We report the crystal structure of the D7 V(HH) at 1.5 A resolution, which reveals the molecular details of the complementarity determining regions (CDR) and substantial flexibility of CDR3 that could facilitate an induced fit interaction with gp120. Structural comparison of CDRs from other CD4 binding site antibodies suggests diverse modes of interaction. Mutational analysis identified CDR3 as a key component of gp120 interaction as determined by surface plasmon resonance. A decrease in affinity is directly coupled to the neutralization efficiency since mutations that decrease gp120 interaction increase the IC50 required for HIV-1 IIIB neutralization. Thus the structural study identifies the long CDR3 of D7 as the key determinant of interaction and HIV-1 neutralization. Furthermore, our data confirm that the structural plasticity of gp120 can accommodate multiple modes of antibody binding within the CD4 binding site."

To gain further insight into the functional role of this interaction, here we used reverse genetics to generate a series of A/WSN/33 (H1N1)-based NS2/NEP mutants for W78 or the C-terminal glutamate residues and assessed their effect on virus growth. We found that simultaneous mutations at three positions (E67S/E74S/E75S) of NS2/NEP were important for inhibition of influenza viral polymerase activity, although the W78S mutant and other glutamate mutants with single substitutions were not. In addition, double and triple substitutions in the NS2/NEP glutamine residues, which resulted in the addition of seven amino acids to the C-terminus of NS1 due to gene overlapping, resulted in virus attenuation in mice. Animal studies with this mutant suggest a potential benefit to incorporating these NS mutations into live vaccines."

A bonnet can also be used, since large amounts of heat can be lost from the head region, but may provide too much thermal insulation, thus increasing the risk of overheating. We assessed the time required to reach warning body temperature (t38 degrees C), heat stroke (t40 degrees C), or extreme value (t43 degrees C) in a mathematical model that involved calculating various local body heat losses. Simulated heat exchanges were based on body surface temperature distribution measured in preterm neonates exposed to 33 degrees C air temperature (relative air humidity: 35%; air velocity: &lt;0.1 m/s) and covered (torso and limbs) or not with a transparent plastic bag. We also compared metabolic heat production with body heat losses when a bonnet (2 or 3.5 mm thick) covered 10%, 40%, or 100% of the head. Wrapping neonates in a bag (combined or not with a bonnet) does not induce a critical situation as long as metabolic heat production does not increase. When endogenous heat production rises, t38 degrees C ranged between 75 and 287, t40 degrees C between 185 and 549, and t43 degrees C between 287 and 702 min. When this increase was accompanied by a fall in skin temperature, overheating risk was accentuated (37&lt;or=t38 degrees C&lt;or=45; 99&lt;or=t40 degrees C&lt;or=117; 169&lt;or=t43 degrees C&lt;or=194 min).

Levels of ICAM-1 in the vascular endothelium were significantly increased over the time course of reperfusion (8-24 h) of the ischaemic myocardium. The video intensity of ICAM-1 molecular images of the ischaemic anterior wall was almost three times greater than that in the non-ischaemic posterior wall during the late phase (8-24 h) of reperfusion.

After adjusted analysis, non-donors mentioned fear, lack of information and no particular reason more often than lapsed donors, who cited lack of time more often than non-donors. This study has pinpointed nine main barriers to blood donation among the French population, the most significant being medical reasons (for both lapsed and non-donors), lack of time, cited more frequently by lapsed donors, and fear of donating blood, most often cited by non-donors. Future studies are needed to gain greater insight into what these barriers represent for individuals to improve awareness and for recruitment of French blood donors."

The most crucial decision will be the choice of sex assignment. Rapid and precise diagnosis is thus essential. In XY newborns with normal/high plasma testosterone (T), partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is usually the first diagnosis evoked, which implies an androgen receptor (AR) defect. The diagnosis of steroid-5-alpha-reductase deficiency is rarely considered by the paediatrician. We report three new SRD5A2 gene mutations in four newborns from France, Morocco and Turkey. The newborns presented with ambiguous genitalia and normal plasma T values and the initial diagnosis\PAIS. In all four cases, normal sequences of the complete AR gene excluded this diagnosis and raised the hypothesis of 5α-reductase deficiency. The entire coding region (5 exons) of the SRD5A2 gene was assessed by PCR and direct sequencing analysis. For patient 1, we identified a new homozygous 2bp deletion in exon 1 (c.122_123delAG). Patient 2 had a known homozygous mutation, p.G115D, in exon 2. New compound heterozygous mutations in exon 4 (p.A215V) and exon 5 (p.X255Q) were found in patient 3. Patient 4 presented a new substitution in exon 1 (p.S14R) associated with a known polymorphism (p.V89L). Our data confirm our previous experience and clearly demonstrate that a 5-α reductase defect should be considered in all XY newborns with ambiguous genitalia and normal plasma T secretion, whatever their geographic area or ethnic group; moreover, this defect was not linked to specific phenotype. Early molecular diagnosis is indispensable for the crucial decision of the newborn's sex of rearing."

After the patients with secondary hypertension, diabetes patients, and patients with liver or kidney disease were excluded, 84 workers (58 males and 26 females) were diagnosed as hypertension. The occupational stressors, personalities, buffering factors and occupational strain were measured by using the Job Demand-control Model, the Effort-reward Imbalance Model questionnaires and Occupational Stress Measurement Scale. Main risk factors for the development of hypertension such as heredity, body mass index, high salt diet, alcohol use, smoking habit and lack of physical activity were investigated. 498 whole blood samples were collected from workers in field epidemiologic survey. All of the samples were detected TG, CHO and FPG by common biochemistry methods. Multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to determine the relationship between occupational stressors and prevalence rate of hypertension. The difference of morbidity of hypertension between different stress level subjects was analyzed by chi2 test.RESULTS: (1) Logistic regression analysis of the hypertension by all occupational stressors and risk factors of hypertension indicated that not only some common factors such as parents' hypertensive history, BMI, alcohol use and TG, but also responsibility for person, work locus of control and social support were significantly correlated with elevated risks of hypertension. (2) Logistic regression analysis of the hypertension by main dimensions of effort-reward imbalance model and risk factors of hypertension indicated that parents' hypertensive history, BMI, alcohol use, TG, and effort were significantly correlated with elevated risks of hypertension. Logistic regression analysis indicated the risk of hypertension had an effect on the FRI and effort (OR was 1.71 and 2.43 respectively). (3) For the job strain model, results indicated that parents' hypertensive history, UMI, alcohol use, TG, work locus of control and social support were significantly correlated with elevated risks of hypertension. But the main dimensions of job strain model (job demands and decision latitude) didn't enter regression equation. (4) The difference of prevalence of hypertension between high- and low stress level groups in male was statistically significant (OR = 3.13, P &lt; 0.01), but the case was not the same in female (P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Occupational stress might be risk factor of hypertension; The predictive power of effort-reward imbalance model for the development of hypertension would be larger than that of job strain model."

Clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed pre-treatment, at 6 and 12 weeks post-treatment.RESULTS: In both groups, UMI plus AmF/SnF(2) -implemented oral hygiene use determined a significant decrease of total bacterial counts, with non-smokers exhibiting a lower count compared with smokers at 12 weeks. No significant differences were observed between smokers and non-smokers in the counts of total pathogens and red complex species at each observation interval. Clinically, a significant reduction of supragingival plaque, gingival inflammation and probing pocket depth was similarly observed in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: A combined mechanical/chemical plaque control approach based on UMI and the use of AmF/SnF(2) agents resulted in the reduction of supragingival plaque deposits, gingival inflammation and subgingival periodontal pathogens in G-AgP patients during SPT, with no substantial difference between smokers and non-smokers."

It may also have a deleterious effect on bone mass acquisition. The aim of this study was to determine the time-course of bone mass accretion in peripubertal elite female rhythmic gymnasts (FRGs) over a 1-year period, as well as the anthropometric and hormone parameters that could be helpful for predicting bone mineral density (BMD) gain.METHODS AND DESIGN: We conducted a 1-year follow-up study in 29 FRGs (10.7-16.1 years old). Whole body composition and BMD of the whole body, proximal femur, lumbar spine, mid-radius, and skull were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Moreover, baseline growth- and bone metabolism-related hormones such as IGF1, IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), leptin, and bone markers were measured.RESULTS: BMD increased significantly at all bone sites throughout puberty, particularly between Tanner stages II and IV-V (P=0.025 to P&lt;0.001). The IGF1 level, IGF1/IGFBP3 ratio, and leptin level were higher in late pubertal stages (i.e. IV-V) compared with early stage (i.e. I). In simple and multivariate analyses, only the IGF1/IGFBP3 ratio was strongly correlated with the BMD change at all bone sites (r=0.49, P=0.02 to r=0.77, P&lt;0.0001).CONCLUSION: This 1-year follow-up study of peripubertal FRGs showed that BMD gain was maximal around Tanner stage III. The plasma IGF1/IGFBP3 ratio was associated with bone mass acquisition in this period, and it may thus serve as a surrogate marker of bone mass gain in this population."

However, ultrasonic measurement data inherently include some errors. In this study, the effects of four major measurement errors, namely, errors due to gaussian noise, aliasing, wall filter, and lack of data, on UMI simulation were examined by a numerical experiment dealing with the blood flow field in the descending aorta with an aneurysm, the same as in our previous study. While solving the governing equations in UMI simulation, gaussian noise did not prevent the UMI simulation from effectively reproducing the blood flow field. In contrast, aliasing caused significant errors in UMI simulation. Effects of wall filter and lack of data appeared in diastole and in the whole period, respectively. By detecting significantly large feedback signals as a sign of aliasing and by not adding feedback signals where measured Doppler velocities were aliasing or zero, the computational accuracy substantially improved, alleviating the effects of measurement errors. Through these considerations, UMI simulation can provide accurate and detailed information on hemodynamics with suppression of four major measurement errors."

The upward migration index (UMI) assesses proximal migration of the humeral head while controlling for patients' bony morphologic features.PURPOSES: We asked whether functional and quality-of-life (QOL) improvement occurs longitudinally in patients with low, moderate, or high degrees of proximal humeral migration after arthroscopic cuff repair and whether differences occur between groups.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 118 patients with full-thickness tears treated by arthroscopic cuff repair. Patients were divided into three groups depending on the severity of preoperative proximal humeral migration seen on MRI. We determined function using two functional scores and the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (a QOL index). Evaluations were performed preoperatively and 6 and 12 months postoperatively. A general linear model analysis controlled for patient characteristics, including the UMI, to determine their effects on functional and QOL scores.RESULTS: Function and QOL improved after surgery in all three groups. The UMI did not correlate with final functional or QOL scores. Six-month functional and QOL scores correlated with final scores. The best predictor of final strength was initial strength.CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative UMI did not correlate with functional or QOL improvements after surgery. The data suggest substantial proximal migration of the humeral head, as measured by the UMI, should not be considered a contraindication to arthroscopic rotator cuff repair."

We consider a model of two species competing for an implicit resource on a habitat divided into two patches. Both patches are connected through constant migration rates and in each patch local dynamics are driven by a Lotka-Volterra competition system. Local competition is asymmetric with the same superior competitor in both patches. Migration is asymmetric, species dependent and fast in comparison to local competitive interactions. The species and patches are taken to be otherwise similar: in both patches we assume the same carrying capacities for both species, and the same growth rates and pair-wise competition coefficients for each species. We show that global dynamics can be described by a classical Lotka-Volterra competition model. We found that by modifying the ratio of intraspecific migration rates for both species all possible combinations of global species relative dominance can be achieved. We find specific conditions for which the local superior competitor is globally excluded. This is to our knowledge the first study showing that fast asymmetric migration can lead to inferior competitor dominance in a homogeneous environment. We conclude that disparity of temporal scales between migration and local dynamics may have important consequences for the maintenance of biodiversity in spatially structured populations."

Men and individuals age 40 and over are overrepresented among donors (chi-square [1ddl]= 19.54, p&lt;0.001; chi-square [3ddl]=14.24, p&lt;0.01). Those with higher education were also more likely to be donors (chi-square [4ddl]=38.91, p&lt;0.001). Main motivations to blood donation are altruism (43%) and awareness of a blood shortage (20.33%).

Bragg diffraction of visible light occurs when the light interacts at the Bragg angle with an ultrasonic field of the appropriate frequency. (The spacing between acoustic condensations and rarefactions acts like the planes in an atomic lattice.) If a beam of light is Bragg diffracted by an ultrasonic beam that previously has passed through an object, an image of the structure of the object is made visible in the diffraction field of the optical beam since there is a one-to-one mapping of the ultrasonic field onto the diffraction order. In many acoustic Bragg imaging applications, the sound field must pass through the object which is to be imaged. Ultrasonic attenuation at the very high acoustic frequencies needed for Bragg imaging (typically approximately 25-30 MHz) severely limits the nondestructive testing (NDT) applications of traditional acoustic Bragg imaging. In this paper, a reflection-based application of acoustic Bragg imaging is discussed which may have useful industrial and biomedical NDT applications."

However, the UMI was not developed for men undergoing AS for prostate cancer and has not been adequately tested in this population.

Automatic working-area classification can reproducibly identify appropriate working smear areas. However, very little research has been reported in the literature. With the aim of providing a preprocessing step for further detailed cell enumeration and diagnosis for high-throughput screening (HTS), we propose an integrated algorithm for area classification and quantify both cell spreading and cell clumping in terms of individual clumps and the occurrence probabilities of the group of clumps over the image. Comprehensive comparisons are presented to compare the effect of these quantifications and their combinations. Our experiments using images of Giemsa-stained blood smears show that the method is efficient, accurate (above 88.9% hit rates for all areas in the validation set of 140 images), and robust (above 78.1% hit rates for a test set of 4878 images). This lays a good foundation for fast working-area selection in HTS."

There were 43 males and 21 females with mean age of 36 years. Duration of symptom was averaged 42 weeks. The patients were asked to complete questionnaires concerning sexual desire, activity, adjustment, and satisfaction. About 83% of the patients had sexual desire, and 89% achieved satisfaction during sexual activities in presick period.RESULTS: Lumbar disc herniation decreased sexual desire in 50% and frequency of sexual activity in 59% of the patients. About 67% of males and 81% of females felt discomfort during sexual activity; satisfaction decreased in 28% of male and 41% of females. Adjustment in sexual position was required in 54% of males and 86% of females. Surgery improved sexual desire, frequency of sexual activity, and satisfaction in 85%, 88%, and 94%, respectively. However, 31% of females did not regain sexual desire and 46% still felt discomfort during sexual activity (the rates were 7% and 17% in males, respectively). Sexual activity was resumed within 2 postoperative weeks in 23% (27% in males and 14% in females), and 4 weeks in 53%. Males resumed sexual activity earlier than females.CONCLUSION: Lumbar disc herniation largely impacted sexual desire, activity, and satisfaction. Adjustment in sexual position was required in large number of patients to avoid discomfort during sexual activities. Surgical treatment improved quality of sexual activities, but more females did not regain sexual desire, felt sexual discomfort, and thereby resumed sexual activities later than males after surgery."

Structural modeling based on small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data reveals an elongated crescent-shaped conformation for dimeric ALIX lacking the proline-rich domain (ALIX(BRO1-V)). Mutations at the dimerization interface prevent dimerization and induce an open elongated monomeric conformation of ALIX(-V) as determined by SAXS modeling. ALIX dimerizes in vivo and dimeric ALIX colocalizes with CHMP4B upon coexpression. We show further that ALIX dimerization affects HIV-1 budding. C-terminally truncated activated CHMP4B retaining the ALIX binding site forms linear, circular, and helical filaments in vitro, which can be bridged by ALIX. Our data suggest that dimeric ALIX represents the active form that interacts with ESCRT-III CHMP4 polymers and functions as a scaffolding protein during membrane remodeling processes."

The reproductive mode of Leishmania species has often been assumed to be predominantly clonal, but remains unsettled. We have investigated the genetic polymorphism at 12 microsatellite loci on 124 human strains of Leishmania braziliensis from 2 countries, Peru and Bolivia. There is substantial genetic diversity, with an average of 12.4 +/- 4.4 alleles per locus. There is linkage disequilibrium at a genome-wide scale, as well as a substantial heterozygote deficit (more than 50% the expected value from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), which indicates high levels of inbreeding. These observations are inconsistent with a strictly clonal model of reproduction, which implies excess heterozygosity. Moreover, there is large genetic heterogeneity between populations within countries (Wahlund effect), which evinces a strong population structure at a microgeographic scale. Our findings are compatible with the existence of population foci at a microgeographic scale, where clonality alternates with sexuality of an endogamic nature, with possible occasional recombination events between individuals of different genotypes. These findings provide key clues on the ecology and transmission patterns of Leishmania parasites."

The nuclease is one of the lytic cycle proteins required for successful viral replication. In addition to the previously described endonuclease and exonuclease activities on single-stranded DNA and dsDNA substrates, we observed an RNase activity for Epstein-Barr virus nuclease in the presence of Mn(2+), giving a possible explanation for its role in host mRNA degradation. Its crystal structure shows a catalytic core of the D-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily closely related to the exonuclease from bacteriophage lambda with a bridge across the active-site canyon. This bridge may reduce endonuclease activity, ensure processivity or play a role in strand separation of dsDNA substrates. As the DNA strand that is subject to cleavage is likely to make a sharp turn in front of the bridge, endonuclease activity on single-stranded DNA stretches appears to be possible, explaining the cleavage of circular substrates."

These proteins form homo-oligomers, fulfil similar roles in the replication cycles of the various viruses, but differ in their length and oligomerization state. Sequence alignments reveal no sequence similarity among proteins from viruses belonging to the same family. Sequence analysis and experimental data show that phosphoproteins from viruses of the Paramyxoviridae contain structured domains alternating with intrinsically disordered regions. Here, we used predictions of disorder of secondary structure, and an analysis of sequence conservation to predict the domain organization of the phosphoprotein from Sendai virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and rabies virus (RV P). We devised a new procedure for combining the results from multiple prediction methods and locating the boundaries between disordered regions and structured domains. To validate the proposed modular organization predicted for RV P and to confirm that the putative structured domains correspond to autonomous folding units, we used two-hybrid and biochemical approaches to characterize the properties of several fragments of RV P. We found that both central and C-terminal domains can fold in isolation, that the central domain is the oligomerization domain, and that the C-terminal domain binds to nucleocapsids. Our results suggest a conserved organization of P proteins in the Rhabdoviridae family in concatenated functional domains resembling that of the P proteins in the Paramyxoviridae family."

However, the diagnosis of UMI is based on the appearance of incidental Q-waves on 12-lead electrocardiography. Thus, the syndrome of non-Q-wave UMI has not been investigated. Delayed-enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DE-CMR) can identify MI, even when small, subendocardial, or without associated Q-waves. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and prognosis associated with non-Q-wave UMI identified by DE-CMR.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a prospective study of 185 patients with suspected coronary disease and without history of clinical myocardial infarction who were scheduled for invasive coronary angiography. Q-wave UMI was determined by electrocardiography (Minnesota Code). Non-Q-wave UMI was identified by DE-CMR in the absence of electrocardiographic Q-waves. Patients were followed to determine the prognostic significance of non-Q-wave UMI. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The prevalence of non-Q-wave UMI was 27% (50/185), compared with 8% (15/185) for Q-wave UMI. Patients with non-Q-wave UMI were older, were more likely to have diabetes, and had higher Framingham risk than those without MI, but were similar to those with Q-wave UMI. Infarct size in non-Q-wave UMI was modest (8%+/-7% of left ventricular mass), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by cine-CMR was usually preserved (52%+/-18%). The prevalence of non-Q-wave UMI increased with the extent and severity of coronary disease on angiography (p&lt;0.0001 for both). Over 2.2 y (interquartile range 1.8-2.7), 16 deaths occurred: 13 in non-Q-wave UMI patients (26%), one in Q-wave UMI (7%), and two in patients without MI (2%). Multivariable analysis including New York Heart Association class and LVEF demonstrated that non-Q-wave UMI was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 11.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.5-51.1) and cardiac mortality (HR 17.4, 95% CI 2.2-137.4).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with suspected coronary disease, the prevalence of non-Q-wave UMI is more than 3-fold higher than Q-wave UMI.

The efficiency of this carbene as ligand for transition metal based catalysts is first illustrated by the gold(I) catalyzed hydroamination of internal alkynes with secondary dialkyl amines, a process with little precedent. The feasibility of this reaction allows for significantly enlarging the scope of the one-pot three-component synthesis of 1,2-dihydroquinoline derivatives, and related nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Indeed, two different alkynes were used, which include an internal alkyne for the first step."

More recently, a small range of complexes has been prepared in which alternative NHC isomers, namely imidazol-5-ylidenes (also termed abnormal NHCs or aNHCs, because the carbene center is no longer located between the two nitrogens), coordinate to a transition metal. Here we report the synthesis of a metal-free aNHC that is stable at room temperature, both in the solid state and in solution. Calculations show that the aNHC is more basic than its normal NHC isomer. Because the substituent at the carbon next to the carbene center is a nonbulky phenyl group, a variety of substitution patterns should be tolerated without precluding the isolation of the corresponding aNHC."

P forms dimers (P(2)) that bind through their C-terminal domains (P(CTD)) to the C-terminal region of the N. Recombinant circular N(m)-RNA complexes containing 9 to 12 protomers of N (hereafter, the subscript m denotes the number of N protomers) served here as model systems for studying the binding of P to NC-like N(m)-RNA complexes. Titration experiments show that there are only two equivalent and independent binding sites for P dimers on the N(m)-RNA rings and that each P dimer binds through a single P(CTD). A dissociation constant in the nanomolar range (160+/-20 nM) was measured by surface plasmon resonance, indicating a strong interaction between the two partners. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data and small-angle neutron scattering data showed that binding of two P(CTD) had almost no effect on the size and shape of the N(m)-RNA rings, whereas binding of two P(2) significantly increased the size of the complexes. SAXS data and molecular modeling were used to add flexible loops (N(NTD) loop, amino acids 105-118; N(CTD) loop, amino acids 376-397) missing in the recently solved crystal structure of the circular N(11)-RNA complex and to build a model for the N(10)-RNA complex. Structural models for the N(m)-RNA-(P(CTD))(2) complexes were then built by docking the known P(CTD) structure onto the completed structures of the circular N(10)-RNA and N(11)-RNA complexes. A multiple-stage flexible docking procedure was used to generate decoys, and SAXS and biochemical data were used for filtering the models. In the refined model, the P(CTD) is bound to the C-terminal top of one N protomer (N(i)), with the C-terminal helix (alpha(6)) of P(CTD) lying on helix alpha(14) of N(i). By an induced-fit mechanism, the N(CTD) loop of the same protomer (N(i)) and that of the adjacent one (N(i)(-1)) mold around the P(CTD), making extensive protein-protein contacts that could explain the strong affinity of P for its template. The structural model is in agreement with available biochemical data and provides new insights on the mechanism of attachment of the polymerase complex to the NC template."

TMS has good clinical accessibility and economical benefit. On the contrary, DTT has a unique advantage to visualize neural tracts three-dimensionally although it requires an expensive and large MRI machine. Many studies have demonstrated that TMS and DTT have predictive values for motor outcome in stroke patients. However, there has been no study on the comparison of these two evaluation tools. In the current study, we compared the abilities of TMS and DTT to predict upper motor outcome in patients with ICH (intracerebral hemorrhage).METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients with severe motor weakness were evaluated by TMS and DTT at the early stage (7-28 days) of ICH. Modified Brunnstrom classification (MBC) and the motricity index of upper extremity (UMI) were evaluated at onset and 6 months after onset.RESULTS: Patients with the presence of a motor evoked potential (MEP) in TMS or a preserved corticospinal tract (CST) in DTT showed better motor outcomes than those without (p=0.000). TMS showed higher positive predictive value than DTT. In contrast, DTT showed higher negative predictive value than TMS.CONCLUSIONS: TMS and DTT had different advantages in predicting motor outcome, and this result could be a reference to predict final neurological deficit at the early stage of ICH."

A UMI was present in 45 (9.4%) of all subjects; in 13.1% of men and in 3.7% of women. The risk of UMI increased from 6.0% (95% CI 2.2 to 9.8%) in those with two vascular risk factors up to 26.2% (95% CI 15.2 to 37.3%) in those with four or five risk factors. In a multivariable analysis, the risk of UMI was related to male gender (OR 2.3 (95% CI 1.0 to 5.6)), age (OR 1.04 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.07) per year), ever smoking (OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.0 to 9.1), history of stroke (OR 1.9 (95% CI 0.8 to 4.3)) and history of aneurysm of the abdominal aorta (OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 6.9)).CONCLUSIONS: In cardiac asymptomatic subjects at high vascular risk, UMI is common.

Moreover, they are antigen-presenting cells which, through contact with T cells, determine the type of immune responses towards inflammatory or anti-inflammatory. Currently, the hypothesis that attributes importance to the development of a post-infectious immunosuppression in the prognosis of the septic patient is growing stronger. It has been possible to verify the role played by these cells in this type of immunosuppression by the significant decrease in the number of DCs and by the dysfunctions in the functional capacity that include, on the one hand, the abnormal cytokine production and, on the other hand, the alterations in communication between the DCs and T cells that constitute an essential immunological fact. Further research into the knowledge regarding the DCs, in the context of severe infection, may help to consolidate some encouraging data that indicate these cells as: 1) an effective tool for monitoring the acute infection, 2) a discriminatory variable that may help determine the risk of nosocomial infection and 3) in a longer term, a treatment target that would restore the immunological abnormalities that occur in sepsis."

Like the other herpesvirus serine PRs, EBV PR could be a target for the inhibition of EBV replication. To date, no data have been reported on the inhibition of EBV PR messenger RNA (mRNA) by small interfering RNA (siRNA).METHODS: In this study, siRNAs targeting EBV PR were delivered to the epithelial 293 cell line stably transfected with the complete B95-8 EBV episome. EBV DNA and PR mRNA were quantified by real-time PCR in cells and supernatant, protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting, and production of EBV infectious particles in the culture medium was measured by Raji cell superinfection.RESULTS: The EBV PR mRNA within the cells was reduced by 73%, the PR protein by 35% and the amount of virus in the cell supernatant was drastically decreased by 86% or 95%, depending on the method.CONCLUSIONS: The strong effect of the siRNA targeting EBV PR on EBV replication attests to the crucial role played by EBV PR in the production of infectious particles and suggests that targeting this enzyme can be a new strategy against EBV-associated diseases where virus replication occurs."

The molecular recognition properties of the M and CA fragments through complementary hydrogen bonds (DAD and ADA; D=donor, A=acceptor) are the key factor used to direct the formation of hybrid silica materials by using a sol-gel process. These materials were synthesised following two methods: First, an organo-bridged silsesquioxane was obtained by the hydrolysis of the two complementary monotrialkoxysilylated melamine and cyanuric acid derivatives, with fluoride ions as a catalyst. The hydrogen-bonding interactions between the two organic fragments are responsible for the formation of the bridging unit. The transcription of the assembly into the hybrid material was characterised and evidenced by solid-state NMR (29Si, 13C) and FTIR spectroscopic experiments. Second, the molecular recognition was exploited to synthesise an imprinted hybrid silica. This material was prepared by co-condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) with the monosilylated cyanuric acid derivative (CA) templated by nonsilylated melamine. The melamine template was completely removed by treating the solid material with hydrochloric acid. The reintroduction of the template was performed by treating the resulting material with an aqueous suspension of melamine. These steps were monitored and analysed by several techniques, such as solid-state NMR (29Si, 13C) and FTIR spectroscopic analysis and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms."

Increased perinatal and infant mortality has been associated with IUGR. Some studies have suggested that HIV infection could increase the risk of IUGR. To confirm this hypothesis, we examined the association between HIV-related factors and the risk of IUGR in Thailand.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from a cohort of 1436 HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled in the &quot;Perinatal HIV Prevention Trial-1&quot;, a clinical trial conducted from 1997 to 1999 in Thailand, were analyzed using a logistic regression, adjusting for risk factors usually associated with IUGR.RESULTS: The rate of IUGR was 7.6%. Adjusting for a short maternal height, low body mass index, small weight gain during pregnancy, and infant female sex, a low maternal CD4 percentage was independently associated with IUGR (odds ratio 0.96, per 1% increment, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 0.99, P = 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: The current World Health Organization recommendation to initiate combination antiretroviral therapy for immunocompromised women as early as possible during pregnancy for their own health and for the prevention of HIV mother-to-child transmission is likely to also decrease the incidence of IUGR. Encouraging immunocompromised HIV-infected women who plan to become pregnant to wait until immune restoration has been achieved may help to reduce the risk of IUGR."

The association between socioeconomic indices and plasma fibrinogen levels was examined after taking into account several variables such as age, educational attainment, job strain, alcohol consumption, and smoking status and (for women) menopause status. Male white-collar workers had significantly lower fibrinogen levels than blue-collar workers. However, no significant association was found between occupational position and plasma fibrinogen for men. Occupational category interacted with occupational position for women. Among white-collar women, those in non-managerial positions showed higher levels of fibrinogen than those in managerial positions; among blue-collar women, there was no such difference. The association of occupational category and position on fibrinogen levels varied as a function of gender, implying that gender-specific socioeconomic differences could exist in cardiovascular risks in Japanese workers."

One-to-one structured interviews were conducted with 260 older French adults living in Marseille and 239 older Moroccans (123 living in Marrakech and 116 living in a Berber village). The same questionnaire comprising multiple-choice and short-answer questions was used in both countries. This methodology allowed us to perform quantitative and qualitative analyses. Participants averaged 73 years of age in both samples. The French and Moroccan older adults perceived positive and negative age stereotypes within their societies, but the Moroccan ones more often perceived positive stereotypes toward older adults. Moreover, almost as many Moroccan people living in Marrakech as French people perceived negative stereotypes toward older adults. The qualitative analysis allowed us to demonstrate that some notions associated with the status of older adults are shared in France and Morocco-such as respect is due to older adults-whereas other notions differ between these societies-such as the association between aging and affection/love in Morocco.

Authors were contacted for missing information.STUDY SELECTION: Studies conducted in humans were selected if they evaluated fluorosis and infant formula. Studies focussed exclusively on primary teeth were excluded. There were no restrictions on study designs.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Summary odds ratios and confidence intervals were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I(2) statistic and publications bias using a funnel plot and Egger test.RESULTS: Twenty-seven out of 41 studies evaluating the effect of infant formula on enamel fluorosis risk were included. These 27 papers reported the results of 19 observational studies (comprising one prospective cohort study, five retrospective cohort studies, six case-control studies, four cross-sectional studies and three historical-control studies). Seventeen of these 19 studies reported odds ratios (OR) and, among these, infant formula consumption was associated with a higher prevalence of enamel fluorosis in the permanent dentition [summary OR, 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4-2.3]. The studies showed significant heterogeneity (66%) and evidence of publication bias (P 0.002). Metaregression suggests that the OR associating infant formula with enamel fluorosis increased by 5% for each 0.1-ppm increase in the reported levels of fluoride in the water supply (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09).CONCLUSIONS: Infant formula consumption may be associated with an increased risk of developing at least some detectable level of enamel fluorosis, but this depends on the level of fluoride in the water supply. The evidence that the fluoride in the infant formula caused enamel fluorosis was weak, as other mechanisms could explain the observed association."

The urban marginalization index (UMI) and the infant mortality rate (IMR) were determined for each of the city's basic geostatistical areas (BGA). The UMI and IMR were statistically calculated to identify geographic areas in which they were concentrated and to determine the degree of spatial correlation between these indicators. To determine the general spatial autocorrelation and spatial clustering of UMIs and IMRs within the city and the BGAs, Morans I index, Ipop statistics, and Besag and Newell's method were employed.RESULTS: The mean IMR was 14.3 per 1,000 live births, higher in the BGAs with greater social marginalization (16.2 per 1,000) and lower in those with less (11.7 per 1,000). The UMI range was -3.1-6.6 (maximum: 4.3; minimum: -2.7). Autocorrelation was found among the UMI (Moran I = 0.62), with significant clustering in the city's northwest, northeast, and southeast parts. Local clustering of high IMRs was found in Hermosillo's central and western areas, albeit without autocorrelation (Moran I = -0.007). High risk areas (high IMR and high UMI) were found in the city's northwestern section.CONCLUSIONS: Spatial clusters with high IMR were found in socially marginalized areas in the northwestern part of Hermosillo, a city of medium size located in northwestern Mexico.

Until that international repository is established, it is possible to access some of these valuable knowledge resources.BACKGROUND: ETDs provide a technologically advanced medium with endless multimedia capabilities that far exceed the print and bound copies of theses and dissertations housed traditionally in individual university libraries. CURRENT USE: A growing trend exists for universities worldwide to require graduate students to submit theses or dissertations as electronic documents. However, nurse scholars underutilize ETDs, as evidenced by perusing bibliographic citation lists in many of the research journals.SOURCES: ETDs can be searched for and retrieved through several digital resources such as the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (http://www.ndltd.org), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (http://www.umi.com), the Australasian Digital Theses Program (http://adt.caul.edu.au/) and through individual university web sites and online catalogues.BENEFITS: An international repository of ETDs benefits the community of nurse scholars in many ways. The ability to access recent graduate students' research electronically from anywhere in the world is advantageous. For scholars residing in developing countries, access to these ETDs may prove to be even more valuable.LIMITATIONS: In some cases, ETDs are not available for worldwide access and can only be accessed through the university library from which the student graduated. Public access to university library ETD collections is not always permitted.CONCLUSIONS: Nurse scholars from both developing and developed countries could benefit from ETDs."

In the recent past, delayed-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) has provided a new imaging method for evaluating myocardial viability and to detect myocardial scars.PURPOSE: To investigate differences in tissue characteristics between UMI and recognized myocardial infarction (RMI) scars, by assessing the signal intensity (SI) detected by DE-MRI.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized subgroup of 259 subjects from the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature of Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study was submitted to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DE-MRI-detected myocardial scars were divided in two groups, UMI and RMI, according to the hospital medical records. The scars detected by DE-MRI were analyzed by measuring SI ratio of scar tissue to normal myocardium.RESULTS: The mean SI ratio in the UMI group (4.5+/-3.0, mean+/-SD) was lower than in the RMI group 8.9+/-5.1 (P-value = 0.001). This difference was still significant (P&lt;0.0001) after adjustment for gender, body mass index, time of image acquisition after gadolinium administration, scar transmurality, or total myocardial infarction mass.CONCLUSION: The difference in the SI ratio of the scars between the two groups most likely reflects a different contrast distribution volume of the tissues, which might indicate that UMI and RMI tissues diverge in tissue composition."

The kinetic data related to the successive steps were calculated according to pseudo-first-order kinetic models and optimized using mono- or poly-exponential regressions. Various metabolites were identified by co-injection with authentic samples and/or ESI-MS coupling. The results led us to propose, for each considered pronucleotide, a global decomposition pathway ending in the selective delivery of the corresponding mononucleotide. Associated to the determination of other parameters (lipophilicity, aqueous solubility), the present study contributes to the search of suitable pharmacological properties for further in vivo evaluations."

Data on accident, treatment and outcomes were collected prospectively. The regions were classified as 'high income' (Austria, five centres), 'upper middle income' (UMI) (Croatia, Slovakia, six centres) or 'lower middle income' (LMI) (Bosnia, Macedonia, two centres). Data on epidemiology, treatment and outcomes were compared according to this classification. Quality of care was assessed using a new scoring system.RESULTS: A total of 1172 data sets were analysed. Patients from the wealthier regions were significantly older. Low-level falls and traffic accidents contributed to more than two-third of all cases. Violence-related trauma was significantly more frequent in 'middle income' regions. Treatment quality was significantly different; treatment according to guidelines for brain trauma management was provided most frequently for patients from high-income regions. Compared with expected mortality rates, mortality was 6.5% lower in the 'high-income' centres, 2.4% lower in the 'UMI' centres and 13% higher in the 'LMI' centres. Advanced age, poor neurological status, high trauma severity and poor quality of care were associated with significantly lower odds for survival.CONCLUSIONS: The association between the economic status and outcome of brain trauma patients was due to the quality of care. Successful implementation of guidelines for brain trauma management requires a well-funded health care system."

In this study, we analysed and compared the population genetic structure of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae over space and time in the Nianza Province, near Victoria Lake in Kenya. The parasites were collected from mosquitoes caught in six villages separated by up to 68 km in 2002 and 2003. A total of 545 oocysts were dissected from 122 infected mosquitoes and genotyped at seven microsatellite markers. Five hundred and forty-seven mosquitoes, both infected and uninfected, were genotyped at eight microsatellites. For the parasite and the vector, the analysis revealed no (or very little) genetic differentiation among villages. This may be explained by high local population sizes for the parasite and the mosquito. The small level of genetic differentiation observed between populations may explain the speed at which antimalarial drug resistance and insecticide resistance spread into the African continent."

This study optimized and utilized a 'Ferric reducing ability of serum (FRAS)' assay as a screening tool to quantitate the degree of oxidative damage induced by NMs on human blood serum. Antioxidants in blood protect against oxidative damage caused by free radicals via chemical quenching and will decrease when exposed to oxidatively stressful materials. Using this approach, the antioxidant capacity of NM treated serum was significantly decreased by nano-silver, a series of nano-carbon blacks, fullerene soot, and nano-TiO(2) (anatase, p&lt;0.05), but not with nano-alumina, fullerite, purified fullerene, fine TiO(2) (rutile) and Min-U-Sil 5. Particle surface area and not biological particle size was highly associated with the degree of oxidative stress observed. This approach appears responsive to multiple determinants of oxidative damage, including particle chemistry, surface area and impurities, and may be a valid screening method to determine oxidative damage imparted by nanomaterials."

SLAP has a unique, myristylated N-terminus, followed by SH3 and SH2 domains with high homology to Src family tyrosine kinases (SFK) and a unique C-terminal tail, which is important for c-Cbl binding. We have previously shown that SLAP negatively regulates platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced mitogenesis in fibroblasts and we now report that it regulates F-actin assembly for dorsal ruffles formation. c-Cbl mediated SLAP inhibition towards actin remodelling. Moreover, SLAP enhanced PDGF-induced c-Cbl phosphorylation by SFK. In contrast, SLAP mitogenic inhibition was not mediated by c-Cbl, but it rather involved a competitive mechanism with SFK for PDGF-receptor (PDGFR) association and mitogenic signalling. Accordingly, phosphorylation of the Src mitogenic substrates Stat3 and Shc were reduced by SLAP. Thus, we concluded that SLAP regulates PDGFR signalling by two independent mechanisms: a competitive mechanism for PDGF-induced Src mitogenic signalling and a non-competitive mechanism for dorsal ruffles formation mediated by c-Cbl."

With an eye towards practical implementation of UMI simulation with real measurement data, its efficiency for three-dimensional unsteady blood flow analysis and a method for treating low time resolution of ultrasonic measurement were investigated by a numerical experiment dealing with complicated blood flow in an aneurysm. Even when simplified boundary conditions were applied, the UMI simulation reduced the errors of velocity and pressure to 31% and 53% in the feedback domain which covered the aneurysm, respectively. Local maximum wall shear stress was estimated, showing both the proper position and the value with 1% deviance. A properly designed intermittent feedback applied only at the time when measurement data were obtained had the same computational accuracy as feedback applied at every computational time step. Hence, this feedback method is a possible solution to overcome the insufficient time resolution of ultrasonic measurement."

A 0.2% CHX solution was used for professional tongue brushing and mouthrinsing. Ten patients (control group) received a similar session of UMI associated with subgingival irrigation and professional tongue brushing and mouthrinsing with a control formulation. Clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed pre-treatment at 3, 6 and 12 weeks post-treatment.RESULTS: UMI either with or without additional CHX use determined a significant reduction of supragingival plaque and gingival inflammation as well as a significant reduction of subgingival bacterial pathogens. The additional use of CHX did not result in any additional clinical and microbiological benefit with respect to mere UMI.CONCLUSIONS: The adjunctive professional use of CHX formulations to UMI seems to produce no additional effects over UMI alone during supportive therapy in G-AgP patients."

In this paper, we investigated the transient and steady characteristics of UMI simulation by numerical experiment. A steady standard numerical solution of a three-dimensional blood flow in an aneurysmal aorta was first defined with realistic boundary conditions. The UMI simulation was performed assuming that the realistic velocity profiles in the upstream and downstream boundaries were unknown but that the Doppler velocities of the standard solution were available in the aneurysmal domain or the feedback domain by virtual color Doppler imaging. The application of feedback in UMI simulation resulted in a computational result approach to the standard solution. As feedback gain increased, the error decreased faster and the steady error became smaller, implying the traceability to the standard solution improves. The positioning of ultrasound probes influenced the result. The height less than or equal to the aneurysm seemed better choice for UMI simulation using one probe. Increasing the velocity information by using multiple probes enhanced the UMI simulation by achieving ten times faster convergence and more reduction of error."

Cross-over studies with a washout period of at least 1 month between experimental periods were also included. Split-mouth studies and trials involving interventions that combined toothbrushing with the use of antimicrobial mouthrinses, irrigation devices, or interdental cleansing and those of less than 4 weeks\[primes] duration were excluded.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Initial assessment and data abstraction was carried out by two reviewers independently. The quality of the trials was evaluated by assessing randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding of the examiner, description of losses, and the use of intention to treat analyses. Trials were divided into categories depending on the mode of action of the powered toothbrush. The weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals was used to express the comparative treatment effect. The random-effects method for meta-analysis was used to combine treatment effects across studies in each category. Heterogeneity was investigated visually, using the I2 test and the Cochran test.RESULTS: Only five trials were considered appropriate for inclusion in the meta-analysis, and these could be grouped into four categories according to mode of action. None of the studies was of more than 60 days' duration. Based on quality assessment and the short experimental period of these trials, there is currently not sufficient evidence to suggest particular efficacy of powered toothbrushes in reducing gingivitis in people who are undergoing fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.CONCLUSIONS: No conclusions can be drawn on the comparative effectiveness of powered toothbrushes in reducing gingivitis in clinical orthodontic practice.

Singly spliced RNAs, harboring the Rev-responsible element, and fully spliced viral RNAs, which do not contain this motif, are enriched in virions to similar levels, even though they are exported from the nucleus by different routes. Deletions of key motifs (SL1 and/or SL3) of the packaging signal of genomic RNA indicate that HIV and host RNAs are encapsidated through independent mechanisms, while genomic and spliced viral RNA compete for the same trans-acting factor due to the presence of the 5' common exon containing the TAR, poly(A) and U5-PBS hairpins. Surprisingly, the RNA dimerization initiation site (DIS/SL1) appears to be the main packaging determinant of genomic RNA, but is not involved in packaging of spliced viral RNAs, suggesting a functional interaction with intronic sequences. Active and selective packaging of host and spliced viral RNAs provide new potential functions to these RNAs in the early stages of the virus life cycle."

In the present study, by using a RT-QPCR and QPCR strategies, we show that spliced viral RNAs are present in infectious particles and consequently participate, along with the unspliced genomic RNA, to some of the early steps of infection such as the reverse transcription step. This work provides the first quantitative data on reverse transcription of the fully spliced viral RNAs, also called the early transcripts, in target cells but also inside virions. The latter results were obtained by measuring the natural endogenous reverse transcription activity directly on intact HIV-1 particles. Our study reveals that spliced HIV RNAs are reverse transcribed as efficiently as the genomic RNA, both in cells and virions. Interestingly, we also show that reverse transcription of spliced RNAs is 56-fold less sensitive to the inhibitor AZT than reverse transcription of the genomic RNA. Therefore, the selection mediated by inhibitors of reverse transcription used to treat patients could lead to increased representativeness of spliced forms of HIV, thus favoring recombination between the HIV DNA species and facilitating HIV recovery."

Although singlet di(amino)carbenes are inert toward dihydrogen, it is shown that more nucleophilic and electrophilic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes can activate H2 under mild conditions, a reaction that has long been known for transition metals. However, in contrast to transition metals that act as electrophiles toward dihydrogen, these carbenes primarily behave as nucleophiles, creating a hydride-like hydrogen, which then attacks the positively polarized carbon center. This nucleophilic behavior allows these carbenes to activate NH3 as well, a difficult task for transition metals because of the formation of Lewis acid-base adducts."

The resulting alkenylaldiminium, -formamidinium, and -amidinium salts can be isolated and fully characterized, including single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Heating solutions of these salts induces ring closure cleanly and regioselectively via formal &quot;exo&quot; addition of the nitrogen-hydrogen bond to the pendent carbon-carbon double bond, affording the corresponding cyclic aldiminium, dihydroisoquinolinium, and imidazolinium salts. Of special interest, novel 4,4-disubstituted imidazolinium salts are accessible via this synthetic route. Similarly, addition of phosgene to alkenyl ureas and alkenyl amides, followed by gentle heating, cleanly affords C-chloro imidazolinium, and cyclic C-chloro iminium salts, respectively. Treatment of the latter with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium allows for the preparation of the first transition-metal complex bearing a cyclic arylaminocarbene as ligand. Deuterium labeling experiments suggest that the mechanism of the hydroiminiumation and -amidiniumation reactions involves an intramolecular proton transfer to the double bond in the rate-determining step.

Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, we studied the role that factors known or occurring at various times during gestation or delivery play in in utero and intrapartum transmission.RESULTS: Variables independently associated with in utero transmission were HIV-1 load &gt;35,000 copies/mL (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.2) and delayed initiation of maternal zidovudine prophylaxis until &gt;31.4 weeks gestation (AOR, 3.0). Variables associated with intrapartum transmission were HIV-1 load &gt;10,000 copies/mL (AOR, 3.8 for 10,000-35,000 copies/mL and 7.1 for &gt;35,000 copies/mL), induction of labor (AOR, 2.6), and premature labor with tocolysis (AOR, 15.1).CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of very high HIV-1 load, risk factors for in utero transmission were different from those for intrapartum transmission. Optimal prophylactic interventions must address each of the major risk factors, with appropriate timing."

The invasion cascade comprises cell attachment to extracellular matrix components or basement membrane, degradation of basement membrane by proteolytic enzymes and migration of cells through the modified matrix. In the present study, we investigated the effect of phenolics extracted from virgin olive oil (OVP) and its main constituents: hydroxytyrosol (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol), tyrosol (p-hydroxyphenylethanol), pinoresinol and caffeic acid. The effects of these phenolics were tested on the invasion of HT115 human colon carcinoma cells in a Matrigel invasion assay. OVP and its compounds showed different dose-related anti-invasive effects. At 25 microg/ml OVP and equivalent doses of individual compounds, significant anti-invasive effects were seen in the range of 45-55% of control. Importantly, OVP, but not the isolated phenolics, significantly reduced total cell number in the Matrigel invasion assay. There were no significant effects shown on cell viability, indicating the reduction of cell number in the Matrigel invasion assay was not due to cytotoxicity. There were also no significant effects on cell attachment to plastic substrate, indicating the importance of extracellular matrix in modulating the anti-invasive effects of OVP. In conclusion, the results from this study indicate that phenols from virgin olive oil have the ability to inhibit invasion of colon cancer cells and the effects may be mediated at different levels of the invasion cascade."

Creatine itself is known to protect cells from stress-induced injury. By using an siRNA approach to silence the CK isoenzymes in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells, expressing low levels of cytoplasmic CK and high levels of mitochondrial CK, as well as HeLa cancer cells, expressing high levels of cytoplasmic CK and low levels of mitochondrial CK, we successfully lowered the respective CK expression levels and studied the effects of either abolishing cytosolic brain-type BB-CK or ubiquitous mitochondrial uMi-CK in these cells. In both cell lines, targeting the dominant CK isoform by the respective siRNAs had the strongest effect on overall CK activity. However, irrespective of the expression level in both cell lines, inhibition of the mitochondrial CK isoform generally caused the strongest decline in cell viability and cell proliferation. These findings are congruent with electron microscopic data showing substantial alteration of mitochondrial morphology as well as mitochondrial membrane topology after targeting uMi-CK in both cell lines. Only for the rate of apoptosis, it was the least expressed CK present in each of the cell lines whose inhibition led to the highest proportion of apoptotic cells, i.e., downregulation of uMi-CK in case of HeLaS3 and BB-CK in case of HaCaT cells. We conclude from these data that a major phenotype is linked to reduction of mitochondrial CK alone or in combination with cytosolic CK, and that this effect is independent of the relative expression levels of Mi-CK in the cell type considered. The mitochondrial CK isoform appears to play the most crucial role in maintaining cell viability by stabilizing contact sites between inner and outer mitochondrial membranes and maintaining local metabolite channeling, thus avoiding transition pore opening which eventually results in activation of caspase cell-death pathways."

The disproportionate number of complications suffered by OAAW with diabetes may be due in part to uncertainty about how to manage diabetes and prevent or manage complications. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of an individualized psychoeducational diabetes uncertainty management intervention (DM-UMI) directed at managing diabetes-related uncertainties and delivered by a nurse via telephone to OAAW.METHODS: Sixty-eight participants with diabetes were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. Participants in the experimental group received the DM-UMI, which was delivered for four weeks. The DM-UMI was composed of four strategies (intervention variables): improving diabetes knowledge, patient-provider communication, problem-solving and cognitive reframing, which were expected to reduce diabetes-related uncertainty (outcome variable). The control group received their usual care. Measurement occurred at two time points for all participants: at Time 1: baseline and at Time 2: 6 weeks post baseline.RESULTS: Despite improvement in all intervention variables only problem-solving (P &lt; .001) was significantly related to decrease in uncertainty (P = .01).CONCLUSION: The study suggests that teaching problem-solving skills and assisting OAAW to apply these skills, via an individualized telephone intervention, may reduce ambiguities about diabetes care."

SD' RNA results from alternative splicing of FL RNA. It is reverse-transcribed, and its DNA copy, integrated into the host genome, constitutes a splice donor-associated retroelement. FL and SD' RNAs share a common 5'-UTR that includes the packaging/dimerization signal (Psi). To investigate whether the mechanism of copackaging of these two RNAs involves RNA heterodimerization, we examined the spontaneous dimerization capacity of the two RNAs as large synthetic RNAs transcribed in vitro. We showed that SD' RNA not only formed homodimers with similar efficiency as the FL RNA, but that FL and SD' RNAs also formed FL/SD' heterodimers via Psi sequences. Comparison of the thermostabilities determined for these different dimeric species and competition experiments with Psi RNA fragments indicate the recruitment of similar dimer-linkage interactions within the Psi region. To validate these results, the dimeric state of the SD' RNA was analyzed in MLV particles. RNA capture assays performed with the FL RNA as bait revealed that SD', and not the host packageable U6 or 7SL RNAs, was associated with the FL RNA in virions. Heterodimerization of SD' RNA with FL RNA may argue for the recent concept of a nuclear dimerization at or near the site of transcription and raises the new hypothesis of RNA dimerization during splicing. Furthermore, FL/SD' heterodimerization may have leukemogenic consequences by influencing the pool of genomic dimers that will undergo recombinogenic template switching by reverse transcriptase."

Imaging included the aorta and the carotid, renal, and lower limb arteries to the ankle, but not the coronary arteries. Subjects with myocardial infarction (MI) scars at late-enhancement MR imaging were classified as having RMI (n=11) (those with a diagnosis of MI at the hospital) or UMI (n=49) (those without a diagnosis of MI at the hospital). The presence of 50% or higher luminal narrowing in any vessel at whole-body MR angiography was considered to represent significant atherosclerosis. Intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery was measured with ultrasonography. C-reactive protein level was measured, and coronary heart disease risk was estimated. Observers were blinded to any previous results. The chi2 test, analysis of variance, and Bonferroni correction were used for statistical analyses.RESULTS: None of the measured parameters differed significantly between the group without MI scars and the UMI group, but parameters were significantly increased in the RMI group (P&lt;.05) compared with those in the group without MI scars. Forty-two of 49 UMIs and nine of 11 RMIs were located within inferolateral segments of the left ventricle.CONCLUSION: MR imaging-detected UMIs might have a different pathogenesis from that of RMIs or may have the same pathogenesis but may manifest at an earlier stage."

When basic phosphine fragments are used, the ylides can be isolated; otherwise they fragment into the carbene and phosphine. This method is limited to the preparation of transient carbenes, owing to the unavailability of sterically hindered dications, and consequently of phosphorus ylides with bulky carbon substituents. This difficulty is overcome by the addition of 2,4-di-tert-butyl-ortho-quinone to readily available C-amino phosphaalkenes at low temperature.

It has survived largely due to the concerted efforts of a few villagers and is now carried on mainly by middle-aged and older women. Almost every elderly woman in Ogimi has at least some experience in basho-fu weaving, and most still participate in some stage of the production process. Aged women form the bulk of the core group of workers that carries out the labor-intensive u-umi (spooling) and u-biki (fiber-cleaning) activities. Without this core group of elderly women, the whole production process would be in jeopardy. Thus, older women in Ogimi play a key role as valued workers in maintaining the basho-fu production process. In exchange for their continued participation, these elderly women receive symbolic capital in the form of respect and honors, as well as wages for their labor. We argue that participating in traditional basho-fu weaving helps these older women maintain an active engagement with life as healthy and productive members of society, a role that has been culturally sanctioned and has taken on moral import in Japan's rapidly aging society.

UMI (n = 81) was diagnosed if ECG-MI criteria were met without previous documented myocardial infarction. Functional Status was assessed by the Goldman Specific Activity Scale.RESULTS: UMI subjects had an increased prevalence of abnormal functional status compared to no MI controls (22% vs 11%, P &lt; 0.05). This association was independent of sex, obesity, smoking, diabetes, and pulmonary disease. It became insignificant after stratifying for echocardiographic abnormalities. Compared to no MI controls, UMI subjects with impaired functional status had a higher mortality hazard ratio (HR 7.2; P&lt;0.0001) than those without impaired functional status (HR 2.7; P = 0.02).

UMI Proquest Digital Dissertations, ISI Web of Science, and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts were also searched. All searches used the terms pressure ulcer, pressure sore, decubitus, bedsore, prevention, prophylactic, reduction, randomized, and clinical trials. Bibliographies of identified articles were further reviewed.DATA SYNTHESIS: Fifty-nine RCTs were selected. Interventions assessed in these studies were grouped into 3 categories, ie, those addressing impairments in mobility, nutrition, or skin health. Methodological quality for the RCTs was variable and generally suboptimal. Effective strategies that addressed impaired mobility included the use of support surfaces, mattress overlays on operating tables, and specialized foam and specialized sheepskin overlays. While repositioning is a mainstay in most pressure ulcer prevention protocols, there is insufficient evidence to recommend specific turning regimens for patients with impaired mobility. In patients with nutritional impairments, dietary supplements may be beneficial. The incremental benefit of specific topical agents over simple moisturizers for patients with impaired skin health is unclear.CONCLUSIONS: Given current evidence, using support surfaces, repositioning the patient, optimizing nutritional status, and moisturizing sacral skin are appropriate strategies to prevent pressure ulcers. Although a number of RCTs have evaluated preventive strategies for pressure ulcers, many of them had important methodological limitations. There is a need for well-designed RCTs that follow standard criteria for reporting nonpharmacological interventions and that provide data on cost-effectiveness for these interventions."

Ejection fraction was significantly lower and LV mass significantly larger in the subjects with UMI or RMI than in those without MI scars.CONCLUSIONS: Unrecognized MI detected with MRI was more frequent than expected in 70-year-old subjects. The subjects displaying these UMIs may represent a previously unknown potential risk group for future cardiovascular events."

The midline is similar to the vertebrate floor plate, in that it plays an essential role in cell fate determination in the lateral CNS and also, later, in axon pathfinding. Despite the importance of the midline, the specification of midline cell fates is still not well understood. Here, we show that most midline cells are determined not at the precursor cell stage, but as daughter cells. After the precursors divide, a combination of repression by Wingless and activation by Hedgehog induces expression of the proneural gene lethal of scute in the most anterior midline daughter cells of the neighbouring posterior segment. Hedgehog and Lethal of scute activate Engrailed in these anterior cells. Engrailed-positive midline cells develop into ventral unpaired median (VUM) neurons and the median neuroblast (MNB). Engrailed-negative midline cells develop into unpaired median interneurons (UMI), MP1 interneurons and midline glia."

Endocrine disruption is mainly caused by the interference of chemicals at the level of steroid receptors: it is now well known that many of these chemicals can display estrogenic effects and/or anti-androgenic effects, but much less is known about the interaction of these compounds with other steroid receptors. Vinclozolin, a dicarboximide fungicide, like its primary metabolites 2-[[(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-carbamoyl]oxy]-2-methyl-3-butenoic acid (M1), and 3',5'-dichloro-2-hydroxy-2-methylbut-3-enanilide (M2), is known to bind androgen receptor (AR). Although vinclozolin and its metabolites were characterized as anti-androgens, relatively little is known about their effects on the function of the progesterone (PR), glucocorticoid (GR), mineralocorticoid (MR) or estrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta). Objectives of the study were to determine the ability of vinclozolin and its two primary metabolites to activate AR, PR, GR, MR and ER. For this purpose, we used reporter cell lines bearing luciferase gene under the control of wild type or chimeric Gal4 fusion AR, PR, GR, MR or ERs. We confirmed that all three were antagonists for AR, whereas only M2 was found a partial agonist. Interestingly, M2 was also a PR, GR and MR antagonist (MR&gt;PR&gt;GR) while vinclozolin was an MR and PR antagonist. Vinclozolin, M1 and M2 were agonists for both ERs with a lower affinity for ERbeta. Although the potencies of the fungicide and its metabolites are low when compared to natural ligands, their ability to act via more than one mechanism and the potential for additive or synergistic effect must be taken into consideration in the risk assessment process."

The growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR-1a) is a G-protein coupled receptor, involved in the biological actions of ghrelin by triggering inositol phosphates and calcium intracellular second messengers. It has also been reported that ghrelin could activate the 44- and 42-kDa extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) in different cell lines, but it is not clear whether this regulation is GHSR-1a dependent or not. 2. To provide direct evidence for the coupling of GHSR-1a to ERK1/2 activation, this pathway has been studied in a heterologous expression system. 3. Thus, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells we showed that ghrelin induced, via the human GHSR-1a, a transient and dose-dependent activation of ERK1/2 leading to activation of the transcriptional factor Elk1. 4. We then investigated the precise mechanisms involved in GHSR-1a-mediated ERK1/2 activation using various specific inhibitors and dominant-negative mutants and found that internalization of GHSR-1a was not necessary. Our results also indicate that phospholipase C (PLC) was involved in GHSR-1a-mediated ERK1/2 activation, however, pathways like tyrosine kinases, including Src, and phosphoinositide 3-kinases were not found to be involved. GHSR-1a-mediated ERK1/2 activation was abolished both by a general protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, Gö6983, and by PKC depletion using overnight pretreatment with phorbol ester. Moreover, the calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, and the inhibitor of conventional PKCs, Gö6976, had no effect on the GHSR-1a-mediated ERK1/2 activation, suggesting the involvement of novel PKC isoforms (epsilon, delta), but not conventional or atypical PKCs. Further analyses suggest that PKCepsilon is required for the activation of ERK1/2. 5. Taken together, these data suggest that ghrelin, through GHSR-1a, activates the Elk1 transcriptional factor and ERK1/2 by a PLC- and PKCepsilon-dependent pathway."

Current models of retroviral particle assembly describe the recruitment of the host vacuolar protein sorting machinery to the cell surface to induce the budding of new particles. Previous fluorescence microscopy study reported the vesicular traffic of the MLV components (Gag, Env and RNA). Here, electron microscopy (EM) associated with immunolabeling approaches were used to go deeply into the assembly of the &quot;prototypic&quot; MLV in chronically infected NIH3T3 cells.RESULTS: Beside the virus budding events seen at the cell surface of infected cells, we observed that intracellular budding events could also occur inside the intracellular vacuoles in which many VLPs accumulated. EM in situ hybridization and immunolabeling analyses confirmed that these latter were MLV particles. Similar intracellular particles were detected in cells expressing MLV Gag alone. Compartments containing the MLV particles were identified as late endosomes using Lamp1 endosomal/lysosomal marker and BSA-gold pulse-chase experiments. In addition, infectious activity was detected in lysates of infected cells.CONCLUSION: Altogether, our results showed that assembly of MLV could occur in part in intracellular compartments of infected murine cells and participate in the production of infectious viruses. These observations suggested that MLV budding could present similarities with the particular intracellular budding of HIV in infected macrophages."

Participants were 4,301 men and 6,780 women in a multi-center community-based prospective study, and data of the baseline survey was collected between 1992 and 1995. The participants were followed up until December 31, 2002 (the average follow-up period was 9.17 years). Early termination of education was associated with an increased risk of mortality from all causes for both men and women. This tendency was more prominent in women aged 59 and younger (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-12.34), after adjusting for confounding factors using the Cox proportional hazard models. Similar trends were shown for men; specifically, cardiovascular disease mortality for all men was increased by early termination of education (HR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.17-7.52) compared to later termination. For employment status, unemployed men showed increased mortality from all causes compared to white-collar workers (HR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.00-2.28). Female farmers and forestry workers showed reduced mortality from all causes compared to white-collar workers (HR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33-0.93). Male farmers and forestry workers also showed reduced mortality from cardiovascular diseases compared to white-collar workers (HR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.14-0.82).

This unawareness might have a multifactorial etiology, including impairment of cognitive domains and psychiatric symptoms. We conducted this study to determine the factors underlying unawareness of memory impairment (UMI) in patients with AD. In 103 patients with mild AD, the UMI was quantified as the difference between the patient's self-rating and the rating of the patient's caregiver on a standardized memory questionnaire system, the Everyday Memory Checklist. We then examined the relationships between UMI and memory, attention, language, visuospatial/constructive perception, frontal lobe function, and psychiatric symptoms. UMI was positively associated with memory impairment and delusions when effects of age, sex, and education were partialled out, suggesting that these symptoms are involved in the formation of UMI in the patients. Thus, existing treatments for memory impairment and delusions may be beneficial for increasing the awareness of mild AD patients of their cognitive impairment."

Reversibility upon dilution was also investigated. These surfaces were three polymeric microfiltration membranes, presenting close Lifshitz-van der Waals components of their surface tension but differing in their surface polar properties. The electron-donor character of the surface was of primary importance for the adsorption of nongalloylated monomers. Increasing the number of phenolic rings above two (galloylated monomers and procyanidins) sharply enhanced flavan-3-ol affinity for surfaces whatever their polarity. However, maximum adsorbed amounts were always much higher on the most polar material. The general trend was a partial reversibility with monomers, whereas an irreversible process was evidenced from the lowest molecular weight tannin fractions. This indicated the formation of multiple bonds with surfaces, in accordance with the high affinity type isotherms. The whole results indicated very different mechanisms in the buildup of the adsorbed layers when the surface electron-donor character varied."

This differential trans-activation is specific, since it was not observed for either the other overexpressed kinases (MEK, PKA) or for other transcription factors (ATF2, ELK-1, CREB). This differential behaviour was also detected in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell-line naturally producing high levels of endogenous MEKK1. This differential behaviour between the two receptors on the MEKK1-induced c-Jun trans-activation was independent of the activation state of JNK, of the phosphorylation level of c-Jun and of its ability to bind its specific DNA responsive elements. Two amino acids (Val43 and Phe50 in the mouse cholecystokinin 1 receptor, replaced by Leu43 and Ileu50 in the rat cholecystokinin 1 receptor) localized in the first transmembrane domain were found to play a crucial role in this differential behaviour. MEKK1 probably activates a transcriptional partner of c-Jun whose activity is maintained or increased in the presence of the rat cholecystokinin 1 receptor but repressed in the presence of the mouse cholecystokinin 1 receptor."

We demonstrate that only one cation position exists at this site. This result is also confirmed by a molecular electrostatic potential analysis. We show that local properties at site II, as well as the global properties of the solid (frontier orbitals), do not depend on the Al and cation distribution and only slightly on the cocation nature. Taking into account the present results and well-known experimental data, we propose that specific catalytic behaviors are correlated with local response properties, such as the local acid strength or, in other reactions, specific local architecture or confinement."

Unrecognized myocardial infarctions (n = 81) were diagnosed if ECG-based myocardial infarction (MI) criteria were met without the history of a documented recognized MI.RESULTS: In UMI versus no MI controls, the prevalence (%) of dyspnea on exertion (49 vs 29), orthopnea (6 vs 4), palpitations (20 vs 15), and history of fluid overload (6 vs 1) was significantly higher (P &lt; .05). The associations of exertional dyspnea and history of fluid overload with UMI were independent of age, sex, and pulmonary disease but had a significant reduction in their magnitude after adjusting for global dysfunction (diastolic or systolic dysfunction). All the 4 symptoms were associated with increased risk of mortality (hazard ratios ranging from 2.3 to 9.1, P &lt; .0001), which was meaningfully attenuated by adjusting for ECG-UMI status. Global ventricular dysfunction had a more significant impact on this association than regional ventricular dysfunction (wall motion abnormalities).CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of mortality associated with symptoms is at least in part mediated via ECG-UMI. Structural abnormalities of global dysfunction play a greater role in mediating this risk than regional dysfunction, challenging the current clinical practice of calling an ECG-based MI false positive in symptomatic adults in the absence of wall motion abnormalities."
"16471968";"UMI";"UMI";"Inorganic chemistry";0;2006;"Solvent tuning of the substitution behavior of a seven-coordinate iron(III) complex.";"A detailed kinetic study of the substitution behavior of the seven-coordinate [Fe(dapsox)(L)2]ClO4 complex (H(2)dapsox = 2,6-diacetylpyridine-bis(semioxamazide), L = solvent or its deprotonated form) with thiocyanate as a function of the thiocyanate concentration, temperature, and pressure was undertaken in protic (EtOH and acidified EtOH and MeOH) and aprotic (DMSO) organic solvents. The lability and substitution mechanism depend strongly on the selected solvent (i.e., on solvolytic and protolytic processes). In the case of alcoholic solutions, substitution of both solvent molecules by thiocyanate could be observed, whereas in DMSO only one substitution step occurred. For both substitution steps, [Fe(dapsox)(L)2]ClO4 shows similar mechanistic behavior in methanol and ethanol, which is best reflected by the values of the activation volumes (MeOH DeltaV(I) = +15.0 +/- 0.3 cm(3) mol(-1), DeltaV(II) = +12.0 +/- 0.2 cm(3) mol(-1); EtOH DeltaV(I) = +15.8 +/- 0.7 cm(3) mol(-1), DeltaV(II) = +11.1 +/- 0.5 cm(3) mol(-1)). On the basis of the reported activation parameters, a dissociative (D) mechanism for the first substitution step and a D or dissociative interchange (I(d)) mechanism for the second substitution step are suggested for the reaction in MeOH and EtOH. This is consistent with the predominant existence of alcoxo [Fe(dapsox)(ROH)(OR)] species in alcoholic solutions. In comparison, the activation parameters for the substitution of the aqua-hydroxo [Fe(dapsox)(H2O)(OH)] complex by thiocyanate at pH 5.1 in MES were determined to be DeltaH = 72 +/- 3 kJ mol(-1), DeltaS = +38 +/- 11 J K(-1) mol(-1), and DeltaV = -3.0 +/- 0.1 cm(3) mol(-1), and the operation of a dissociative interchange mechanism was suggested, taking the effect of pressure on the employed buffer into account. The addition of triflic acid to the alcoholic solutions ([HOTf] = 10(-3) and 10(-2) M to MeOH and EtOH, respectively) resulted in a drastic changeover in mechanism for the first substitution step, for which an associative interchange (Ia) mechanism is suggested, on the basis of the activation parameters obtained for both the forward and reverse reactions and the corresponding volume profile. The second substitution step remained to proceed through an I(d) or D mechanism (acidified MeOH DeltaV(II) = +9.2 +/- 0.2 cm(3) mol(-1); acidified EtOH DeltaV(II) = +10.2 +/- 0.2 cm(3) mol(-1)). The first substitution reaction in DMSO was found to be slowed by several orders of magnitude and to follow an associative interchange mechanism (DeltaS = -50 +/- 9 J K(-1) mol(-1), DeltaV(I) = -1.0 +/- 0.5 cm(3) mol(-1)), making DMSO a suitable solvent for monitoring substitution processes that are extremely fast in aqueous solution."

A differential display screen was performed to gain insight into transcriptional changes of the host response. Some of the genes strongly up-regulated in tumors showed a pronounced developmental expression pattern with decreasing transcript levels from basal to apical shoot segments, suggesting that U. maydis has the capacity to extend the undifferentiated state of maize plants. Differentially expressed genes implicated in secondary metabolism were Bx1, involved in biosynthesis of the cyclic hydroxamic acid 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one, and a novel putative sesquiterpene cyclase gene U. maydis induced (Umi)2. Together with the up-regulation of Umi11 encoding a cyclotide-like protein this suggests a nonconventional induction of plant defenses. Explicitly, U. maydis was resistant to 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one but susceptible to its benzoxazolinone derivative 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone. Infection studies of isolated leaves with U. maydis and Colletotrichum graminicola provided evidence for coregulation of Umi2 and PR-1 gene expression, with mRNA levels strongly determined by the extent of fungal colonization within tissue. However, in contrast to Umi2, transcript levels of PR-1 remained low in plants infected with wild-type U. maydis but were 8-fold elevated upon infection with an U. maydis mutant strongly attenuated in pathogenic development. This suggests that U. maydis colonization in planta suppresses a classical defense response. Furthermore, comparative expression analysis uncovered distinct transcriptional programs operating in the host in response to fungal infection and subsequent tumor formation."

The prevalence rates of depression ranged from 1.6 to 50%. In eight articles, a diagnostic test was applied, in the rest of the studies, questionnaires were used. The prevalence of depression was highest in those using patient-completed questionnaires. A significant positive association was shown between depression and postmyocardial infarction mortality in 15 studies, a non-significant association in 14, and in two articles, this was not reported. In articles with data collection starting after 1994, a non-significant relation tended to be reported. The studies were generally not of acceptable quality. They lacked sufficient power to show differences in stated end points between groups. Application of non-validated instruments caused large differences in prevalence rates of depression. Future studies should include a minimum of 1,000 patients, use a validated instrument, re-examine the patients, and describe participants and non-participants in detail."

Using a pharmacological approach, we report for the first time that compounds SB202190 and SB203580 were able to directly and selectively interact with a G-protein-coupled receptor, namely the cholecystokinin receptor subtype CCK1, but not with the CCK2 receptor. We demonstrated that these compounds were non-competitive antagonists of the CCK1 receptor at concentrations typically used to inhibit protein kinases. By chimeric construction of the CCK2 receptor, we determined the involvement of two CCK1 receptor intracellular loops in the binding of SB202190 and SB203580. We also showed that two CCK antagonists, L364,718 and L365,260, were able to regulate p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity. Using a reporter gene strategy and immunoblotting experiments, we demonstrated that both CCK antagonists inhibited selectively the enzymatic activity of p38 MAP kinase. Kinase assays suggested that this inhibition resulted from a direct interaction with both CCK antagonists. Molecular modeling simulations suggested that this interaction occurs in the ATP binding pocket of p38 MAP kinase. These results suggest that SB202190 and SB203580 bind to the CCK1 receptor and, as such, these compounds should be used with caution in models that express this receptor. We also found that L364,718 and L365,260, two CCK receptor antagonists, directly interacted with p38 MAP kinase and inhibited its activity. These findings suggest that the CCK1 receptor shares structural analogies with the p38 MAP kinase ATP binding site. They open the way to potential design of either a new family of MAP kinase inhibitors from CCK1 receptor ligand structures or new CCK1 receptor ligands based on p38 MAP kinase inhibitor structures."

We studied a random community cohort of 2,042 adults who were &gt; or =45 years of age in a cross-sectional setting in Olmsted County, Minnesota. RMI was diagnosed by review of medical records and UMI was diagnosed if the electrocardiogram met MI criteria without a previous MI recorded in the medical record. All subjects underwent transthoracic echocardiography. We identified 80 patients who had UMI and 101 who had RMI. In bivariate analyses, a stepwise increase in echocardiographic abnormalities was observed from participants who had no MI to UMI to RMI: respective mean ejection fractions were 63%, 61%, and 55; prevalences in left ventricular enlargement were 13%, 22%, and 52%; mean left ventricular mass indexes were 98, 103, and 118 g/m(2); prevalences in regional wall motion abnormality were 2%, 13%, and 42%; and prevalences in diastolic dysfunction were 25%, 56%, and 65% (p for trend &lt;0.0001 for all comparisons). After adjusting for standard coronary risk factors, patients who had UMI continued to exhibit significant abnormalities in systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and regional wall motion abnormality, although to a lesser extent than patients who had RMI. In conclusion, patients who have UMI manifest structural abnormalities more commonly than do patients who have no MI but less commonly than do those who have RMI. The similar prognosis after UMI and RMI cannot be explained by comparable degrees of ventricular damage."

Six different ECG-MI criteria and two subjective recognized myocardial infarction (RMI) identification criteria, from different published studies, were applied to the same survey ECG. The operating test characteristics of different criteria were compared with the objective criterion standard of a RMI by Gillum criteria.RESULTS: The UMI proportion estimates varied from 32% to 61% due to variation in ECG-MI criteria, while keeping the study population, MI recognition criteria, and ECG constant. Subjective criteria for MI recognition had limited value (positive predictive value of 44-93%) in picking up RMI. Depending on the ECG abnormality used to define MI, ECG reading had widely varying sensitivity (21-37%; P &lt; 0.0001) with consistently high specificity (92-97%) for detection of RMI.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence estimates of UMI vary widely and are strongly dependent on the ECG-MI and MI recognition criteria. Future studies of UMI should explicitly recognize this variation and select the ECG-MI criteria that match their study aims."

Ultrasonic-Measurement-Integrated (UMI) simulation, in which feedback signals from the ultrasonic measurement make the simulation converge to the real blood flow, is a key to solving this problem. However, aliasing in the ultrasonic blood velocity measurement causes UMI simulation to converge to an erroneous result. In this paper, we have investigated the detection and the correction of aliasing in UMI simulation. The artificial force in the feedback of UMI simulation can be used as an index to detect the aliasing. We have proposed two ways for the correction of the aliasing. Correction A, in which measurement velocity is replaced with the computational one at the monitoring point where the aliasing is detected, substantially improves the accuracy of UMI simulation. Correction B, in which measurement velocity is replaced with an estimated Doppler velocity, can provide exactly the same result as that of UMI simulation using the nonaliased standard solution. Although correction B gives the most accurate result, correction A seems more robust and, therefore, a beneficial choice considering the other artifacts in the measurement."

A possible way to obtain such information is integration of numerical simulation and color Doppler ultrasonography in the framework of a flow observer. This methodology, namely, Ultrasonic-Measurement-Integrated (UMI) Simulation, consists of the following processes. At each time step of numerical simulation, the difference between the measurable output signal and the signal indicated by numerical simulation is evaluated. Feedback signals are generated from the difference, and numerical simulation is updated applying the feedback signal to compensate for the difference. This paper deals with a numerical study on the fundamental characteristics of UMI simulation using a simple two-dimensional model problem for the blood flow in an aorta with an aneurysm. The effect of the number of feedback points and the feedback formula are investigated systematically. It is revealed that the result of UMI simulation in the feedback domain rapidly converges to the standard solution, even with usually inevitable incorrect upstream boundary conditions. Finally, an example of UMI simulation with feedback from real color Doppler measurement also shows a good agreement with measurement."

The methodology we use is based on the extraction of the 3D shape of sulci and their separation into subunits called sulcal roots. Seventeen normal brains (male: 11, female: 6, age: 22-60) were systematically analyzed. Additionally, parameters generated by visual observation were recorded. Non-parametric statistics were performed to evaluate the variation of the STs and influence of side, handedness and sex. We found that the 3D architecture of the STs was consistent with our generic model in four sulcal roots and four &quot;plis de passage&quot; (PP) and significant differences between right and left hemispheres. These morphological differences may be related to the language-relevant cortical areas difference and are pertinent for defining the limits of morphometric variability of the STs in &quot;normal humans&quot;."
"15308997";"UMI";"UMI";"American heart journal";11;2004;"Defining unrecognized myocardial infarction: a call for standardized electrocardiographic diagnostic criteria.";"BACKGROUND: Unrecognized myocardial infarctions (UMI) are detected by surveillance electrocardiograms (ECGs). In epidemiologic studies, different sets of ECG criteria have been used to define myocardial infarction, possibly contributing to significant differences in prevalence estimates and risk factor associations. We sought to summarize the rationale behind the various UMI-ECG definitions and to suggest an approach to develop uniform criteria.METHODS: A comprehensive review of relevant publications from 1966 to 2002 was conducted.RESULTS: Out of 14 major studies, the occurrence of UMI as a proportion of all infarctions varied from 4% to 44%, with markedly varying ECG criteria. No study directly addressed the rationale behind selection of ECG criteria. Computerized ECG analysis appears superior to visual reading due to better reliability, speed and cost while maintaining a similar predictive validity. Criteria requiring only major Q waves have the highest specificity for ECG-MI and for prediction validity for future coronary heart disease in middle-aged white men. The addition of minor Q waves and ST-T abnormalities improves predictive validity in middle-aged women and elderly men. Minor Q waves can have their diagnostic accuracy improved by several strategies, including use of ST-T wave changes, Washington Code, vector cardiogram, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-ECG criteria, and serial ECG analysis.CONCLUSION: Currently the most cost-effective and valid method for detecting UMI in epidemiologic studies appears to be computerized ECG analysis using major Q waves in middle-aged white men. Issues needing further research include morphologic validation of ECG-UMI criteria and the influence of age, sex, and race on ECG-MI criteria."

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is now used as a first-line drug for asymptomatic PBC (aPBC) because it is reported that UDCA decreases mortality and prolongs the time of liver transplantation. However, only 20-30% of patients respond fully to UDCA. Recently, lipoprotein-lowering agents have been found to be effective for PBC. The aim of this study was to examine the safety and efficacy of fenofibrate, a member of the fibrate class of hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory agent via peroxysome proliferatory-activated receptor alpha, in patients with aPBC.METHODS: Fenofibrate was administered for twelve weeks in nine patients with aPBC who failed to respond to UDCA. UDCA was used along with fenofibrate during the study. The data from aPBC patients were analyzed to assess the biochemical effect of fenofibrate during the study.RESULTS: The serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (285+/-114.8 IU/L) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) (255.8+/-85.9 mg/dl) significantly decreased to 186.9+/-76.2 IU/L and 192.9+/-67.5 mg/dL respectively, after fenofibrate treatment in patients with aPBC (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, the titer of antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) also decreased in 4 of 9 patients with aPBC. No adverse reactions were observed in any patients.CONCLUSION: Fenofibrate appears to be significantly effective in treating patients with aPBC who respond incompletely to UDCA alone. Although the mechanism of fenofibrate on aPBC has not yet been fully clarified, combination therapy using fenofibrate and UDCA might be related to the anti-immunological effects, such as the suppression of AMA production as well as its anti-inflammatory effect."

We explored the subcellular mechanisms leading to decreased force development in trabeculae from rats with a myocardial infarction. We defined CHF according to clinical and pathological criteria and compared properties of trabeculae from animals with CHF (cMI) to those of animals with a myocardial scar but without evidence of CHF (uMI), and sham-operated animals. The new findings of this study on properties of cMI trabeculae are that (1) maximal twitch force following post-extrasystolic potentiation is unchanged; (2) the sensitivity of cMI trabeculae to [Ca(2+)](o) is increased; (3) spontaneous diastolic sarcomere length (SL) fluctuations (SA) are increased in cMI at all levels of SR Ca(2+) loading; and (4) SA is accompanied by a proportional reduction of F(max). The results suggest that the probability of spontaneous diastolic opening of SR Ca(2+) channels is increased in CHF. These data provide the basis for a novel mechanism underlying systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as arrhythmias in hearts in CHF. If SA proves to be a component of myocardial dysfunction in human CHF, our thinking about therapy of the patient with CHF may be profoundly changed."

Remarkably, this SD' site was also found to be utilized for production of oncogenic gag-myb fusion RNA in 100% of murine-induced myeloid leukemia (MML) in pristane-treated BALB/c mice. Therefore, we investigated the influence of silent mutations of SD' in this model. Although there was no decrease in the overall incidence of disease, there was a decrease in the incidence of myeloid leukemia with a concomitant increase in lymphoid leukemia. Importantly, there was a complete lack of myeloid tumors associated with 5' insertional mutagenic activation of c-myb, suggesting the specific requirement of the SD' site in this mechanism."

The well-known inhibition by excess substrate is often accompanied by an unexpectedly high activity at low substrate concentrations. It appears that these peculiarities are the consequence of an unusual architecture of the active site, which conducts the substrate molecule over many stages before it is cleaved and released. Structural and kinetic data also suggest that two substrate molecules can attach at the same time to the free, as well as to the acetylated, enzyme. We present a procedure which provides an unbiased framework for mathematical modelling of such complex reaction mechanisms. It is based on regression analysis of a rational polynomial using classical initial rate data. The determination of polynomial degree reveals the number of independent parameters that can be evaluated from the available information. Once determined, these parameters can substantially facilitate the construction and evaluation of a kinetic model reflecting the expected molecular events in an enzymic reaction. We also present practical suggestions for testing the postulated kinetic model, using an original thermodynamic approach and an isolated effect in a specifically mutated enzyme."

Following T-cell stimulation, PKCtheta translocates to the center of the immunological synapse where it co-localizes with the T-cell receptor (TCR). PKCtheta is required for the activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), which regulate the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a necessary step for the deployment of T-cell effector functions. By using primary murine T lymphocytes we have investigated regulatory phosphorylation events on PKCtheta which may impinge on its activity or its interaction with other signaling mediators. Here, we describe a TCR stimulation-induced Ser/Thr phosphorylation event on PKCtheta that takes place simultaneously with its recruitment to cellular membranes and which can be detected as an electrophoretic mobility shift. By analyzing Ser and Thr point mutants, we find that phosphorylation of Ser-695 in the hydrophobic motif is one, but not the only residue involved in the mobility shift. Interestingly, Ser-695 appears to be required to trigger further phosphorylation events at adjacent Thr-692 and Thr-703 residues, which also participate in the mobility shift. We show that phosphorylation at these residues is not due to auto-phosphorylation, but requires instead Src family kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activities. We further show that activation-induced phosphorylation of PKCtheta correlates with its function but not with its kinase activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of PKCtheta plays a role in its interaction with upstream or downstream effectors."

The angiotensin II receptor blocker, Losartan, has been demonstrated to improve cardiac function and long-term survival after myocardial infarction. In this study we have investigated whether chronic Losartan treatment affects myosin isoform composition in the hearts of rats following a myocardial infarction. Rats were subjected to coronary artery ligation and received either Losartan (1 g/L) in the drinking water or water only. Four months after myocardial infarction, rats were classified as having either congestive heart failure (cMI) or uncomplicated myocardial infarction (uMI) based on their lung weight to body weight ratio (LW/BW). Compared with sham operated rats, uMI rats showed a 68.5% increase in the relative contribution of V3 and a 33.7% decrease in the relative contribution of V1 (p &lt; 0.05). Untreated cMI showed 39.7% more V3 and 38.2% less V1 when compared with untreated uMI (p &lt; 0.05). Losartan treatment after myocardial infarction reduced the incidence of cMI from 30.4 to 4.5% and scar size from 1.52 +/- 0.07 to 0.94 +/- 0.11 cm2 respectively. The percentage of V1 in Losartan treated uMI (LuMI) was 25.2% higher than the percentage of V1 in untreated uMI (p &lt; 0.05), whereas the percentage of V3 in LuMI was 24.2% lower than that in untreated uMI (p &lt; 0.05). A positive correlation of V3 myosin and scar area was observed. Our study suggests that expression of V3 myosin in the left ventricle is associated with scar size and the progress of hemodynamic changes after myocardial infarction. Losartan treatment reduces scar size and wall stress of the heart after the infarct, and therefore inhibits the signals shifting myosin isoform expression from V1 to V3 after a myocardial infarction."

Infants fed breast milk (n=25) constituted a reference group (BM group). Anthropometric and fatty acid parameters (plasma phospholipids, cholesterol esters, triglycerides and red blood cell phosphatidylethanolamine, PL, CE, TG, RBC-PE, respectively) were obtained after 2 days (D2) and 15 days (D15) of enteral feeding and at the 37th week (W37) of post-conception age and 1 month later (W37+30) in the DHA group. Mean DHA intake ranged between 16.5+/-1.6 and 17.9+/-2.9 mg/kg/day between D2 and W37+30.RESULTS: At W37, infant weights, heights, and head circumferences were similar in DHA and BM groups. PL DHA was maintained in the DHA group at the same level as in the BM group and the same for DHA in PE at W37. In RBC-PE and at W37, AA status was the same in both groups. In PL, AA levels remained very stable throughout the study; however, in the DHA group AA levels in PL remained in the range observed with standard formulas.CONCLUSION: The combined 18:3 n-3 and DHA supplementation of infant formula with DHA/EPA ratio 5/l is compatible with growth and n-3 fatty acid metabolism similar to that of preterm infants fed human milk."

The objective of this study was to determine the ACCase mutation responsible for herbicide resistance in a well-studied wild oat biotype (UMI). A 2039-bp region encompassing the carboxybiotin and acetyl-CoA binding domains of multifunctional plastidic ACCase was analyzed. DNA sequences representing three plastidic ACCase gene loci were isolated from both the resistant UMI and a herbicide-susceptible biotype, consistent with the hexaploid nature of wild oat. Only one nonsynonymous point mutation was found among the resistant wild oat sequences, inferring an isoleucine to leucine substitution. The position of this substitution corresponds to residue 1769 of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plastidic ACCase (GenBank accession No. AF029895). Analysis of an F2 population derived from a cross between a herbicide-resistant and a susceptible biotype confirmed co-segregation of herbicide resistance with the mutated ACCase. We conclude that the isoleucine to leucine mutation is responsible for herbicide resistance in UMI wild oat based on a comparison of the substitution site across species and ACCase types. While isoleucine is conserved among plastidic ACCases of herbicide-susceptible grasses, leucine is found in plastidic and cytosolic forms of multifunctional herbicide-resistant ACCase."

When hemodialyzers were switched back from vitamin E bonded to the original regular ones, Acr levels increased to nearly their initial levels after 3 months (p &lt;.001), compared with the 6 month time point.

These compounds also bind with a low affinity to binding sites whose pharmacological profiles are different from that of NMDARs. With the intention to develop new strategies of neuroprotection, we found it mandatory to investigate whether 1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine (TCP) and gacyclidine low-affinity sites are similar. The effects of several drugs selective for either NMDARs or the [(3)H]TCP low-affinity site (or PCP(3) site) on (+), (-)[(3)H]GK11 and [(3)H]TCP specific binding were investigated. Competition experiments on cerebellum homogenates revealed substantial differences between the pharmacological profiles of the PCP(3) site and that of gacyclidine's enantiomers low-affinity sites. Under experimental conditions preventing the interaction of the radioligands with NMDARs, the autoradiographic study showed, however, that the distributions of both [(3)H]TCP and (-)[(3)H]GK11 specific binding were similar. The specific labelling was low and uniform in telencephalic structures, whereas in the cerebellum it was higher in the molecular than in the granular layer. Finally, the analysis of competition experiments performed on tissues slices demonstrated that PCP(3) selective ligands were unable to prevent [(3)H]TCP or (-)[(3)H]GK11 binding to &quot;non-NMDA&quot; binding sites. As a whole, our data suggest that: (1) the different pharmacological profiles of [(3)H]TCP and [(3)H]gacyclidine enantiomers on low-affinity sites are due to their selectivity for specific NMDARs subpopulations; (2) the pharmacological isolation of TCP and gacyclidine &quot;non-NMDA&quot; binding sites is the most appropriate way to further study the low-affinity component of their specific binding. Obtaining reliable and specific pharmacological tools for those binding sites is of particular interest, since it is likely that they play a substantial role in the low neurotoxicity, and therefore tolerability, of gacyclidine, a new neuroprotective drug currently evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of brain and spinal cord injuries."

The 68-residue protein p8MTCP1 has been chosen as model for this study. Its solution state consists mainly of three alpha-helices. The two N-terminal helices are strapped in a well-determined alpha-hairpin, whereas, due to an intrinsic mobility, the position of the third helix is less well defined in the NMR structure. To further characterize the degrees of freedom of this helix, we have measured the dipolar coupling constants in the backbone of p8MTCP1 in a bicellar medium. We show here that including D(dip)HN dipolar couplings in the structure calculation protocol improves the structure of the alpha-hairpin but not the positioning of the third helix. This is due to the motional averaging of the dipolar couplings measured in the last helix. Performing two calculations with different force constants for the dipolar restraints highlights the inconstancy of these mobility-averaged dipolar couplings. Alternatively, prior to any structure calculations, comparing the values of the dipolar couplings measured in helix III to values back-calculated from an ideal helix demonstrates that they are atypical for a helix. This can be partly attributed to mobility effects since the inclusion of the 15N relaxation derived order parameter allows for a better fit."

The pI of the oligomeric atypical mitochondrial CK (Mi-CK) was found at the acidic side compared to that of the typical ubiquitous Mi-CK (uMi-CK), while the molecular size of the atypical Mi-CK was similar to that of the typical uMi-CK. The pIs of the oligomeric and the dimeric atypical Mi-CKs became the same as those of the typical uMi-CK upon treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol. Therefore, the atypical Mi-CK was suggested to be an oxidized form of uMi-CK, and the oxidation might have occurred in the mitochondria because the oligomeric atypical Mi-CK had atypical pIs. The physicochemical characteristics of the oxidized uMi-CK were similar to those of the typical uMi-CK."

The dugong showed 14 ovarian cycles during the period of study. Concentrations of progesterone ranged from 0.01 ng/mg creatinine (Cr) to 1.94 ng/mg Cr and the length of estrous cycle was 53.6+/-8.6 (mean+/-SEM) days based on intervals of urinary progesterone peak-to-peak measurements. Concentrations of urinary estradiol-17 beta ranged from 0.9pg/mgCr to 23.7pg/mgCr, and tended to peak just prior to elevations of progesterone during the first year of study. This is the first report demonstrates that the ovulatory cycle of the dugong is about 50 days. The present findings suggest that measurement of urinary progesterone is a useful method to detect ovarian cycle of the dugong in captivity."

There were 110 French participants (54 men, 56 women) and 128 Japanese participants (41 men, 87 women), selected from undergraduate students, employed workers, housewives, and retirees. Their occupational proportion and their ranges of age were balanced in both countries. Scales for Individualism and Masculinity dealt not only with work-related but also general items for workplace, culture, education, and family. Analyses generally showed that the Japanese individuals scored higher on the Masculinity scale and French participants scored higher on the Individualism scale. There was a mean difference between Japanese men and women in how they answered questions about the work-related items concerning Masculinity."

These modifications are thought to allow otherwise soluble proteins to associate with membranes by lipid-lipid based hydrophobic interactions. The purpose of this work was to quantify the effect of acyl chain length on hydrophobic interactions between acylated proteins and phospholipid monolayers. The binding of an artificially acylated model protein to electrically neutral phospholipids was studied by surface plasmon resonance, using BIACORE. Kinetic rates for the binding of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A), monoacylated on its N-terminal lysine with fatty acids of 10, 12, 14, 16 or 18 carbon atoms, to phospholipids on hydrophobic sensor chips, were measured. Unlike unmodified ribonuclease, acylated RNase A bound to the phospholipids, and the association level increased with the acyl chain length to reach a maximum for C16. Reproducible kinetics were obtained which did not fit a 1:1 Langmuir model but rather a two-step binding profile."

Using endoscopic images in the follow-up study, we estimated the doubling time (DT) of this unusual tumor as 9.2 days. Since the doubling time of gastric cancer is generally fairly long due to exfoliation of many cancer cells into the gastric lumen, this cancer presented with extremely rapid growth. Besides, this case reinforces that follow-up study is important in terms of clinical management of ulcerative lesions."

The features and outcomes of this group were compared to those of individuals with prevalent RMI.RESULTS: Of 5,888 participants, 901 evidenced a past MI, and 201 (22.3%) were previously unrecognized. The independent predictors of UMI were the absence of angina and the absence of congestive heart failure (CHF). Six-year mortality did not significantly differ between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: 1) In the elderly, UMI continues to represent a significant proportion of all MIs; 2) associations with angina and CHF may reflect complex neurological issues, but they also may represent diagnosis bias; 3) these individuals can otherwise not be distinguished from those with recognized infarctions; and 4) mortality rates after UMI and RMI are similar. Future studies should address screening for UMI, risk stratification after detection of previously UMI, and the role of standard post-MI therapies."

(1) Fasted rat model: indomethacin was intra-gastrically administered in rats pre-treated with different doses of the anti-secretory drugs. (2) Re-fed rat model: rats orally treated with different doses of anti-secretory drugs had free access to chow pellets and were then treated with parenteral indomethacin. (3) Healing model: either oral or parenteral anti-secretory drugs were given after indomethacin administration. Computer-assisted analysis of the area of damage was expressed as ulcer index. Gastric secretion was evaluated in the pylorus-ligated rat model.RESULTS: Inhibition of acid secretion was in the order omeprazole &gt; ebrotidine = ranitidine. Ebrotidine at the highest dose used (100 mg/kg) and omeprazole, but not ranitidine, significantly prevented indomethacin-induced corpus (fasted rat) and antrum (re-fed rat) gastric lesions. In the ulcer healing model, oral administration of omeprazole and both ranitidine and ebrotidine at the highest dose used improved the ulcer index. The parenteral administration of these drugs had a lesser effect than the oral route and was in the order ebrotidine &gt; omeprazole &gt; ranitidine.CONCLUSIONS: Ebrotidine is effective in both the prevention and healing of indomethacin-induced experimental gastric lesions. In these models, the effect of ebrotidine is comparable to omeprazole and more effective than ranitidine."

A superior mesenteric angiogram revealed that the arteries supplying the small intestine were twisted in the arterial phase, while the portal vein was not visualized in the late phase. A celiac angiogram demonstrated that portal blood flow from the splenic venous return was maintained. The patient's symptoms had almost resolved the day after admission, and his serum transaminases level had gradually decreased to normal with conservative therapy. A superior mesenteric angiogram on the 13th hospital day showed a normal arteriogram and the portal vein demonstrated blood flow from the superior mesenteric vein. Liver biopsy revealed hemorrhagic necrosis around the central veins, which was compatible with ischemic hepatitis. Since the patient's O2 saturation level on admission was not low enough to have caused ischemic hepatitis by itself, we suspect that a sudden decrease in portal blood flow was the additional factor that allowed the threshold for the initiation of ischemic liver damage to be reached."
"11022097";"UMI";"UMI";"Annales de biologie clinique";0;2000;"[Vitamin E and cardiovascular prevention].";"The antioxidant properties of vitamin E are well established. In humans, they appear very clearly from the nutritional supplementation trials. There is a strong correlation between supplied doses (&gt;= 50 mg/j), vitamin E content of LDL and antioxidant protection of LDL. The consumption studies mostly suggest that the cardiovascular disease risk is diminished by the vitamin E supplementation, this being not true for vitamin E supplied by food strictly. In spite of the fact that there is a coherence between these results due in particular to the highly atherogenic role of oxidized low density lipoprotein, it is not allowed to claim that only the increased protection of LDL against oxidation is responsible for the diminished risk. The cell-regulating properties of vitamin E that have been more recently discovered have also to be taken into account as regards the functions of platelets, monocytes-macrophages, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. The LDL-vitamin E capacity at decreasing the superoxide anion production (involved in turn in the oxidation process of LDL) could also play a role in preventing cardiovascular risk. The nutritional intervention studies undertaken in secondary prevention indicate a beneficial effect in terms of cardiovascular morbidity, either for low dose (50 mg), or for higher dose (&gt;= 270 mg/d) intake, but without effect in terms of mortality. A recent study presumably supports a beneficial effect at the dose intake of 300 mg/d only in terms of cardiovascular mortality. Only one intervention has been carried out in condition of primary prevention, leading to the absence of effect at the dose employed (50 mg/d). The studies on the mechanisms of action make plausible the beneficial effects observed in analytical or experimental epidemiology. However, the experimental epidemiology does not provide indisputable evidence for the efficacy of the secondary prevention of cardiovascular risk by vitamin E supplementation. There is no intervention study using doses higher than 50 mg/d in primary prevention. There is a need for such studies in the not too distant future. A period of several years will be necessary before having new data possibly resulting in a consensus achievement."

The choreatic movement lasted for a few seconds and the dystonia lasted for a few minutes. He also had high serum CK levels and hypertrophic calf muscles. His muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes were normal. His choreatic movements fulfill the criteria for paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis (PKC). However, it was unclear what the symptom of dystonia was due to. From a muscle biopsy and DNA analysis, he was diagnosed as having Becker muscular dystrophy. Administration of anticonvulsant improved the dystonia as well as the choreatic movement, which showed that the dystonia was a symptom of PKC. Coincidence of choreatic movements and dystonias which had different lasting time in a patient of PKC was atypical and had not previously reported."

Octameric sMi-CK and uMi-CK were electrophoresed cathodic to cytoplasmic muscle-type creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MM) and dimeric Mi-CKs were found at the position of CK-MM on a cellulose acetate membrane. The electrophoretic mobilities of sMi-CK were similar to those of uMi-CK. Octameric sMi-CK was focused at pI 7.1-8.0 and dimeric forms at pI 6.55, 6.75, 6.85, and 6.95. New bands appearing at pI 6.65 and 6.75 after treatment of sMi-CK with carboxypeptidase B were found to be delysined forms. sMi-CK reacted with anti-sMi-CK antibodies, and the immune complexes were focused at pI 5.8. The Km value of sMi-CK for creatine phosphate (PCr) was 1.19 +/-0.20 mmol/L (mean +/- standard error), the activation energy (Ea) was 108.3+/-1.2 kJ/ mol, and the residual enzyme activity after heating at 45 degrees C for 20 min was 79.6+/-1.9%. On the other hand, octameric uMi-CK was focused at pI 7.1-7.9 and the dimeric forms were focused at pI 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, and 7.0. Delysined forms were focused around pI 6.3, 6.4, 6.8, and 6.9. uMi-CK reacted with anti-sMi-CK antibodies, and the immune complexes were focused at pI 5.8. The Km value of uMi-CK for PCr was 1.07+/-0.03 mmol/L, Ea of uMi-CK was 110.0+/-0.9 kJ/mol, and the residual enzyme activity after heating at 45 degrees C for 20 min was 90.3+/-0.4%. The sMi-CK and uMi-CK were hybridized and the hybrid Mi-CK appeared at pI 6.78, 6.98, and 7.1-7.95. The pIs of the hybrid Mi-CK were between those of sMi-CK and uMi-CK.

The corresponding amounts of ingested ALA and LA were related to ALA and LA levels determined by capillary column gas-liquid chromatography in plasma cholesterol esters at D15 and W37, respectively.RESULTS: ALA in CE was very significantly correlated to D0-D15 and D0-W37 ALA intakes (0.66; P=0.0001 and 0.70; P=0.0001), respectively. LA in CE was weakly correlated to D0-D15 LA intakes (0.03; P=0.01) and whatever the group (human milk or enriched formula) the correlation was lost at W37.CONCLUSION: In preterm infants, ALA in CE can be considered as representative of ALA dietary intakes, whereas LA in CE appears as a poor marker of LA intakes."
