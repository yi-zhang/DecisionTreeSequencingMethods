Methylation has been commonly assessed with non-quantitative methodologies, such as methylation-specific PCR (MSP). We investigated previously reported hypermethylated genes with quantitative methodology in oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas (OTSCC).RESULTS: The methylation status of 12 genes in 115 OTSCC samples was assessed by one or more of three quantitative analyses: methylation sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM), sensitive-melting analysis after real time-methylation specific PCR (SMART-MSP), and bisulfite pyrosequencing. In contrast to much of the literature, either no or infrequent locus-specific methylation was identified by MS-HRM for DAPK1, RASSF1A, MGMT, MLH1, APC, CDH1, CDH13, BRCA1, ERCC1, and ATM. The most frequently methylated loci were RUNX3 (18/108 methylated) and ABO (22/107 methylated). Interrogation of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HNSCC cohort confirmed the frequency of significant methylation for the loci investigated. Heterogeneous methylation of RUNX3 (18/108) and ABO (22/107) detected by MS-HRM, conferred significantly worse survival (P = 0.01, and P = 0.03). However, following quantification of methylation levels using pyrosequencing, only four tumors had significant quantities (&gt;15%) of RUNX3 methylation which correlated with a worse patient outcome (P &lt;0.001), while the prognostic significance of ABO hypermethylation was lost. RUNX3 methylation was not prognostic for the TCGA cohort (P = 0.76).CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the critical need for quantification of methylation levels and its impact on correlative analyses. In OTSCC, we found little evidence of significant or frequent hypermethylation of many loci reported to be commonly methylated. It is likely that previous reports have overestimated the frequency of significant methylation events as a consequence of the use of non-quantitative methodology."

As a consequence, testing for DNA methylation biomarkers in plasma or other body fluids shows great promise for detection of malignancies at early stages and/or for monitoring response to treatment. However, DNA from normal leukocytes may contribute to the DNA in plasma and will affect biomarker specificity if there is any methylation in the leukocytes. DNA from 48 samples of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells was evaluated for the presence of methylation of a panel of DNA methylation biomarkers that have been implicated in cancer. SMART-MSP, a methylation specific PCR (MSP) methodology based on real time PCR amplification, high-resolution melting and strategic primer design, enabled quantitative detection of low levels of methylated DNA. Methylation was observed in all tested mononuclear cell DNA samples for the CDH1 and HIC1 promoters and in majority of DNA samples for the TWIST1 and DAPK1 promoters. APC and RARB promoter methylation, at a lower average level, was also detected in a substantial proportion of DNA samples. We found no BRCA1, CDKN2A, GSTP1 and RASSF1A promoter methylation in this sample set. Several individuals had higher levels of methylation at several loci suggestive of a methylator phenotype. In conclusion, methylation of many potential DNA methylation biomarkers can be detected in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and is likely to affect their specificity for detecting low level disease. However, we found no evidence of promoter methylation for other genes indicating that panels of analytically sensitive and specific methylation biomarkers in body fluids can be obtained."
"21913071";"SMART-MSP";"SMART-MSP";"Methods Mol Biol";2;2011;"Closed-tube PCR methods for locus-specific DNA methylation analysis.";"Closed-tube PCR methods (sometimes referred to as in-tube PCR methods) for locus-specific DNA -methylation analysis are methodologies in which the amplification and analysis of bisulphite-modified DNA take place in one tube without the need to remove the PCR products for further analysis. Closed-tube methodologies lend themselves to high-throughput applications and molecular diagnostics but are also applicable as a research tool. We review three closed-tube methodologies, methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM), MethyLight, and sensitive melting after real-time analysis - methylation-specific PCR (SMART-MSP). Closed-tube detection can be performed by simultaneously amplifying both methylated and unmethylated templates and subsequent melting curve analysis (MS-HRM). Alternatively, methylation-specific primers are used in real-time quantitative PCR and monitored either by a fluorescent hydrolysis probe (MethyLight) or using a double-stranded DNA binding fluorescent dye with a subsequent quality control step by melting curve analysis (SMART-MSP)."

MGMT removes alkyl adducts from the O⁶ position of guanine thereby preventing G&gt;A mutations in the genome. For this reason, MGMT promoter methylation predicts a favorable outcome for glioblastoma patients treated with alkylating agents. In this study, we investigated whether MGMT becomes silenced by promoter methylation in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), an aggressive cancer of the pleura associated with a poor prognosis. Ninety-five samples from patients diagnosed with MPM were studied. These samples were genotyped for the MGMT rs16906252 promoter SNP using high-resolution melting, and methylation status was analyzed using SMART-MSP and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The SMART-MSP assay was designed to provide information on the allelic methylation status in samples heterozygous for rs16906252. MGMT immunohistochemistry was performed on samples showing no methylation, monoallelic methylation, and biallelic methylation. Thirteen of the 95 MPM samples (13.7%) were methylation positive and a strong association with the T allele of the rs16906252 SNP (P&lt;0.001) was observed. Detection of the protein was found to be dependent not only on the allelic methylation status but also on the methylation level, and complete silencing was observed in only one sample, showing biallelic methylation and a methylation level close to 100%. In conclusion, methylation of the MGMT promoter occurs in a subset of MPM patients and is associated with the T allele of the MGMT rs16906252 SNP. However, complete silencing of MGMT in MPM is a rare event."

The altered DNA methylation patterns found in cancer cells include not only global hypomethylation but also discrete hypermethylation of specific genes. In particular, numerous tumor suppressor genes undergo epigenetic silencing because of hypermethylated promoter regions. Some of these genes are considered promising DNA methylation biomarkers for early cancer diagnostics, and some have been shown to be valuable for predicting prognosis or the response to therapy.CONTENT: PCR-based methods that use sodium bisulfite-treated DNA as a template are generally accepted as the most analytically sensitive and specific techniques for analyzing DNA methylation at single loci. A number of new methods, such as methylation-specific fluorescent amplicon generation (MS-FLAG), methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM), and sensitive melting analysis after real-time methylation-specific PCR (SMART-MSP), now complement the traditional PCR-based methods and promise to be valuable diagnostic tools. In particular, the HRM technique shows great potential as a diagnostic tool because of its closed-tube format and cost-effectiveness.SUMMARY: Numerous traditional and new PCR-based methods have been developed for detecting DNA methylation at single loci. All have characteristic advantages and disadvantages, particularly with regard to use in clinical settings."

A correlation between methylation and the T allele of the rs16906252 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in colorectal carcinomas has previously been reported. As aberrant MGMT methylation can be an early event in tumor development, we tested the hypothesis that normal individuals possessing the T allele may be predisposed to somatic methylation at the MGMT promoter. Peripheral blood monononuclear cell DNA from 89 normal, healthy individuals was genotyped at rs1690625 and assessed for the methylation status of the MGMT promoter region using independent quantitative methodologies capable of detecting low-level methylation: MethyLight and Sensitive Melting Analysis after Real-time Methylation-Specific PCR (SMART-MSP). There was a strong association between presence of the T allele and detectable methylation (P = 0.00005) in the peripheral blood DNA. Furthermore, when a MSP assay flanking the SNP was used to amplify methylated sequences in heterozygotes, only the T allele was methylated. Thus, detectable somatic methylation of the MGMT promoter in normal individuals is strongly associated with the T allele of the rs16906252 MGMT promoter SNP."

The methylation status of multiple tumor suppressor genes may serve as biomarkers for early cancer diagnostics, for prediction of prognosis and for prediction of response to treatment. Therefore, it is important that methodologies for detection of DNA methylation continue to evolve. Sensitive Melting Analysis after Real Time - Methylation Specific PCR (SMART-MSP) and Methylation Sensitive - High Resolution Melting (MS-HRM) are two methods for single locus DNA methylation detection based on HRM.METHODS: Here, we have assessed the quality of DNA extracted from up to 30 years old Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissue for DNA methylation analysis using SMART-MSP and MS-HRM. The quality assessment was performed on DNA extracted from 54 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) samples derived from FFPE tissue, collected over 30 years and grouped into five years intervals. For each sample, the methylation levels of the CDKN2A (p16) and RARB promoters were estimated using SMART-MSP and MS-HRM assays designed to assess the methylation status of the same CpG positions. This allowed for a direct comparison of the methylation levels estimated by the two methods for each sample.RESULTS: CDKN2A promoter methylation levels were successfully determined by SMART-MSP and MS-HRM in all 54 samples. Identical methylation estimates were obtained by the two methods in 46 of the samples. The methylation levels of the RARB promoter were successfully determined by SMART-MSP in all samples. When using MS-HRM to assess RARB methylation five samples failed to amplify and 15 samples showed a melting profile characteristic for heterogeneous methylation. Twenty-seven of the remaining 34 samples, for which the methylation level could be estimated, gave the same result as observed when using SMART-MSP.CONCLUSION: MS-HRM and SMART-MSP can be successfully used for single locus methylation studies using DNA derived from up to 30 years old FFPE tissue. Furthermore, it can be expected that MS-HRM and SMART-MSP will provide similar methylation estimates when assays are designed to analyze the same CpG positions."

In such situations, essential information is missed if the methylation detection is purely qualitative. We describe a new probe-free quantitative methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assay that incorporates evaluation of the amplicon by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. Depending on amplicon design, different types of information can be obtained from the HRM analysis. Much of this information cannot be obtained by electrophoretic analysis. In particular, identification of false positives due to incomplete bisulphite conversion or false priming is possible. Heterogeneous methylation can also be distinguished from homogeneous methylation. As proof of principle, we have developed assays for the promoter regions of the CDH1, DAPK1, CDKN2A (p16(INK4a)) and RARB genes. We show that highly accurate quantification is possible in the range from 100% to 0.1% methylated template when 25 ng of bisulphite-modified DNA is used as a template for PCR. We have named this new approach to quantitative methylation detection, Sensitive Melting Analysis after Real Time (SMART)-MSP."
