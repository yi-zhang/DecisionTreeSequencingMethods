Part A";0;2015;"A de novo 1.58 Mb deletion, including MAP2K6 and mapping 1.28 Mb upstream to SOX9, identified in a patient with Pierre Robin sequence and osteopenia with multiple fractures.";"Defects of long-range regulatory elements of dosage-sensitive genes represent an under-recognized mechanism underlying genetic diseases. Haploinsufficiency of SOX9, the gene essential for development of testes and differentiation of chondrocytes, results in campomelic dysplasia, a skeletal malformation syndrome often associated with sex reversal. Chromosomal rearrangements with breakpoints mapping up to 1.6 Mb up- and downstream to SOX9, and disrupting its distant cis-regulatory elements, have been described in patients with milder forms of campomelic dysplasia, Pierre Robin sequence, and sex reversal. We present an ∼1.58 Mb deletion mapping ∼1.28 Mb upstream to SOX9 that encompasses its putative long-range cis-regulatory element(s) and MAP2K6 in a patient with Pierre Robin sequence and osteopenia with multiple fractures. Low bone mass panel testing using massively parallel sequencing of 23 nuclear genes, including COL1A1 and COL1A2 was negative. Based on the previous mouse model of Map2k6, suggesting that Sox9 is likely a downstream target of the p38 MAPK pathway, and our previous chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) data showing potential interactions between SOX9 promoter and MAP2K6, we hypothesize that deletion of MAP2K6 might have affected SOX9 expression and contributed to our patient's phenotype. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Heterozygous point mutations and genomic deletions involving SOX9 lead to campomelic dysplasia (CD), a skeletal malformation syndrome often associated with sex reversal. Chromosomal rearrangements with breakpoints mapping up to 1.6 Mb up- and downstream to SOX9, and likely disrupting its distant cis-regulatory elements, have been described in patients with milder forms of CD. Based on the location of these aberration breakpoints, four clusters upstream of SOX9 have been defined. Interestingly, we found that each of these intervals overlaps a gene encoding long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), suggesting that lncRNAs may contribute to long-range regulation of SOX9 expression. One of the four upstream regions, RevSex (517-595 kb 5' to SOX9), is associated with sex reversal, and was suggested to harbor a testis-specific and sex-determining enhancer. Another sex-determining interval was mapped to a gene desert &gt;1.3 Mb downstream of SOX9. We have performed chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) analysis in Sertoli cells and lymphoblasts to verify the proposed long-range interactions of the SOX9 promoter and to identify potential novel regulatory elements that might be responsible for sex reversal in patients with CD. We identified several novel potentially cis-interacting regions both up- and downstream to SOX9, with some of them overlapping lncRNA genes. Our data point to lncRNAs as likely mediators of some of these regulatory interactions."

The technology relies on the original and, in hindsight, remarkably simple idea that digestion and religation of fixed chromatin in cells, followed by the quantification of ligation junctions, allows for the determination of DNA contact frequencies and insight into chromosome topology. Here we evaluate and compare the current 3C-based methods (including 4C [chromosome conformation capture-on-chip], 5C [chromosome conformation capture carbon copy], HiC, and ChIA-PET), summarize their contribution to our current understanding of genome structure, and discuss how shape influences genome function."

Technical variants of the assay ('4C') allow the systematic detection of genome-wide coassociations with bait sequences of interest, enabling the nuclear environments of specific genes to be probed. We describe enhanced 4C (e4C, enhanced chromosome conformation capture on chip), a technique incorporating additional enrichment steps for bait-specific sequences, and thus improving sensitivity in the detection of weaker, distal chromatin coassociations. In brief, e4C entails the fixation, restriction digestion and ligation steps of conventional 3C, with an optional chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) step to select for subsets of chromatin coassociations, followed by bait enrichment by biotinylated primer extension and pull-down, adapter ligation and PCR amplification. Chromatin coassociations with the bait sequence can then be assessed by hybridizing e4C products to microarrays or sequencing. The e4C procedure takes approximately 1 week to go from tissue to DNA ready for microarray hybridization."
"22776363";"4C_on-Chip";"(4C AND on-chip)";"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)";4;2012;"A genome-wide 3C-method for characterizing the three-dimensional architectures of genomes.";"Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromosomes within the eukaryotic nucleus reflects and influences genomic activities, including transcription, DNA replication, recombination and DNA repair. In order to uncover structure-function relationships, it is necessary first to understand the principles underlying the folding and the 3D arrangement of chromosomes. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) provides a powerful tool for detecting interactions within and between chromosomes. A high throughput derivative of 3C, chromosome conformation capture on chip (4C), executes a genome-wide interrogation of interaction partners for a given locus. We recently developed a new method, a derivative of 3C and 4C, which, similar to Hi-C, is capable of comprehensively identifying long-range chromosome interactions throughout a genome in an unbiased fashion. Hence, our method can be applied to decipher the 3D architectures of genomes. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for this method."
"22525789";"4C_on-Chip";"(4C AND on-chip)";"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)";0;2012;"Chromosome conformation capture on chip in single Drosophila melanogaster tissues.";"Chromosomes are protein-DNA complexes that encode life. In a cell nucleus, chromosomes are folded in a highly specific manner, which connects strongly to some of their paramount functions, such as DNA replication and gene transcription. Chromosome conformation capture methodologies allow researchers to detect chromosome folding, by quantitatively measuring which genomic sequences are in close proximity in nuclear space. Here, we describe a modified chromosome conformation capture on chip (4C) protocol, which is specifically designed for detection of chromosome folding in a single Drosophila melanogaster tissue. Our protocol enables 4C analyses on a limited number of cells, which is crucial for fly tissues, because these contain relatively low numbers of cells. We used this protocol to demonstrate that target genes of Polycomb group proteins interact with each other in nuclear space of third instar larval brain cells. Major benefits of using D. melanogaster in 4C studies are: (1) powerful and tractable genetic approaches can be incorporated; (2) short generation time allows use of complex genotypes; and (3) compact and well annotated genome. We anticipate that our sensitized 4C method will be generally applicable to detect chromosome folding in other fly tissues."

To study the relationship between the transcriptional activity and the spatial environment of a gene, we used allele-specific chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) technology to produce high-resolution topology maps of the active and inactive X chromosomes in female cells. We found that loci on the active X form multiple long-range interactions, with spatial segregation of active and inactive chromatin. On the inactive X, silenced loci lack preferred interactions, suggesting a unique random organization inside the inactive territory. However, escapees, among which is Xist, are engaged in long-range contacts with each other, enabling identification of novel escapees. Deletion of Xist results in partial refolding of the inactive X into a conformation resembling the active X without affecting gene silencing or DNA methylation. Our data point to a role for Xist RNA in shaping the conformation of the inactive X chromosome at least partially independent of transcription."

Two T-ALL subtypes were identified that lacked rearrangements of known oncogenes. One subtype associated with cortical arrest, expression of cell cycle genes, and ectopic NKX2-1 or NKX2-2 expression for which rearrangements were identified. The second subtype associated with immature T cell development and high expression of the MEF2C transcription factor as consequence of rearrangements of MEF2C, transcription factors that target MEF2C, or MEF2C-associated cofactors. We propose NKX2-1, NKX2-2, and MEF2C as T-ALL oncogenes that are activated by various rearrangements."

Contradicting results have been reported to date, with little consensus about the dynamics of nuclear organization and the features of the contact loci. In this study, we investigated the properties and dynamics of genomic loci that are in contact with glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-responsive loci. We took a systematic approach, combining genome-wide interaction profiling by the chromosome conformation capture on chip (4C) technology with expression, protein occupancy, and chromatin accessibility profiles. This approach allowed a comprehensive analysis of how distinct features of the linear genome are organized in the three-dimensional nuclear space in the context of rapid gene regulation. We found that the transcriptional response to GR occurs without dramatic nuclear reorganization. Moreover, contrary to the view of transcription-driven organization, even genes with opposite transcriptional responses colocalize. Regions contacting GR-regulated genes are not particularly enriched for GR-regulated loci or for any functional group of genes, suggesting that these subnuclear environments are not organized to respond to a specific factor. The contact regions are, however, highly enriched for DNase I-hypersensitive sites that comprehensively mark cell-type-specific regulatory sites. These findings indicate that the nucleus is pre-organized in a conformation allowing rapid transcriptional reprogramming, and this organization is significantly correlated with cell-type-specific chromatin sites accessible to regulatory factors. Numerous open chromatin loci may be arranged in nuclear domains that are poised to respond to diverse signals in general and to permit efficient gene regulation."
"21455484";"4C_on-Chip";"(4C AND on-chip)";"PLoS genetics";34;2011;"Interactions among Polycomb domains are guided by chromosome architecture.";"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins bind and regulate hundreds of genes. Previous evidence has suggested that long-range chromatin interactions may contribute to the regulation of PcG target genes. Here, we adapted the Chromosome Conformation Capture on Chip (4C) assay to systematically map chromosomal interactions in Drosophila melanogaster larval brain tissue. Our results demonstrate that PcG target genes interact extensively with each other in nuclear space. These interactions are highly specific for PcG target genes, because non-target genes with either low or high expression show distinct interactions. Notably, interactions are mostly limited to genes on the same chromosome arm, and we demonstrate that a topological rather than a sequence-based mechanism is responsible for this constraint. Our results demonstrate that many interactions among PcG target genes exist and that these interactions are guided by overall chromosome architecture."

Therefore, characterizing 15q11.2-13.3 chromatin structure is important for understanding the regulation of this locus during normal neuronal development. Deletion of the Prader-Willi imprinting center (PWS-IC) within 15q11.2-13.3 disrupts long-range imprinted gene expression resulting in Prader-Willi syndrome. Previous results establish that MeCP2 binds to the PWS-IC and is required for optimal expression of distal GABRB3 and UBE3A. To examine the hypothesis that MeCP2 facilitates 15q11.2-13.3 transcription by linking the PWS-IC with distant elements, chromosome capture conformation on chip (4C) analysis was performed in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. SH-SY5Y neurons had 2.84-fold fewer 15q11.2-13.3 PWS-IC chromatin interactions than undifferentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblasts, revealing developmental chromatin de-condensation of the locus. Out of 68 PWS-IC interactions with15q11.2-13.3 identified by 4C analysis and 62 15q11.2-13.3 MeCP2-binding sites identified by previous ChIP-chip studies, only five sites showed overlap. Remarkably, two of these overlapping PWS-IC- and MeCP2-bound sites mapped to sites flanking CHRNA7 (cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 7) encoding the cholinergic receptor, nicotinic, alpha 7. PWS-IC interaction with CHRNA7 in neurons was independently confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Subsequent quantitative transcriptional analyses of frontal cortex from Rett syndrome and autism patients revealed significantly reduced CHRNA7 expression compared with controls. Together, these results suggest that transcription of CHRNA7 is modulated by chromatin interactions with the PWS-IC. Thus, loss of long-range chromatin interactions within 15q11.2-13.3 may contribute to multiple human neurodevelopmental disorders."

It is now widely recognized that these regulatory elements can be brought in close proximity through the formation of chromatin loops, and that these loops are crucial for transcriptional regulation of their target genes. The chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique presents a snapshot of long-range interactions, by fixing physically interacting elements with formaldehyde, digestion of the DNA, and ligation to obtain a library of unique ligation products. Recently, several large-scale modifications to the 3C technique have been presented. Here, we describe chromosome conformation capture sequencing (4C-seq), a high-throughput version of the 3C technique that combines the 3C-on-chip (4C) protocol with next-generation Illumina sequencing. The method is presented for use in mammalian cell lines, but can be adapted to use in mammalian tissues and any other eukaryotic genome."

Here we demonstrate that chromatin conformation capture on chip (4C) technology can be used to screen large genomic regions for balanced and complex inversions and translocations at high resolution. The 4C technique can be used to detect breakpoints also in repetitive DNA sequences as it uniquely relies on capturing genomic fragments across the breakpoint. Using 4C, we uncovered LMO3 as a potentially leukemogenic translocation partner of TRB@. We developed multiplex 4C to simultaneously screen for translocation partners of multiple selected loci. We identified unsuspected translocations and complex rearrangements. Furthermore, using 4C we detected translocations even in small subpopulations of cells. This strategy opens avenues for the rapid fine-mapping of cytogenetically identified translocations and inversions, and the efficient screening for balanced rearrangements near candidate loci, even when rearrangements exist only in subpopulations of cells."
"19235779";"4C_on-Chip";"(4C AND on-chip)";"Yeast (Chichester, England)";7;2009;"Repeated elements coordinate the spatial organization of the yeast genome.";"The spatial organization of the chromosomes is crucial for gene expression and development. Inter- and intrachromosomal interactions form a crucial part of this epigenomic regulatory system. Here we use circular chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) to identify interactions between repetitive and non-repetitive loci within the yeast genome. The interacting regions occur in non-randomly distributed clusters. Furthermore, the SIR2 histone deacetylase has opposing roles in the organization of the inter- or intrachromosomal interactions. These data establish a dynamic domain model for yeast genome organization. Moreover, they point to the repeated elements playing a central role in the dynamic organization of genome architecture."
"18274532";"4C_on-Chip";"(4C AND on-chip)";"Nature protocols";24;2008;"High-resolution circular chromosome conformation capture assay.";"The pioneering chromosome conformation capture (3C) method provides the opportunity to study chromosomal folding in the nucleus. It is based on formaldehyde cross-linking of living cells followed by enzyme digestion, intramolecular ligation and quantitative (Q)-PCR analysis. However, 3C requires prior knowledge of the bait and interacting sequence (termed interactor) rendering it less useful for genome-wide studies. As several recent reports document, this limitation has been overcome by exploiting a circular intermediate in a variant of the 3C method, termed 4C (for circular 3C). The strategic positioning of primers within the bait enables the identification of unknown interacting sequences, which form part of the circular DNA. Here, we describe a protocol for our 4C method, which produces a high-resolution interaction map potentially suitable for the analysis of cis-regulatory elements and for comparison with chromatin marks obtained by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip at the sites of interaction. Following optimization of enzyme digestions and amplification conditions, the protocol can be completed in 2-3 weeks."
"17033623";"4C_on-Chip";"(4C AND on-chip)";"Nature genetics";271;2006;"Nuclear organization of active and inactive chromatin domains uncovered by chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C).";"The spatial organization of DNA in the cell nucleus is an emerging key contributor to genomic function. We developed 4C technology (chromosome conformation capture (3C)-on-chip), which allows for an unbiased genome-wide search for DNA loci that contact a given locus in the nuclear space. We demonstrate here that active and inactive genes are engaged in many long-range intrachromosomal interactions and can also form interchromosomal contacts. The active beta-globin locus in fetal liver preferentially contacts transcribed, but not necessarily tissue-specific, loci elsewhere on chromosome 7, whereas the inactive locus in fetal brain contacts different transcriptionally silent loci. A housekeeping gene in a gene-dense region on chromosome 8 forms long-range contacts predominantly with other active gene clusters, both in cis and in trans, and many of these intra- and interchromosomal interactions are conserved between the tissues analyzed. Our data demonstrate that chromosomes fold into areas of active chromatin and areas of inactive chromatin and establish 4C technology as a powerful tool to study nuclear architecture."
