However, for the vast majority of non-coding RNAs, the cellular function remains enigmatic. The two long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes DLEU1 and DLEU2 map to a critical region at chromosomal band 13q14.3 that is recurrently deleted in solid tumors and hematopoietic malignancies like chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While no point mutations have been found in the protein coding candidate genes at 13q14.3, they are deregulated in malignant cells, suggesting an epigenetic tumor suppressor mechanism. We therefore characterized the epigenetic makeup of 13q14.3 in CLL cells and found histone modifications by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that are associated with activated transcription and significant DNA-demethylation at the transcriptional start sites of DLEU1 and DLEU2 using 5 different semi-quantitative and quantitative methods (aPRIMES, BioCOBRA, MCIp, MassARRAY, and bisulfite sequencing). These epigenetic aberrations were correlated with transcriptional deregulation of the neighboring candidate tumor suppressor genes, suggesting a coregulation in cis of this gene cluster. We found that the 13q14.3 genes in addition to their previously known functions regulate NF-kB activity, which we could show after overexpression, siRNA-mediated knockdown, and dominant-negative mutant genes by using Western blots with previously undescribed antibodies, by a customized ELISA as well as by reporter assays. In addition, we performed an unbiased screen of 810 human miRNAs and identified the miR-15/16 family of genes at 13q14.3 as the strongest inducers of NF-kB activity. In summary, the tumor suppressor mechanism at 13q14.3 is a cluster of genes controlled by two lncRNA genes that are regulated by DNA-methylation and histone modifications and whose members all regulate NF-kB. Therefore, the tumor suppressor mechanism in 13q14.3 underlines the role both of epigenetic aberrations and of lncRNA genes in human tumorigenesis and is an example of colocalization of a functionally related gene cluster."

Aberrant DNA methylation, in contrast, is frequently observed in many different malignancies including leukemias and lymphomas. Global DNA methylation profiling addresses the methylated sequences (methylome) of patient genomes to identify disease-specific methylation patterns. Workload in methylome analyses can be considerably reduced by methylome enrichment using proteins or antibodies with high affinity to methylated DNA. Methyl-CpG Immunoprecipitation (MCIp) employs an immobilized recombinant human methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2, MBD2, which binds methylated CpGs in double-stranded DNA. Elution with increasing salt concentrations allows the fractionated enrichment of different degrees of methylation."

Changes in methylation early in cancer development may be clinically relevant for cancer detection and prognosis-based therapeutic decisions. In the present study, a combination of methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation (MCIp) and human CpG island (CGI) arrays was applied to compare genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in 10 low-grade in situ and invasive breast cancers against 10 normal breast samples. In total, 214 CGIs were found to be hypermethylated in ≥6 of 10 tumors. Functional term enrichment analyses revealed an overrepresentation of homeobox genes and genes involved in transcription and regulation of transcription. Significant hypermethylation of 11 selected genes in tumor vs. normal tissue was validated in two independent sample sets (45 tumors and 11 controls, 43 tumors and 8 controls) using quantitative EpiTyper technology. In tumors, median methylation levels of BCAN, HOXD1, KCTD8, KLF11, NXPH1, POU4F1, SIM1, and TCF7L1 were ≥30% higher than in normal samples, representing potential biomarkers for tumor diagnosis. Using the 90th percentile of methylation levels in normal tissue as cutoff value, 62-92% of in situ samples (n=13), 72-97% of invasive samples from the first validation set (n=32), and 86-100% of invasive samples from the second validation set (n=43) were classified as hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of KLF11 and SIM1 might also be associated with increased risk of developing metastases. In summary, early methylation changes are frequent in the low-grade pathway of breast cancer and may be useful in the development of differential diagnostic and possibly also prognostic markers."

However, the activation status of p38γ in muscle is unclear.METHODS: p38γ activity in slow and fast adult mouse skeletal muscle tissue was examined, as was the impact of p38γ deficiency on muscle development and gene expression.RESULTS: p38γ is preferentially activated in slow muscle, but it is inactive in fast muscle types. Furthermore, the loss of p38γ in mice led to decreased muscle mass associated with a smaller myofiber diameter in slow muscle, but there was no impact on fast muscle in either mass or myofiber diameter. Finally, p38γ-deficient muscle showed selective changes in genes related to muscle growth in slow muscle fibers.CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that p38γ is selectively activated in slow skeletal muscle and is involved in the normal growth and development of a subset of skeletal muscle."

We have examined the effects of co-administration of the vitamin D receptor agonist, paricalcitol, on the hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis produced by chronic angiotensin II (AII) infusion. Administration of AII (800ng/kg/min) over a 14-day period resulted in increased blood pressure, myocyte hypertrophy, activation of the hypertrophic fetal gene program (atrial natriuretic peptide, B-type natriuretic peptide and alpha skeletal actin gene expression), increased expression of the pro-hypertrophic modulatory calcineurin inhibitor protein 1 (MCIP 1), and increased fibrosis with augmented procollagen 1 and 3 gene expression. In each case co-administration of paricalcitol (300ng/kg intraperitoneally every 48h) at least partially reversed the AII-dependent effect. These studies demonstrate that the liganded vitamin D receptor possesses potent anti-hypertrophic activity in this non-renin-dependent model of cardiac hypertrophy. The anti-hypertrophic activity appears to be at least partially intrinsic to the cardiac myocyte and may involve suppression of the MCIP 1 protein. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Vitamin D Workshop'."

Changes in the epigenetic and miRNA regulatory landscape can dramatically alter the outcome of a stress response. However, little is known about the scope and extent of these regulatory factors on drought related cellular processes and functions. To this end, we selected a list of 5468 drought responsive genes (DRGs) of rice identified in multiple microarray studies and mapped the DNA methylation regions found in a genome wide methylcytosine immunoprecipitation and sequencing (mCIP-Seq) study to their genic and promoter regions, identified the chromatin remodeling genes and the genes that are targets of miRNAs. We found statistically significant enrichment of DNA methylation reads and miRNA target sequences in DRGs compared to a random set of genes. About 75% of the DRGs annotated to be involved in chromatin remodeling were downregulated. We found one-third of the DRGs are targeted by two-thirds of all known/predicted miRNAs in rice which include many transcription factors targeted by more than five miRNAs. Clustering analysis of the DRGs with epigenetic and miRNA features revealed, upregulated cluster was enriched in drought tolerance mechanisms while the downregulated cluster was enriched in drought resistance mechanisms evident by their unique gene ontologies (GOs), protein-protein interactions (PPIs), specific transcription factors, protein domains and metabolic pathways. Further, we analyzed the proteome of two weeks old young rice plants treated with a global demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine (5-azaC), subjected to drought stress and identified 56 protein spots that are differentially expressed. Out of the 56 spots, 35 were differently expressed in the sample with both demethylation and drought stress treatments and 28 (50%) were part of DRGs considered in the bioinformatic analysis."

While DNA methylation changes in adaption to repeated stress exposure are established for a variety of drugs, their role in fractioned ionizing radiation is largely unknown.MATERIAL AND METHODS: MCF7 breast cancer cells were treated 5 times a week with IR in fractions of 2 Gy, resulting in total doses of 10 and 20 Gy. Cells were harvested 48 and 72 h after the last irradiation, as well as after a recovery period of at least 14 d. To identify genes differentially methylated in irradiated versus non-irradiated cells, we used methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation (MCIp) followed by global methylation profiling on CpG island microarrays.RESULTS: MCIp profiling revealed methylation changes in several CpG islands 48 h after FIR with 10 and 20 Gy. Cells receiving a total dose of 10 Gy started regrowing after 14 d and exhibited similar radioresistance as mock-treated cells. Differential methylation of the CpG units associated with FOXC1 (p&lt;0.001) and TRAPPC9 (p&lt;0.001) could be confirmed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Sequenom).CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these data indicate that regrowth of MCF7 cells after 10 Gy FIR is associated with locus-specific alterations in DNA methylation."

The aim of this study was undertaken to clarify the cytological immunoreactivity of nuclear findings about CCSC and MCIP which may be recognized in EGBD cases by using p53 protein and cyclin A in liquid-based cytologic (LBC) preparations. The material consists of cytologic smears of 20 cases of EGBD and 20 cases of G1 for which histopathological diagnosis was obtained by endometrial curettage at the JA Suzuka General Hospital. The evaluation of immunoreactivity was performed by using the intensity of nuclear staining and the nuclear labeling index (N-LI). The intensity of nuclear staining was scored as negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), or strong (3). The N-LI was scored as less than 10% (0), from 10 to 25% (1), from 26 to 50% (2), or greater than 50% (3). The final score was calculated of the addition of both partial scores. Results are as follows: As for the p53 protein immunoreactivity, CCC (2.4 ± 1.4) was a significantly higher value in comparison with CCSC (0) and MCIP (0.8 ± 0.4), respectively. As for the cyclin A immunoreactivity, CCC (2.8 ± 1.1) was a significantly higher value in comparison with CCSC (0) and MCIP (0.6 ± 0.5), respectively. CCSC and MCIP in EGBD are misunderstood as cellular atypia and structural atypia on occasion; but, as for results of the immunoreactivity scores of p53 protein and cyclin A in our study, it seemed that those biochemical characters proved that the biological activity level was low (or degenerative). The results of the current study demonstrated that the cytological immunoreactivity of nuclear findings by p53 and cyclin A appear to be more useful for the LBC assessment of endometrial lesions, especially for the discrimination of EGBD and G1."

The present study was performed to investigate causality of this inverse relationship under in vivo conditions in the transversal aortic constriction mouse model (TAC). Left ventricular SERCA-mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in TAC by 32% after 6 h, but not different from sham after 24 h. Serum proANP and BNP levels were increased in TAC after 24 h (BNP +274%, p &lt; 0.01; proANP +60%, p &lt; 0.05), but only proANP levels were increased after 6 h (+182%, p &lt; 0.01). cGMP levels were only increased 24 h after TAC (+307%, p &lt; 0.01), but not 6 h after TAC. BNP infusion inhibited the increase in SERCA expression 6 h after TAC. In BNP-receptor-knockout animals (GC-A), the expression of SERCA was still significantly increased 24 h after TAC at the mRNA level by 35% (p &lt; 0.05), as well as at the protein level by 25% (p &lt; 0.05). MCIP expression as an indicator of calcineurin activity was regulated in parallel to SERCA after 6 and 24 h. MCIP-mRNA was increased by 333% 6 h after TAC, but not significantly different from sham after 24 h. In the GC-A-KO mice, MCIP-mRNA was significantly increased in TAC compared to WT after 24 h. In mice with BNP infusion, MCIP was significantly lower 6 h after TAC compared to control animals. In conclusion, mechanical load leads to an upregulation of SERCA expression. This is followed by upregulation of natriuretic peptides with subsequent suppression of SERCA upregulation. Elevated natriuretic peptides may suppress SERCA expression by inhibition of calcineurin activity via activation of GC-A."
"18372323";"MCIp";"MCIp";"Endocrinology";25;2008;"Estrogen inhibits cardiac hypertrophy: role of estrogen receptor-beta to inhibit calcineurin.";"Estrogen has been reported to prevent development of cardiac hypertrophy in female rodent models and in humans. However, the mechanisms of sex steroid action are incompletely understood. We determined the cellular effects by which 17beta-estradiol (E2) inhibits angiotensin II (AngII)-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo. Two weeks of angiotensin infusion in female mice resulted in marked hypertrophy of the left ventricle, exacerbated by the loss of ovarian steroid hormones from oophorectomy. Hypertrophy was 51% reversed by the administration of E2 (insertion of 0.1 mg/21-d-release tablets). The effects of E2 were mainly mediated by the estrogen receptor (ER) beta-isoform, because E2 had little effect in ERbeta-null mice but comparably inhibited AngII-induced hypertrophy in wild-type or ERalpha-null mice. AngII induced a switch of myosin heavy chain production from alpha to beta, but this was inhibited by E2 via ERbeta. AngII-induced ERK activation was also inhibited by E2 through the beta-receptor. E2 stimulated brain natriuretic peptide protein expression and substantially prevented ventricular interstitial cardiac fibrosis (collagen deposition) as induced by AngII. Importantly, E2 inhibited calcineurin activity that was stimulated by AngII, related to E2 stimulating the modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein (MCIP) 1 gene and protein expression. E2 acting mainly through ERbeta mitigates the important signaling by AngII that produces cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in female mice."

Aberrant (m)C patterns are associated with heritable developmental abnormalities in plants and with cancer in mammals. We have developed a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling technology employing a novel amplification step for DNA subjected to bisulfite-mediated cytosine conversion. The methylation patterns detected are not only consistent with previous results obtained with (m)C immunoprecipitation (mCIP) techniques, but also demonstrated improved resolution and sensitivity. The technology, named BiMP (for Bisulfite Methylation Profiling), is more cost-effective than mCIP and requires as little as 100 ng of Arabidopsis DNA."

The pathogenic processes in neurodegenerative diseases are closely related to oxidative stress and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Therefore, we investigated whether oxidative stress induces a change in the protein level of RCAN1 through the UPS. H2O2 induced ubiquitination of RCAN1 at the same concentrations as those causing a decrease in RCAN1 in HEK293T cells. beta-TrCP, the F-box protein component of SCF ubiquitin ligase, interacted with RCAN1 in response to H2O2 stimulation. Although FBW4, another F-box protein, interacted with RCAN1, its interaction was independent of H2O2 stimulation. In vitro ubiquitination assay showed that SCFbeta-TrCP but not SCFFBW4 increased ubiquitination of RCAN1, dependent on H2O2 stimulation. In addition, knockdown of beta-TrCP by siRNA abolished the H2O2-induced decrease in RCAN1 in HEK293T cells. We further examined whether RCAN1 undergoes ubiquitination by H2O2 in primary neurons, similarly to that in HEK293T cells. An H2O2-induced decrease in RCAN1 was exhibited also in hippocampal and cortical neurons. Ubiquitination of RCAN1 was induced by 500 muM H2O2, the concentration at which H2O2 induced a decrease in RCAN1 in primary neurons. These results suggest that H2O2 induces SCF beta-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination of RCAN1, leading to a decrease in the protein level of RCAN1."

TH affect muscle properties through nuclear receptors; they act either by a positive or a negative control on target genes that encode proteins accounting for contractile or metabolic phenotypes. Contractile activity and muscle load also affect muscle phenotype; several intracellular signaling pathways are involved in the transduction of signals related to contractile activity, including the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. Calcineurin activity is negatively controlled by MCIP-1 protein (modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein-1). We recently performed an experiment aimed at examining the specific and combined effects of the pharmacological calcineurin inhibition (using cyclosporin-A CsA administration) and thyroid hormone deficiency. The expected effects of CsA administration were only observed if TH were available, while thyroid deficiency totally blunted the muscle responses to calcineurin inhibition. In conditions of thyroid hormone deficiency, there was no response to the pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin, usually known to induce a slow-to-fast IIA transition associated with an enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis in normothyroid rats. Moreover, thyroid deficiency markedly decreased the expression of MCIP-1 and MCIP-2 mRNA and proteins, two endogenous calcineurin inhibitors; such results clearly suggest that thyroid hormone and calcineurin pathways are interconnected."

Here we applied methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation (MCIp) to obtain comparative methylation profiles of coding and noncoding genes in three human tissues, testis, brain, and monocytes. Forty-four mainly testis-specific promoters were independently validated using bisulfite sequencing or single-gene MCIp, confirming the results obtained by the MCIp microarray approach. We demonstrate the previously unknown somatic hypermethylation at many CpG-rich, testis-specific gene promoters, in particular in ampliconic areas of the Y chromosome. We also identify a number of miRNA genes showing tissue-specific methylation patterns. The comparison of the obtained tissue methylation profiles with corresponding gene expression data indicates a significant association between tissue-specific promoter methylation and gene expression, not only in CpG-rich promoters. In summary, our study highlights the exceptional epigenetic status of germ-line cells in testis and provides a global insight into tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns."

Accordingly, there has been much interest in studying the role of biomechanical forces in cell biology and pathophysiology. This has led to the introduction and even commercialization of many experimental devices. Many of the early devices were limited by the heterogeneity of deformation of cells cultivated in different locations of the culture plate membranes and were also attached with complicated technical/electronic efforts resulting in a restriction of the reproducibility of these devices. The objective of this study was to design and build a simple device to allow the application of dose-dependent homogeneous equibiaxial static stretch to cells cultured on flexible silicone membranes to investigate biological and biomedical questions. In addition, cultured neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes were stretched with the proposed device with different strain gradients. For the first time with this study we could demonstrate that stretch up to 21% caused dose-dependent changes in biological markers such as the calcineurin activity, modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein-1, voltage-gated potassium channel isoform 4.2, and voltage-gated K(+) channel-interacting proteins-2 gene expression and transient outward potassium current densities but not the protein-to-DNA ratio and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA. With both markers mentioned last, dose-dependent stretch alterations could only be achieved with stretch up to 13%. The simple and low-cost device presented here might be applied to a wide range of experimental settings in different fields of research."

Such differences in heat tolerance may be related to particularities in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activation. To further this hypothesis, 80 rats instrumented with a telemetric device for abdominal temperature (Tabd) measurement were separated into two groups. Sixty-eight rats were exposed during 90 min at an ambient temperature of 40 degrees C, and 12 rats to an ambient temperature of 22 degrees C. Heat-exposed rats were then divided into three groups using the a posteriori k-means clustering method according to their Tabd level at the end of heat exposure. Heat tolerant rats (Tol, n=30) exhibiting the lowest Tabd showed a slight dehydration, a moderate triglyceride mobilization, but the highest plasma adrenocorticotropic-hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone levels. Conversely, heat exhausted rats (HE, n=14) presented the highest Tabd, a higher degree of dehydration, a greater metabolic imbalance with the lowest plasma triglyceride level and the highest lactate concentration, as well as a lowest plasma corticosterone and ACTH levels. The fact that the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA content within the pituitary was low despite of a high c-fos mRNA level is also relevant. Current inflammatory processes in HE rats were underlined by lower inhibitory factor kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) mRNA and higher tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) mRNA. In conclusion, data show that intolerance to heat exposure is associated to an HPA axis impairment, possibly related to changes occurring in the IkappaBalpha and TNF-alpha mRNA levels."

Relevance to heart failure.";"Changes in thyroid status are associated with profound alterations in biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle, although its impact on cardiac energy metabolism is still debated. Similarities between the changes in cardiac gene expression in pathological hypertrophy leading to heart failure and hypothyroidism prompted scientists to suggest a role for thyroid hormone status in the development of metabolic and functional alterations in this disease. We thus investigated the effects of hypothyroidism on cardiac energy metabolism. Hypothyroid state (HYPO) was induced by thyroidectomy and propyl-thio-uracyl in male rats for 3 weeks. We examined the effects of hypothyroid state on oxidative capacity and mitochondrial substrate utilization by measuring oxygen consumption of saponin permeabilized cardiac fibers, mitochondrial biogenesis by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and energy metabolism, and energy transfer enzymes by spectrophotometry. The results show that maximal oxidative capacity of the myocardium was decreased from 24.9 +/- 0.9 in control (CT) to 19.3 +/- 0.7 micromol O(2) min(-1) g dry weight(-1) in HYPO. However, protein content and messenger RNA (mRNA) of PGC-1alpha and mRNA of its transcription cascade that is thought to control mitochondrial content in normal myocardium and heart failure, were unchanged in HYPO. Mitochondrial utilization of glycerol-3P (-70%), malate (-45%), and octanoate (-24%) but not pyruvate was decreased in HYPO. Moreover, the creatine kinase system and energy transfer were hardly affected in HYPO. Besides, hypothyroidism decreased the activation of other signaling pathways like p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, AMP-activated protein kinase, and calcineurin. These results show that cellular hypothyroidism can hardly account for the specific energetic alterations of heart failure."
"17971515";"MCIp";"MCIp";"Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab";1;2007;"Thyroid hormone is required for the phenotype transitions induced by the pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin in adult soleus muscle of rats.";"The present experiment was designed to examine the effects of hypothyroidism and calcineurin inhibition induced by cyclosporin A (CsA) administration on both contractile and metabolic soleus muscle phenotypes, with a novel approach to the signaling pathway controlling mitochondrial biogenesis. Twenty-eight rats were randomly assigned to four groups, normothyroid, hypothyroid, and orally treated with either CsA (25 mg/kg, N-CsA and H-CsA) or vehicle (N-Vh and H-Vh), for 3 wk. Muscle phenotype was estimated by the MHC profile and activities of oxidative and glycolytic enzymes. We measured mRNA levels of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), the major regulator of mitochondrial content. We also studied the expression of the catalytic A-subunit of calcineurin (CnA) both at protein and transcript levels and mRNA levels of modulatory calcineurin inhibitor proteins (MCIP)-1 and -2, which are differentially regulated by calcineurin activity and thyroid hormone, respectively. CsA-administration induced a slow-to-fast MHC transition limited to the type IIA isoform, which is associated with increased oxidative capacities. Hypothyroidism strongly decreased both the expression of fast MHC isoforms and oxidative capacities. Effects of CsA administration on muscle phenotype were blocked in conditions of thyroid hormone deficiency. Changes in the oxidative profile were strongly related to PGC-1 alpha changes and associated with phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Calcineurin and MCIPs mRNA levels were decreased by both hypothyroidism and CsA without additive effects. Taken together, these results suggest that adult muscle phenotype is primarily under the control of thyroid state. Physiological levels of thyroid hormone are required for the effects of calcineurin inhibition on slow oxidative muscle phenotype."

The removal of the embedded copper salicylate from MCEP to prepare metal-chelate imprinted polymer (MCIP) was assessed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques. Conventional or non-imprinted polymer material was prepared in a similar manner to MCEP, but without the addition of copper salicylate to the synthesis recipe. The drug release behaviour was examined in vitro with polymer materials having different template to monomer ratio, different crosslinker density and with polymer material loaded with copper salicylate to different extent. Detailed drug release studies with the drug loaded to MCIP and NIP materials unequivocally establish the higher and sustained release of the therapeutic agent over several days in addition to higher drug loading capacity with the former material."

In cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes, Foxo transcription factors trigger an atrophy-related gene program that counters hypertrophic growth. However, downstream molecular events are not yet well defined.METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report that expression of either Foxo1 or Foxo3 in cardiomyocytes attenuates calcineurin phosphatase activity and inhibits agonist-induced hypertrophic growth. Consistent with these results, Foxo proteins decrease calcineurin phosphatase activity and repress both basal and hypertrophic agonist-induced expression of MCIP1.4, a direct downstream target of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. Furthermore, hearts from Foxo3-null mice exhibit increased MCIP1.4 abundance and a hypertrophic phenotype with normal systolic function at baseline. Together, these results suggest that Foxo proteins repress cardiac growth at least in part through inhibition of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. Given that hypertrophic growth of the heart occurs in multiple contexts, our findings also suggest that certain hypertrophic signals are capable of overriding the antigrowth program induced by Foxo. Consistent with this, multiple hypertrophic agonists triggered inactivation of Foxo proteins in cardiomyocytes through a mechanism requiring the PI3K/Akt pathway. In addition, both Foxo1 and Foxo3 are phosphorylated and consequently inactivated in hearts undergoing hypertrophic growth induced by hemodynamic stress.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that inhibition of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling cascade by Foxo and release of this repressive action by the PI3K/Akt pathway are important mechanisms whereby Foxo factors govern cell growth in the heart."

The physiologic function of MCIP remains an area of ongoing investigation, because both positive and negative calcineurin regulatory effects have been reported. Here we disrupted the mcip1 and mcip2 genes in the mouse and provide multiple lines of evidence that endogenous MCIP functions as a calcineurin facilitator in vivo. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in both mcip1/2 showed impaired activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), suggesting that MCIP is required for efficient calcineurin-NFAT coupling. Mice deficient in mcip1/2 showed a dramatic impairment in cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload, neuroendocrine stimulation, or exercise, similar to mice lacking calcineurin Abeta. Moreover, simultaneous deletion of calcineurin Abeta in the mcip1/2-null background did not rescue impaired hypertrophic growth after pressure overload. Slow/oxidative fiber-type switching in skeletal muscle after exercise stimulation was also impaired in mcip1/2 mice, similar to calcineurin Abeta-null mice. Moreover, CD4(+) T cells from mcip1/2-null mice showed enhanced apoptosis that was further increased by loss of calcineurin Abeta. Finally, mcip1/2-null mice displayed a neurologic phenotype that was similar to calcineurin Abeta-null mice, such as increased locomotor activity and impaired working memory. Thus, a loss-of-function analysis suggests that MCIPs serve either a permissive or facilitative function for calcineurin-NFAT signaling in vivo."

Although overexpression experiments in several organisms have revealed that MCIPs inhibit calcineurin activity , their in vivo functions remain unclear. Here, we show that the Drosophila MCIP sarah (sra) is essential for meiotic progression in oocytes. Eggs from sra null mothers are arrested at anaphase of meiosis I. This phenotype was due to loss of function of sra specifically in the female germline. Sra is physically associated with the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, and its overexpression suppresses the phenotypes caused by constitutively activated calcineurin, such as rough eye or loss of wing veins. Hyperactivation of calcineurin signaling in the germline cells resulted in a meiotic-arrest phenotype, which can also be suppressed by overexpression of Sra. All these results support the hypothesis that Sra regulates female meiosis by controlling calcineurin activity in the germline. To our knowledge, this is the first unambiguous demonstration that the regulation of calcineurin signaling by MCIPs plays a critical role in a defined biological process."

Cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibits calcium-induced calcineurin activation and blocks the stabilization of HIF-1alpha in cultured cells.OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that treatment of rats with CsA would prevent HIF-1-dependent gene transcription, lower specific responses to acute hypoxia, and prevent pulmonary hypertension and right ventricle hypertrophy resulting from prolonged exposure to hypoxia.METHODS: Acute and chronic responses to hypoxia were studied in rats treated or not treated with CsA (25 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)).MEASUREMENTS: Transcript levels of genes encoding the serotonin transporter or four HIF-1 target genes, in rats exposed for 6 h to ambient hypoxia, treated or not by CsA, were measured. In vivo hemodynamics, hematocrit, and heart morphologic characteristics were assessed in rats subjected to hypoxia for 3 wk, treated or not treated with CsA. Changes in mRNA levels of the modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein-1 (MCIP-1) were used as a sensitive indicator of calcineurin activity in lung and heart.MAIN RESULTS: Acute exposure to hypoxia led to a marked increase in mRNA levels of serotonin transporter, modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein-1, and HIF-1 target genes, which was blunted by CsA treatment. Prolonged exposure to hypoxia raised right ventricle pressure, induced right ventricle hypertrophy, and activated cardiac calcineurin, effects that were fully prevented by CsA treatment.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CsA prevents hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension and right ventricle hypertrophy, either by inhibiting HIF-1 transcriptional activity in lung, by decreasing calcineurin activity in lung and heart, by direct effects of CsA, or by a combination of these factors."
"17046757";"MCIp";"MCIp";"FEBS Lett";8;2006;"Switching feedback mechanisms realize the dual role of MCIP in the regulation of calcineurin activity.";"Calcineurin (CaN) assists T-cell activation, growth and differentiation of skeletal and cardiac myocytes, memory, and apoptosis. It also activates transcription of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) family including hypertrophic target genes. It has been reported that the modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein (MCIP) inhibits the CaN activity and thereby reduces the hypertrophic response. However, it has been shown that MCIP facilitates or permits the hypertrophic response under some stress conditions such as isoproterenol infusion or pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction. As there is no direct experimental evidence that can explain these paradoxical phenomena, there has been a controversy concerning the functional role of MCIP in developing the hypertrophic response. It is therefore crucial to establish a hypothesis that can clearly explain these phenomena. Towards this end, we propose in this paper a hypothesis that is based on available experimental evidence as well as mathematical modeling and computer simulations. We hypothesize that there is a threshold in the nuclear NFAT concentration above which MCIP is switched on. Below this threshold, the inhibition of active CaN by MCIP is negligible, while the activated protein kinase increases the dissociation rate of the CaN/MCIP complex. This leads to an augmentation of active CaN. This mechanism realizes the positive effect (i.e., removing any negative feedback) of MCIP in the hypertrophic response. On the other hand, the over-expression of active CaN increases nuclear NFAT to values above the threshold, while CaN is inhibited through binding of MCIP (expressed by the nuclear NFAT). This mechanism realizes the introduction of a negative feedback mechanism. To unravel this switching feedback mechanism, we have developed a mathematical model for which computer simulations are in agreement with the existing experimental data. The simulations demonstrate how the apparently paradoxical behavior can emerge as a result of cellular conditions."

Rats were treated with two specific calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506, or vehicle (Vhl); they were then subjected to exhaustive treadmill running. Modulatory Calcineurin-Interacting Protein-1 (MCIP-1) mRNA levels, a reliable indicator of calcineurin activity, and IL-6 mRNA levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR in soleus muscles, and IL-6 protein concentration was measured in the plasma. Because low carbohydrates availability enhances IL-6 transcription through p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway, muscle glycogen content and glycaemia were measured and p38 MAPK phosphorylation was determined in skeletal muscle by western blotting. As expected, exercise induced an increase in IL-6 (P &lt; 0.01) and MCIP-1 mRNA (P &lt; 0.01) in soleus muscle of Vhl rats, and enhanced p38 phosphorylation and plasmatic IL-6 protein (P &lt; 0.05). Calcineurin inhibition did not affect running time, glycemia or soleus glycogen content. CsA administration totally inhibited the exercise-induced increase in MCIP-1 mRNA (P &lt; 0.01), blunted the IL-6 gene transcription related to muscle activity, and suppressed the changes in IL-6 protein in plasma. In addition to its inhibition of calcineurin activity, FK506 administration totally suppressed the exercise-induced IL-6 gene transcription, likely by an inhibition of p38 activation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in addition to p38 MAPK, increased calcineurin activity is one of the signalling events involved in IL-6 gene transcription."

The present work aimed to analyze the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs), and of Cn in patients with compensated LVH. By semiquantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and gelatine zymography, we determined mRNA, protein, and/or enzyme activity levels of MMPs, TIMPs, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), Cn subunits, and of the modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein (MCIP) 1. Myocardial samples from patients showing severe aortic stenosis, normal ejection fraction, and compensated LVH were compared with autopsy samples from healthy hearts. LVH patients showed upregulation of CnA-beta mRNA but downregulation of both CnB-alpha mRNA and protein. Total Cn activity (as determined through NF-AT phosphorylation and MCIP1 mRNA expression) was unchanged. There were no differences in gene expression and activities of MMP-2, MMP-9, and of TIMPs 1-4 between LVH patients and controls. As expected, ANP mRNA expression was high in LVH patients. We propose a prominent role for CnB in controlling Cn activity in compensated LVH. At this stage of the disease, MMP and TIMP activities are balanced."

LVH can be concentric (cLVH) but subsequent dilatation and progression to eccentric hypertrophy (eLVH) may lead to global pump failure. Recently, several endogenous molecular inhibitors of hypertrophy have been identified. Using real-time PCR, we compared the myocardial mRNA expression of these inhibitors in pressure-overload induced cLVH (severe aortic stenosis) and in volume overload-induced eLVH (severe mitral regurgitation) in patients, and during the progression from cLVH to eLVH in pressure overload in rat. Each of these genes showed a unique temporal expression profile. Strikingly, except for SOCS-3, changes in gene expression of these negative regulators in rat cLVH and eLVH vs sham were recapitulated in human cLVH and eLVH. In particular, VDUP-1 and MCIP-1 were high in cLVH but expression levels were normal in eLVH, both in rat and human. These data indicate that during the progression of LVH, both in pressure and volume overload, expression levels of endogenous inhibitors of hypertrophy are modified and that these changes may have pathophysiological significance. In particular, MCIP-1 (the endogenous calcineurin inhibitor) and VDUP-1 (the endogenous inhibitor of thioredoxin) are potential molecular switches in the progression of LV hypertrophy."

Forty-two days after notexin-induced degeneration of left SOL muscles, rats were treated with CsA (25 mg/kg x day) or vehicle daily for 3 weeks. CsA administration decreased by eightfold the level of transcription of MCIP-1, a well-known calcineurin-induced gene, in intact as well as in regenerated muscles (P &lt; 0.001). In response to CsA-administration we observed a slow-to-fast transition in the MHC profile, more marked in regenerated than in intact muscles (P &lt; 0.05), but mainly restricted to MHC-Ibeta toward MHC-IIA. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that MHC-IIA was often co-expressed with MHC-Ibeta within myofibers of intact muscles, whereas it was mainly expressed within pure fast fibers of regenerated muscles. MHC-Ibeta mRNA levels were lower in regenerated than in intact muscles, but did not change in response to CsA-administration. CsA administration induced a significant increase in MHC-IIA mRNA levels (P &lt; 0.001) similar in both intact and regenerated muscles. Present results suggest that in vivo in intact SOL muscles, calcineurin blocks the upregulation of the MHC-IIA isoform at the transcriptional level. On the other hand, the higher response of regenerated muscles to CsA administration cannot be explained by transcriptional events, and may result from either a more rapid turnover of MHC proteins in regenerated muscles than in intact ones, or translational events. This study further suggests that the developmental history of myofibers could play a role in the adaptability of skeletal muscle to variations in neuromuscular activity."

Histopathology of patients with dysfunctional uterine bleeding due to an anovulatory cycle usually contain endometrial glandular and stromal breakdown (EGBD) and papillary metaplasia on the endometrial surface epithelium, if an appropriate sample has been collected. We often recognized abnormal cell clumps in the cytological smears with EGBD cases. They were composed of metaplastic cells, and some irregular small projection figures were observed from the margins of the cell clumps. We describe the quantitation of metaplastic clumps with irregular protrusions (MCIP) in endometrial endocyte samples. The current study presents the cytomorphological characteristics of the metaplastic changes recognized in EGBD cases. During a 7-yr period, 144 cases for which histopathological diagnoses were obtained following endometrial curettage, after collecting a direct endometrial sample using the endocyte. The material comprised 49 cases of normal proliferative endometrium (NPE) (patients aged 28-51, average 39.9), 32 cases of EGBD (patients aged 30-67, average 49.6), and 63 cases of endometrial hyperplasia without atypia (EH) (patients aged 35-65, average 47.7). The following points were investigated: (1) the occurrence of metaplastic cells; (2) the occurrence and the frequency of MCIP; and (3) the occurrence of MCIP that contains condensed stromal clusters. Metaplastic cells were seen in 93.8% of the EGBD cases. Cytomorphologic pattern identified with MCIP was 90.6%, and its frequency showed 16.1%. The occurrence of MCIP that contain condensed stromal clusters (93.1%) showed a strong association in comparison with other lesions, such as NPE and EH. Our data appear to indicate that the appearance of MCIP with condensed stromal clusters originated from the papillary metaplasia, which occurred on the endometrial surface epithelium. The cytologic observation of those cells may be a useful indicator for providing the nature of EGBD endometrium."

Metastin, a product of the KiSS-1 gene, is an endogenously expressed metastasis suppressor that is the ligand for G protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPR54), a Gq/11-coupled receptor. In the present study, our goal was to define the basis of GPR54 action using thyroid cancer cells as a model.DESIGN AND RESULTS: We used GPR54-null thyroid cancer cells to create a stable GPR54 overexpression model. Cell growth and cell migration of the GPR54-expressing lines were inhibited by recombinant metastin, and metastin stimulated the protein kinase C, ERK, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathways. To identify metastin-regulated genes, we performed microarray analyses using RNA isolated from GPR54 stable transfectants before and after 1 and 24 h of metastin stimulation. Consistent increases in expression of the gene encoding myocyte-enriched calcineurin interacting protein 1 (MCIP-1), an inhibitor of calcineurin, were identified and confirmed using real-time RT-PCR and Western blot. Functionally, metastin treatment of GPR54-expressing cells initially increased calcineurin activity, followed by a prolonged reduction in calcineurin activity for 24 and 48 h, consistent with the pattern of MCIP-1 expression. In addition, treatment with cyclosporin A, a calcineurin inhibitor, blocked cell migration. Lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid cancers demonstrated loss of MCIP-1 expression in comparison with primary tumors.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a role for MCIP-1 and calcineurin inhibition in GPR54-mediated metastasis suppression in human cancers."

Individual myofibres were isolated from plantaris and soleus muscles of rats at the end of an exhaustive running exercise test (n = 10), categorized according to their myosin heavy chain isoform content, and compared to those of resting rats (n = 10). Using real-time PCR analysis in individual fibres, a marked rise in IL-6 transcript levels occurred in type I and IIa fibres at the end of exercise (P &lt; 0.05). Transcription of the gene encoding for the modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein-1 (MCIP-1), a sensitive indicator of calcineurin activity, also mainly increased in type I and IIa fibres (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, a slight increase in MCIP-1 mRNA levels was observed in type IIx (P &lt; 0.05). Fibre types determined by immunohistochemistry were qualitatively examined for glycogen content using periodic acid-Shiff staining, and no direct relationship was found, at the cellular level, between glycogen content, fibre-type and IL-6 transcription. Our data clearly suggest that IL-6 gene transcription was mainly observed in early recruited myofibres and that contraction-induced IL-6 transcription could be associated with enhanced calcineurin activity."

We previously reported two major cytosolic isoforms (1 and 4) of Adapt 78, and that isoform 4 is an oxidative and calcium stress-response protein. Using a higher cell culture density and new antibody, we again observed that both major isoforms localized to the cytosol, but a significant level of isoform 4 (but not isoform 1) was also detected in the nucleus where it was present in the non-soluble region and not associated with RNA. Exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide led to the significant loss of isoform 4 from the nucleus with a moderate increase in cytosolic localization. The change in isoform 4 phosphorylation state in response to oxidative stress, characterized by a loss of the lesser (hypo) phosphorylated Adapt 78, was not due to accelerated degradation, although general Adapt 78 degradation was proteosome mediated. Finally, stimulation of Jurkat and primary T-lymphocyte signaling led to isoform 4 induction. This induction was BAPTA, diphenylene iodonium, and N-acetylcysteine inhibitable, and accompanied by induction of the classic immune response mediator and calcineurin-pathway-stimulated interleukin-2. These studies reveal new redox-related activities for Adapt 78 isoform 4, which may contribute to its known calcineurin-regulating and cytoprotective activities, and further suggest that Adapt 78 plays a role in basic T-cell response."

The aim of this project was to determine if cardiac-specific overexpression of the wild-type alpha(1B)-AR results in sustained activation of the ERK pathway. At 3 and 9 months, ERK activity was increased in alpha(1B)-AR overexpressing hearts relative to non-transgenic animals. Similarly, phosphorylation of MEK and p90(rsk) were also elevated. MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), which inactivate MAP kinases, are transcriptionally regulated. MKP2 mRNA levels were reduced at 3 months in alpha(1B)-AR overexpressing hearts. Interestingly, there was a general trend for reduced expression of MKP-1, -2, and -3 with increased age. In addition, expression of the modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein (MCIP) 1, an indicator of calcineurin activity, was elevated 3-fold in alpha(1B)-AR overexpressing hearts at both 3 and 9 months. These results indicate that the overexpression of the wild-type alpha(1B)-AR leads to chronic changes in the activation of signalling pathways previously shown to be associated with the hypertrophic response."

Both modeling systems were applied to an ozone episode that occurred along the I-5 urban corridor in western Washington and Oregon during July 11-14, 1996. Both models employed the same modeling domain and used the same detailed gridded emission inventory. The CMAQ model was run using both the CB-IV and RADM2 chemical mechanisms, while CALGRID was used with the SAPRC-97 chemical mechanism. Outputfrom the Mesoscale Meteorological Model (MM5) employed with observational nudging was used in both models. The two modeling systems, representing three chemical mechanisms and two sets of meteorological inputs, were evaluated in terms of statistical performance measures for both 1- and 8-h average observed ozone concentrations. The results showed that the different versions of the systems were more similar than different, and all versions performed well in the Portland region and downwind of Seattle but performed poorly in the more rural region north of Seattle. Improving the meteorological input into the CALGRID/CALMET system with planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameters from the Models-3/CMAQ meteorology preprocessor (MCIP) improved the performance of the CALGRID/CALMET system. The 8-h ensemble case was often the best performer of all the cases indicating that the models perform better over longer analysis periods. The 1-h ensemble case, derived from all runs, was not necessarily an improvement over the five individual cases, but the standard deviation about the mean provided a measure of overall modeling uncertainty. Process analysis was applied to examine the contribution of the individual processes to the species conservation equation. The process analysis results indicated that the two modeling systems arrive at similar solutions by very different means. Transport rates are faster and exhibit greater fluctuations in the CMAQ cases than in the CALGRID cases, which lead to different placement of the urban ozone plumes. The CALGRID cases, which rely on the SAPRC97 chemical mechanism, exhibited a greater diurnal production/loss cycle of ozone concentrations per hour compared to either the RADM2 or CBIV chemical mechanisms in the CMAQ cases. These results demonstrate the need for specialized process field measurements to confirm whether we are modeling ozone with valid processes."

MCIP proteins can bind to and inhibit calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-regulated serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is activated during cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Transcription of the mammalian MCIP1 gene is induced by calcineurin, suggesting that it functions as an endogenous feedback regulator of calcineurin signal transduction. Forced expression of human MCIP1 protein in the hearts of transgenic mice attenuates the hypertrophic response to a broad range of stimuli. This review summarizes work from a number of laboratories on the structure, regulation, and function of MCIP proteins."

Calcineurin activity is suppressed by association with modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein (MCIP)1DSCR1, which is up-regulated by calcineurin signaling and has been proposed to function in a negative feedback loop to modulate calcineurin activity. To investigate the involvement of MCIP1 in cardiac hypertrophy in vivo, we generated MCIP1 null mice and subjected them to a variety of stress stimuli that induce cardiac hypertrophy. In the absence of stress, MCIP1(-/-) animals exhibited no overt phenotype. However, the lack of MCIP1 exacerbated the hypertrophic response to activated calcineurin expressed from a muscle-specific transgene, consistent with a role of MCIP1 as a negative regulator of calcineurin signaling. Paradoxically, however, cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload or chronic adrenergic stimulation was blunted in MCIP1(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that MCIP1 can facilitate or suppress cardiac calcineurin signaling depending on the nature of the hypertrophic stimulus. These opposing roles of MCIP have important implications for therapeutic strategies to regulate cardiac hypertrophy through modulation of calcineurin-MCIP activity."

In skeletal muscle, fatty acid usage is enhanced and mitochondrial content is increased. The exact molecular mechanisms regulating these functional and structural changes remain to be elucidated. Contractile activity-induced metabolic perturbation has repeatedly been shown to be important for the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis. Recent reports suggest that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha)/mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) pathway is involved in exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. In the present study, nine healthy men performed two 45-min bouts of one-legged knee extension exercise: one bout with restricted blood flow, and the other with nonrestricted blood flow to the working muscle. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle before exercise and at 0, 30, 120, and 360 min after the exercise bout. Biopsies were analyzed for whole muscle, as well as fiber-type specific mRNA expression of myocyte-enriched calcineurin interacting protein (MCIP)-1, PGC-1alpha, and downstream mitochondrial transcription factors. A novel finding was that, in human skeletal muscle, PGC-1alpha mRNA increased more after exercise with restricted blood flow than in the nonrestricted condition. No changes were observed for the mRNA of NRF-1, Tfam, mitochondrial transcription factor B1, and mitochondrial transcription factor B2. Muscle fiber type I and type II did not differ in the basal PGC-1alpha mRNA levels or in the expression increase after ischemic training. Another novel finding was that there was no difference between the restricted and nonrestricted exercise conditions in the increase of MCIP-1 mRNA, a marker for calcineurin activation. This suggests that calcineurin may be activated by exercise in humans and does not exclude that calcineurin could play a role in PGC-1 transcription activation in human skeletal muscle."

In particular, the administration of immunosuppressive drugs that inhibit calcineurin has inconsistent effects in blocking cardiac hypertrophy in various animal models. As an alternative approach to inhibiting calcineurin in the hearts of intact animals, transgenic mice were engineered to overexpress a human cDNA encoding the calcineurin-binding protein, myocyte-enriched calcineurin-interacting protein-1 (hMCIP1) under control of the cardiac-specific, alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter (alpha-MHC). In unstressed mice, forced expression of hMCIP1 resulted in a 5-10% decline in cardiac mass relative to wild-type littermates, but otherwise produced no apparent structural or functional abnormalities. However, cardiac-specific expression of hMCIP1 inhibited cardiac hypertrophy, reinduction of fetal gene expression, and progression to dilated cardiomyopathy that otherwise result from expression of a constitutively active form of calcineurin. Expression of the hMCIP1 transgene also inhibited hypertrophic responses to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation or exercise training. These results demonstrate that levels of hMCIP1 producing no apparent deleterious effects in cells of the normal heart are sufficient to inhibit several forms of cardiac hypertrophy, and suggest an important role for calcineurin signaling in diverse forms of cardiac hypertrophy. The future development of measures to increase expression or activity of MCIP proteins selectively within the heart may have clinical value for prevention of heart failure."
"10722714";"MCIp";"MCIp";"J Biol Chem";96;2000;"A protein encoded within the Down syndrome critical region is enriched in striated muscles and inhibits calcineurin signaling.";"Here we describe a small family of proteins, termed MCIP1 and MCIP2 (for myocyte-enriched calcineurin interacting protein), that are expressed most abundantly in striated muscles and that form a physical complex with calcineurin A. MCIP1 is encoded by DSCR1, a gene located in the Down syndrome critical region. Expression of the MCIP family of proteins is up-regulated during muscle differentiation, and their forced overexpression inhibits calcineurin signaling to a muscle-specific target gene in a myocyte cell background. Binding of MCIP1 to calcineurin A requires sequence motifs that resemble calcineurin interacting domains found in NFAT proteins. The inhibitory action of MCIP1 involves a direct association with the catalytic domain of calcineurin, rather than interference with the function of downstream components of the calcineurin signaling pathway. The interaction between MCIP proteins and calcineurin may modulate calcineurin-dependent pathways that control hypertrophic growth and selective programs of gene expression in striated muscles."
"11110780";"MCIp";"MCIp";"Circ Res";93;2000;"Independent signals control expression of the calcineurin inhibitory proteins MCIP1 and MCIP2 in striated muscles.";"Calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase, modulates gene expression in cardiac and skeletal muscles during development and in remodeling responses such as cardiac hypertrophy that are evoked by environmental stresses or disease. Recently, we identified two genes encoding proteins (MCIP1 and MCIP2) that are enriched in striated muscles and that interact with calcineurin to inhibit its enzymatic activity. In the present study, we show that expression of MCIP1 is regulated by calcineurin activity in hearts of mice with cardiac hypertrophy, as well as in cultured skeletal myotubes. In contrast, expression of MCIP2 in the heart is not altered by activated calcineurin but responds to thyroid hormone, which has no effect on MCIP1. A approximately 900-bp intragenic segment located between exons 3 and 4 of the MCIP1 gene functions as an alternative promoter that responds to calcineurin. This region includes a dense cluster of 15 consensus binding sites for NF-AT transcription factors. Because MCIP proteins can inhibit calcineurin, these results suggest that MCIP1 participates in a negative feedback circuit to diminish potentially deleterious effects of unrestrained calcineurin activity in cardiac and skeletal myocytes. Inhibitory effects of MCIP2 on calcineurin activity may be pertinent to gene switching events driven by thyroid hormone in striated muscles.
