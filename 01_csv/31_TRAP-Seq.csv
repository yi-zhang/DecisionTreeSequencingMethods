Despite the importance of LepRb-containing neurons, the transcriptome and molecular identity of many LepRb subpopulations remain undefined due to the difficulty of studying the small fraction of total cells represented by LepRb neurons in heterogeneous brain regions. Here we sought to examine the transcriptome of LepRb neurons directly and identify markers for functionally relevant LepRb subsets.METHODS: We isolated mRNA from mouse hypothalamic and brainstem LepRb cells by Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) and analyzed it by RNA-seq (TRAP-seq).RESULTS: TRAP mRNA from LepRb cells was enriched for markers of peptidergic neurons, while TRAP-depleted mRNA from non-LepRb cells was enriched for markers of glial and immune cells. Genes encoding secreted proteins that were enriched in hypothalamic and brainstem TRAP mRNA revealed subpopulations of LepRb neurons that contained neuropeptide-encoding genes (including prodynorphin, Pdyn) not previously used as functional markers for LepRb neurons. Furthermore, Pdyn (cre) -mediated ablation of Lepr (flox) in Pdyn-expressing neurons (LepRb (Pdyn) KO mice) blunted energy expenditure to promote obesity during high-fat feeding.CONCLUSIONS: TRAP-seq of CNS LepRb neurons defines the LepRb neuron transcriptome and reveals novel markers for previously unrecognized subpopulations of LepRb neurons."

TRAP is based on the expression of an epitope-tagged version of a ribosomal protein and the affinity purification of ribosomes and associated mRNAs using antibodies conjugated to agarose beads. Quantitative assessment of the translatome is achieved by direct RNA sequencing (RNA-SEQ), which provides accurate quantitation of ribosome-associated mRNAs and reveals alternatively spliced isoforms. Here we present a detailed procedure for TRAP, as well as a guide for preparation of RNA-SEQ libraries (TRAP-SEQ) and a primary data analysis. This methodology enables the study of translational dynamic by assessing rapid changes in translatomes, at organ or cell-type level, during development or in response to endogenous or exogenous stimuli."
