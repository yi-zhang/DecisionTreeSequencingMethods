To reduce the overhead of structure alignment on large-scale data, the specific pairing patterns in the query sequences are ignored. On the other hand, the partial structural information of the target sequences embedded in probing data is retrieved to guide the alignment. Thus the structure alignment problem is transformed into a sequence alignment problem with additional reactivity information. The benchmark results show that the prediction accuracy of ProbeAlign outperforms filter-based CMsearch with high computational efficiency. The application of ProbeAlign to the FragSeq data, which is based on genome-wide structure probing, has demonstrated its capability to search ncRNAs in a large-scale dataset from high-throughput sequencing.CONCLUSIONS: By incorporating high-throughput sequencing-based structure probing information, ProbeAlign can improve the accuracy and efficiency of ncRNA homology search. It is a promising tool for ncRNA functional annotation on genome-wide datasets.AVAILABILITY: The source code of ProbeAlign is available at http://genome.ucf.edu/ProbeAlign."

SeqFold transforms experimental RNA structure information into a structure preference profile (SPP) and uses it to select stable RNA structure candidates representing the structure ensemble. Under a high-dimensional classification framework, SeqFold efficiently matches a given SPP to the most likely cluster of structures sampled from the Boltzmann-weighted ensemble. SeqFold is able to incorporate diverse types of RNA structure profiling data, including parallel analysis of RNA structure (PARS), selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq), fragmentation sequencing (FragSeq) data generated by deep sequencing, and conventional SHAPE data. Using the known structures of a wide range of mRNAs and noncoding RNAs as benchmarks, we demonstrate that SeqFold outperforms or matches existing approaches in accuracy and is more robust to noise in experimental data. Application of SeqFold to reconstruct the secondary structures of the yeast transcriptome reveals the diverse impact of RNA secondary structure on gene regulation, including translation efficiency, transcription initiation, and protein-RNA interactions. SeqFold can be easily adapted to incorporate any new types of high-throughput RNA structure profiling data and is widely applicable to analyze RNA structures in any transcriptome."

The formation of mRNA secondary and tertiary structures is one such regulatory process that until recently it has not been analysed in depth. Formation of these mRNA structures has the potential to enhance and inhibit alternative splicing of transcripts, and regulate rates and amount of translation. As this regulatory mechanism potentially impacts at both the transcriptional and translational level, while also potentially utilising the vast array of non-coding RNAs, it warrants further investigation. Currently, a variety of high-throughput sequencing techniques including parallel analysis of RNA structure (PARS), fragmentation sequencing (FragSeq) and selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) lead the way in the genome-wide identification and analysis of mRNA structure formation. These new sequencing techniques highlight the diversity and complexity of the transcriptome, and demonstrate another regulatory mechanism that could become a target for new therapeutic approaches."

In this study, we propose a novel algorithm to perform iterative updates of a given BPPM, satisfying marginal probability constraints that are (approximately) given by recently developed biochemical experiments, such as SHAPE, PAR, and FragSeq. The method is easily implemented and is applicable to common models for RNA secondary structures, such as energy-based or machine-learning-based models. In this article, we focus mainly on the details of the algorithms, although preliminary computational experiments will also be presented."

To accelerate RNA structure inference, we developed fragmentation sequencing (FragSeq), a high-throughput RNA structure probing method that uses high-throughput RNA sequencing of fragments generated by digestion with nuclease P1, which specifically cleaves single-stranded nucleic acids. In experiments probing the entire mouse nuclear transcriptome, we accurately and simultaneously mapped single-stranded RNA regions in multiple ncRNAs with known structure. We probed in two cell types to verify reproducibility. We also identified and experimentally validated structured regions in ncRNAs with, to our knowledge, no previously reported probing data."
