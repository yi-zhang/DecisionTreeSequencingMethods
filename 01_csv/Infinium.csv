But it has been difficult to detect an accelerated aging effect at a molecular level.METHODS:  Here, we used an epigenetic biomarker of aging based on host DNA methylation levels to study accelerated aging effects due to HIV infection. DNA from brain and blood tissue was assayed via the Illumina Infinium Methylation 450 K platform.RESULTS:  Using 6 novel DNA methylation data sets, we show that HIV infection leads to an increase in epigenetic age both in brain tissue (7.4 years) and blood (5.2 years). While the observed accelerated aging effects in blood may reflect changes in blood cell composition (notably exhausted cytotoxic T cells), it is less clear what explains the observed accelerated aging effects in brain tissue.CONCLUSIONS:  Overall, our results demonstrate that the epigenetic clock is a useful biomarker for detecting accelerated aging effects due to HIV infection. This tool can be used to accurately determine the extent of age acceleration in individual tissues and cells."

Our aim was to uncover molecular pathways and signaling networks exposed by differentially methylated genes informative of the biology of ER(-) breast cancer (BC) subtypes versus ER-positive (ER(+)). Whole-genome methylation array analysis was carried out using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip on 14 primary BC: five ER(+), four triple-negative (TNBC), and five ER(-)HER2(+). Degree of methylation was calculated as a β-value (ranging from 0 to 1), and M-values [log (β/(1 - β)] were used for significance tests. To identify methylated genes associated with ER(-) subtypes (TNBC and ER(-)HER2(+)) and distinct from ER(+), a weighted algorithm, developed to increase statistical rigor, called out genes in which methylation changed dramatically between ER(+) and ER(-) subtypes. Differentially methylated gene lists examined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis called out canonical pathways and networks with clues to biological distinctiveness as well as relatedness between ER(-) subtypes as compared to ER(+) BC. The study highlights the interplay of ER(-) subtype-specific genes and their signaling pathways as potential putative fingerprints in refining classification of BC subtypes and as potential biological markers designed to hit multiple targets."

Comparison of WTs with NRs revealed two WT subgroups; group-2 WTs and NRs were epigenetically indistinguishable whereas group-1 WTs showed an increase in methylation variability, hypomethylation of renal development genes, hypermethylation and relative loss of expression of cell adhesion genes and known and potential new WT tumour suppressor genes (CASP8, H19, MIR195, RB1 and TSPAN32) and was strongly associated with bilateral disease (P = 0.032). Comparison of WTs and NRs to embryonic kidney highlighted the significance of polycomb target methylation in Wilms tumourigenesis.CONCLUSIONS: Methylation levels vary during cancer evolution. We have described biomarkers related to WT evolution from its precursor NRs which may be useful to differentiate between these tissues for patients with bilateral disease."

Prior gene expression and network analyses within the human hippocampus implicate a broader network of genes, termed the GAD1 regulatory network, in regulation of GAD1 expression. Several genes within this GAD1 regulatory network show diagnosis- and sector-specific expression changes within the circuitry of the hippocampus, influencing abnormal GAD1 expression in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that aberrant DNA methylation contributes to circuit- and diagnosis-specific abnormal expression of GAD1 regulatory network genes in psychotic illness.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This epigenetic association study targeting GAD1 regulatory network genes was conducted between July 1, 2012, and June 30, 2014. Postmortem human hippocampus tissue samples were obtained from 8 patients with schizophrenia, 8 patients with bipolar disorder, and 8 healthy control participants matched for age, sex, postmortem interval, and other potential confounds from the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, McLean Hospital, Belmont, Massachusetts. We extracted DNA from laser-microdissected stratum oriens tissue of cornu ammonis 2/3 (CA2/3) and CA1 postmortem human hippocampus, bisulfite modified it, and assessed it with the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc). The subset of CpG loci associated with GAD1 regulatory network genes was analyzed in R version 3.1.0 software (R Foundation) using the minfi package. Findings were validated using bisulfite pyrosequencing.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Methylation levels at 1308 GAD1 regulatory network-associated CpG loci were assessed both as individual sites to identify differentially methylated positions and by sharing information among colocalized probes to identify differentially methylated regions.RESULTS: A total of 146 differentially methylated positions with a false detection rate lower than 0.05 were identified across all 6 groups (2 circuit locations in each of 3 diagnostic categories), and 54 differentially methylated regions with P &lt; .01 were identified in single-group comparisons. Methylation changes were enriched in MSX1, CCND2, and DAXX at specific loci within the hippocampus of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This work demonstrates diagnosis- and circuit-specific DNA methylation changes at a subset of GAD1 regulatory network genes in the human hippocampus in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These genes participate in chromatin regulation and cell cycle control, supporting the concept that the established GABAergic dysfunction in these disorders is related to disruption of GABAergic interneuron physiology at specific circuit locations within the human hippocampus."

The study was conducted as a community-based participatory research project in the Zuni Indians, a small endogamous tribe in rural New Mexico. We recruited 998 members from 28 extended multigenerational families, ascertained through probands with CKD who had at least one sibling with CKD. We used the Illumina Infinium Human1M-Duo version 3.0 BeadChips to type 1.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Prevalence estimates for CKD, hyperuricemia, diabetes, and hypertension were 24%, 30%, 17% and 34%, respectively. We found a significant (p &lt; 1.58 × 10(-7)) association for a SNP in a novel gene for serum creatinine (PTPLAD2). We replicated significant associations for genes with serum uric acid (SLC2A9), triglyceride levels (APOA1, BUD13, ZNF259), and total cholesterol (PVRL2). We found novel suggestive associations (p &lt; 1.58 × 10(-6)) for SNPs in genes with systolic (OLFML2B), and diastolic blood pressure (NFIA). We identified a series of genes associated with CKD and related cardiometabolic phenotypes among Zuni Indians, a population with a high prevalence of kidney disease. Illuminating genetic variations that modulate the risk for these disorders may ultimately provide a basis for novel preventive strategies and therapeutic interventions."

By applying the Infinium iSelect 9K SNP assay, we have constructed a high-density genetic linkage map with 269 F 8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed between a Chinese cornerstone wheat breeding parental line Yanda1817 and a high-yielding line Beinong6. The map contains 2431 SNPs and 128 SSR &amp; EST-SSR markers in a total coverage of 3213.2 cM with an average interval of 1.26 cM per marker. Eighty-eight QTLs for thousand-grain weight (TGW), grain length (GL), grain width (GW) and grain thickness (GT) were detected in nine ecological environments (Beijing, Shijiazhuang and Kaifeng) during five years between 2010-2014 by inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) (LOD ≥ 2.5). Among which, 17 QTLs for TGW were mapped on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 3D, 4A, 4D, 5A, 5B and 6B with phenotypic variations ranging from 2.62% to 12.08%. Four stable QTLs for TGW could be detected in five and seven environments, respectively. Thirty-two QTLs for GL were mapped on chromosomes 1B, 1D, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3B, 3D, 4A, 4B, 4D, 5A, 5B, 6B, 7A and 7B, with phenotypic variations ranging from 2.62% to 44.39%. QGl.cau-2A.2 can be detected in all the environments with the largest phenotypic variations, indicating that it is a major and stable QTL. For GW, 12 QTLs were identified with phenotypic variations range from 3.69% to 12.30%. We found 27 QTLs for GT with phenotypic variations ranged from 2.55% to 36.42%. In particular, QTL QGt.cau-5A.1 with phenotypic variations of 6.82-23.59% was detected in all the nine environments. Moreover, pleiotropic effects were detected for several QTL loci responsible for grain shape and size that could serve as target regions for fine mapping and marker assisted selection in wheat breeding programs."

It is a complex quantitative trait having different components, which can be dissected effectively by genome-wide association study (GWAS). Here, we implemented GWAS to identify loci controlling salinity tolerance in rice. A custom-designed array based on 6,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in as many stress-responsive genes, distributed at an average physical interval of &lt;100 kb on 12 rice chromosomes, was used to genotype 220 rice accessions using Infinium high-throughput assay. Genetic association was analysed with 12 different traits recorded on these accessions under field conditions at reproductive stage. We identified 20 SNPs (loci) significantly associated with Na(+)/K(+) ratio, and 44 SNPs with other traits observed under stress condition. The loci identified for various salinity indices through GWAS explained 5-18% of the phenotypic variance. The region harbouring Saltol, a major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosome 1 in rice, which is known to control salinity tolerance at seedling stage, was detected as a major association with Na(+)/K(+) ratio measured at reproductive stage in our study. In addition to Saltol, we also found GWAS peaks representing new QTLs on chromosomes 4, 6 and 7. The current association mapping panel contained mostly indica accessions that can serve as source of novel salt tolerance genes and alleles. The gene-based SNP array used in this study was found cost-effective and efficient in unveiling genomic regions/candidate genes regulating salinity stress tolerance in rice."

To identify new sources of resistance we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a worldwide collection of 1000 spring wheat accessions. Adult plants were evaluated under field conditions in six environments in the western United States, and seedlings were tested with four Pst races. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Infinium 9K-assay provided 4585 SNPs suitable for GWAS. High correlations among environments and high heritabilities were observed for stripe rust infection type and severity. Greater levels of Pst resistance were observed in a subpopulation from Southern Asia than in other groups. GWAS identified 97 loci that were significant for at least three environments, including 10 with an experiment-wise adjusted Bonferroni probability &lt; 0.10. These 10 quantitative trait loci (QTL) explained 15% of the phenotypic variation in infection type, a percentage that increased to 45% when all QTL were considered. Three of these 10 QTL were mapped far from previously identified Pst resistance genes and QTL, and likely represent new resistance loci. The other seven QTL mapped close to known resistance genes and allelism tests will be required to test their relationships. In summary, this study provides an integrated view of stripe rust resistance resources in spring wheat and identifies new resistance loci that will be useful to diversify the current set of resistance genes deployed to control this devastating disease."

Limited evidence has shown the association of DNA methylation (DNA-M) with eczema. We explored this association at the epigenome-scale to better understand the role of DNA-M. Data from the first generation (F1) of the Isle of Wight (IoW) birth cohort participants and the second generation (F2) were examined in our study. Epigenome-scale DNA methylation of F1 at age 18 years and F2 in cord blood was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip. A total of 307,357 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) in the F1 generation were screened via recursive random forest (RF) for their potential association with eczema at age 18. Functional enrichment and pathway analysis of resulting genes were carried out using DAVID gene functional classification tool. Log-linear models were performed in F1 to corroborate the identified CpGs. Findings in F1 were further replicated in F2.RESULTS: The recursive RF yielded 140 CpGs, 88 of which showed statistically significant associations with eczema at age 18, corroborated by log-linear models after controlling for false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. These CpGs were enriched among many biological pathways, including pathways related to creating transcriptional variety and pathways mechanistically linked to eczema such as cadherins, cell adhesion, gap junctions, tight junctions, melanogenesis, and apoptosis. In the F2 generation, about half of the 83 CpGs identified in F1 showed the same direction of association with eczema risk as in F1, of which two CpGs were significantly associated with eczema risk, cg04850479 of the PROZ gene (risk ratio (RR) = 15.1 in F1, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.71, 79.5; RR = 6.82 in F2, 95 % CI 1.52, 30.62) and cg01427769 of the NEU1 gene (RR = 0.13 in F1, 95 % CI 0.03, 0.46; RR = 0.09 in F2, 95 % CI 0.03, 0.36).CONCLUSIONS: Via epigenome-scaled analyses using recursive RF followed by log-linear models, we identified 88 CpGs associated with eczema in F1, of which 41 were replicated in F2. Several identified CpGs are located within genes in biological pathways relating to skin barrier integrity, which is central to the pathogenesis of eczema. Novel genes associated with eczema risk were identified (e.g., the PROZ and NEU1 genes)."

Significant overlap of differentially methylated regions was identified between sequenced based platforms. MeDIP provided the best coverage for the whole genome and gene body regions, while RRBS and Nimblegen MethSeq were superior for CpGs in CpG islands and promoters. Methylation analyses can be achieved by any of the five methods but understanding their differences may better address the research question being posed."

This study aimed to assess the role of methylation deregulation in pSS pathogeny through a genome-wide methylation approach.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 26 female patients with pSS and 22 age-matched controls were included in this study. CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by magnetic microbeads and their genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were analysed using Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChips. Probes with a median DNA methylation difference of at least 7% and p&lt;0.01 between patients and controls were considered significantly differentially methylated.RESULTS: Methylation alterations were mainly present in B cells compared with T cells. In B cells, an enrichment of genes with differentially methylated probes in genetic at-risk loci was observed, suggesting involvement of both genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in the same genes. Methylation alterations in B cells were more frequent in some specific pathways including Interferon Regulated Genes, mainly among patients who were autoantibody positive. Moreover, genes with differentially methylated probes were over-represented in B cells from patients with active disease.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated more important deregulation of DNA methylation patterns in B cells compared with T cells, emphasising the importance of B cells in the pathogenesis of the disease. Overlap between genes with differentially methylated probes in B lymphocytes and genetic at-risk loci is a new finding highlighting their importance in pSS."

Previously, we observed population differences in cytosine modifications between Caucasian and African lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) on the autosomes using whole genome arrays to measure modified cytosines. DNA methylation plays a critical role in establishment and maintenance of X-chromosome inactivation in females. Therefore, we reasoned that by investigating cytosine modification patterns specifically on the X-chromosome, we could obtain valuable information about a chromosome that is often disregarded in genome-wide analyses. We investigated population differences in cytosine modification patterns along the X-chromosome between Caucasian and African LCLs and identified novel sites that escape methylation on the inactive X-chromosome (Xi) in females. We characterized the chromatin state of these loci by incorporating the extensive histone modification ChIP-seq data generated by ENCODE. To explore the relationship between DNA and histone modifications further, we hypothesized that BRD4, a protein that binds acetylated histones, could be preventing some sites from becoming de novo methylated. To test this, we treated four female LCLs with JQ1, a small molecule inhibitor of BRD4, but found that JQ1 treatment induced minor changes in cytosine modification levels, and the majority of sites escaping methylation on the Xi remained unmethylated. This suggests that other epigenetic mechanisms or transcription factors are likely playing a larger role in protecting these sites from de novo methylation on the Xi."

Oxidative stress related DNA methylation may therefore be associated (causally or as a by-product) with cancer. We measured derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites (D-ROM), total thiol levels (TTL) and DNA methylation with the Illumina Infinium 450K BeadChip in three samples of German individuals aged ≥50 years: n = 1,000 ESTHER study baseline participants (DNA methylation only), n = 99 ESTHER eight-year follow-up participants and n = 142 participants of the BLITZ study. The correlation coefficient of methylation at cg10342304 and D-ROM in the ESTHER 8-year follow-up sample (r = -0.427; P = 1 × 10(-5) ) was replicated with a P-value indicating statistical significance after correction for multiple testing in the BLITZ sample (r = -0.192; P = 0.022). The association was robust to adjusting for potential confounders. In the ESTHER baseline sample, the hazard ratio for cancer development in 11 years of follow-up comparing bottom and top quartile of DNA methylation at cg10342304 was 1.86 (95%-confidence-interval 1.01-3.43). In summary, this first epigenome-wide screening and replication study with oxidative status markers observed a negative correlation of D-ROM levels and DNA methylation at cg10342304 in two independent cohorts. This CpG site is located in the body region of the nucleoredoxin gene. The nucleoredoxin protein is a redox-dependent inhibitor of the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway, a well-characterized cancer pathway. If the observed CpG-cancer association can be successfully replicated by other studies, this epigenetic marker could be an interesting biomarker of cancer risk. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Since a single miRNA can regulate multiple downstream target genes, its altered expression may potentially be a sensitive biomarker to detect early malignant transformation and improve diagnosis and prognosis. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that altered methylation of miRNA encoding genes, associated with deregulated mature miRNA expression, may be related to dietary and lifestyle factors and may contribute to cancer development.In a case-control study nested in a prospective cohort (EPIC-Italy), we analysed DNA methylation levels of miRNA encoding genes (2,191 CpG probes related to 517 genes) that are present in the Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip array in prediagnostic peripheral white blood cells of subjects who developed Colorectal Cancer (CRC, n=159) or Breast Cancer (BC, n=166) and matched subjects who remained clinically healthy.In the whole cohort, several differentially methylated miRNA genes were observed in association with age, sex, smoking habits and physical activity. Interestingly, in the case-control study, 8 differentially methylated miRNAs were identified in subjects who went on to develop BC (miR-328, miR-675, miR-1307, miR-1286, miR-1275, miR-1910, miR-24-1, and miR-548a-1; all Bonferroni-adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05). No significant associations were found with CRC.Assuming that altered methylation of miRNAs detectable in blood may be present before diagnosis, it may represent a biomarker for early detection or risk of cancer and may help to understand the cascade of events preceding tumour onset."
"26161907";"Infinium";"Infinium";"PLoS One";0;2015;"Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Analysis Identifies Novel Hypomethylated Non-Pericentromeric Genes with Potential Clinical Implications in ICF Syndrome.";"INTRODUCTION AND RESULTS: Immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial anomalies syndrome (ICF) is a rare autosomal recessive disease, characterized by severe hypomethylation in pericentromeric regions of chromosomes (1, 16 and 9), marked immunodeficiency and facial anomalies. The majority of ICF patients present mutations in the DNMT3B gene, affecting the DNA methyltransferase activity of the protein. In the present study, we have used the Infinium 450K DNA methylation array to evaluate the methylation level of 450,000 CpGs in lymphoblastoid cell lines and untrasformed fibroblasts derived from ICF patients and healthy donors. Our results demonstrate that ICF-specific DNMT3B variants A603T/STP807ins and V699G/R54X cause global DNA hypomethylation compared to wild-type protein. We identified 181 novel differentially methylated positions (DMPs) including subtelomeric and intrachromosomic regions, outside the classical ICF-related pericentromeric hypomethylated positions. Interestingly, these sites were mainly located in intergenic regions and inside the CpG islands. Among the identified hypomethylated CpG-island associated genes, we confirmed the overexpression of three selected genes, BOLL, SYCP2 and NCRNA00221, in ICF compared to healthy controls, which are supposed to be expressed in germ line and silenced in somatic tissues.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study contributes in clarifying the direct relationship between DNA methylation defect and gene expression impairment in ICF syndrome, identifying novel direct target genes of DNMT3B. A high percentage of the DMPs are located in the subtelomeric regions, indicating a specific role of DNMT3B in methylating these chromosomal sites. Therefore, we provide further evidence that hypomethylation in specific non-pericentromeric regions of chromosomes might be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of ICF syndrome. The detection of DNA hypomethylation at BOLL, SYCP2 and NCRNA00221 may pave the way for the development of specific clinical biomarkers with the aim to facilitate the identification of ICF patients."

This is particularly useful in preferentially outcrossed, insect pollinated Eucalypts known to suffer considerable inbreeding depression from related matings. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker panel consisting of 106 markers was selected for pedigree reconstruction from the recently developed high-density Eucalyptus Infinium SNP chip (EuCHIP60K). The performance of this SNP panel for pedigree reconstruction in open-pollinated progenies of two Eucalyptus nitens seed orchards was compared with that of two microsatellite panels with 13 and 16 markers respectively. The SNP marker panel out-performed one of the microsatellite panels in the resolution power to reconstruct pedigrees and out-performed both panels with respect to data quality. Parentage of all but one offspring in each clonal seed orchard was correctly matched to the expected seed parent using the SNP marker panel, whereas parentage assignment to less than a third of the expected seed parents were supported using the 13-microsatellite panel. The 16-microsatellite panel supported all but one of the recorded seed parents, one better than the SNP panel, although there was still a considerable level of missing and inconsistent data. SNP marker data was considerably superior to microsatellite data in accuracy, reproducibility and robustness. Although microsatellites and SNPs data provide equivalent resolution for pedigree reconstruction, microsatellite analysis requires more time and experience to deal with the uncertainties of allele calling and faces challenges for data transferability across labs and over time. While microsatellite analysis will continue to be useful for some breeding tasks due to the high information content, existing infrastructure and low operating costs, the multi-species SNP resource available with the EuCHIP60k, opens a whole new array of opportunities for high-throughput, genome-wide or targeted genotyping in species of Eucalyptus."

For this aim, we developed a diagnostic classifier based on DNA methylation profiles.RESULTS: Methylation data generated by the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip arrays were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (n = 472). Using the data, we built MethPed, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA methylation profiles from nine subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. DNA from 18 regional samples was used to validate MethPed. MethPed was additionally applied to a set of 28 publically available tumors with the heterogeneous diagnosis PNET. MethPed could successfully separate individual histology tumor types at a very high accuracy (κ = 0.98). Analysis of a regional cohort demonstrated the clinical benefit of MethPed, as confirmation of diagnosis of tumors with clear histology but also identified possible differential diagnoses in tumors with complicated and mixed type morphology.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumors and offer MethPed as an easy-to-use toolbox that allows researchers and clinical diagnosticians to test single samples as well as large cohorts for subclass prediction of pediatric brain tumors. This will immediately aid clinical practice and importantly increase our molecular knowledge of these tumors for further therapeutic development."

To date, several genome-wide methylome studies have revealed sex-biased DNA methylation, yet no studies have investigated sex differences in DNA methylation by taking into account cellular heterogeneity. The aim of the present study was to investigate sex-biased DNA methylation on the autosomes in human blood by adjusting for estimated cellular proportions because cell-type proportions may vary by sex.METHODS: We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of the peripheral leukocytes in two sets of samples, a discovery set (49 males and 44 females) and a replication set (14 males and 10 females) using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips for 485,764 CpG dinucleotides and then examined the effect of sex on DNA methylation with a multiple linear regression analysis after adjusting for age, the estimated 6 cell-type proportions, and the covariates identified in a surrogate variable analysis.RESULTS: We identified differential DNA methylation between males and females at 292 autosomal CpG site loci in the discovery set (Bonferroni-adjusted p &lt; 0.05). Of these 292 CpG sites, significant sex differences were also observed at 98 sites in the replication set (p &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: These findings provided further evidence that DNA methylation may play a role in the differentiation or maintenance of sexual dimorphisms. Our methylome mapping of the effects of sex may be useful to understanding the molecular mechanism involved in both normal development and diseases."

The sample mixture brings complication in data analysis and results in biased findings if not correctly accounted for. Estimating tumor purity is of great interest, and a number of methods have been developed using gene expression, copy number variation or point mutation data.RESULTS: We discover that in cancer samples, the distributions of data from Illumina Infinium 450 k methylation microarray are highly correlated with tumor purities. We develop a simple but effective method to estimate purities from the microarray data. Analyses of the Cancer Genome Atlas lung cancer data demonstrate favorable performance of the proposed method.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method is implemented in InfiniumPurify, which is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/zhengxiaoqi/infiniumpurify.CONTACT: xqzheng@shnu.edu.cn or hao.wu@emory.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

Methylation at individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites as a function of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), adjusting for age, gender, study site, T-cell purity, smoking, and family structure, was modeled.RESULTS: Epigenome-wide significant associations between eight CpG sites and BMI and five CpG sites and WC, successfully replicating the top hits in whole blood samples from the Framingham Heart Study (n = 2,377) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (n = 2,097), were found. Top findings were in CPT1A (meta-analysis P = 2.7 × 10(-43) for BMI and 9.9 × 10(-23) for WC), PHGDH (meta-analysis P = 2.0 × 10(-15) for BMI and 4.0 × 10(-9) for WC), CD38 (meta-analysis P = 6.3 × 10(-11) for BMI and 1.6 × 10(-12) for WC), and long intergenic non-coding RNA 00263 (meta-analysis P = 2.2 × 10(-16) for BMI and 8.9 × 10(-14) for WC), regions with biologically plausible relationships to adiposity.CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale epigenome-wide study discovered and replicated robust associations between DNA methylation at CpG loci and obesity indices, laying the groundwork for future diagnostic and/or therapeutic applications."

Applied to 90 European ecotypes composed of 716 individuals identifies a significant genetic-geographic correlation. Grassland ecosystems are ubiquitous across temperate and tropical regions, totalling 37 % of the terrestrial land cover of the planet, and thus represent a global resource for understanding local adaptations to environment. However, genomic resources for grass species (outside cereals) are relatively poor. The advent of next-generation DNA sequencing and high-density SNP genotyping platforms enables the development of dense marker assays for population genetics analyses and genome-wide association studies. A high-density SNP marker resource (Illumina Infinium assay) for perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) was created and validated in a broad ecotype collection of 716 individuals sampled from 90 sites across Europe. Genetic diversity within and between populations was assessed. A strong correlation of geographic origin to genetic structure was found using principal component analysis, with significant correlation to longitude and latitude (P &lt; 0.001). The potential of this array as a resource for studies of germplasm diversity and identifying traits underpinning adaptive variation is highlighted."

As DNA damage and uncontrolled proliferation are hallmarks of cancer, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), we hypothesized that inherited variation in the cellular transport genes contributes to EOC risk.METHODS: In total, DNA samples were obtained from 14,525 case subjects with invasive EOC and from 23,447 controls from 43 sites in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). Two hundred seventy nine SNPs, representing 131 genes, were genotyped using an Illumina Infinium iSelect BeadChip as part of the Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study (COGS). SNP analyses were conducted using unconditional logistic regression under a log-additive model, and the FDR q&lt;0.2 was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons.RESULTS: The most significant evidence of an association for all invasive cancers combined and for the serous subtype was observed for SNP rs17216603 in the iron transporter gene HEPH (invasive: OR = 0.85, P = 0.00026; serous: OR = 0.81, P = 0.00020); this SNP was also associated with the borderline/low malignant potential (LMP) tumors (P = 0.021). Other genes significantly associated with EOC histological subtypes (p&lt;0.05) included the UGT1A (endometrioid), SLC25A45 (mucinous), SLC39A11 (low malignant potential), and SERPINA7 (clear cell carcinoma). In addition, 1785 SNPs in six genes (HEPH, MGST1, SERPINA, SLC25A45, SLC39A11 and UGT1A) were imputed from the 1000 Genomes Project and examined for association with INV EOC in white-European subjects. The most significant imputed SNP was rs117729793 in SLC39A11 (per allele, OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.5-4.35, p = 5.66x10-4).CONCLUSION: These results, generated on a large cohort of women, revealed associations between inherited cellular transport gene variants and risk of EOC histologic subtypes."

Breeding for disease resistance is the preferred strategy of managing both diseases. The continued emergence of new races of Pt and Pst requires a constant search for new sources of resistance. Here we report a genome-wide association analysis of 567 winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) landrace accessions using the Infinium iSelect 9K wheat SNP array to identify loci associated with seedling resistance to five races of Pt (MDCL, MFPS, THBL, TDBG, and TBDJ) and one race of Pst (PSTv-37) frequently found in the Northern Great Plains of the United States. Mixed linear models identified 65 and eight significant markers associated with leaf rust and stripe rust, respectively. Further, we identified 31 and three QTL associated with resistance to Pt and Pst, respectively. Eleven QTL, identified on chromosomes 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6D, are previously unknown for leaf rust resistance in T. aestivum."

Medical treatment is fraught with high recurrence rates mainly because of an incomplete understanding of the biological mechanisms that lead to keloids. The purpose of this project was to examine keloid pathogenesis from the epigenome perspective of DNA methylation. Genome-wide profiling used the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to interrogate DNA from 6 fresh keloid and 6 normal skin samples from 12 anonymous donors. A 3-tiered approach was used to call out genes most differentially methylated between keloid and normal. When compared to normal, of the 685 differentially methylated CpGs at Tier 3, 510 were hypomethylated and 175 were hypermethylated with 190 CpGs in promoter and 495 in nonpromoter regions. The 190 promoter region CpGs corresponded to 152 genes: 96 (63%) were hypomethylated and 56 (37%) hypermethylated. This exploratory genome-wide scan of the keloid methylome highlights a predominance of hypomethylated genomic landscapes, favoring nonpromoter regions. DNA methylation, as an additional mechanism for gene regulation in keloid pathogenesis, holds potential for novel treatments that reverse deleterious epigenetic changes. As an alternative mechanism for regulating genes, epigenetics may explain why gene mutations alone do not provide definitive mechanisms for keloid formation."

Histone variant H2AX phosphorylation plays a central role in the response to damaged chromatin. In the current study, we investigated whether H2AX gene polymorphisms account for PM2.5-modulated DNA damage levels. A total of 307 healthy urban residents were collected from three cities in southern, central, and northern China, Zhuhai, Wuhan, and Tianjin, respectively. The dust mass concentrations of PM2.5 were detected by Gilian 5000 pumps, and the DNA damage levels were measured using comet assay. Seven potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of H2AX gene were selected and genotyped by Illumina Infinium(®) BeadChip. We found that three SNPs (rs10790283 G&gt;A, rs604714 C&gt;A and rs7759 A&gt;G) were significantly associated with DNA damage levels (adjusted P=0.002, 0.018 and 0.027, respectively). Significant interactions (P&lt;0.05) were observed between certain genetic polymorphisms and PM2.5-modulated DNA damage levels. These results suggested that genetic variations of H2AX might be associated with the DNA damage levels in urban residents with different exposure to PM2.5. Further studies with large sample size in independent populations merit validating these findings."

To move towards gene discovery and marker-assisted breeding in cacao, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification project was undertaken using RNAseq data from 16 diverse cacao cultivars. RNA sequences were aligned to the assembled transcriptome of the cultivar Matina 1-6, and 330,000 SNPs within coding regions were identified. From these SNPs, a subset of 6,000 high-quality SNPs were selected for inclusion on an Illumina Infinium SNP array: the Cacao6kSNP array. Using Cacao6KSNP array data from over 1,000 cacao samples, we demonstrate that our custom array produces a saturated genetic map and can be used to distinguish among even closely related genotypes.

Here, we aimed (1) to investigate the blood-brain correspondence of DNA methylation using a within-subject design and (2) to identify changes in DNA methylation of brain-related biological pathways in schizophrenia.We obtained paired blood and temporal lobe biopsy samples simultaneously from 12 epilepsy patients during neurosurgical treatment. Using the Infinium 450K methylation array we calculated similarity of blood and brain DNA methylation for each individual separately. We applied our findings by performing gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of peripheral blood DNA methylation data (Infinium 27K) of 111 schizophrenia patients and 122 healthy controls and included only Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites that were significantly correlated across tissues.Only 7.9% of CpG sites showed a statistically significant, large correlation between blood and brain tissue, a proportion that although small was significantly greater than predicted by chance. GSEA analysis of schizophrenia data revealed altered methylation profiles in pathways related to precursor metabolites and signaling peptides.Our findings indicate that most DNA methylation markers in peripheral blood do not reliably predict brain DNA methylation status. However, a subset of peripheral data may proxy methylation status of brain tissue. Restricting the analysis to these markers can identify meaningful epigenetic differences in schizophrenia and potentially other brain disorders."

SNPs have several advantages over simple sequence repeats, such as ease of data comparison and integration, high-throughput processing of loci, and identification of associated phenotypes. SNPs are thus ideal for DNA fingerprinting, genetic diversity analysis, and marker-assisted breeding. Here, we developed a high-throughput and compatible SNP array, maizeSNP3072, containing 3072 SNPs developed from the maizeSNP50 array. To improve genotyping efficiency, a high-quality cluster file, maizeSNP3072_GT.egt, was constructed. All 3072 SNP loci were localized within different genes, where they were distributed in exons (43 %), promoters (21 %), 3' untranslated regions (UTRs; 22 %), 5' UTRs (9 %), and introns (5 %). The average genotyping failure rate using these SNPs was only 6 %, or 3 % using the cluster file to call genotypes. The genotype consistency of repeat sample analysis on Illumina GoldenGate versus Infinium platforms exceeded 96.4 %. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of the SNPs averaged 0.37 based on data from 309 inbred lines. The 3072 SNPs were highly effective for distinguishing among 276 examined hybrids. Comparative analysis using Chinese varieties revealed that the 3072SNP array showed a better marker success rate and higher average MAF values, evaluation scores, and variety-distinguishing efficiency than the maizeSNP50K array. The maizeSNP3072 array thus can be successfully used in DNA fingerprinting identification of Chinese maize varieties and shows potential as a useful tool for germplasm resource evaluation and molecular marker-assisted breeding."

However, few studies have examined its effect on the DNA de-methylation pathway, specifically the dynamic changes of the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) profile. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the relationship between Pb exposure and 5mC and 5hmC modifications during early development. To study the changes in the 5hmC profile, we use a novel modification of the Infinium™ HumanMethylation450 assay (Illumina, Inc.), which we named HMeDIP-450K assay, in an in vitro human embryonic stem cell model of Pb exposure. We model Pb exposure-associated 5hmC changes as clusters of correlated, adjacent CpG sites, which are co-responding to Pb. We further extend our study to look at Pb-dependent changes in high density 5hmC regions in umbilical cord blood DNA from 48 mother-infant pairs from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) cohort. For our study, we randomly selected umbilical cord blood from 24 male and 24 female children from the 1st and 4th quartiles of Pb levels. Our data show that Pb-associated changes in the 5hmC and 5mC profiles can be divided into sex-dependent and sex-independent categories. Interestingly, differential 5mC sites are better markers of Pb-associated sex-dependent changes compared to differential 5hmC sites. In this study we identified several 5hmC and 5mC genomic loci, which we believe might have some potential as early biomarkers of prenatal Pb exposure."

DNA was extracted from the affected portions of temporal artery tissue in patients with GCA and from histologically confirmed normal arteries in controls. Genome-wide DNA methylation status was evaluated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Array. Differentially methylated loci between affected and unaffected arterial tissues were identified, and subsequent bioinformatic analysis performed. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine tissue expression patterns in temporal artery biopsies.RESULTS: We identified 1555 hypomethylated CG sites (853 genes) in affected temporal artery tissue from patients with GCA compared with normal controls. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of hypomethylated genes revealed significant representation in T cell activation and differentiation pathways, including both TH1 and TH17 signatures. Our DNA methylation data suggest a role for increased activity of the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signalling pathway in GCA, confirmed by immunohistochemistry showing increased expression and nuclear localisation of NFAT1. NFAT signalling downstream targets such as interleukin (IL)-21/IL-21R and CD40L were overexpressed in GCA-affected arteries. Further, proinflammatory genes including TNF, LTA, LTB, CCR7, RUNX3, CD6, CD40LG, IL2, IL6, NLRP1, IL1B, IL18, IL21, IL23R and IFNG were hypomethylated in the cellular milieu of GCA arteries.CONCLUSIONS: We characterised the inflammatory response in GCA-affected arteries using 'epigenetic immunophenotyping' and identified molecules and pathways relevant to disease pathogenesis in GCA."

The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip is a widely used platform in large-scale epidemiologic studies. This platform can efficiently and simultaneously measure methylation levels at ∼480,000 CpG sites in the human genome in multiple study samples. Due to the intrinsic chip design of 2 types of chemistry probes, data normalization or preprocessing is a critical step to consider before data analysis. To date, numerous methods and pipelines have been developed for this purpose, and some studies have been conducted to evaluate different methods. However, validation studies have often been limited to a small number of CpG sites to reduce the variability in technical replicates. In this study, we measured methylation on a set of samples using both whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and 450K chips. We used WGBS data as a gold standard of true methylation states in cells to compare the performances of 8 normalization methods for 450K data on a genome-wide scale. Analyses on our dataset indicate that the most effective methods are peak-based correction (PBC) and quantile normalization plus β-mixture quantile normalization (QN.BMIQ). To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically compare existing normalization methods for Illumina 450K data using novel WGBS data. Our results provide a benchmark reference for the analysis of DNA methylation chip data, particularly in white blood cells."

This is the first genome-wide association study to investigate variants associated with whole blood levels of a range of toxic metals. Eleven toxic metals and trace elements (aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, chromium, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead and zinc) were assayed in a cohort of 949 individuals using mass spectrometry. DNA samples were genotyped on the Infinium Omni Express bead microarray and imputed up to reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project. Analyses revealed two regions associated with manganese level at genome-wide significance, mapping to 4q24 and 1q41. The lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 4q24 locus was rs13107325 (P-value = 5.1 × 10(-11), β = -0.77), located in an exon of SLC39A8, which encodes a protein involved in manganese and zinc transport. The lead SNP in the 1q41 locus is rs1776029 (P-value = 2.2 × 10(-14), β = -0.46). The SNP lies within the intronic region of SLC30A10, another transporter protein. Among other metals, the loci 6q14.1 and 3q26.32 were associated with cadmium and mercury levels (P = 1.4 × 10(-10), β = -1.2 and P = 1.8 × 10(-9), β = -1.8, respectively).

The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in MBC and compare them with the previously identified transcriptional subgroups of MBC, luminal M1 and M2, as well as the intrinsic subtypes of FBC. Illumina's 450K Infinium arrays were applied to 47 MBC and 188 FBC tumors. Unsupervised clustering of the most variable CpGs among MBC tumors revealed two stable epitypes, designated ME1 and ME2. The methylation patterns differed significantly between the groups and were closely associated with the transcriptional subgroups luminal M1 and M2. Tumors in the ME1 group were more proliferative and aggressive than ME2 tumors, and showed a tendency toward inferior survival. ME1 tumors also displayed hypermethylation of PRC2 target genes and high expression of EZH2, one of the core components of PRC2. Upon combined analysis of MBC and FBC tumors, ME1 MBCs clustered among luminal B FBC tumors and ME2 MBCs clustered within the predominantly luminal A FBC cluster. The majority of the MBC tumors remained grouped together within the clusters rather than being interspersed among the FBC tumors. Differences in the genomic location of methylated CpGs, as well as in the regulation of central canonical pathways may explain the separation between MBC and FBC tumors in the respective clusters. These findings further suggest that MBC is not readily defined using conventional criteria applied to FBC."

A total of 208 fresh, tripronuclear, discarded zygotes were also collected in this study from patients on the third day of their treatment cycle, prior to transfer. The blastula-formation rates were 13.51% (26/192) and 26.7% (4/15) while the high-quality blastocyst formation rates were 5.8% (11/192) and 20% (3/15) in the IVF and ICSI groups, respectively. The inner cell mass (ICM) from each embryo was mechanically separated, and then grown on feeder layers consisting of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human foreskin fibroblasts (a 1:1 mixture). The hESC karyotype was determined by traditional G-banding; analysis of the results for the Zh19P25 and Zh20P24 cell lines showed that both were 46 XY. CNV and loss-of-heterozygosity analysis of hESC gDNA was performed to assess the genetic characteristics associated with molecular diseases using the high-resolution Infinium High-Density HumanCytoSNP-12 DNA chip. Seven CNVs in Zh19P25 and Zh20P24 were deletions, and a region that corresponds to Potocki-Shaffer disease, 11p11.2-11p11.12 in Zh20P24, showed a 2.98-Mb loss.

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate clinical and genetic factors associated with development of LGAE.METHODS: A total of 972 patients undergoing autologous SCT were graded for LGAE based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v 4.0). Germline DNA material was obtained from leukapharesis products and genotyped using Illumina(®) Whole Genome Genotyping Infinium chemistry and HumanOmni1-Quad Bead chips containing over 1.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). Statistical models incorporating clinical factors, genetic factors, and a combination of clinical plus genetic factors were utilized to compare patients who developed severe LGAE (grade 2 or above) and others.RESULTS: Among 972 patients, 459 (47.2%) developed severe LGAE. Baseline hemoglobin and hematocrit, estimated glomerular filtration rate, β2-microglobulin, protocol type, and C. difficile infection (CDI) were associated with severe LGAE on univariate analysis, Genomic comparisons between groups did not reveal any SNPs associated with severe LGAE and neither did incorporation of genetic factors into the clinical model.

Epigenetic differences between the races may be involved in such disparities. The goal of these analyses was to model the role of IGF1 methylation in mediating the association between race and birth weight. Data was collected on a cohort of 87 live born infants. IGF1 methylation was measured in DNA isolated from the mononuclear fraction of umbilical cord blood collected after delivery. Quantitative, loci-specific methylation was assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Locus specific methylation of the IGF1 CpG site was validated on a subset of the original sample (N = 61) using pyrosequencing. Multiple linear regression was used to examine relationships between IGF1 methylation, race, and birth weight. A formal mediation analysis was then used to estimate the relationship of IGF1 methylation to race and birth weight.RESULTS: Black race was associated with a 7.45% decrease in gestational age-adjusted birth weight (aBW) (P = 0.04) and Black infants had significantly higher IGF1 methylation than non-Black infants (P &lt; 0.05). A one standard deviation increase in IGF1 methylation was associated with a 3.32% decrease in aBW (P = 0.02). Including IGF1 methylation as a covariate, the effect of Black race on aBW was attenuated. A formal mediation analysis showed that the controlled direct effect of Black race on aBW was -6.26% (95% CI = -14.15, 1.06); the total effect of Black race on IGF1 methylation was -8.12% (95% CI = -16.08, -0.55); and the natural indirect effect of Black race on aBW through IGF1 methylation was -1.86% (95% CI = -5.22, 0.18).CONCLUSION: The results of the mediation analysis along with the multivariable regression analyses suggest that IGF1 methylation may partially mediate the relationship between Black race and aBW. Such epigenetic differences may be involved in racial disparities observed in perinatal outcomes."

White blood cell composition was inferred from DNA methylation measurements. A doubling in toenail mercury concentration was associated with a 2.5% decrease (95% CI: 5.0%, 1.0%) in the estimated monocyte proportion. An increase of 3.5% (95% CI: 1.0, 7.0) in B-cell proportion was observed for females only. Among the top 100 CpGs associated with toenail mercury levels (ranked on P-value), there was a significant enrichment of loci located in North shore regions of CpG islands (P = 0.049), and the majority of these loci were hypermethylated (85%). Among the top 100 CpGs for the interaction between arsenic and mercury, there was a greater than expected proportion of loci located in CpG islands (P = 0.045) and in South shore regions (P = 0.009) and all of these loci were hypermethylated. This work supports the hypothesis that mercury may be contributing to epigenetic variability and immune cell proportion changes, and suggests that in utero exposure to mercury and arsenic, even at low levels, may interact to impact the epigenome."

Previous genome-wide methylomic studies on depression have suggested that, along with differential DNA methylation, affected co-twins of monozygotic (MZ) pairs have increased DNA methylation variability, probably in line with theories of epigenetic stochasticity. Nevertheless, the potential biological roots of this variability remain largely unexplored. The current study aimed to evaluate whether DNA methylation differences within MZ twin pairs were related to differences in their psychopathological status. Data from the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip was used to evaluate peripheral blood DNA methylation of 34 twins (17 MZ pairs). Two analytical strategies were used to identify (a) differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and (b) variably methylated probes (VMPs). Most DMPs were located in genes previously related to neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Remarkably, one of these DMPs (cg01122889) was located in the WDR26 gene, the DNA sequence of which has been implicated in major depressive disorder from genome-wide association studies. Expression of WDR26 has also been proposed as a biomarker of depression in human blood. Complementarily, VMPs were located in genes such as CACNA1C, IGF2 and the p38 MAP kinase MAPK11, showing enrichment for biological processes such as glucocorticoid signaling. These results expand on previous research to indicate that both differential methylation and differential variability have a role in the etiology and clinical manifestation of depression, and provide clues on specific genomic loci of potential interest in the epigenetics of depression."

Hitherto, the array has been used for case-control studies, where sample numbers can be sufficient to yield statistically robust data on a genome-wide basis. We recently reported an informatic pipeline capable of yielding statistically and biologically significant results using only five cases, which expanded the use of this technology to rare disease studies. However, the clinical application of these technologies requires the ability to perform robust analysis of individual patients.RESULTS: Here we report a novel informatic approach for methylation array analysis of single samples, using the Crawford-Howell t-test. We tested our approach on patients with ultra-rare imprinting disorders with aberrant DNA methylation at multiple locations across the genome, which was previously detected by targeted testing. However, array analysis outperformed targeted assays in three ways: it detected loci not normally analysed by targeted testing, detected methylation changes too subtle to detect by the targeted testing and reported broad and consistent methylation changes across genetic loci not captured by point testing.CONCLUSIONS: This method has potential clinical utility for human disorders where DNA methylation change may be a biomarker of disease."

We have developed the CottonSNP63K, an Illumina Infinium array containing assays for 45,104 putative intraspecific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for use within the cultivated cotton species Gossypium hirsutum L. and 17,954 putative interspecific SNP markers for use with crosses of other cotton species with G. hirsutum. The SNPs on the array were developed from 13 different discovery sets that represent a diverse range of G. hirsutum germplasm and five other species: G. barbadense L., G. tomentosum Nuttal × Seemann, G. mustelinum Miers × Watt, G. armourianum Kearny, and G. longicalyx J.B. Hutchinson and Lee. The array was validated with 1,156 samples to generate cluster positions to facilitate automated analysis of 38,822 polymorphic markers. Two high-density genetic maps containing a total of 22,829 SNPs were generated for two F2 mapping populations, one intraspecific and one interspecific, and 3,533 SNP markers were co-occurring in both maps. The produced intraspecific genetic map is the first saturated map that associates into 26 linkage groups corresponding to the number of cotton chromosomes for a cross between two G. hirsutum lines. The linkage maps were shown to have high levels of collinearity to the JGI G. raimondii Ulbrich reference genome sequence. The CottonSNP63K array, cluster file and associated marker sequences constitute a major new resource for the global cotton research community."

A major challenge to improve the understanding of lung cancer is the difficulty of identifying reproducible differentially expressed genes across independent studies, due to their low consistency. To enhance the reproducibility of the findings, an integrated analysis was performed to identify regulatory SNPs. Thirty-two pairs of tumor and adjacent normal lung tissue specimens were analyzed using Affymetrix U133plus2.0, Affymetrix SNP 6.0, and Illumina Infinium Methylation microarrays. Copy number variations (CNVs) and methylation alterations were analyzed and paired t-tests were used to identify differentially expressed genes.RESULTS: A total of 505 differentially expressed genes were identified, and their dysregulated patterns moderately correlated with CNVs and methylation alterations based on the hierarchical clustering analysis. Subsequently, three statistical approaches were performed to explore regulatory SNPs, which revealed that the genotypes of 551 and 66 SNPs were associated with CNV and changes in methylation, respectively. Among them, downstream transcriptional dysregulation was observed in 9 SNPs for CNVs and 4 SNPs for methylation alterations.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these identified SNPs concurrently showed the same direction of gene expression changes with genetic modifications, suggesting their pivotal roles in the genome for non-smoking women with lung adenocarcinoma."

Days to flowering (DTF) and maturity (DTM), duration of flowering-to-maturity (DFTM) and plant height (PH) are crucial for soybean adaptability and yield. To dissect the genetic architecture of these agronomically important traits, a population consisting of 309 early maturity soybean germplasm accessions was genotyped with the Illumina Infinium SoySNP50K BeadChip and phenotyped in multiple environments. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using a mixed linear model that involves both relative kinship and population structure.RESULTS: The linkage disequilibrium (LD) decayed slowly in soybean, and a substantial difference in LD pattern was observed between euchromatic and heterochromatic regions. A total of 27, 6, 18 and 27 loci for DTF, DTM, DFTM and PH were detected via GWAS, respectively. The Dt1 gene was identified in the locus strongly associated with both DTM and PH. Ten candidate genes homologous to Arabidopsis flowering genes were identified near the peak single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with DTF. Four of them encode MADS-domain containing proteins. Additionally, a pectin lyase-like gene was also identified in a major-effect locus for PH where LD decayed rapidly.CONCLUSIONS: This study identified multiple new loci and refined chromosomal regions of known loci associated with DTF, DTM, DFTM and/or PH in soybean. It demonstrates that GWAS is powerful in dissecting complex traits and identifying candidate genes although LD decayed slowly in soybean. The loci and trait-associated SNPs identified in this study can be used for soybean genetic improvement, especially the major-effect loci associated with PH could be used to improve soybean yield potential. The candidate genes may serve as promising targets for studies of molecular mechanisms underlying the related traits in soybean."

It has been shown that epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, are well established mechanisms for cancer, and also have emerging roles in aging and common disease. Here, we directly ask whether DNA methylation is altered following skin aging and/or chronic sun exposure in humans.RESULTS: We compare epidermis and dermis of both sun-protected and sun-exposed skin derived from younger subjects (under 35 years old) and older subjects (over 60 years old), using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 array and whole genome bisulfite sequencing. We observe large blocks of the genome that are hypomethylated in older, sun-exposed epidermal samples, with the degree of hypomethylation associated with clinical measures of photo-aging. We replicate these findings using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, comparing epidermis from an additional set of younger and older subjects. These blocks largely overlap known hypomethylated blocks in colon cancer and we observe that these same regions are similarly hypomethylated in squamous cell carcinoma samples.CONCLUSIONS: These data implicate large scale epigenomic change in mediating the effects of environmental damage with photo-aging."

BDNF is known to regulate SST expression; however, the mechanisms underlying decreased expression of both genes are not understood. DNA methylation (DNAm) is an attractive candidate mechanism. To investigate the contribution of DNAm to the age-related decline in BDNF and SST expression, the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip Array was used to quantify DNAm of BDNF (26 CpG loci) and SST (9 CpG loci) in the orbital frontal cortices of postmortem brains from 22 younger (age &lt;42 years) and 22 older individuals (age &gt;60 years) with known age-dependent BDNF and SST expression differences. Relative to the younger individuals, 10 of the 26 CpG loci in BDNF and 8 of the 9 CpG loci in SST were significantly hypermethylated in the older individuals. DNAm in BDNF exons/promoters I, II, and IV negatively correlated with BDNF expression (r=-0.37, p&lt;0.05; r=-0.40, p&lt;0.05; r=-0.24, p=0.07), and DNAm in SST 5' UTR and first exon/intron negatively correlated with SST expression (r=-0.48, p&lt;0.01; r=-0.63, p&lt;0.001), respectively. An expanded set of BDNF- and GABA-related genes exhibited similar age-related changes in DNAm and correlation with gene expression. These results suggest that DNAm may be a proximal mechanism for decreased expression of BDNF, SST, and other BDNF- and GABA-related genes with brain aging and, by extension, for brain disorders in which their expression is decreased.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 13 May 2015; doi:10.1038/npp.2015.107."

We analysed methylation data from 44 sperm samples run on the CHARM 3.0 array, which contains over 4 million probes (over 7 million CpG sites), including 30 samples also run on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip platform (∼485 000 CpG sites). We also examined associated regions in an independent sample of post-mortem human brain ASD and control samples for which Illumina 450K DNA methylation data were available.RESULTS: Using region-based statistical approaches, we identified 193 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in paternal sperm with a family-wise empirical P-value [family-wise error rate (FWER)] &lt;0.05 associated with performance on the Autism Observational Scale for Infants (AOSI) at 12 months of age in offspring. The DMRs clustered near genes involved in developmental processes, including many genes in the SNORD family, within the Prader-Willi syndrome gene cluster. These results were consistent among the 75 probes on the Illumina 450K array that cover AOSI-associated DMRs from CHARM. Further, 18 of 75 (24%) 450K array probes showed consistent differences in the cerebellums of autistic individuals compared with controls.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that epigenetic differences in paternal sperm may contribute to autism risk in offspring, and provide evidence that directionally consistent, potentially related epigenetic mechanisms may be operating in the cerebellum of individuals with autism."

However, well-annotated clinical samples are mostly available as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues containing poor-quality DNA. To overcome this limitation, we here aimed to evaluate a DNA restoration protocol for usage with the genome-wide Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay (HM-450K). Sixty-six DNA samples from normal colon (n=9) and breast cancer (n=11) were interrogated separately using HM-450K. Analyses included matched FF/FFPE samples and technical duplicates. FFPE DNA was processed with (FFPEr) or without a DNA restoration protocol (Illumina). Differentially methylated genes were finally validated in 24 additional FFPE tissues using nested methylation-specific PCR (MSP). In summary, β-values correlation between FFPEr duplicates was high (ρ=0.9927 (s.d. ±0.0015)). Matched FF/FFPEr correlation was also high (ρ=0.9590 (s.d. ±0.0184)) compared with matched FF/FFPE (ρ=0.8051 (s.d. ±0.1028). Probe detection rate in FFPEr samples (98.37%, s.d. ±0.66) was comparable to FF samples (99.98%, s.d. ±0.019) and substantially lower in FFPE samples (82.31%, s.d. ±18.65). Assay robustness was not decreased by sample archival age up to 10 years. We could also demonstrate no decrease in assay robustness when using 100 ng of DNA input only. Four out of the five selected differentially methylated genes could be validated by MSP. The gene failing validation by PCR showed high variation of CpG β-values in primer-binding sites. In conclusion, by using the FFPE DNA restoration protocol, HM-450K assays provide robust, accurate and reproducible results with FFPE tissue-derived DNA, which are comparable to those obtained with FF tissue. Most importantly, differentially methylated genes can be validated using more sensitive techniques, such as nested MSP, altogether providing an epigenomics platform for molecular pathological epidemiology research on archived samples with limited tissue amount."

However, quantitative models that accurately predict the up or down regulation of gene expression are currently lacking.METHODS: A new machine learning-based method of gene expression prediction is developed in the context of lung cancer. This method uses the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K Beadchip CpG methylation array data from paired lung cancer and adjacent normal tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and histone modification marker CHIP-Seq data from the ENCODE project, to predict the differential expression of RNA-Seq data in TCGA lung cancers. It considers a comprehensive list of 1424 features spanning the four categories of CpG methylation, histone H3 methylation modification, nucleotide composition, and conservation. Various feature selection and classification methods are compared to select the best model over 10-fold cross-validation in the training data set.RESULTS: A best model comprising 67 features is chosen by ReliefF based feature selection and random forest classification method, with AUC = 0.864 from the 10-fold cross-validation of the training set and AUC = 0.836 from the testing set. The selected features cover all four data types, with histone H3 methylation modification (32 features) and CpG methylation (15 features) being most abundant. Among the dropping-off tests of individual data-type based features, removal of CpG methylation feature leads to the most reduction in model performance. In the best model, 19 selected features are from the promoter regions (TSS200 and TSS1500), highest among all locations relative to transcripts. Sequential dropping-off of CpG methylation features relative to different regions on the protein coding transcripts shows that promoter regions contribute most significantly to the accurate prediction of gene expression.CONCLUSIONS: By considering a comprehensive list of epigenomic and genomic features, we have constructed an accurate model to predict transcriptomic differential expression, exemplified in lung cancer."

So far, our current knowledge of the DNA methylation profiles for atherosclerosis affected and healthy human vascular tissues is still limited. Using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation27 BeadChip, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in right coronary artery in the area of advanced atherosclerotic plaques, atherosclerotic-resistant internal mammary arteries, and great saphenous veins obtained from same patients with coronary heart disease. The resulting DNA methylation patterns were markedly different between all the vascular tissues. The genes hypomethylated in athero-prone arteries to compare with atherosclerotic-resistant arteries were predominately involved in regulation of inflammation and immune processes, as well as development. The great saphenous veins exhibited an increase of the DNA methylation age in comparison to the internal mammary arteries. Gene ontology analysis for genes harboring hypermethylated CpG-sites in veins revealed the enrichment for biological processes associated with the development. Four CpG-sites located within the MIR10B gene sequence and about 1 kb upstream of the HOXD4 gene were also confirmed as hypomethylated in the independent dataset of the right coronary arteries in the area of advanced atherosclerotic plaques in comparison with the other vascular tissues. The DNA methylation differences observed in vascular tissues of patients with coronary heart disease can provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of pathology and explanation for the difference in graft patency after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery."

Aflatoxin is a contaminant of staple foods in sub-Saharan Africa, is a known human liver carcinogen and has been associated with stunting in infants.METHODS: We have measured aflatoxin exposure in 115 pregnant women in The Gambia and examined the DNA methylation status of white blood cells from their infants at 2-8 months old (mean 3.6 ± 0.9). Aflatoxin exposure in women was assessed using an ELISA method to measure aflatoxin albumin (AF-alb) adducts in plasma taken at 1-16 weeks of pregnancy. Genome-wide DNA methylation of infant white blood cells was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450beadchip.RESULTS: AF-alb levels ranged from 3.9 to 458.4 pg/mg albumin. We found that aflatoxin exposure in the mothers was associated to DNA methylation in their infants for 71 CpG sites (false discovery rate &lt; 0.05), with an average effect size of 1.7% change in methylation. Aflatoxin-associated differential methylation was observed in growth factor genes such as FGF12 and IGF1, and immune-related genes such as CCL28, TLR2 and TGFBI. Moreover, one aflatoxin-associated methylation region (corresponding to the miR-4520b locus) was identified.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that maternal exposure to aflatoxin during the early stages of pregnancy is associated with differential DNA methylation patterns of infants, including in genes related to growth and immune function. This reinforces the need for interventions to reduce aflatoxin exposure, especially during critical periods of fetal and infant development."

The different genes can be used to incorporate stripe resistance in cultivated varieties. Stripe rust [yellow rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst)] is a serious disease in wheat (Triticum aestivum). This study employed genome-wide association mapping (GWAM) to identify markers linked to stripe rust resistance genes using Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT(®)) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Infinium 9K assays in 200 ICARDA wheat genotypes, phenotyped for seedling and adult plant resistance in two sites over two growing seasons in Syria. Only 25.8 % of the genotypes showed resistance at seedling stage while about 33 and 44 % showed moderate resistance and resistance response, respectively. Mixed-linear model adjusted for false discovery rate at p &lt; 0.05 identified 12 DArT and 29 SNP markers on chromosome arms 3AS, 3AL, 1AL, 2AL, 2BS, 2BL, 3BS, 3BL, 5BL, 6AL, and 7DS significantly linked to Pst resistance genes. Of these, the locus on 3AS has not been previously reported to confer resistance to stripe rust in wheat. The QTL on 3AS, 3AL, 1AL, 2AL, and 2BS were effective at seedling and adult plant growth stages while those on 3BS, 3BL, 5BL, 6AL and 7DS were effective at adult plant stage. The 3BS QTL was validated in Cham-6 × Cham-8 recombinant inbred line population; composite interval analysis identified a stripe resistance QTL flanked by the DArT marker, wPt-798970, contributed by Cham-6 parent which accounted for 31.2 % of the phenotypic variation. The DArT marker &quot;wPt-798970&quot; lies 1.6 cM away from the 3BS QTL detected within GWAM. Epistatic interactions were also investigated; only the QTL on 1AL, 3AS and 6AL exhibited interactions with other loci. These results suggest that GWAM can be an effective approach for identifying and improving resistance to stripe rust in wheat."

We studied methylation profiles in genes related to mitochondrial function to assess whether differences in these epigenetic features were associated with diabetic kidney disease in people with Type 1 diabetes.METHODS: A case-control association study was undertaken (n = 196 individuals with diabetic kidney disease vs. n = 246 individuals without renal disease). Participants were White and diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes before 31 years of age. Genes that encode mitochondrial proteins (n = 780) were downloaded from mitoproteome.org. DNA methylation profiles from blood-derived DNA were generated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (262 samples) and Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 (192 samples) arrays. Beta values (β) were calculated and quality control was conducted, including evaluating blind duplicate DNA samples.RESULTS: Fifty-four Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine probes across 51 unique genes were significantly associated (P ≤ 10(-8) ) with diabetic kidney disease across both the 450K and the 27K methylation arrays. A subanalysis, employing the 450K array, identified 755 Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine probes in 374 genes that were significantly associated (P ≤ 10(-8) ) with end-stage renal disease. Forty-six of the top-ranked variants for diabetic kidney disease were also identified as being differentially methylated in individuals with end-stage renal disease. The largest change in methylation (Δβ = 0.2) was observed for cg03169527 in the TAMM41 gene, chromosome 3p25.2. Three genes, PMPCB, TSFM and AUH, were observed with differential methylation at multiple Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine sites each (P &lt; 10(-12) ).CONCLUSIONS: Differential methylation in genes that influence mitochondrial function are associated with kidney disease in individuals with Type 1 diabetes."

To date, very little effort has been devoted to the study of the metabolism of PCBs on a genome-wide level.OBJECTIVES: Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic regions involved in the metabolism of PCBs.METHODS: Plasma levels of 16 PCBs ascertained in a cohort of elderly individuals from Sweden (n=1016) were measured using gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrophotometry (GC-HRMS). DNA samples were genotyped on the Infinium Omni Express bead microarray, and imputed up to reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project. Association testing was performed in a linear regression framework under an additive model.RESULTS: Plasma levels of PCB-99 demonstrated genome-wide significant association with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping to chromosome 19q13.2. The SNP with the strongest association was rs8109848 (p=3.7×10(-13)), mapping to an intronic region of CYP2B6. Moreover, when all PCBs were conditioned on PCB-99, further signals were revealed for PCBs -74, -105 and -118, mapping to the same genomic region. The lead SNPs were rs8109848 (p=3.8×10(-12)) for PCB-118, rs4802104 (p=1.4×10(-9)) for PCB-74 and rs4803413 (p=2.5×10(-9)) for PCB-105, all of which map to CYP2B6.CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found plasma levels of four lower-chlorinated PCBs to be significantly associated with the genetic region mapping to the CYP2B6 locus. These findings show that CYP2B6 is of importance for the metabolism of PCBs in humans, and may help to identify individuals who may be susceptible to PCB toxicity."

Several platforms are targeted toward the identification of DNA methylation changes that might be pertinent to the disease process and include regional analysis (e.g., pyrosequencing) as well as genome-wide analysis (e.g., next-generation sequencing and microarray). The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip is one of the most comprehensive microarray platforms available, and due to the high costs associated with next-generation sequencing, it is becoming a widely used tool for the analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation levels. Providing quantitative DNA methylation levels at 482,421 CpG sites within CpG islands, shores, and shelves, as well as intergenic regions, the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip can allow accurate assessment of differential methylation across large studies.

The genotyping success rate in mapping populations was 80.4% overall and 72.4% for polymorphic SNPs. In natural populations, these figures were lower (54.8% and 51.9%, respectively). Illumina genotype clusters with compression (shift of clusters on the normalized x-axis) were detected in ~25% of the successfully genotyped SNPs and may be due to the presence of paralogues. Compressed clusters were significantly more frequent for SNPs showing a priori incorrect Illumina genotypes, suggesting that they should be considered with caution or discarded. Altogether, these results show a high experimental error rate for the Infinium array (between 15% and 20% of SNPs potentially unreliable and 10% when excluding all compressed clusters), and recommendations are proposed when applying this type of high-throughput technique. Finally, results on diversity levels and shared polymorphisms across targeted white oaks and more distant species of the Quercus genus are discussed, and perspectives for future comparative studies are proposed."

Preterm babies of mothers with early onset preeclampsia (EOPE) are at higher risks for various diseases later on in life, including cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that genome-wide epigenetic alterations occur in cord blood DNAs in association with EOPE and conducted a case control study to compare the genome-scale methylome differences in cord blood DNAs between 12 EOPE-associated and 8 normal births.RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis of methylation data from the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip shows a genome-scale hypomethylation pattern in EOPE, with 51,486 hypomethylated CpG sites and 12,563 hypermethylated sites (adjusted P &lt;0.05). A similar trend also exists in the proximal promoters (TSS200) associated with protein-coding genes. Using summary statistics on the CpG sites in TSS200 regions, promoters of 643 and 389 genes are hypomethylated and hypermethylated, respectively. Promoter-based differential methylation (DM) analysis reveals that genes in the farnesoid X receptor and liver X receptor (FXR/LXR) pathway are enriched, indicating dysfunction of lipid metabolism in cord blood cells. Additional biological functional alterations involve inflammation, cell growth, and hematological system development. A two-way ANOVA analysis among coupled cord blood and amniotic membrane samples shows that a group of genes involved in inflammation, lipid metabolism, and proliferation are persistently differentially methylated in both tissues, including IL12B, FAS, PIK31, and IGF1.CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide, for the first time, evidence of prominent genome-scale DNA methylation modifications in cord blood DNAs associated with EOPE. They may suggest a connection between inflammation and lipid dysregulation in EOPE-associated newborns and a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases later in adulthood."

In the present study, body fluid-specific epigenetic marker candidates were identified from genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of 42 body fluid samples including blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluid and menstrual blood using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. A total of 64 CpG sites were selected as body fluid-specific marker candidates by having more than 20% discrepancy in DNA methylation status between a certain type of body fluid and other types of body fluids and to have methylation or unmethylation pattern only in a particular type of body fluid. From further locus-specific methylation analysis in additional samples, 1 to 3 CpG sites were selected for each body fluid. Then, a multiplex methylation SNaPshot reaction was constructed to analyze methylation status of 8 body fluid-specific CpG sites. The developed multiplex reaction positively identifies blood, saliva, semen and the body fluid which originates from female reproductive organ in one reaction, and produces successful DNA methylation profiles in aged or mixed samples. Although it remains to be investigated whether this approach is more sensitive, more practical than RNA- or peptide-based assays and whether it can be successfully applied to forensic casework, the results of the present study will be useful for the forensic investigators dealing with body fluid samples."
"25787433";"Infinium";"Infinium";"Pregnancy Hypertens";0;2015;NA;"OBJECTIVES: Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-associated complex condition associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and angiogenic imbalance. Stress sensitive transcription factors nuclear factor-erythroid 2-like 1 (Nrf1) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2) are involved in regulation of angiogenic, inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Recent evidence suggests a link between Nrf2 and angiogenic factor balance in preeclampsia though the degree to which maternal and placental DNA methylation contributes to disruption of Nrf pathways among women with preeclampsia is unknown. Our central hypothesis is that distinct patterns of DNA methylation in Nrf pathway and angiogenic genes contribute to altered angiogenic balance in preeclampsia.METHODS: Prospectively, we collected blood in each of three trimesters of pregnancy, maternal white blood cells in the first trimester of pregnancy and placental tissue at delivery from nulliparous women. We analyzed DNA methylation at individual CpG dinucleotides (Illumina Infinium) in Nrf and angiogenic (VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGC, FLT1, KDR, NRF1, PlGF) genes in maternal peripheral blood cells and placenta and circulating angiogenic factors (Millipore Bioplex) from women who developed preeclampsia and normotensive controls (n=6/group). Differences in average methylation beta scores (change in beta score &gt;0.2 indicated significant gain of methylation; &gt;-0.2 indicated significant loss of methylation) determined significant differences between groups.RESULTS: DNA methylation patterns in Nrf and angiogenic genes in maternal white blood cells and placenta were not significantly different in cases/controls. Among women with preeclampsia, PlGF was significantly lower across pregnancy and sFLT1 was significantly higher in the third trimester among women with preeclampsia.CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation in Nrf and angiogenic genes was not associated with altered angiogenic balance in women who developed late onset preeclampsia. Differences in DNA methylation may occur later in pregnancy when circulating factors differed between groups.DISCLOSURES: C.M. Anderson: None. J.L. Ralph: None. J.E. Ohm: None."

This study compares 46 sperm samples obtained from 17 normospermic fertile men and 29 normospermic infertile patients.MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Illumina Infinium HD Human Methylation 450K arrays were used to identify genomic regions showing differences in sperm DNA methylation patterns between five fertile and seven infertile individuals. Additionally, global DNA methylation of sperm was measured using the Methylamp Global DNA Methylation Quantification Ultra kit (Epigentek) in 14 samples, and DNA methylation at several repetitive sequences (LINE-1, Alu Yb8, NBL2, D4Z4) measured by bisulfite pyrosequencing in 44 sperm samples. A sperm-specific DNA methylation pattern was obtained by comparing the sperm methylomes with the DNA methylomes of differentiated somatic cells using data obtained from methylation arrays (Illumina 450 K) of blood, neural and glial cells deposited in public databases.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In this study we conduct, for the first time, a genome-wide study to identify alterations of sperm DNA methylation in individuals with unexplained infertility that may account for the differences in their biological fertility compared with fertile individuals. We have identified 2752 CpGs showing aberrant DNA methylation patterns, and more importantly, these differentially methylated CpGs were significantly associated with CpG sites which are specifically methylated in sperm when compared with somatic cells. We also found statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001) associations between DNA hypomethylation and regions corresponding to those which, in somatic cells, are enriched in the repressive histone mark H3K9me3, and between DNA hypermethylation and regions enriched in H3K4me1 and CTCF, suggesting that the relationship between chromatin context and aberrant DNA methylation of sperm in infertile men could be locus-dependent. Finally, we also show that DNA methylation patterns, not only at specific loci but also at several repetitive sequences (LINE-1, Alu Yb8, NBL2, D4Z4), were lower in sperm than in somatic cells. Interestingly, sperm samples at Alu Yb8 repetitive sequences of infertile patients showed significantly lower DNA methylation levels than controls.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our results are descriptive and further studies would be needed to elucidate the functional effects of aberrant DNA methylation on male fertility.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Overall, our data suggest that aberrant sperm DNA methylation might contribute to fertility impairment in couples with unexplained infertility and they provide a promising basis for future research.COMPETING INTERESTS: This work has been financially supported by Fundación Cientifica de la AECC (to R.G.U.); IUOPA (to G.F.B.); FICYT (to E.G.T.); the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC; 200820I172 to M.F.F.); Fundación Ramón Areces (to M.F.F); the Plan Nacional de I+D+I 2008-2011/2013-2016/FEDER (PI11/01728 to AF.F., PI12/01080 to M.F.F. and PI12/00361 to S.L.); the PN de I+D+I 2008-20011 and the Generalitat de Catalunya (2009SGR01490).

Because Hg can interfere with placental functioning and cross the placenta to target the fetal brain, prenatal Hg exposure can inhibit fetal growth and development directly and indirectly.OBJECTIVES: We examined potential associations between prenatal Hg exposure assessed through infant toenail Hg, placental DNA methylation changes, and newborn neurobehavioral outcomes.METHODS: The methylation status of &gt; 485,000 CpG loci was interrogated in 192 placental samples using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadArray. Hg concentrations were analyzed in toenail clippings from a subset of 41 infants; neurobehavior was assessed using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) in an independent subset of 151 infants.RESULTS: We identified 339 loci with an average methylation difference &gt; 0.125 between any two toenail Hg tertiles. Variation among these loci was subsequently found to be associated with a high-risk neurodevelopmental profile (omnibus p-value = 0.007) characterized by the NNNS. Ten loci had p &lt; 0.01 for the association between methylation and the high-risk NNNS profile. Six of 10 loci reside in the EMID2 gene and were hypomethylated in the 16 high-risk profile infants' placentas. Methylation at these loci was moderately correlated (correlation coefficients range, -0.33 to -0.45) with EMID2 expression.CONCLUSIONS: EMID2 hypomethylation may represent a novel mechanism linking in utero Hg exposure and adverse infant neurobehavioral outcomes.CITATION: Maccani JZ, Koestler DC, Lester B, Houseman EA, Armstrong DA, Kelsey KT, Marsit CJ. 2015.

Single-CpG resolution genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using the Infinium assay was performed on 109 samples of non-cancerous gastric mucosa (N) and 105 samples of tumorous tissue (T). DNA methylation alterations in T samples relative to N samples were evident for 3861 probes. Since N can be at the precancerous stage according to the field cancerization concept, unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on DNA methylation levels was performed on N samples (βN) using the 3861 probes. This divided the 109 patients into three clusters: A (n = 20), B1 (n = 20), and B2 (n = 69). Gastric carcinomas belonging to Cluster B1 showed tumor aggressiveness more frequently than those belonging to Clusters A and B2. The recurrence-free and overall survival rates of patients in Cluster B1 were lower than those of patients in Clusters A and B2. Sixty hallmark genes for which βN characterized the epigenetic clustering were identified. We then focused on DNA methylation levels in T samples (βT) of the 60 hallmark genes. In 48 of them, including the ADAM23, OLFM4, AMER2, GPSM1, CCL28, DTX1 and COL23A1 genes, βT was again significantly correlated with tumor aggressiveness, and the recurrence-free and/or overall survival rates. Multivariate analyses revealed that βT was a significant prognostic factor, being independent of clinicopathological parameters. These data indicate that DNA methylation profiles at the precancerous stage may be inherited by gastric carcinomas themselves, thus determining tumor aggressiveness and patient outcome."

However, the bisulfite (BS) reaction commonly used with the 450K array cannot distinguish between 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). The oxidative-bisulfite assay disambiguates 5mC and 5hmC. We describe the use of oxBS in conjunction with the 450K array (oxBS-array) to analyse 5hmC/5mC in cerebellum DNA. The &quot;methylation&quot; level derived by the BS reaction is the combined level of 5mC and 5hmC at a given base, while the oxBS reaction gives the level of 5mC alone. The level of 5hmC is derived by subtracting the oxBS level from the BS level. Here we present an analysis method that distinguishes genuine positive levels of 5hmC at levels as low as 3%. We performed four replicates of the same sample of cerebellum and found a high level of reproducibility (average r for BS = 98.3, and average r for oxBS = 96.8). In total, 114,734 probes showed a significant positive measurement for 5hmC. The range at which we were able to distinguish 5hmC occupancy was between 3% and 42%. In order to investigate the effects of multiple replicates on 5hmC detection we also simulated fewer replicates and found that decreasing the number of replicates to two reduced the number of positive probes identified by &gt; 50%. We validated our results using qPCR in conjunction with glucosylation of 5hmC sites followed by MspI digestion and we found good concordance with the array estimates (r = 0.94). This experiment provides a map of 5hmC in the cerebellum and a robust dataset for use as a standard in future 5hmC analyses. We also provide a novel method for validating the presence of 5hmC at low levels, and highlight some of the pitfalls associated with measuring 5hmC and 5mC."

To date the most effective tool to study genome wide DNA methylation changes is Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Infinium 450k). Despite the wealth of tools for Infinium 450k analysis, the identification of the most biologically relevant DNA methylation changes is still challenging. Here we propose an analytical pipeline to select differentially methylated regions (DMRs), tailored on microarray architecture, which is highly effective in highlighting biologically relevant results. The pipeline groups microarray probes on the basis of their localization respect to CpG islands and genic sequences and, depending on probes density, identifies DMRs through a single-probe or a region-centric approach that considers the concomitant variation of multiple adjacent CpG probes. We successfully applied this analytical pipeline on 3 independent Infinium 450k datasets that investigated age-associated changes in blood DNA methylation. We provide a consensus list of genes that systematically vary in DNA methylation levels from 0 to 100 years and that have a potentially relevant role in the aging process."

Although it is well established that the causative defect of DS is the trisomy of chromosome 21, the molecular bases of its phenotype are still largely unknown. We used the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to investigate DNA methylation patterns in whole blood from 29 DS persons, using their relatives (mothers and unaffected siblings) as controls. This family-based model allowed us to monitor possible confounding effects on DNA methylation patterns deriving from genetic and environmental factors. Although differentially methylated regions (DMRs) displayed a genome-wide distribution, they were enriched on chromosome 21. DMRs mapped in genes involved in developmental functions, including embryonic development (HOXA family) and haematological (RUNX1 and EBF4) and neuronal (NCAM1) development. Moreover, genes involved in the regulation of chromatin structure (PRMD8, KDM2B, TET1) showed altered methylation. The data also showed that several pathways are affected in DS, including PI3K-Akt signaling. In conclusion, we identified an epigenetic signature of DS that sustains a link between developmental defects and disease phenotype, including segmental premature aging."

This study investigates the molecular causes behind this phenomenon. Genome wide DNA methylation of exposed and unexposed EVT was assessed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (450 K array). We identified 444 differentially methylated CpG loci in dNK-treated EVT compared with medium control (P &lt; 0.05). The genes associated with these loci had critical biological roles in cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation, cell signaling, cellular assembly and organization by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Furthermore, 23 mobility-related genes were identified by IPA from dNK-treated EVT. Among these genes, CLDN4 (encoding claudin-4) and FUT4 (encoding fucosyltransferase IV) were chosen for follow-up studies because of their biological relevance from research on tumor cells. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expressions of both CLDN4 and FUT4 in dNK-treated EVT were significantly reduced compared with control (P &lt; 0.01 for both CLDN4 and FUT4 mRNA expression; P &lt; 0.001 for CLDN4 and P &lt; 0.01 for FUT4 protein expression), and were inversely correlated with DNA methylation. Knocking down CLDN4 and FUT4 by small interfering RNA reduced trophoblast invasion, possibly through the altered matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and/or MMP-9 expression and activity. Taken together, dNK alter EVT mobility at least partially in association with an alteration of DNA methylation profile. Hypermethylation of CLDN4 and FUT4 reduces protein expression. CLDN4 and FUT4 are representative genes that participate in modulating trophoblast mobility."

Here, we aimed to establish a DNA methylation marker to estimate the fraction of gastric cancer (GC) cells in any DNA sample by isolating genomic regions specifically methylated in GC cells.METHODS: Genome-wide and gene-specific methylation analyses were conducted with an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array and by quantitative methylation-specific PCR, respectively. Purified cancer and noncancer cells were prepared by laser-capture microdissection. TP53 mutation data were obtained from our previous study using next-generation target sequencing.RESULTS: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 12 GC cell lines, 30 GCs, six normal gastric mucosae, one sample of peripheral leukocytes, and four noncancerous gastric mucosae identified OSR2, PPFIA3, and VAV3 as barely methylated in normal cells and highly methylated in cancer cells. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR using 26 independent GCs validated that one or more of them was highly methylated in all of the GCs. Using four pairs of purified cells, we confirmed the three genes were highly methylated (85 % or more) in cancer cells and barely methylated (5 % or less) in noncancer cells. The cancer cell fraction assessed by the panel of the three genes showed good correlation with that assessed by the TP53 mutant allele frequency in 13 GCs (r = 0.77). After correction of the GC cell fraction, unsupervised clustering analysis of the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles yielded clearer clustering.CONCLUSIONS: A DNA methylation marker-namely, the panel of the three genes-is useful to estimate the cancer cell fraction in GCs."

Current diagnostic tests are excellent makers of sensitization but poor predictors of clinical reactivity. Thus oral food challenges (OFCs) are required to determine a patient's risk of reactivity.OBJECTIVE: We sought to discover genomic biomarkers of clinical FA with utility for predicting food challenge outcomes.METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiling was performed on blood mononuclear cells from volunteers who had undergone objective OFCs, concurrent skin prick tests, and specific IgE tests. Fifty-eight food-sensitized patients (aged 11-15 months) were assessed, half of whom were clinically reactive. Thirteen nonallergic control subjects were also assessed. Reproducibility was assessed in an additional 48 samples by using methylation data from an independent population of patients with clinical FA.RESULTS: Using a supervised learning approach, we discovered a DNAm signature of 96 CpG sites that predict clinical outcomes. Diagnostic scores were derived from these 96 methylation sites, and cutoffs were determined in a sensitivity analysis. Methylation biomarkers outperformed allergen-specific IgE and skin prick tests for predicting OFC outcomes. FA status was correctly predicted in the replication cohort with an accuracy of 79.2%.CONCLUSION: DNAm biomarkers with clinical utility for predicting food challenge outcomes are readily detectable in blood. The development of this technology in detailed follow-up studies will yield highly innovative diagnostic assays."

Recent technical advances in the genome-wide determination of single-base DNA-methylation enabled epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). Early EWASs established robust associations between age and gender with the degree of CpG methylation at specific sites. Other studies uncovered associations with cigarette smoking. However, so far these studies were mainly conducted in Caucasians, raising the question of whether these findings can also be extrapolated to other populations.RESULTS: Here, we present an EWAS with age, gender, and smoking status in a family study of 123 individuals of Arab descent. We determined DNA methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, applied state-of-the-art data processing protocols, including correction for blood cell type heterogeneity and hidden confounders, and eliminated probes containing SNPs at the targeted CpG site using 40× whole-genome sequencing data. Using this approach, we could replicate the leading published EWAS associations with age, gender and smoking, and recovered hallmarks of gender-specific epigenetic changes. Interestingly, we could even replicate the recently reported precise prediction of chronological age based on the methylation of only a few selected CpG sites.CONCLUSION: Our study supports the view that when applied with state-of-the art protocols to account for all potential confounders, DNA methylation arrays represent powerful tools for EWAS with more complex phenotypes that can also be successfully applied to non-Caucasian populations."

We propose that use of high-throughput genotyping tools can provide a fast, efficient and cost-effective way of confirming species in germplasm collections, as well as providing valuable genetic diversity data. We genotyped 180 Brassicaceae samples sourced from the Australian Grains Genebank across the recently released Illumina Infinium Brassica 60K SNP array. Of these, 76 were provided on the basis of suspected misclassification and another 104 were sourced independently from the germplasm collection. Presence of the A- and C-genomes combined with principle components analysis clearly separated Brassica rapa, B. oleracea, B. napus, B. carinata and B. juncea samples into distinct species groups. Several lines were further validated using chromosome counts. Overall, 18% of samples (32/180) were misclassified on the basis of species. Within these 180 samples, 23/76 (30%) supplied on the basis of suspected misclassification were misclassified, and 9/105 (9%) of the samples randomly sourced from the Australian Grains Genebank were misclassified. Surprisingly, several individuals were also found to be the product of interspecific hybridization events. The SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) array proved effective at confirming species, and provided useful information related to genetic diversity. As similar genomic resources become available for different crops, high-throughput molecular genotyping will offer an efficient and cost-effective method to screen germplasm collections worldwide, facilitating more effective use of these valuable resources by breeders and researchers."

Recent genome-scale studies report that blood displays a highly distinctive methylomic profile from other somatic tissues. In this study, we sought to understand why blood DNA methylation state is so different to the one found in other tissues. We found that whole blood contains approximately twice as many tissue-specific differentially methylated positions (tDMPs) than any other somatic tissue examined. Furthermore, a large subset of blood tDMPs showed much lower levels of methylation than tDMPs for other tissues. Surprisingly, these regions of low methylation in blood show no difference regarding genomic location, genomic content, evolutionary rates, or histone marks when compared to other tDMPs. Our results reveal why blood displays a distinctive methylation profile relative to other somatic tissues. In the future, it will be important to study how these blood specific tDMPs are mechanistically involved in blood-specific functions."

To identify genomic regions that carry genetic factors controlling embryogenic potential of isolated microspores of rapeseed, marker segregations were analysed in a segregating population of haploid microspore-derived embryos and a BC1 population from a cross between 'Express 617' and 'RS239'. After map construction 15 intervarietal substitution lines from the same cross with 'Express 617' as recurrent parent were selected with donor segments covering five genomic regions that had shown skewed segregations in the population of microspore-derived embryos but not in the BC1 population. By comparing the embryogenic potential of microspores of the 15 substitution lines and 'Express 617', seven lines were identified with significantly enhanced embryogenic potential ranging from 4.1 to 40.4 times that of 'Express 617'. To improve the genetic characterization of the selected lines, they were subjected to a high-throughput SNP analysis using the Illumina Infinium 60K chip for rapeseed. Based on 7,960 mapped SNP markers, one to eight donor segments per line, which cover 0.64-6.79% of the 2,126.1 cM of the SNP map, were found. The SNP analysis also gave evidence that homoeologous exchanges had occurred during the development of the substitution line population, increasing the genetic diversity within this population. By comparing donor segments between lines with significantly enhanced embryogenic potential and non-significant lines, 12 genomic regions were identified that may contain genetic factors controlling embryogenic potential in rapeseed. These regions range in size from 0 (represented by just one marker) to 26.8 cM and cover together just 5.42% of the SNP map."

There was a greater than expected proportion of statistically-significant loci located in CpG islands (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.029) and of those CpG islands, 90.3% exhibit higher methylation levels in the exposed group. The most striking and significant CpG site, cg05727225, is located in the chromosome 11p15.4, within the adrenomedullin gene.CONCLUSIONS: In utero tobacco exposure, even in the absence of fetal growth restriction, may alter the epigenome, contributing to global DNA hypomethylation. Therefore, DNA status can be used as a biomarker of prenatal insults. Considering the possibility to reverse epigenetic modifications, a window of opportunity exists to change the programmed chronic disease."

Chordomas occur mainly in vertebral bones and account for 1-4% of malignant bone tumors. Management and treatment of chordomas are difficult as they are resistant to conventional chemotherapy; therefore, they are mainly treated with surgery and radiation therapy. In this study, we performed DNA methylation profiling of 26 chordomas and normal nucleus pulposus samples plus UCH-1 chordoma cell line using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Combined bisulfite restriction analysis and bisulfite sequencing was used to confirm the methylation data. Gene expression was analyzed using RT-PCR before and after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azaDC) treatment of chordoma cell lines. Analysis of the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip data led to the identification of 8,819 loci (2.9%) that were significantly differentially methylated (&gt;0.2 average β-value difference) between chordomas and nucleus pulposus samples (adjusted P &lt; 0.05). Among these, 5,868 probes (66.5%) were hypomethylated, compared to 2,951 (33.5%) loci that were hypermethylated in chordomas compared to controls. From the 2,951 differentially hypermethylated probes, 33.3% were localized in the promoter region (982 probes) and, among these, 104 probes showed cancer-specific hypermethylation. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicates that the cancer-specific differentially methylated loci are involved in various networks including cancer disease, nervous system development and function, cell death and survival, cellular growth, cellular development, and proliferation. Furthermore, we identified a subset of probes that were differentially methylated between recurrent and non-recurrent chordomas. BeadChip methylation data was confirmed for these genes and gene expression was shown to be upregulated in methylated chordoma cell lines after treatment with 5-azaDC. Understanding epigenetic changes in chordomas may provide insights into chordoma tumorigenesis and development of epigenetic biomarkers."

Linkage disequilibrium-based association mapping has been proposed as a cloning tool, and recent advances in high-throughput genotyping and whole-genome resequencing enable marker saturation to levels sufficient for association mapping with no a priori candidate gene selection. Here, multiyear and multienvironment evaluation of cell wall phenotypes was conducted in an interspecific P. trichocarpa x P. deltoides pseudo-backcross mapping pedigree and two partially overlapping populations of unrelated P. trichocarpa genotypes using pyrolysis molecular beam mass spectrometry, saccharification, and/ or traditional wet chemistry. QTL mapping was conducted using a high-density genetic map with 3,568 SNP markers. As a fine-mapping approach, chromosome-wide association mapping targeting a QTL hot-spot on linkage group XIV was performed in the two P. trichocarpa populations. Both populations were genotyped using the 34 K Populus Infinium SNP array and whole-genome resequencing of one of the populations facilitated marker-saturation of candidate intervals for gene identification.RESULTS: Five QTLs ranging in size from 0.6 to 1.8 Mb were mapped on linkage group XIV for lignin content, syringyl to guaiacyl (S/G) ratio, 5- and 6-carbon sugars using the mapping pedigree. Six candidate loci exhibiting significant associations with phenotypes were identified within QTL intervals. These associations were reproducible across multiple environments, two independent genotyping platforms, and different plant growth stages. cDNA sequencing for allelic variants of three of the six loci identified polymorphisms leading to variable length poly glutamine (PolyQ) stretch in a transcription factor annotated as an ANGUSTIFOLIA C-terminus Binding Protein (CtBP) and premature stop codons in a KANADI transcription factor as well as a protein kinase. Results from protoplast transient expression assays suggested that each of the polymorphisms conferred allelic differences in the activation of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin pathway marker genes.CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the utility of complementary QTL and association mapping as tools for gene discovery with no a priori candidate gene selection. This proof of concept in a perennial organism opens up opportunities for discovery of novel genetic determinants of economically important but complex traits in plants."

In this perspective, we aimed to determine whether childhood maltreatment could durably modify epigenetic processes by the means of a whole-genome methylation scan of BPD subjects. Using the Illumina Infinium® HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, global methylation status of DNA extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes was correlated to the severity of childhood maltreatment in 96 BPD subjects suffering from a high level of child adversity and 93 subjects suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) and reporting a low rate of child maltreatment. Several CpGs within or near the following genes (IL17RA, miR124-3, KCNQ2, EFNB1, OCA2, MFAP2, RPH3AL, WDR60, CST9L, EP400, A2ML1, NT5DC2, FAM163A and SPSB2) were found to be differently methylated, either in BPD compared with MDD or in relation to the severity of childhood maltreatment. A highly relevant biological result was observed for cg04927004 close to miR124-3 that was significantly associated with BPD and severity of childhood maltreatment. miR124-3 codes for a microRNA (miRNA) targeting several genes previously found to be associated with BPD such as NR3C1. Our results highlight the potentially important role played by miRNAs in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as BPD and the usefulness of using methylome-wide association studies to uncover such candidate genes. Moreover, they offer new understanding of the impact of maltreatments on biological processes leading to diseases and may ultimately result in the identification of relevant biomarkers."

Here, we utilized the nCounter Analysis System to characterise the expression of 60 genes in 69 9-year-old children from a cohort with a high prevalence of obesity. nCounter expression levels ranged broadly (from 3 to over 10000 messenger RNA counts) and were divided into four categories: high (&gt;2000 counts), moderate (200-1000 counts), low (100-200 counts) and marginal (&lt;100 counts). For a subset of five genes (ADIPOR1, PPARG1, GSTM1, PON1 and ACACA) from different expression level categories, we validated nCounter data using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and expanded RT-PCR analysis of ADIPOR1 to include 180 children. Expression data from the two methodologies were correlated for all five genes included in the validation experiment, with estimates ranging from r s = 0.26 (P = 0.02) to r s = 0.88 (P &lt; 5×10(-6)). ADIPOR1 and PPARG1 nCounter expression levels were negatively correlated (r = -0.60, P &lt; 5×10(-5)), and this relationship was stronger in overweight children (r = -0.73, P &lt; 5×10(-5)) than in normal weight children (r = -0.42, P = 0.016). Using methylation data from the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (n = 180), we found eight CpG sites in ADIPOR1 and PPARG where methylation level was associated with expression by RT-PCR (P &lt; 0.05). Hypomethylation of PPARG gene body site cg10499651 was associated with increased expression as measured by both RT-PCR and nCounter (P &lt; 0.05). We found no statistically significant relationships between either expression or methylation of ADIPOR1 and PPARG and body mass index or waist circumference. In addition to demonstrating the validity of expression data derived from nCounter, our results illustrate the use of new technologies in assessing epigenetic effects on expression in children."

However, no comprehensive studies using medication-free subjects with MDD have been conducted. Furthermore, the majority of these previous studies has been limited to the analysis of the CpG sites in CpG islands (CGIs) in the gene promoter regions. The main aim of the present study is to identify DNA methylation markers that distinguish patients with MDD from non-psychiatric controls. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of peripheral leukocytes was conducted in two set of samples, a discovery set (20 medication-free patients with MDD and 19 controls) and a replication set (12 medication-free patients with MDD and 12 controls), using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Significant diagnostic differences in DNA methylation were observed at 363 CpG sites in the discovery set. All of these loci demonstrated lower DNA methylation in patients with MDD than in the controls, and most of them (85.7%) were located in the CGIs in the gene promoter regions. We were able to distinguish patients with MDD from the control subjects with high accuracy in the discriminant analysis using the top DNA methylation markers. We also validated these selected DNA methylation markers in the replication set. Our results indicate that multiplex DNA methylation markers may be useful for distinguishing patients with MDD from non-psychiatric controls."

No significant subsequent methylation changes were observed after a second round of xenografting between primary and secondary PDXs. Based on computational simulation using publically available methylation data, we additionally show that future studies comparing two groups of PDXs should use 15 or more samples in each group to minimise the impact of xenografting-associated changes in methylation on comparison results.CONCLUSIONS: Our results from rare and common cancers indicate that PDXs are a suitable discovery tool for cancer epigenomics and we provide guidance on how to overcome the observed limitations."

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genome-wide DNA methylation and blood lipid levels high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Observed DNA methylation changes were also further analyzed to examine their relationship with previous hospitalized myocardial infarction.METHODS AND RESULTS: Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were determined in whole blood samples of 1776 subjects of the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg F4 cohort using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina). Ten novel lipid-related CpG sites annotated to various genes including ABCG1, MIR33B/SREBF1, and TNIP1 were identified. CpG cg06500161, located in ABCG1, was associated in opposite directions with both high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (β coefficient=-0.049; P=8.26E-17) and triglyceride levels (β=0.070; P=1.21E-27). Eight associations were confirmed by replication in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg F3 study (n=499) and in the Invecchiare in Chianti, Aging in the Chianti Area study (n=472). Associations between triglyceride levels and SREBF1 and ABCG1 were also found in adipose tissue of the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource cohort (n=634). Expression analysis revealed an association between ABCG1 methylation and lipid levels that might be partly mediated by ABCG1 expression. DNA methylation of ABCG1 might also play a role in previous hospitalized myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval=1.06-1.25).CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetic modifications of the newly identified loci might regulate disturbed blood lipid levels and thus contribute to the development of complex lipid-related diseases."

In addition, most studies to date have analyzed only a small number of CpG sites and focused on methylation changes in placentas, while data on cord blood are scarce. Our aim was to compare DNA methylation in cord blood samples from ART (N = 10) and control pregnancies (N = 8) using a genome-wide approach with the Illumina® Infinium Human Methylation27 array, which interrogates 27,578 CpG sites. A total of 733 (2.7%) of the CpG sites were significantly differentially methylated between the 2 groups (P &lt; 0.05), with an overall relative hypomethylation in the ART group (P &lt; 0.001). Differences in DNA methylation were more pronounced for CpG sites in certain types of genomic locations and were related to baseline methylation levels and distance from CpG islands and transcription start sites. ART was associated with significantly higher variation in DNA methylation, suggesting that differences in DNA methylation between cases and controls may result from stochastic (or random) genome-wide changes in DNA methylation in ART pregnancies. We identified 24 candidate genes with 2 or more CpG sites that were significantly different between the IVF and control groups. The current study provides support for the hypothesis that ART or associated subfertility may be associated with genome-wide changes in DNA methylation, and these changes appear to be, at least in part, due to epigenetic instability in ART pregnancies. Further studies are required in order to determine the extent to which such ART-related epigenetic instability may have phenotypic consequences."

Although associations between several genetic variants and body-mass index (BMI) have been identified, little is known about epigenetic changes related to BMI. We undertook a genome-wide analysis of methylation at CpG sites in relation to BMI.METHODS: 479 individuals of European origin recruited by the Cardiogenics Consortium formed our discovery cohort. We typed their whole-blood DNA with the Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. After quality control, methylation levels were tested for association with BMI. Methylation sites showing an association with BMI at a false discovery rate q value of 0·05 or less were taken forward for replication in a cohort of 339 unrelated white patients of northern European origin from the MARTHA cohort. Sites that remained significant in this primary replication cohort were tested in a second replication cohort of 1789 white patients of European origin from the KORA cohort. We examined whether methylation levels at identified sites also showed an association with BMI in DNA from adipose tissue (n=635) and skin (n=395) obtained from white female individuals participating in the MuTHER study. Finally, we examined the association of methylation at BMI-associated sites with genetic variants and with gene expression.FINDINGS: 20 individuals from the discovery cohort were excluded from analyses after quality-control checks, leaving 459 participants. After adjustment for covariates, we identified an association (q value ≤0·05) between methylation at five probes across three different genes and BMI. The associations with three of these probes--cg22891070, cg27146050, and cg16672562, all of which are in intron 1 of HIF3A--were confirmed in both the primary and second replication cohorts. For every 0·1 increase in methylation β value at cg22891070, BMI was 3·6% (95% CI 2·4-4·9) higher in the discovery cohort, 2·7% (1·2-4·2) higher in the primary replication cohort, and 0·8% (0·2-1·4) higher in the second replication cohort. For the MuTHER cohort, methylation at cg22891070 was associated with BMI in adipose tissue (p=1·72 × 10(-5)) but not in skin (p=0·882). We observed a significant inverse correlation (p=0·005) between methylation at cg22891070 and expression of one HIF3A gene-expression probe in adipose tissue. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms--rs8102595 and rs3826795--had independent associations with methylation at cg22891070 in all cohorts. However, these single nucleotide polymorphisms were not significantly associated with BMI.INTERPRETATION: Increased BMI in adults of European origin is associated with increased methylation at the HIF3A locus in blood cells and in adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that perturbation of hypoxia inducible transcription factor pathways could have an important role in the response to increased weight in people.FUNDING: The European Commission, National Institute for Health Research, British Heart Foundation, and Wellcome Trust."

DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification that can regulate gene expression. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed on post-mortem human brain tissue from 24 patients with schizophrenia and 24 unaffected controls. DNA methylation was assessed at over 485,000 CpG sites using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip. After adjusting for age and post-mortem interval, 4641 probes corresponding to 2929 unique genes were found to be differentially methylated. Of those genes, 1291 were located in a CpG island and 817 were in a promoter region. These include NOS1, AKT1, DTNBP1, DNMT1, PPP3CC and SOX10, which have previously been associated with schizophrenia. More than 100 of these genes overlap with a previous DNA methylation study of peripheral blood from schizophrenia patients in which 27,000 CpG sites were analysed. Unsupervised clustering analysis of the top 3000 most variable probes revealed two distinct groups with significantly more people with schizophrenia in cluster one compared with controls (P=1.74 × 10(-4)). The first cluster composed of 88% of patients with schizophrenia and only 12% controls, whereas the second cluster composed of 27% of patients with schizophrenia and 73% controls. These results strongly suggest that differential DNA methylation is important in schizophrenia etiology and add support for the use of DNA methylation profiles as a future prognostic indicator of schizophrenia."

This study was undertaken to investigate the role of epigenetic dysregulation in the pathogenesis of primary SS.METHODS: A genome-wide DNA methylation study was performed in naive CD4+ T cells from 11 patients with primary SS compared to age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. Cytosine methylation was quantified using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array, and the data were validated using bisulfite sequencing.RESULTS: Genome-wide analyses identified 553 hypomethylated CpG sites and 200 hypermethylated CpG sites in naive CD4+ T cells from patients with primary SS as compared to healthy controls, representing 311 hypomethylated and 115 hypermethylated gene regions. The hypomethylated genes in patients with primary SS included LTA (encoding lymphotoxin α). Other relevant genes, such as CD247, TNFRSF25, PTPRC, GSTM1, and PDCD1, were also hypomethylated. The interferon signature pathway was represented by hypomethylation of STAT1, IFI44L, USP18, and IFITM1. A group of genes encoding members of the solute carrier proteins were differentially methylated. In addition, the transcription factor gene RUNX1 was hypermethylated in patients with primary SS, suggesting a possible connection to lymphoma predisposition. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of hypomethylated genes demonstrated enrichment of genes involved in lymphocyte activation and immune response. GO terms for hypermethylated genes included antigen processing and presentation.CONCLUSION: This is the first epigenome-wide DNA methylation study in patients with primary SS. These findings highlight a role for DNA methylation in primary SS and identify disease-associated DNA methylation changes in several genes and pathways in naive CD4+ T cells from patients with primary SS that may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease."

This has led to considerable interest in arsenic's ability to disrupt fetal programming. Many studies report that arsenic exposure alters DNA methylation in whole blood but these studies did not adjust for cell mixture. In this study, we examined the relationship between arsenic in maternal drinking water collected ≤ 16 weeks gestational age and DNA methylation in cord blood (n = 44) adjusting for leukocyte-tagged differentially methylated regions. DNA methylation was quantified using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip array. Recursively partitioned mixture modeling examined the relationship between arsenic and methylation at 473,844 CpG sites. Median arsenic concentration in water was 12 µg/L (range&lt;1- 510 µg/L). Log 10 arsenic was associated with altered DNA methylation across the epigenome (P = 0.002); however, adjusting for leukocyte distributions attenuated this association (P = 0.013). We also observed that arsenic had a strong effect on the distribution of leukocytes in cord blood. In adjusted models, every log 10 increase in maternal drinking water arsenic exposure was estimated to increase CD8+ T cells by 7.4% (P = 0.0004) and decrease in CD4+ T cells by 9.2% (P = 0.0002). These results show that prenatal exposure to arsenic had an exposure-dependent effect on specific T cell subpopulations in cord blood and altered DNA methylation in cord blood. Future research is needed to determine if these small changes in DNA methylation alter gene expression or are associated with adverse health effects."

Although numerous studies have looked at genetic markers associated with depression, the role of epigenetic variation remains relatively unexplored.METHODS: Monozygotic (MZ) twins were selected from an adolescent twin study designed to investigate the interplay of genetic and environmental factors in the development of emotional and behavioral difficulties. There were 18 pairs of MZ twins identified in which one member scored consistently higher (group mean within the clinically significant range) on self-rated depression than the other. We assessed genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in twin buccal cell DNA using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip from Illumina. Quality control and data preprocessing was undertaken using the wateRmelon package. Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were identified using an analysis strategy taking into account both the significance and the magnitude of DNA methylation differences. The top differentially methylated DMP was successfully validated by bisulfite-pyrosequencing, and identified DMPs were tested in postmortem brain samples obtained from patients with major depressive disorder (n = 14) and matched control subjects (n = 15).RESULTS: Two reproducible depression-associated DMPs were identified, including the top-ranked DMP that was located within STK32C, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase, of unknown function.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that DNA methylation differences are apparent in MZ twins discordant for adolescent depression and that some of the disease-associated variation observed in buccal cell DNA is mirrored in adult brain tissue obtained from individuals with clinical depression."

We modeled the percentage of methylation at individual CpGs as a function of fasting very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs) by using mixed linear regression adjusted for age, sex, study site, cell purity, and family structure. Four CpGs (cg00574958, cg17058475, cg01082498, and cg09737197) in intron 1 of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) were strongly associated with very-low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=1.8×10(-21) to 1.6×10(-8)) and TG (P=1.6×10(-26) to 1.5×10(-9)). Array findings were validated by bisulfite sequencing. We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments demonstrating that methylation of the top CpG (cg00574958) was correlated with CPT1A expression. The association of cg00574958 with TG and CPT1A expression were replicated in the Framingham Heart Study (P=4.1×10(-14) and 3.1×10(-13), respectively). DNA methylation at CPT1A cg00574958 explained 11.6% and 5.5% of the variation in TG in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: This genome-wide epigenomic study identified CPT1A methylation as strongly and robustly associated with fasting very-low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and TG. Identifying novel epigenetic contributions to lipid traits may inform future efforts to identify new treatment targets and biomarkers of disease risk."

In this study, a recently developed 60K Brassica Infinium(®) SNP array was used to analyse an association panel with 472 accessions. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the array were in silico mapped using 'pseudomolecules' representative of the genome of rapeseed to establish their hypothetical order and to perform association mapping of seed weight and seed quality. As a result, two significant associations on A8 and C3 of Brassica napus were detected for erucic acid content, and the peak SNPs were found to be only 233 and 128 kb away from the key genes BnaA.FAE1 and BnaC.FAE1. BnaA.FAE1 was also identified to be significantly associated with the oil content. Orthologues of Arabidopsis thaliana HAG1 were identified close to four clusters of SNPs associated with glucosinolate content on A9, C2, C7 and C9. For seed weight, we detected two association signals on A7 and A9, which were consistent with previous studies of quantitative trait loci mapping.

Seed protein and oil concentration are quantitative traits which are determined by the interaction among many genes with small to moderate genetic effects and their interaction with the environment. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling seed protein and oil concentration in 298 soybean germplasm accessions exhibiting a wide range of seed protein and oil content.RESULTS: A total of 55,159 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using various methods including Illumina Infinium and GoldenGate assays and 31,954 markers with minor allele frequency &gt;0.10 were used to estimate linkage disequilibrium (LD) in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions. In euchromatic regions, the mean LD (r2) rapidly declined to 0.2 within 360 Kbp, whereas the mean LD declined to 0.2 at 9,600 Kbp in heterochromatic regions. The GWAS results identified 40 SNPs in 17 different genomic regions significantly associated with seed protein. Of these, the five SNPs with the highest associations and seven adjacent SNPs were located in the 27.6-30.0 Mbp region of Gm20. A major seed protein QTL has been previously mapped to the same location and potential candidate genes have recently been identified in this region. The GWAS results also detected 25 SNPs in 13 different genomic regions associated with seed oil. Of these markers, seven SNPs had a significant association with both protein and oil.CONCLUSIONS: This research indicated that GWAS not only identified most of the previously reported QTL controlling seed protein and oil, but also resulted in narrower genomic regions than the regions reported as containing these QTL. The narrower GWAS-defined genome regions will allow more precise marker-assisted allele selection and will expedite positional cloning of the causal gene(s)."

In addition, trisomies have been shown to disrupt normal epigenetic marks across the genome, perhaps in response to changes in gene dosage. We hypothesized that trisomy 21 would result in global epigenetic changes across all participants, and that DS patients with cognitive impairment would show an additional epigenetic signature.METHODS: We therefore examined whole-genome DNA methylation in buccal epithelial cells of 10 adults with DS and 10 controls to determine whether patterns of DNA methylation were correlated with DS and/or cognitive impairment. In addition we examined DNA methylation at the APP gene itself, to see whether there were changes in DNA methylation in this population. Using the Illumina Infinium 450 K Human Methylation Array, we examined more than 485,000 CpG sites distributed across the genome in buccal epithelial cells.RESULTS: We found 3300 CpGs to be differentially methylated between the groups, including 495 CpGs that overlap with clusters of differentially methylated probes. In addition, we found 5 probes that were correlated with cognitive function including two probes in the TSC2 gene that has previously been associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. We found no enrichment on chromosome 21 in either case, and targeted analysis of the APP gene revealed weak evidence for epigenetic impacts related to the AD phenotype.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results indicated that both Trisomy 21 and cognitive impairment were associated with distinct patterns of DNA methylation."

Age-related changes in DNA methylation have been reported before and may be responsible for aging-induced changes in gene expression, although a causal relationship has yet to be shown. Using genome-wide assays, we analyzed age-induced changes in DNA methylation and their effect on gene expression with and without transient induction with the synthetic transcription modulating agent WY14,643. To demonstrate feasibility of the approach, we isolated peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) from five young and five old healthy male volunteers and cultured them with or without WY14,643. Infinium 450K BeadChip and Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST expression array analysis revealed significant differential methylation of at least 5 % (ΔYO &gt; 5 %) at 10,625 CpG sites between young and old subjects, but only a subset of the associated genes were also differentially expressed. Age-related differential methylation of previously reported epigenetic biomarkers of aging including ELOVL2, FHL2, PENK, and KLF14 was confirmed in our study, but these genes did not display an age-related change in gene expression in PBMCs. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that differentially methylated genes that lack an age-related expression change predominantly represent genes involved in carcinogenesis and developmental processes, and expression of most of these genes were silenced in PBMCs. No changes in DNA methylation were found in genes displaying transiently induced changes in gene expression. In conclusion, aging-induced differential methylation often targets developmental genes and occurs mostly without change in gene expression."
"24690455";"Infinium";"Infinium";"Genome Biol";7;2014;"DNA methylome profiling of human tissues identifies global and tissue-specific methylation patterns.";"BACKGROUND: DNA epigenetic modifications, such as methylation, are important regulators of tissue differentiation, contributing to processes of both development and cancer. Profiling the tissue-specific DNA methylome patterns will provide novel insights into normal and pathogenic mechanisms, as well as help in future epigenetic therapies. In this study, 17 somatic tissues from four autopsied humans were subjected to functional genome analysis using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, covering 486 428 CpG sites.RESULTS: Only 2% of the CpGs analyzed are hypermethylated in all 17 tissue specimens; these permanently methylated CpG sites are located predominantly in gene-body regions. In contrast, 15% of the CpGs are hypomethylated in all specimens and are primarily located in regions proximal to transcription start sites. A vast number of tissue-specific differentially methylated regions are identified and considered likely mediators of tissue-specific gene regulatory mechanisms since the hypomethylated regions are closely related to known functions of the corresponding tissue. Finally, a clear inverse correlation is observed between promoter methylation within CpG islands and gene expression data obtained from publicly available databases.CONCLUSIONS: This genome-wide methylation profiling study identified tissue-specific differentially methylated regions in 17 human somatic tissues. Many of the genes corresponding to these differentially methylated regions contribute to tissue-specific functions. Future studies may use these data as a reference to identify markers of perturbed differentiation and disease-related pathogenic mechanisms."

We have developed an approach that uses DNA methylation to simultaneously quantify multiple leukocyte subsets, enabling investigation of immune modulations in virtually any blood sample including archived samples previously precluded from such analysis. Here we assess the performance characteristics and validity of this approach.RESULTS: Using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 and VeraCode GoldenGate Methylation Assay microarrays, we measure DNA methylation in leukocyte subsets purified from human whole blood and identify cell lineage-specific DNA methylation signatures that distinguish human T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils. We employ a bioinformatics-based approach to quantify these cell types in complex mixtures, including whole blood, using DNA methylation at as few as 20 CpG loci. A reconstruction experiment confirms that the approach could accurately measure the composition of mixtures of human blood leukocyte subsets. Applying the DNA methylation-based approach to quantify the cellular components of human whole blood, we verify its accuracy by direct comparison to gold standard immune quantification methods that utilize physical, optical and proteomic characteristics of the cells. We also demonstrate that the approach is not affected by storage of blood samples, even under conditions prohibiting the use of gold standard methods.CONCLUSIONS: Cell mixture distributions within peripheral blood can be assessed accurately and reliably using DNA methylation. Thus, precise immune cell differential estimates can be reconstructed using only DNA rather than whole cells."

Such integrative tools are important for the discovery of epigenetically regulated gene modules or molecular pathways, which play key roles in cellular differentiation and disease.RESULTS: Here, we present a novel functional supervised algorithm, called Functional Epigenetic Modules (FEM), for the integrative analysis of Infinium 450k DNA methylation and matched or unmatched gene expression data. The algorithm identifies gene modules of coordinated differential methylation and differential expression in the context of a human interactome. We validate the FEM algorithm on simulated and real data, demonstrating how it successfully retrieves an epigenetically deregulated gene, previously known to drive endometrial cancer development. Importantly, in the same cancer, FEM identified a novel epigenetically deregulated hotspot, directly upstream of the well-known progesterone receptor tumour suppressor pathway. In the context of cellular differentiation, FEM successfully identifies known endothelial cell subtype-specific gene expression markers, as well as a novel gene module whose overexpression in blood endothelial cells is mediated by DNA hypomethylation. The systems-level integrative framework presented here could be used to identify novel key genes or signalling pathways, which drive cellular differentiation or disease through an underlying epigenetic mechanism.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: FEM is freely available as an R-package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/funepimod."

Using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California) in a substudy of 1,046 infants from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) enrolled between 1999 and 2008, we examined epigenome-wide cord blood DNA methylation in relation to birth weight. In multivariable-adjusted robust linear regression models, we identified differential methylation at 19 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) associated with either decreased (AT-rich interactive domain 5B (MRF1-like) (ARID5B), 2 CpGs) or increased (x-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 3 (XRCC3), 4 CpGs) birth weight. ARID5B knockout mice have less adipose tissue and significantly lower weight in the postnatal period. XRCC3 plays a key role in the maintenance of chromosome stability and the repair of DNA damage. Although there are fewer data on the other implicated genes, many of these genes have been shown to have roles in developmental processes. This constitutes the largest and most robust study of birth weight using an epigenome-wide methylation platform and offers potential insights into epigenetic mechanisms of fetal growth."

Previously, we identified about 0.9 million SNP markers by sequencing transcriptomes of 27 diverse alfalfa genotypes. From this SNP set, we developed an Illumina Infinium array containing 9,277 SNPs. Using this array, we genotyped 280 diverse alfalfa genotypes and several genotypes from related species. About 81% (7,476) of the SNPs met the criteria for quality control and showed polymorphisms. The alfalfa SNP array also showed a high level of transferability for several closely related Medicago species. Principal component analysis and model-based clustering showed clear population structure corresponding to subspecies and ploidy levels. Within cultivated tetraploid alfalfa, genotypes from dormant and nondormant cultivars were largely assigned to different clusters; genotypes from semidormant cultivars were split between the groups. The extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across all genotypes rapidly decayed to 26 Kbp at r(2) = 0.2, but the rate varied across ploidy levels and subspecies. A high level of consistency in LD was found between and within the two subpopulations of cultivated dormant and nondormant alfalfa suggesting that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) could be conducted using alfalfa genotypes from throughout the fall dormancy spectrum. However, the relatively low LD levels would require a large number of markers to fully saturate the genome."

The CpGs in MYO1G and CNTNAP2 were associated, respectively, with higher and lower DNAm in exposed versus nonexposed adolescents. The same CpGs were differentially methylated at birth, during childhood, and during adolescence in the replication cohort. In both cohorts and at all developmental time points, the differential DNAm was in the same direction and of a similar magnitude, and was not altered appreciably by adjustment for current smoking by the participants or their parents. In addition, four of the five EWAS (epigenome-wide association study)-significant CpGs in the adolescent discovery cohort were also among the top sites of differential methylation in a previous birth cohort, and differential methylation of CpGs in CYP1A1, AHRR, and GFI1 observed in that study was also evident in our discovery cohort.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that modifications of DNAm associated with prenatal maternal smoking may persist in exposed offspring for many years-at least until adolescence."

A medium density array for apple, the IRSC 8K SNP array, has been successfully developed and used for screens of bi-parental populations. However, the number of robust and well-distributed markers contained on this array was not sufficient to perform genome-wide association analyses in wider germplasm sets, or Pedigree-Based Analysis at high precision, because of rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium. We describe the development of an Illumina Infinium array targeting 20K SNPs. The SNPs were predicted from re-sequencing data derived from the genomes of 13 Malus × domestica apple cultivars and one accession belonging to a crab apple species (M. micromalus). A pipeline for SNP selection was devised that avoided the pitfalls associated with the inclusion of paralogous sequence variants, supported the construction of robust multi-allelic SNP haploblocks and selected up to 11 entries within narrow genomic regions of ±5 kb, termed focal points (FPs). Broad genome coverage was attained by placing FPs at 1 cM intervals on a consensus genetic map, complementing them with FPs to enrich the ends of each of the chromosomes, and by bridging physical intervals greater than 400 Kbps. The selection also included ∼3.7K validated SNPs from the IRSC 8K array. The array has already been used in other studies where ∼15.8K SNP markers were mapped with an average of ∼6.8K SNPs per full-sib family. The newly developed array with its high density of polymorphic validated SNPs is expected to be of great utility for Pedigree-Based Analysis and Genomic Selection. It will also be a valuable tool to help dissect the genetic mechanisms controlling important fruit quality traits, and to aid the identification of marker-trait associations suitable for the application of Marker Assisted Selection in apple breeding programs."

"24953961";"Infinium";"Infinium";"BMC Med";4;2014;"Effects of palmitate on genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation patterns in human pancreatic islets.";"BACKGROUND: Circulating free fatty acids are often elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obese individuals. Chronic exposure to high levels of saturated fatty acids has detrimental effects on islet function and insulin secretion. Altered gene expression and epigenetics may contribute to T2D and obesity. However, there is limited information on whether fatty acids alter the genome-wide transcriptome profile in conjunction with DNA methylation patterns in human pancreatic islets. To dissect the molecular mechanisms linking lipotoxicity to impaired insulin secretion, we investigated the effects of a 48 h palmitate treatment in vitro on genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation patterns in human pancreatic islets.METHODS: Genome-wide mRNA expression was analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip(®) Human Gene 1.0 ST whole transcript-based array (n = 13) and genome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed using Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip (n = 13) in human pancreatic islets exposed to palmitate or control media for 48 h. A non-parametric paired Wilcoxon statistical test was used to analyze mRNA expression. Apoptosis was measured using Apo-ONE(®) Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay (n = 4).RESULTS: While glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was decreased, there was no significant effect on apoptosis in human islets exposed to palmitate. We identified 1,860 differentially expressed genes in palmitate-treated human islets. These include candidate genes for T2D, such as TCF7L2, GLIS3, HNF1B and SLC30A8. Additionally, genes in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism and one carbon pool by folate were differentially expressed in palmitate-treated human islets. Palmitate treatment altered the global DNA methylation level and DNA methylation levels of CpG island shelves and shores, 5'UTR, 3'UTR and gene body regions in human islets. Moreover, 290 genes with differential expression had a corresponding change in DNA methylation, for example, TCF7L2 and GLIS3. Importantly, out of the genes differentially expressed due to palmitate treatment in human islets, 67 were also associated with BMI and 37 were differentially expressed in islets from T2D patients.CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that palmitate treatment of human pancreatic islets gives rise to epigenetic modifications that together with altered gene expression may contribute to impaired insulin secretion and T2D."

Infinium assay was performed using 139 paired samples of non-cancerous lung tissue (N) and tumorous tissue (T) from a learning cohort of patients with lung adenocarcinomas (LADCs). Fifty paired N and T samples from a validation cohort were also analyzed. DNA methylation alterations on 1,928 probes occurred in N samples relative to normal lung tissue from patients without primary lung tumors, and were inherited by, or strengthened in, T samples. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using DNA methylation levels in N samples on all 26,447 probes subclustered patients into Cluster I (n = 32), Cluster II (n = 35) and Cluster III (n = 72). LADCs in Cluster I developed from the inflammatory background in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in heavy smokers and were locally invasive. Most patients in Cluster II were non-smokers and had a favorable outcome. LADCs in Cluster III developed in light smokers were most aggressive (frequently showing lymphatic and blood vessel invasion, lymph node metastasis and an advanced pathological stage), and had a poor outcome. DNA methylation levels of hallmark genes for each cluster, such as IRX2, HOXD8, SPARCL1, RGS5 and EI24, were again correlated with clinicopathological characteristics in the validation cohort. DNA methylation profiles reflecting carcinogenetic factors such as smoking and COPD appear to be established in non-cancerous lung tissue from patients with LADCs and may determine the aggressiveness of tumors developing in individual patients, and thus patient outcome."

Genome-wide methylation was assessed in chondrocyte DNA extracted from 23 hip OA patients, 73 knee OA patients, and 21 healthy hip control patients with femoral neck fracture.RESULTS: Analysis revealed that chondrocytes from the hip cartilage of OA patients and healthy controls have unique methylation profiles, with 5,322 differentially methylated loci (DMLs) identified between the 2 groups. In addition, a comparison between hip and knee OA chondrocytes revealed 5,547 DMLs between the 2 groups, including DMLs in several genes known to be involved in the pathogenesis of OA. Hip OA samples were found to cluster into 2 groups. A total of 15,239 DMLs were identified between the 2 clusters, with an enrichment of genes involved in inflammation and immunity. Similarly, we confirmed a previous report of knee OA samples that also clustered into 2 groups.CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that global DNA methylation using a high-density array can be a powerful tool in the characterization of OA at the molecular level.

CD4+ T-cells are key drivers of the allergic response, and may therefore harbor epigenetic variation in association with the disease phenotype. Here we retrospectively examined genome-wide DNA methylation profiles (~450,000 CpGs) from CD4+ T-cells on a birth cohort of 12 children with IgE-mediated food allergy diagnosed at 12-months, and 12 non-allergic controls. DNA samples were available at two time points, birth and 12-months.CASE: control comparisons of CD4+ methylation profiles identified 179 differentially methylated probes (DMP) at 12-months and 136 DMP at birth (FDR-adjusted P value&lt;0.05, delta β&gt;0.1). Approximately 30% of DMPs were coincident with previously annotated SNPs. A total of 96 allergy-associated non-SNP DMPs were present at birth when individuals were initially disease-free, potentially implicating these loci in the causal pathway. Pathway analysis of differentially methylated genes identified several MAP kinase signaling molecules. Mass spectrometry was used to validate 15 CpG sites at 3 candidate genes. Combined analysis of differential methylation with gene expression profiles revealed gene expression differences at some but not all allergy associated differentially methylated genes. Thus, dysregulation of DNA methylation at MAPK signaling-associated genes during early CD4+ T-cell development may contribute to suboptimal T-lymphocyte responses in early childhood associated with the development of food allergy."

The linkage map contains 9164 SNP markers covering 1832.9 cM. 1232 bins account for 7648 of the markers. A subset of 2795 SNP markers, with an average distance of 0.66 cM between adjacent markers, was applied for QTL mapping of seed colour and the cell wall fiber components acid detergent lignin (ADL), cellulose and hemicellulose. After phenotypic analyses across four different environments a total of 11 QTL were detected for seed colour and fiber traits. The high-density map considerably improved QTL resolution compared to the previous low-density maps. A previously identified major QTL with very high effects on seed colour and ADL was pinpointed to a narrow genome interval on chromosome A09, while a minor QTL explaining 8.1% to 14.1% of variation for ADL was detected on chromosome C05. Five and three QTL accounting for 4.7% to 21.9% and 7.3% to 16.9% of the phenotypic variation for cellulose and hemicellulose, respectively, were also detected. To our knowledge this is the first description of QTL for seed cellulose and hemicellulose in B. napus, representing interesting new targets for improving oil content.

The platform needed to be relatively affordable, rapid to deploy, and use a common and accessible technology. Central to this project, we wanted to make the content of the platform open to any investigator without restriction. In designing this array we prioritized a number of types of genetic variability for inclusion, such as known risk alleles, disease-causing mutations, putative risk alleles, and other functionally important variants. The array was primarily designed to allow rapid screening of samples for disease-causing mutations and large population studies of risk factors. Notably, an explicit aim was to make this array widely available to facilitate data sharing across and within diseases. The resulting array, NeuroX, is a remarkably cost and time effective solution for high-quality genotyping. NeuroX comprises a backbone of standard Illumina exome content of approximately 240,000 variants, and over 24,000 custom content variants focusing on neurologic diseases. Data are generated at approximately $50-$60 per sample using a 12-sample format chip and regular Infinium infrastructure; thus, genotyping is rapid and accessible to many investigators. Here, we describe the design of NeuroX, discuss the utility of NeuroX in the analyses of rare and common risk variants, and present quality control metrics and a brief primer for the analysis of NeuroX derived data."

To facilitate gene discovery, we assembled an association mapping panel of 528 spring wheat landraces of diverse geographic origin for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). All accessions were genotyped using an Illumina Infinium 9K wheat single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip and 4781 polymorphic SNPs were used for analysis. To identify loci underlying resistance to the major leaf spot diseases and to better understand the genomic patterns, we quantified population structure, allelic diversity, and linkage disequilibrium. Our results showed 32 loci were significantly associated with resistance to the major leaf spot diseases. Further analysis identified QTL effective against major leaf spot diseases of wheat which appeared to be novel and others that were previously identified by association analysis using Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and bi-parental mapping.

We also used data for AS patients from previous genome-wide association studies to investigate the AS risk locus ANTXR2 for its putative effect in AAU. ANTXR2 expression in mouse eyes was investigated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: A comparison between all patients with AAU and healthy control subjects showed strong association over HLA-B, corresponding to the HLA-B27 tag single-nucleotide polymorphism rs116488202. The association of 3 non-major histocompatibility complex loci, IL23R, the intergenic region 2p15, and ERAP1, reached genome-wide significance (P &lt; 5 × 10(-8)). Five loci harboring the immune-related genes IL10-IL19, IL18R1-IL1R1, IL6R, the chromosome 1q32 locus harboring KIF21B, as well as the eye-related gene EYS, were also associated, reaching a suggestive level of significance (P &lt; 5 × 10(-6)). Several previously confirmed AS associations demonstrated significant differences in effect size between AS patients with AAU and AS patients without AAU. ANTXR2 expression varied across eye compartments.CONCLUSION: These findings of both novel AAU-specific associations and associations shared with AS demonstrate overlapping but also distinct genetic susceptibility loci for AAU and AS. The associations in IL10 and IL18R1 are shared with inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting common etiologic pathways."

Using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array, we obtained a chronological profile of the genome-wide DNA methylation status in a human myoblast differentiation model, where myoblasts were cultured in low-serum medium to stimulate myogenic differentiation. As the differentiation of the myoblasts proceeded, their global DNA methylation level increased and their methylation patterns became more distinct from those of mesenchymal stem cells. Gene ontology analysis revealed that genes whose promoter region was hypermethylated upon myoblast differentiation were highly significantly enriched with muscle-related terms such as 'muscle contraction' and 'muscle system process'. Sequence motif analysis identified 8-bp motifs somewhat similar to the binding motifs of ID4 and ZNF238 to be most significantly enriched in hypermethylated promoter regions. ID4 and ZNF238 have been shown to be critical transcriptional regulators of muscle-related genes during myogenic differentiation. An integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression profiles revealed that de novo DNA methylation of non-CpG island (CGI) promoters was more often associated with transcriptional down-regulation than that of CGI promoters. These results strongly suggest the existence of an epigenetic mechanism in which DNA methylation modulates the functions of key transcriptional factors to coordinately regulate muscle-related genes during myogenic differentiation."

Its deregulation has been linked to many human cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This study was designed to explore the whole methylation status of ESCC and to identify potential plasma biomarkers for early diagnosis. We used Infinium Methylation 450k array to analyze ESCC tissues (n = 4), paired normal surrounding tissues (n = 4) and normal mucosa from healthy individuals (n = 4), and combined these with gene expression data from the GEO database. One hundred and sixty eight genes had differentially methylated CpG sites in their promoter region and a gene expression pattern inverse to the direction of change in DNA methylation. These genes were involved in several cancer-related pathways. Three genes were validated in additional 42 ESCC tissues and paired normal surrounding tissues. The methylation frequency of EPB41L3, GPX3, and COL14A1 were higher in tumor tissues than in normal surrounding tissues (P &lt; 0.017). The higher methylation frequency of EPB41l3 was correlated with large tumor size (P = 0.044) and advanced pT tumor stage (P = 0.001). The higher methylation frequency of GPX3 and COL14A1 were correlated with advanced pN tumor stage (P = 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001). The methylation of EPB41L3, GPX3, and COL14A1 genes were only found in ESCC patients' plasma, but not in normal individuals upon testing 42 ESCC patients and 50 healthy individuals. Diagnostic sensitivity was increased when methylation of any of the 3 genes were counted (64.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity). These differentially methylated genes in plasma may be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis of ESCC."

The Infinium 450K methylation microarray was used to compare differential DNA methylation sites of gastric cancer tissue with that of normal gastric tissue. The results of the DNA microarray analysis were confirmed by pyrosequencing. Functional analysis of the differential genes was performed using the GO software. The effect of candidate site methylation on gene expression was monitored using quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Of the 2,645 differential methylation sites identified in gastric cancer tissues, 2,016 were hypermethylated sites, 629 were hypomethylated sites, 826 were located in promoter regions and 1,024 were located within genes. These differential sites were associated with 1,352 genes. In total, five sites were selected and pyrosequencing verified the results of the microarray analysis in five of the sites. Change in gastric cancer DNA methylation pattern was a common occurrence. Differential methylation sites appeared more often in non-promoter regions. The associated genes were involved in multiple signaling pathways, and hypermethylated and hypomethylated sites were involved in roughly the same signaling pathways. Methylation of the genome promoted gene expression. TRIM15, ITGAM, MSX2 and FAM38A may be candidate genes for diagnosing gastric cancer."

Early onset pre-eclampsia (EOPE) is a disorder that has severe maternal and fetal outcomes, whilst its etiology is poorly understood. We hypothesize that epigenetics plays an important role to mediate the development of EOPE and conducted a case-control study to compare the genome-wide methylome difference between chorioamniotic membranes from 30 EOPE and 17 full-term pregnancies using the Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip arrays. Bioinformatics analysis tested differential methylation (DM) at CpG site level, gene level, and pathway and network level. A striking genome-wide hypermethylation pattern coupled with hypomethylation in promoters was observed. Out of 385 184 CpG sites, 9995 showed DM (2.6%). Of those DM sites, 91.9% showed hypermethylation (9186 of 9995). Over 900 genes had DM associated with promoters. Promoter-based DM analysis revealed that genes in canonical cancer-related pathways such as Rac, Ras, PI3K/Akt, NFκB and ErBB4 were enriched, and represented biological functional alterations that involve cell cycle, apoptosis, cancer signaling and inflammation. A group of genes previously found to be up-regulated in pre-eclampsia, including GRB2, ATF3, NFKB2, as well as genes in proteasome subunits (PSMA1, PMSE1, PSMD1 and PMSD8), harbored hypomethylated promoters. Contrarily, a cluster of microRNAs, including mir-519a1, mir-301a, mir-487a, mir-185, mir-329, mir-194, mir-376a1, mir-486 and mir-744 were all hypermethylated in their promoters in the EOPE samples.

This study was undertaken to investigate whether there are DNA methylation abnormalities in BD that might contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.METHODS: We examined genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in monocytes and CD4+ T cells from 16 male patients with untreated BD and age, sex, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. Additional samples were collected from 12 of the same BD patients after treatment and achievement of disease remission. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array, which includes &gt;485,000 individual methylation sites across the genome.RESULTS: We identified 383 CpG sites in monocytes, and 125 in CD4+ T cells, that were differentially methylated between BD patients and controls. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a pattern of aberrant DNA methylation among genes that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics, suggesting that aberrant DNA methylation of multiple classes of structural and regulatory proteins of the cytoskeleton might contribute to the pathogenesis of BD. Further, treatment of BD modified the differences in DNA methylation observed in patients compared to controls; indeed, among CpG sites that were differentially methylated after disease remission versus before treatment, there was widespread reversal of the direction of aberrant DNA methylation observed between the patient and control groups.CONCLUSION: The results of this epigenome-wide study-the first such study in BD-provide strong evidence that epigenetic modification of cytoskeletal dynamics underlies the pathogenesis of BD and its response to treatment."

Differential DNA methylation patterns have been observed in single genes in muscle tissue from type 2 diabetic and LBW individuals, and we recently showed multiple DNA methylation changes during short-term high-fat overfeeding in muscle of healthy people. In a randomised crossover study, we analysed genome-wide DNA promoter methylation in skeletal muscle of 17 young LBW men and 23 matched normal birthweight (NBW) men after a control and a 5 day high-fat overfeeding diet.METHODS: DNA methylation was measured using Illumina's Infinium BeadArray covering 27,578 CpG sites representing 14,475 different genes.RESULTS: After correction for multiple comparisons, DNA methylation levels were found to be similar in the LBW and NBW groups during the control diet. Whereas widespread DNA methylation changes were observed in the NBW group in response to high-fat overfeeding, only a few methylation changes were seen in the LBW group (χ(2), p &lt; 0.001).INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate lower DNA methylation plasticity in skeletal muscle from LBW vs NBW men, potentially contributing to understanding the link between LBW and increased risk of type 2 diabetes."

Sixty-seven paired samples of both noncancerous renal cortex tissue and cancerous tissue from patients with clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) were subjected to whole-exome, methylome and transcriptome analyses using Agilent SureSelect All Exon capture followed by sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray and Agilent SurePrint Human Gene Expression microarray, respectively. Sanger sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR were performed for technical verification. MetaCore software was used for pathway analysis. Somatic nonsynonymous single-nucleotide mutations, insertions/deletions and intragenic breaks of 2,153, 359 and 8 genes were detected, respectively. Mutations of GCN1L1, MED12 and CCNC, which are members of CDK8 mediator complex directly regulating β-catenin-driven transcription, were identified in 16% of the RCCs. Mutations of MACF1, which functions in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, were identified in 4% of the RCCs. A combination of methylome and transcriptome analyses further highlighted the significant role of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in renal carcinogenesis. Genetic aberrations and reduced expression of ERC2 and ABCA13 were frequent in RCCs, and MTOR mutations were identified as one of the major disrupters of cell signaling during renal carcinogenesis. Our results confirm that multilayer-omics analysis can be a powerful tool for revealing pathways that play a significant role in carcinogenesis."

We explored DNA methylation-based signatures in association with breast cancer subtypes to assess their impact on clinical presentation and patient prognosis. DNA methylation was analyzed using Infinium 450K arrays in 40 tumors and 17 normal breast samples, together with DNA copy number changes and subtype-specific markers by tissue microarrays. The identified methylation signatures were validated against a cohort of 212 tumors annotated for breast cancer subtypes by the PAM50 method (The Cancer Genome Atlas). Selected markers were pyrosequenced in an independent validation cohort of 310 tumors and analyzed with respect to survival, clinical stage and grade. The results demonstrate that DNA methylation patterns linked to the luminal-B subtype are characterized by CpG island promoter methylation events. In contrast, a large fraction of basal-like tumors are characterized by hypomethylation events occurring within the gene body. Based on these hallmark signatures, we defined two DNA methylation-based subtypes, Epi-LumB and Epi-Basal, and show that they are associated with unfavorable clinical parameters and reduced survival. Our data show that distinct mechanisms leading to changes in CpG methylation states are operative in different breast cancer subtypes. Importantly, we show that a few selected proxy markers can be used to detect the distinct DNA methylation-based subtypes thereby providing valuable information on disease prognosis."

Classically there are two types of endometrial cancer, endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC), or Type I, and uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC), or Type II. However, the whole genome DNA methylation changes in these two classical types of endometrial cancer is still unknown.RESULTS: Here we described complete genome-wide DNA methylome maps of EAC, UPSC, and normal endometrium by applying a combined strategy of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion sequencing (MRE-seq). We discovered distinct genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in EAC and UPSC: 27,009 and 15,676 recurrent differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified respectively, compared with normal endometrium. Over 80% of DMRs were in intergenic and intronic regions. The majority of these DMRs were not interrogated on the commonly used Infinium 450K array platform. Large-scale demethylation of chromosome X was detected in UPSC, accompanied by decreased XIST expression. Importantly, we discovered that the majority of the DMRs harbored promoter or enhancer functions and are specifically associated with genes related to uterine development and disease. Among these, abnormal methylation of transposable elements (TEs) may provide a novel mechanism to deregulate normal endometrium-specific enhancers derived from specific TEs.CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation changes are an important signature of endometrial cancer and regulate gene expression by affecting not only proximal promoters but also distal enhancers."

Known and putative new stripe rust resistance genes were found. Genome-wide association mapping (GWAM) is becoming an important tool for the discovery and mapping of loci underlying trait variation in crops, but in the wild relatives of crops the use of GWAM has been limited. Critical factors for the use of GWAM are the levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and genetic diversity in mapped populations, particularly in those of self-pollinating species. Here, we report LD estimation in a population of 128 accessions of self-pollinating wild emmer, Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, the progenitor of cultivated wheat, collected in Israel. LD decayed fast along wild emmer chromosomes and reached the background level within 1 cM. We employed GWAM for the discovery and mapping of genes for resistance to three isolates of Puccinia striiformis, the causative agent of wheat stripe rust. The wild emmer population was genotyped with the wheat iSelect assay including 8643 gene-associated SNP markers (wheat 9K Infinium) of which 2,278 were polymorphic. The significance of association between stripe rust resistance and each of the polymorphic SNP was tested using mixed linear model implemented in EMMA software. The model produced satisfactory results and uncovered four significant associations on chromosome arms 1BS, 1BL and 3AL. The locus on 1BS was located in a region known to contain stripe rust resistance genes. These results show that GWAM is an effective strategy for gene discovery and mapping in wild emmer that will accelerate the utilization of this genetic resource in wheat breeding."

Here we investigate alterations in DNA methylation of purified blood monocytes that are associated with inflammatory phenotypes of asthma. Peripheral blood was collected from adults with eosinophilic asthma (EA; n = 21), paucigranulocytic asthma (PGA; n = 22), neutrophilic asthma (NA; n = 9), and healthy controls (n = 10). Blood monocytes were isolated using ficoll density gradient and immuno-magnetic cell separation. Bisulfite converted genomic DNA was hybridized to Illumina Infinium Methylation27 arrays and analyzed for differential methylation using R/Bioconductor packages; networks of gene interactions were identified using the STRING database. Compared with healthy controls, differentially methylated CpG loci were identified in EA (n = 413), PGA (n = 495), and NA (n = 89). We found that 223, 237, and 72 loci were significantly hypermethylated in EA, PGA, and NA, respectively. Nine genes were common to all three phenotypes and showed increased methylation in asthma. Three pathway networks were identified in EA, involved in purine metabolism, calcium signaling, and ECM-receptor interaction. In PGA, two networks were identified, involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. In NA, one network was identified involving sFRP1 as a key node, over representing the Wnt signaling pathway. We have identified characteristic alterations in DNA methylation that are associated with inflammatory phenotypes of asthma and may contribute to the disease mechanisms.

Here genomic SNPs were discovered between four cultivars of the important amphidiploid oilseed species Brassica napus and used to develop a B. napus Infinium™ array containing 5,306 SNPs randomly dispersed across the genome. Assay success was high, with &gt;94 % of these producing a reproducible, polymorphic genotype in the 1,070 samples screened. Although the assay was designed to B. napus, successful SNP amplification was achieved in the B. napus progenitor species, Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea, and to a lesser extent in the related species Brassica nigra. Phylogenetic analysis was consistent with the expected relationships between B. napus individuals. This study presents an efficient custom SNP assay development pipeline in the complex polyploid Brassica genome and demonstrates the utility of the array for high-throughput genotyping in a number of related Brassica species.

In HER2+ breast cancer, we found altered DNA methylation in genes involved in multicellular development, differentiation and transcription. Within these genes, we observed an overrepresentation of homeobox family genes, including several genes that have not been previously reported in relation to cancer (DBX1, NKX2-6, SIX6). Other affected genes included several belonging to the PI3K and Wnt signaling pathways. Notably, HER2, AKT3, HK1, and PFKP, genes for which altered methylation has not been previously reported, were also identified in this analysis. In total, we report 69 candidate biomarker genes with maximum differential methylation in HER2+ breast cancer. External validation of gene expression in a selected group of these genes (n = 13) revealed lowered mean gene expression in HER2+ breast cancer. We analyzed DNA methylation in six top candidate genes (AKR1B1, INA, FOXC2, NEUROD1, CDKL2, IRF4) using EpiTect Methyl II Custom PCR Array and confirmed the 450K array findings.

Although elective CS continues to rise, it is unclear whether and how it may contribute to compromised future health. Our aim was to investigate the influence of mode of delivery on the epigenetic state in neonatal hematopoietic stem cells.STUDY DESIGN: This was an observational study of 64 healthy, singleton, newborn infants (33 boys) born at term. Cord blood was sampled after elective CS (n = 27) and vaginal delivery. Global deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation in hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+) was determined by luminometric methylation assay, and genome-wide, locus-specific DNA methylation analysis was performed by Illumina Infinium 450K (Illumina, San Diego, CA), validated by bisulfite-pyrosequencing.RESULTS: CD34+ cells from infants delivered by CS were globally more DNA methylated (+2%) than DNA from infants delivered vaginally (P = .02). In relation to mode of delivery, a locus-specific analysis identified 343 loci with a difference in DNA methylation of 10% or greater (P &lt; .01). A majority of the differentially methylated loci in neonatal CD34+ cells (76%) were found to be hypermethylated after vaginal delivery. In these infants, the degree of DNA methylation in 3 loci correlated to the duration of labor. The functional relevance of differentially methylated loci involved processes such as immunoglobulin biosynthetic process, regulation of glycolysis and ketone metabolism, and regulation of the response to food.CONCLUSION: A possible interpretation is that mode of delivery affects the epigenetic state of neonatal hematopoietic stem cells. Given the functional relevance indicated, our findings may have important implications for health and disease in later life."

The adverse effects of arsenic may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, as there are indications that arsenic causes altered DNA methylation of cancer-related genes. The objective was to assess effects of arsenic on genome-wide DNA methylation in newborns. We studied 127 mothers and cord blood of their infants. Arsenic exposure in early and late pregnancy was assessed by concentrations of arsenic metabolites in maternal urine, measured by high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Genome-wide 5-methylcytosine methylation in mononuclear cells from cord blood was analyzed by Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. Urinary arsenic in early gestation was associated with cord blood DNA methylation (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P-value&lt;10-15), with more pronounced effects in boys than in girls. In boys, 372 (74%) of the 500 top CpG sites showed lower methylation with increasing arsenic exposure (r S -values&gt;-0.62), but in girls only 207 (41%) showed inverse correlation (r S -values&gt;-0.54). Three CpG sites in boys (cg15255455, cg13659051 and cg17646418), but none in girls, were significantly correlated with arsenic after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The associations between arsenic and DNA methylation were robust in multivariable-adjusted linear regression models. Much weaker associations were observed with arsenic exposure in late compared with early gestation. Pathway analysis showed overrepresentation of affected cancer-related genes in boys, but not in girls. In conclusion, early prenatal arsenic exposure appears to decrease DNA methylation in boys. Associations between early exposure and DNA methylation might reflect interference with de novo DNA methylation."

It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid β peptides and abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins that are associated with cognitive decline and dementia. Much has been learned about the genomics of AD from linkage analyses and, more recently, genome-wide association studies. Several but not all aspects of the genomic landscape are involved in amyloid β metabolism. The moderate concordance of disease among twins suggests other factors, potentially epigenomic factors, are related to AD. We are at the earliest stages of examining the relation of the epigenome to the clinical and pathologic phenotypes that characterize AD. Our literature review suggests that there is some evidence of age-related changes in human brain methylation. Unfortunately, studies of AD have been relatively small with limited coverage of methylation sites and microRNA, let alone other epigenomic marks. We are in the midst of 2 large studies of human brains including coverage of more than 420,000 autosomal cytosine-guanine dinucleotides with the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadArray, and histone acetylation with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing.

Genotyping of rs10235235 was conducted using a custom Illumina Infinium array. Stratified analyses were conducted to determine whether this association was modified by age at diagnosis, ethnicity, age at menarche or tumor characteristics.RESULTS: We confirmed the association of rs10235235 with breast cancer risk for women of European ancestry but found no evidence that this association differed with age at diagnosis. Heterozygote and homozygote odds ratios (ORs) were OR = 0.98 (95% CI 0.94, 1.01; P = 0.2) and OR = 0.80 (95% CI 0.69, 0.93; P = 0.004), respectively (P trend = 0.02). There was no evidence of effect modification by tumor characteristics. rs10235235 was, however, associated with age at menarche in controls (P trend = 0.005) but not cases (P trend = 0.97). Consequently the association between rs10235235 and breast cancer risk differed according to age at menarche (P het = 0.02); the rare allele of rs10235235 was associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk for women who had their menarche age ≥15 years (ORhet = 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.94; ORhom = 0.81, 95% CI 0.51, 1.30; P trend = 0.002) but not for those who had their menarche age ≤11 years (ORhet = 1.06, 95% CI 0.95, 1.19, ORhom = 1.07, 95% CI 0.67, 1.72; P trend = 0.29).CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge rs10235235 is the first single nucleotide polymorphism to be associated with both breast cancer risk and age at menarche consistent with the well-documented association between later age at menarche and a reduction in breast cancer risk. These associations are likely mediated via an effect on circulating hormone levels."

DNA promoter hypermethylation is a frequent epigenetic event in prostate cancer, but few studies of DNA methylation in relation to features of more aggressive tumors or prostate cancer recurrence have been completed.METHODS: We used the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to assess DNA methylation in tumor tissue from 407 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. Recurrence status was determined by follow-up patient surveys, medical record review, and linkage with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. The methylation status of 14 genes for which promoter hypermethylation was previously correlated with advanced disease or biochemical recurrence was evaluated. Average methylation level for promoter region CpGs in patients who recurred compared with those with no evidence of recurrence was analyzed. For two genes with differential methylation, time to recurrence was examined.RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 11.7 years, 104 (26%) patients recurred. Significant promoter hypermethylation in at least 50% of CpG sites in two genes, ABHD9 and HOXD3, was found in tumors from patients who recurred compared with those without recurrence. Evidence was strongest for HOXD3 (lowest P = 9.46 × 10(-6)), with higher average methylation across promoter region CpGs associated with reduced recurrence-free survival (P = 2 × 10(-4)). DNA methylation profiles did not differ by recurrence status for the other genes.CONCLUSIONS: These results validate the association between promoter hypermethylation of ADHB9 and HOXD3 and prostate cancer recurrence.IMPACT: Tumor DNA methylation profiling may help to distinguish patients with prostate cancer at higher risk for disease recurrence."

The aim of this study was to verify the utility of STAT6 immunohistology in diagnosing SFT.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 689 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumours comprising 35 pleural SFTs and 654 other mesenchymal tumours were investigated for STAT6 expression using immunohistochemistry. Nine dedifferentiated liposarcomas (DDLSs) and five SFTs were also examined for the presence of NAB2-STAT6 fusion at the protein level using the proximity ligation assay (PLA), and for copy number variants (CNVs) with the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 array. Thirty-four of 35 SFTs showed strong nuclear STAT6 expression. Furthermore, five of 68 DDLSs, two of 130 undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas and one of 63 cases of nodular fasciitis showed moderate to strong nuclear STAT6 expression. The PLA indicated the presence of NAB2-STAT6 fusion protein in SFTs, but signal was also detected in some DDLSs. Copy number analysis showed an overall low frequency of chromosomal imbalances in SFTs, but complex karyotypes in DDLSs, including amplification of STAT6 and MDM2 loci.CONCLUSIONS: The detection of nuclear relocation of STAT6 with immunohistochemistry is a characteristic of SFTs, and may serve as a diagnostic marker that indicates NAB2-STAT6 fusion and helps to discriminate SFTs from histological mimics."

The aim of this study is to identify potential biomarkers in HCC.METHODS: We used the Infinium methylation array and a DNA-pooling strategy to analyze the genome-wide methylation profile in HCC. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) was used to validate homeobox A9 (HOXA9) methylation in 29 normal controls, 100 HCC samples and adjacent non-tumor tissues and in 74 plasma samples, including 40 patients with HCC.RESULTS: Ten genes (HOXA9, NEUROG1, TNFRSF10C, IRAK3, GFPT2, ZNF177, DPYSL4, ELOVL4, FSD1, and CACNA1G) showed differences in methylation between controls and HCCs. Of these, HOXA9 was significantly hypermethylated in HCCs (76.7%; 23/30) compared with controls (3.4%; 1/29). In addition, combination analysis of two- and three-gene sets for HCC detection showed greater sensitivity (90%-96.7%) and comparable specificity (93.1%-96.6%) to each individual gene (33.3%-76.7% and 55.2%-100.0%). HOXA9 methylation was further validated by Q-MSP in two independent set of clinical samples including 100 HCC and paired non-tumor tissues. Further, HOXA9 methylation could be detected in plasma from HCC patients (n=40) but not in normal plasma (n=34) (p&lt;0.0005). Combined testing (either parameter positive) for α-fetoprotein (AFP, a plasma protein biomarker) and HOXA9 methylation showed greater sensitivity (94.6%) for detection of HCC than AFP alone (75.7%).CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that methylation of HOXA9 could be a helpful biomarker to assist in HCC detection."

These samples are often well annotated and provide an invaluable resource for research. However, this process of fixation and storage of tissue leads to DNA damage and fragmentation. The use of DNA from formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue to interrogate methylation levels on a genome-wide scale can pose challenges. We compared fresh and matched FFPE tissue DNA samples using the Illumina Infinium HD Human Methylation 450K BeadChip platform with a companion application for repair and &quot;restoration&quot; of DNA from FFPE tissue. Our results showed good correlation between fresh and FFPE sample data. FFPE DNA captured 99% of the CpG sites on the array on average. Significant cancer subgroups based on the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) were clearly distinguished for both fresh and FFPE sample sets with cluster and scaling analysis. The DNA methylation status for the five standard CIMP panel genes which was evaluated for all samples by the MethyLight assay was correctly assigned in both fresh and FFPE samples by the array data. We conclude that the &quot;restoration&quot; method followed by assay on the Infinium HD Human Methylation 450K microarray can produce good quality data for DNA from FFPE samples."

However, little is known about DNA methylation changes over time in people who develop arsenic-induced skin lesions. We sought to investigate epigenome-wide changes of DNA methylation in people who developed arsenic-induced skin lesions in a 10-year period. In 2009-2011, we conducted a follow-up study of 900 skin lesion cases and 900 controls and identified 10 people who developed skin lesions since a baseline survey in 2001-2003. The 10 cases (&quot;New Cases&quot;) were matched with 10 controls who did not have skin lesions at baseline or follow-up (&quot;Persistent Controls&quot;). Drinking water and blood samples were collected, and skin lesion was diagnosed by the same physician at both time points. We measured DNA methylation in blood using Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip, followed by quantitative validation using pyrosequencing. Two-sample t-tests were used to compare changes in percent methylation between New Cases and Persistent Controls. Six CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) sites with greatest changes of DNA methylation over time among New Cases were further validated with a correlation of 93% using pyrosequencing. One of the validated CpG site (cg03333116; change of %methylation was 13.2 in New Cases versus -0.09 in Persistent Controls; P &lt; 0.001) belonged to the RHBDF1 gene, which was previously reported to be hypermethylated in arsenic-exposed cases. We examined DNA methylation changes with the development of arsenic-induced skin lesions over time but nothing was statistically significant given the small sample size of this exploratory study and the high dimensionality of data."

DSC3 transcript expression in prostate cell line panel and an independent tissue cohort (n = 52) was estimated by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). Epigenetic status of DSC3 gene promoter in PCa was investigated by uploading three dataset (ENCODE Infinium 450K array data and two methylation sequencing) in UCSC genome browser. While pyrosequencing analysis measured promoter DNA methylation, Q-PCR estimates were obtained for DSC3 transcript re-expression after 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) treatment. Clinical relevance of DSC3 expression was studied by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Finally, functional studies monitoring cell proliferation, migration and invasion were performed in prostate cell lines after siRNA mediated DSC3 knockdown or following 5-Aza induced re-expression. EMT markers Vimentin and E-cadherin expression was measured by Western Blot.RESULTS: Microarray data analyses revealed a significant decrease in DSC3 transcript expression in PCa, compared to benign samples. Q-PCR analysis of an independent cohort revealed DSC3 transcript down-regulation, both in PCa cell lines and tumor tissues but not in their benign counterpart. Examination of available NGS and Infinium data identified a role for epigenetic regulation DSC3 mRNA reduction in PCa. Pyrosequencing confirmed the increased DSC3 promoter methylation in cancer cell lines and restoration of transcript expression upon 5-Aza treatment further corroborated this epigenetic silencing mechanism. Importantly Kaplan-Meier analysis of an outcome cohort showed an association between loss of DSC3 expression and significantly increased risk of biochemical recurrence. Functional studies indicate a role for epithelial-mesenchymal transition in DSC3 regulated cell migration/invasion.CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggests that DNA methylation contributes to down-regulation of DSC3 in prostate cancer, and loss of DSC3 predicts poor clinical outcome."

We compared DNA methylation levels at 498 target loci (1001 PCR amplicons) in human whole blood, osteosarcoma cells and an archived tumor tissue sample. We assessed the ability of RainDrop BS-seq to accurately measure DNA methylation over a range of DNA quantities (from 10 to 1500 ng), both with and without whole-genome amplification (WGA) following bisulfite conversion. DNA methylation profiles generated using at least 100 ng correlated well (median R = 0.92) with those generated on Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips, currently the platform of choice for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). WGA allowed for testing of samples with a starting DNA amount of 10 and 50 ng, although a reduced correlation was observed (median R = 0.79). We conclude that RainDrop BS-seq is suitable for measuring DNA methylation levels using nanogram quantities of DNA, and can be used to study candidate epigenetic biomarker loci in an accurate and high-throughput manner, paving the way for its application to routine clinical diagnostics."
"24501229";"Infinium";"Infinium";"J Med Genet";2;2014;"Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of patients with imprinting disorders identifies differentially methylated regions associated with novel candidate imprinted genes.";"BACKGROUND: Genomic imprinting is allelic restriction of gene expression potential depending on parent of origin, maintained by epigenetic mechanisms including parent of origin-specific DNA methylation. Among approximately 70 known imprinted genes are some causing disorders affecting growth, metabolism and cancer predisposition. Some imprinting disorder patients have hypomethylation of several imprinted loci (HIL) throughout the genome and may have atypically severe clinical features. Here we used array analysis in HIL patients to define patterns of aberrant methylation throughout the genome.DESIGN: We developed a novel informatic pipeline capable of small sample number analysis, and profiled 10 HIL patients with two clinical presentations (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and neonatal diabetes) using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip array to identify candidate imprinted regions. We used robust statistical criteria to quantify DNA methylation.RESULTS: We detected hypomethylation at known imprinted loci, and 25 further candidate imprinted regions (nine shared between patient groups) including one in the Down syndrome critical region (WRB) and another previously associated with bipolar disorder (PPIEL). Targeted analysis of three candidate regions (NHP2L1, WRB and PPIEL) showed allelic expression, methylation patterns consistent with allelic maternal methylation and frequent hypomethylation among an additional cohort of HIL patients, including six with Silver-Russell syndrome presentations and one with pseudohypoparathyroidism 1B.CONCLUSIONS: This study identified novel candidate imprinted genes, revealed remarkable epigenetic convergence among clinically divergent patients, and highlights the potential of epigenomic profiling to expand our understanding of the normal methylome and its disruption in human disease."

Three samples were analyzed in each group. The infinium methylation array identified more hypermethylated and hypomethylated CpGs in choESC than in euESCa, and only a few genes were methylated differently in euESCa and euESCb. A functional analysis revealed that signal transduction, developmental processes, immunity, etc. were different in choESC and euESCa. A clustering analysis and a principal component analysis performed based on the methylation levels segregated choESC from euESC, while euESCa and euESCb were identical. A transcriptome analysis was then conducted and the results were compared with those of the DNA methylation analysis. Interestingly, the hierarchical clustering and principal component analyses showed that choESC were segregated from euESCa and euESCb in the DNA methylation analysis, while no segregation was recognized in the transcriptome analysis. The mRNA expression levels of the epigenetic modification enzymes, including DNA methyltransferases, obtained from the specimens were not significantly different between the groups. Some of the differentially methylated and/or expressed genes (NR5A1, STAR, STRA6 and HSD17B2), which are related with steroidogenesis, were validated by independent methods in a larger number of samples. Our findings indicate that different DNA methylation profiles exist in ectopic ESC, highlighting the benefits of genome wide DNA methylation analyses over transcriptome analyses in clarifying the development and characterization of endometriosis."

Quality control and SNP-centred analysis were done with GenABEL R package. An in-house implementation of the Wang method permitted gene-centred analysis.RESULTS: CCR4-NOT transcription complex, subunit 1 (CNOT1) gene (16q21), showed the strongest association with the modification of the response to the therapeutic vaccine (p=0.00075). CNOT1 SNP rs7188697 A/G was significantly associated with DC treatment response. The presence of a G allele indicated poor response to the therapeutic vaccine (p=0.0031; OR=33.00; CI=1.74-624.66), and the SNP behaved in a dominant model (A/A vs. A/G+G/G p=0.0009; OR=107.66; 95% CI=3.85-3013.31), being the A/G genotype present only in weak/transient responders, conferring susceptibility to poor response to the immune treatment.DISCUSSION: CNOT1 is known to be involved in the control of mRNA deadenylation and mRNA decay. Moreover, CNOT1 has been recently described as being involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes mediated by tristetraprolin (TTP). The TTP-CCR4-NOT complex (CNOT1 in the CCR4-NOT complex is the binding site for TTP) has been reported as interfering with HIV replication, through post-transcriptional control. Therefore, we can hypothesize that genetic variation occurring in the CNOT1 gene could impair the TTP-CCR4-NOT complex, thus interfering with HIV replication and/or host immune response.CONCLUSIONS: Being aware that our findings are exclusive to the 18 patients studied with a need for replication, and that the genetic variant of CNOT1 gene, localized at intron 3, has no known functional effect, we propose a novel potential candidate locus for the modulation of the response to the immune treatment, and open a discussion on the necessity to consider the host genome as another potential variant to be evaluated when designing an immune therapy study."

The epigenetic underpinnings of adiposity are not well understood, and studies of DNA methylation in relation to adiposity have rarely focused on target adipose tissue. Objectives were to evaluate whether genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue and peripheral blood leukocytes are associated with measures of adiposity, including central fat mass, body fat distribution and body mass index.METHODS: Participants were 106 men and women (mean age 47 years) from the New England Family Study. DNA methylation was evaluated using the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. Adiposity phenotypes included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-assessed android fat mass, android:gynoid fat ratio and trunk:limb fat ratio, as well as body mass index.RESULTS: Adipose tissue genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were associated with all four adiposity phenotypes, after adjusting for race, sex and current smoking (omnibus p-values &lt;0.001). After further adjustment for adipose cell-mixture effects, associations with android fat mass, android:gynoid fat ratio, and trunk:limb fat ratio remained. In gene-specific analyses, adiposity phenotypes were associated with adipose tissue DNA methylation in several genes that are biologically relevant to the development of adiposity, such as AOC3, LIPE, SOD3, AQP7 and CETP. Blood DNA methylation profiles were not associated with adiposity, before or after adjustment for blood leukocyte cell mixture effects.CONCLUSION: Findings show that DNA methylation patterns in adipose tissue are associated with adiposity.KEYWORDS: Adiposity, adipose tissue, DNA methylation, epigenetics."

This variant, in which alanine is replaced by threonine at position 673 (A673T), appears to protect against late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). We evaluated the frequency of this variant in AD cases and cognitively normal controls to determine whether this variant will significantly contribute to risk assessment in individuals in the United States.OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of the APP A673T variant in a large group of elderly cognitively normal controls and AD cases from the United States and in 2 case-control cohorts from Sweden.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control association analysis of variant APP A673T in US and Swedish white individuals comparing AD cases with cognitively intact elderly controls. Participants were ascertained at multiple university-associated medical centers and clinics across the United States and Sweden by study-specific sampling methods. They were from case-control studies, community-based prospective cohort studies, and studies that ascertained multiplex families from multiple sources.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Genotypes for the APP A673T variant were determined using the Infinium HumanExome V1 Beadchip (Illumina, Inc) and by TaqMan genotyping (Life Technologies).RESULTS: The A673T variant genotypes were evaluated in 8943 US AD cases, 10 480 US cognitively normal controls, 862 Swedish AD cases, and 707 Swedish cognitively normal controls. We identified 3 US individuals heterozygous for A673T, including 1 AD case (age at onset, 89 years) and 2 controls (age at last examination, 82 and 77 years). The remaining US samples were homozygous for the alanine (A673) allele. In the Swedish samples, 3 controls were heterozygous for A673T and all AD cases were homozygous for the A673 allele. We also genotyped a US family previously reported to harbor the A673T variant and found a mother-daughter pair, both cognitively normal at ages 72 and 84 years, respectively, who were both heterozygous for A673T; however, all individuals with AD in the family were homozygous for A673.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The A673T variant is extremely rare in US cohorts and does not play a substantial role in risk for AD in this population. This variant may be primarily restricted to Icelandic and Scandinavian populations."

Failure of this interplay leads to poor placental development and fetal growth restriction (FGR), which is associated with future metabolic disease. We investigated whether whole genome methylation differences existed in umbilical cord blood and placenta, between gestational-matched, FGR, and appropriately grown (AGA) neonates. Using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip®, we found that DNA from umbilical cord blood of FGR born at term (n = 19) had 839 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) that reached genome-wide significance compared with AGA (n = 18). Using gestational age as a continuous variable, we identified 76,249 DMPs in cord blood (adj. P &lt; 0.05) of which 121 DMPs were common to the 839 DMPs and were still evident when comparing 12 FGR with 12 AGA [39.9 ± 1.2 vs. 40.0 ± 1.0 weeks (mean ± SD), respectively]. A total of 53 DMPs had a β methylation difference &gt;10% and 25 genes were co-methylated more than twice within 1000 base pairs. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of DMPs supported their involvement in gene regulation and transcription pathways related to organ development and metabolic function. A similar profile of DMPs was found across different cell types in the cord blood. At term, no DMPs between FGR and AGA placentae reached genome-wide significance, validated with an external dataset. GO analysis of 284 pre-term, placental DMPs associated with autophagy, oxidative stress and hormonal responses. Growth restricted neonates have distinct DNA methylation profiles in pre-term placenta and in cord blood at birth, which may predispose to future adult disease."

However, the CpG island methylation level only accounts for a fraction of the variance in gene expression, and methylation in other domains is hypothesized to play a role. We hypothesized that regions of very high stability in methylation would exist and provide biological insight into the role of methylation both within and outside CpG islands.RESULTS: We set out to identify highly stable regions in the human methylome, based on the subset of CpGs assayed with an Illumina Infinium 450 K array. Using 1,737 samples from 30 publically available studies, we identified 15,224 CpGs that are 'ultrastable' in their state across tissues and developmental stages (974 always methylated; 14,250 always unmethylated). Further analysis of ultrastable CpGs led us to identify a novel subset of CpG islands, 'ravines', which exhibit a markedly consistent pattern of low methylation with highly methylated flanking shores and shelves. We distinguish ravines from other CpG islands characterized by a broader flanking region of low methylation. Interestingly, ravines are associated with higher gene expression compared to typical unmethylated CpG islands, and are more often found near housekeeping genes.CONCLUSIONS: The identification of ultrastable sites in the human methylome led us to identify a subclass of CpG islands characterized by a very stable pattern of methylation encompassing the island and flanking regions, established early in development and maintained through differentiation. This pattern is associated with particularly high levels of gene expression, providing new evidence that methylation beyond the CpG island could play a role in gene expression."

In this study, we investigate short-term effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on DNA methylation levels at CpG sites across the genome in circulating blood in asthmatics.METHODS: A double-blind crossover study of filtered air and diesel exhaust exposures was performed on sixteen non-smoking asthmatic subjects. Blood samples were collected pre-exposure, and then 6 and 30 hours post-exposure. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA methylation was interrogated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Array. Exposure-related changes in DNA methylation were identified. In addition, CpG sites overlapping with Alu or LINE1 repetitive elements and candidate microRNA loci were also analyzed.RESULTS: DNA methylation at 2827 CpG sites were affected by exposure to diesel exhaust but not filtered air; these sites enriched for genes involved in protein kinase and NFkB pathways. CpG sites with significant changes in response to diesel exhaust exposure primarily became less methylated, with a site residing within GSTP1 being among the significant hits. Diesel exhaust-associated change was also found for CpG sites overlapping with Alu and LINE1 elements as well as for a site within miR-21.CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to diesel exhaust resulted in DNA methylation changes at CpG sites residing in genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress response, repetitive elements, and microRNA. This provides plausibility for the role of DNA methylation in pathways by which airborne particulate matter impacts gene expression and offers support for including DNA methylation analysis in future efforts to understand the interactions between environmental exposures and biological systems."

We hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in EMT and to test this hypothesis we analyzed global and gene-specific changes in DNA methylation during TGF-β-induced EMT in ovarian cancer cells. Epigenetic profiling using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450) revealed extensive (P &lt; 0.01) methylation changes after TGF-β stimulation (468 and 390 CpG sites altered at 48 and 120 h post cytokine treatment, respectively). The majority of gene-specific TGF-β-induced methylation changes occurred in CpG islands located in or near promoters (193 and 494 genes hypermethylated at 48 and 120 h after TGF-β stimulation, respectively). Furthermore, methylation changes were sustained for the duration of TGF-β treatment and reversible after the cytokine removal. Pathway analysis of the hypermethylated loci identified functional networks strongly associated with EMT and cancer progression, including cellular movement, cell cycle, organ morphology, cellular development, and cell death and survival. Altered methylation and corresponding expression of specific genes during TGF-β-induced EMT included CDH1 (E-cadherin) and COL1A1 (collagen 1A1). Furthermore, TGF-β induced both expression and activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) -1, -3A, and -3B, and treatment with the DNMT inhibitor SGI-110 prevented TGF-β-induced EMT. These results demonstrate that dynamic changes in the DNA methylome are implicated in TGF-β-induced EMT and metastasis. We suggest that targeting DNMTs may inhibit this process by reversing the EMT genes silenced by DNA methylation in cancer."

We hypothesize that the tissue-specific expression of the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster will show an inverse pattern with DNA methylation, and that repression in non- or low-expressing tissue, such as the intestine, can be reversed using epigenetic drugs.METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed DNA samples from different human adult tissues (liver, intestine, leukocytes, brain, kidney, pancreas, muscle and sperm) using the Infinium HumanMethyation450 BeadChip array. DNA methylation profiles in APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster were confirmed by bisulfite PCR and pyrosequencing. To determine whether the observed tissue-specific methylation was associated with the expression profile we exposed intestinal TC7/Caco-2 cells to the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine and monitored intestinal APOA1/C3/A4/A5 transcript re-expression by RT-qPCR. The promoters of APOA1, APOC3 and APOA5 genes were less methylated in liver compared to other tissues, and APOA4 gene was highly methylated in most tissues and partially methylated in liver and intestine. In TC7/Caco-2 cells, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment induced a decrease between 37 and 24% in the methylation levels of APOA1/C3/A4/A5 genes and a concomitant re-expression mainly in APOA1, APOA4 and APOA5 genes ranging from 22 to 600%.CONCLUSIONS: We have determined the methylation patterns of the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 cluster that may be directly involved in the transcriptional regulation of this cluster.

Previous exposure to hyperglycemic conditions accelerates a decline in cellular function through metabolic memory despite normalization of glycemic control. Persistent, hyperglycemia-induced epigenetic patterns are considered a central mechanism that activates metabolic memory; however, this has not been investigated in patient-derived fibroblasts from DFUs. We generated a cohort of patient-derived lines from DFU fibroblasts (DFUF), and site- and age-matched diabetic foot fibroblasts (DFF) and non-diabetic foot fibroblasts (NFF) to investigate global and genome-wide DNA methylation patterns using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K array. DFFs and DFUFs demonstrated significantly lower global DNA methylation compared to NFFs (p = 0.03). Hierarchical clustering of differentially methylated probes (DMPs, p = 0.05) showed that DFFs and DFUFs cluster together and separately from NFFs. Twenty-five percent of the same probes were identified as DMPs when individually comparing DFF and DFUF to NFF. Functional annotation identified enrichment of DMPs associated with genes critical to wound repair, including angiogenesis (p = 0.07) and extracellular matrix assembly (p = 0.035). Identification of sustained DNA methylation patterns in patient-derived fibroblasts after prolonged passage in normoglycemic conditions demonstrates persistent metabolic memory. These findings suggest that epigenetic-related metabolic memory may also underlie differences in wound healing phenotypes and can potentially identify therapeutic targets."

Most SNP discovery projects in nonmodel organisms apply a strategy for identifying putative SNPs based on filtering rules that account for random sequencing errors. Here, we analyse data used to develop 4723 novel SNPs for the commercially important deep-sea fish, orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), to assess the impact of not accounting for systematic sequencing errors when filtering identified polymorphisms when discovering SNPs. We used SAMtools to identify polymorphisms in a velvet assembly of genomic DNA sequence data from seven individuals. The resulting set of polymorphisms were filtered to minimize 'bycatch'-polymorphisms caused by sequencing or assembly error. An Illumina Infinium SNP chip was used to genotype a final set of 7714 polymorphisms across 1734 individuals. Five predictors were examined for their effect on the probability of obtaining an assayable SNP: depth of coverage, number of reads that support a variant, polymorphism type (e.g. A/C), strand-bias and Illumina SNP probe design score. Our results indicate that filtering out systematic sequencing errors could substantially improve the efficiency of SNP discovery. We show that BLASTX can be used as an efficient tool to identify single-copy genomic regions in the absence of a reference genome. The results have implications for research aiming to identify assayable SNPs and build SNP genotyping assays for nonmodel organisms."

This study identifies potential TSGs in HCCs using methylation profiling and pharmacological unmasking of methylated TSGs.METHODS: Methylation profiling was performed on 22 pairs of HCCs and their corresponding noncancerous liver tissues using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. We also determined the gene reexpression after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) and trichostatin A (TSA) in 5 HCC cell lines.RESULTS: We selected CpGs that exhibited a significant increase in methylation in HCC tissues compared with that of the noncancerous control group. Two hundred and thirteen CpGs on different gene promoters with a mean difference in the β value ≥0.15 and a value of p &lt; 0.05 were selected. Of the 213 genes, 45 genes were upregulated in 3 or more HCC cell lines with multiplier value of differences ≥2.0 after 5-Aza-dC and TSA treatment.CONCLUSIONS: We identified several potential TSGs that participate in transcription inactivation through epigenetic interactions in HCC. The results of this study are important for the understanding of functionally important epigenetic alterations in HCC."

Altered DNA methylation patterns during tumor progression were also analyzed.RESULTS: We identified 38,330 CpG sites with significant differences in methylation levels between HCCs and noncancerous livers (DM-CpGs) using strict criteria. Of the DM-CpGs, 92% were hypomethylated and only 3,051 CpGs (8%) were hypermethylated in HCC. The DM-CpGs were more prevalent within intergenic regions with isolated CpGs. In contrast, DM-CpGs that were hypermethylated in HCC were predominantly located within promoter regions and CpG islands (p &lt; 0.0001). The association between methylation profiles of DM-CpGs and tumor size was statistically significant, especially in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive cases (p = 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: We clarified the unique characteristics of DM-CpGs in human HCCs. The stepwise progression of alterations in DNA methylation was a common feature of HCV-related hepatocarcinogenesis."

Cervical cancer (CC), and its cause, human papillomavirus (HPV) are both challenges for the immune system. We present here evidence of epigenetic activation of immune system genes in CC. Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip identified genes, which were all significantly hypomethylated in CC tissue versus normal tissue. The GeneMANIA computer program identified a tight network between those genes. The most strongly correlated genes based on their function are immune effectors' process (AIM2, BST2, BTN3A3, and IL12RB1) and response to virus related genes (AIM2, BST2, and IL12RB1). Thus, activation of those genes through demethylation is probably triggered by HPV oncogenes. In conclusion, the immune system of women who do not develop CC is probably activated earlier through DNA demethylation."

Parathyroid tumors are the most common clinical manifestations, occurring in more than 90% of MEN1 patients. Heterozygous germline mutations of the MENIN gene underlie the tumorigenesis in MEN1 and epigenetic alterations along with germline mutations may contribute to tumorigenesis. Here, we investigated the associations between genotype and phenotype in Korean MEN1 patients.METHODS: We analyzed medical records from 14 unrelated MEN1 patients who had newly confirmed MENIN germline mutations, together with 14 previous reports in Korea. Aberrant DNA methylations were also examined in MEN1-related parathyroid tumors using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip.RESULTS: Total 28 germline mutations of MENIN were relatively highly concentrated in exons 7 and 8 compared to previous reports from Western countries. Six mutations (c.111dupT/p.S38Ffs(*)79, c.225_226insT/p.T76Yfs(*)41, c.383_398del16/p.S128Tfs(*)52, c.746dupT/p.H250Afs(*)20, c.1150G&gt;T/p.E384(*), and c.1508G&gt;A/p.G503N) were newly found in the present study. Of interest, four patients (15%) showed unusual initial presentations and three patients were diagnosed incidentally at the general medical checkup. We also found three distinct sites in exon 2 of MENIN were significantly hypomethylated in the MEN1 parathyroid tumors, comparing correspondent blood samples.CONCLUSION: We also have found a lack of genotype/phenotype correlation in Korean MEN1 patients. There were not a few unusual initial manifestations in MEN1 patients, thus, genetic testing for the MENIN germline mutations can provide important information for the better prognosis. Further studies are warranted to investigate altered DNA methylations in the MENIN gene involved in tumorigenesis."

Although the science of genomics has opened our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of asthma, epigenetics is emerging as a mechanism whereby the expression of disease-risk genes may be influenced by environmental exposure.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to discuss the methodology of data collection and evaluation involved in genome-wide methylation profiling (epigenomic) through presentation of data generated for a population presenting with severe asthma.METHOD: Over 14,000 gene promoter sites were analyzed for methylation status among six subjects with severe asthma and four normal controls in this pilot study. Two duplicate samples were used as technical replicates. Nonsmoking case/control subjects were chosen based on similar gender and age. Blood samples were used for DNA extraction, and methylation data were collected utilizing the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27BeadChip platform.RESULTS: Technical replicates were highly concordant, and statistically significant differences were found in methylation profiles between subjects with severe asthma and normal controls (p &lt; 10(-8)), some previously reported with pulmonary function and others never before reported. After correction for multiple testing, three gene promoter regions remained statistically different: FAM181A, ZNF718, and MRI1.DISCUSSION: This research supports the internal validity of the Illumina platform in methylation analysis of DNA from stored blood samples. Although significant differences in methylation were noted between subjects with severe asthma and controls, the small sample size warrants further investigation into these results."

Using previously published genome-wide expression data of 33 pairs of cartilage samples, of which 13 pairs were overlapping with the current methylation dataset, we assessed gene expression differences in differentially methylated regions (DMRs).RESULTS: Principal component analysis of the methylation data revealed distinct clustering of knee and hip samples, irrespective of OA pathophysiology. A total of 6272 CpG dinucleotides were differentially methylated between the two joints, comprising a total of 357 DMRs containing 1817 CpGs and 245 unique genes. Enrichment analysis of genes proximal of the DMRs revealed significant enrichment for developmental pathways and homeobox (HOX) genes. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis of DMR genes exposed distinct knee and hip expression patterns.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal consistent DMRs between knee and hip articular cartilage that marked transcriptomic differences among HOX genes, which were not reflecting the temporal sequential HOX expression pattern during development. This implies distinct mechanisms for maintaining cartilage integrity in adulthood, thereby contributing to our understanding of cartilage homeostasis and future tissue regeneration approaches."

Adult plant resistance (APR), based upon partial resistance, has proven to be a durable rust management strategy in other cereal rust pathosystems. The crown rust APR in the oat line MN841801 has been effective for more than 30 years. The genetic basis of this APR was studied under field conditions in three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations: 1) AC Assiniboia/MN841801, 2) AC Medallion/MN841801, and 3) Makuru/MN841801. The populations were evaluated for crown rust resistance with the crown rust isolate CR251 (race BRBB) in multiple environments. The 6 K oat and 90 K wheat Illumina Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used for genotyping the AC Assiniboia/MN841801 population. KASP assays were designed for selected SNPs and genotyped on the other two populations.RESULTS: This study reports a high density genetic linkage map constructed with oat and wheat SNP markers in the AC Assiniboia/MN841801 RIL population. Most wheat SNPs were monomorphic in the oat population. However the polymorphic wheat SNPs could be scored accurately and integrated well into the linkage map. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on oat chromosome 14D, designated QPc.crc-14D, explained up to 76% of the APR phenotypic variance. This QTL is flanked by two SNP markers, GMI_GBS_90753 and GMI_ES14_c1439_83. QPc.crc-14D was validated in the populations AC Medallion/MN841801 and Makuru/MN841801.CONCLUSIONS: We report the first APR QTL in oat with a large and consistent effect. QPc.crc-14D was statistically significant in all environments tested in each of the three oat populations. QPc.crc-14D is a suitable candidate for use in marker-assisted breeding and also an excellent target for map-based cloning. This is also the first study to use the 90 K wheat Infinium SNP array on oat for marker development and comparative mapping. The Infinium SNP array is a useful tool for saturating oat maps with markers. Synteny with wheat suggests that QPc.crc-14D is orthologous with the stripe rust APR gene Yr16 in wheat."

It has been shown that pluripotent stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, appear to have a hypermethylated status compared with differentiated cells. However, the epigenetic differences in genes that maintain stemness and regulate reprogramming between embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells remain unclear. Additionally, differential methylation patterns of induced pluripotent stem cells generated using diverse methods require further study.METHODOLOGY: Here, we determined the DNA methylation profiles of 10 human cell lines, including 2 ESC lines, 4 virally derived iPSC lines, 2 episomally derived iPSC lines, and the 2 parental cell lines from which the iPSCs were derived using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. The iPSCs exhibited a hypermethylation status similar to that of ESCs but with distinct differences from the parental cells. Genes with a common methylation pattern between iPSCs and ESCs were classified as critical factors for stemness, whereas differences between iPSCs and ESCs suggested that iPSCs partly retained the parental characteristics and gained de novo methylation aberrances during cellular reprogramming. No significant differences were identified between virally and episomally derived iPSCs. This study determined in detail the de novo differential methylation signatures of particular stem cell lines.CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the DNA methylation profiles of human iPSCs generated using both viral and episomal methods, the corresponding somatic cells, and hESCs. Series of ss-DMRs and ES-iPS-DMRs were defined with high resolution. Knowledge of this type of epigenetic information could be used as a signature for stemness and self-renewal and provides a potential method for selecting optimal pluripotent stem cells for human regenerative medicine."

As part of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (HM450) BeadChip was used to measure DNA methylation in peripheral blood obtained from ~3000 African American study participants. Over 480,000 cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide sites were surveyed on the HM450 BeadChip. To evaluate the impact of technical variation, 265 technical replicates from 130 participants were included in the study.RESULTS: For each CpG site, we calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to compare variation of methylation levels within- and between-replicate pairs, ranging between 0 and 1. We modeled the distribution of ICC as a mixture of censored or truncated normal and normal distributions using an EM algorithm. The CpG sites were clustered into low- and high-reliability groups, according to the calculated posterior probabilities. We also demonstrated the performance of this clustering when applied to a study of association between methylation levels and smoking status of individuals. For the CpG sites showing genome-wide significant association with smoking status, most (~96%) were seen from sites in the high reliability cluster.CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that CpG sites with low ICC may be excluded from subsequent association analyses, or extra caution needs to be taken for associations at such sites."

The work will facilitate genetic and evolutionary studies in Brassicaceae. A broccoli population, VI-158 × BNC, consisting of 150 F2:3 families was used to create a saturated Brassica oleracea (diploid: CC) linkage map using a recently developed rapeseed (Brassica napus) (tetraploid: AACC) Illumina Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. The map consisted of 547 non-redundant SNP markers spanning 948.1 cM across nine chromosomes with an average interval size of 1.7 cM. As the SNPs are anchored to the genomic reference sequence of the rapid cycling B. oleracea TO1000, we were able to estimate that the map provides 96 % coverage of the diploid genome. Carotenoid analysis of 2 years data identified 3 QTLs on two chromosomes that are associated with up to half of the phenotypic variation associated with the accumulation of total or individual compounds. By searching the genome sequences of the two related diploid species (B. oleracea and B. rapa), we further identified putative carotenoid candidate genes in the region of these QTLs. This is the first description of the use of a B. napus SNP array to rapidly construct high-density genetic linkage maps of one of the constituent diploid species. The unambiguous nature of these markers with regard to genomic sequences provides evidence to the nature of genes underlying the QTL, and demonstrates the value and impact this resource will have on Brassica research."

At present, each marker is individually tested by distinct assays. Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays (HM450) enable the determination of large-scale methylation profiles and genome-wide DNA copy number changes. Algorithms have been developed to detect the glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) associated with IDH1/2 mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT promoter methylation using a single assay.METHODS: Here, we retrospectively investigated the diagnostic and prognostic performance of these algorithms in comparison to individual marker testing and patient outcome in the biomarker cohort (n = 115 patients) of the NOA-04 trial.RESULTS: Concordance for IDH and 1p/19q status was very high: In 92% of samples, the HM450 and reference data agreed. In discordant samples, survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses suggested a more accurate assessment of biological phenotype by the HM450 analysis. The HM450-derived MGMT-STP27 model to calculate MGMT promoter methylation probability revealed this aberration in a significantly higher fraction of samples than conventional methylation-specific PCR, with 87 of 91 G-CIMP tumors predicted as MGMT promoter-methylated. Pyrosequencing of discordant samples confirmed the HM450 assessment in 14 of 17 cases.CONCLUSIONS: G-CIMP and 1p/19q codeletion are reliably detectable by HM450 analysis and are associated with prognosis in the NOA-04 trial. For MGMT, HM450 suggests promoter methylation in the vast majority of G-CIMP tumors, which is supported by pyrosequencing."

Participants were between 18 and 60 years of age (mean 40.31 years), had worked in the ferromanganese refinery for at least 1 year and lived in the local area.RESULTS: The GXMEWHC study included a baseline survey. Participants were divided into four groups according to manganese (Mn) cumulative exposure index (Mn-CEI) levels: an internal control group (Mn-CEI &lt;1.0 mg/m(3) year), a low exposure group (1.0 mg/m(3) year≤Mn-CEI&lt;2.0 mg/m(3) year), a medium exposure group (2.0 mg/m(3) year≤Mn-CEI&lt;5.0 mg/m(3) year) and a high exposure group (Mn-CEI≥5.0 mg/m(3) year).

However, the utility of DBS is restricted by the limited amount and quality of extractable biomolecules (including DNA), especially for genome wide profiling. Degradation of DNA in DBS often occurs during storage and extraction. Moreover, amplifying small quantities of DNA often leads to a bias in subsequent data, particularly in methylome profiles. Thus it is important to develop methodologies that maximize both the yield and quality of DNA from DBS for downstream analyses.RESULTS: Using combinations of in-house-derived and modified commercial extraction kits, we developed a robust and efficient protocol, compatible with methylome studies, many of which require stringent bisulfite conversion steps. Several parameters were tested in a step-wise manner, including blood extraction, cell lysis, protein digestion, and DNA precipitation, purification and elution. DNA quality was assessed based on spectrophotometric measurements, DNA detectability by PCR, and DNA integrity by gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analyses. Genome scale Infinium HumanMethylation450 and locus-specific pyrosequencing data generated using the refined DBS extraction protocol were of high quality, reproducible and consistent.CONCLUSIONS: This study may prove useful to meet the increased demand for research on prenatal, particularly epigenetic, origins of human diseases and for newborn screening programs, all of which are often based on DNA extracted from DBS."

However, the exact mechanisms regulating the pathogenesis of PE remain unclear. While many studies have investigated changes in gene expression in the PE placenta, the role of epigenetics in PE associated placental dysfunction remains unclear. Using the genome-wide Illumina Infinium Methylation 450 BeadChip array, we analyzed gene-specific alterations in DNA methylation in placental biopsies collected from normal pregnant women delivering at term (n = 14), with term PE (≥37 weeks; n = 19) or with preterm PE (&lt;37 weeks, n = 12). Of the 485,582 gene loci on the array, compared to controls, 229 loci were differentially methylated in PE placentas and 3411 loci were differentially methylated in preterm PE (step up p-value &lt;0.05 and &gt;5% methylation difference). Functional annotation of the differentially methylated genes in preterm PE placentas revealed a 32 gene cluster in the cadherin and cell adhesion functional groups (Benjamini p&lt;0.00001). Hypermethylation of CDH11 (p = 0.0143), COL5A1 (p = 0.0127) and TNF (p = 0.0098) and hypomethylation of NCAM1 (p = 0.0158) was associated with altered mRNA expression in preterm PE placentas. Demethylation of first trimester extravillous trophoblast cells resulted in altered CDH11 (p = 0.0087), COL5A1 (p = 0.0043), NCAM1 (p = 0.0260) and TNF (p = 0.0022) mRNA expression. These studies demonstrate aberrant methylation, correlating with disease severity, in PE placentas. Furthermore, we provide evidence that disruption of gene-specific methylation in preterm PE placentas and first trimester trophoblasts is significantly associated with altered gene expression demonstrating that epigenetic modifications early in pregnancy can have effects on trophoblast function contributing to PE."

To investigate if epigenetic mechanisms could be involved in virus-induced asthma exacerbations, we undertook DNA methylation profiling in asthmatic and healthy nasal epithelial cells (NECs) during Human Rhinovirus (HRV) infection in vitro.METHODS: Global and loci-specific methylation profiles were determined via Alu element and Infinium Human Methylation 450 K microarray, respectively. Principal components analysis identified the genomic loci influenced the most by disease-status and infection. Real-time PCR and pyrosequencing were used to confirm gene expression and DNA methylation, respectively.RESULTS: HRV infection significantly increased global DNA methylation in cells from asthmatic subjects only (43.6% to 44.1%, p = 0.04). Microarray analysis revealed 389 differentially methylated loci either based on disease status, or caused by virus infection. There were disease-associated DNA methylation patterns that were not affected by HRV infection as well as HRV-induced DNA methylation changes that were unique to each group. A common methylation locus stood out in response to HRV infection in both groups, where the small nucleolar RNA, H/ACA box 12 (SNORA12) is located. Further analysis indicated that a relationship existed between SNORA12 DNA methylation and gene expression in response to HRV infection.CONCLUSIONS: We describe for the first time that Human rhinovirus infection causes DNA methylation changes in airway epithelial cells that differ between asthmatic and healthy subjects. These epigenetic differences may possibly explain the mechanism by which respiratory viruses cause asthma exacerbations."

In past decades, there have been substantial changes in phenotypic properties of rapeseed as a result of extensive breeding effort. Uncovering the underlying patterns of allelic variation in the context of genome organisation would provide knowledge to guide future genetic improvement. We assessed genome-wide genetic changes, including population structure, genetic relatedness, the extent of linkage disequilibrium, nucleotide diversity and genetic differentiation based on F ST outlier detection, for a panel of 472 Brassica napus inbred accessions using a 60 k Brassica Infinium® SNP array. We found genetic diversity varied in different sub-groups. Moreover, the genetic diversity increased from 1950 to 1980 and then remained at a similar level in China and Europe. We also found ~6-10 % genomic regions revealed high F ST values. Some QTLs previously associated with important agronomic traits overlapped with these regions. Overall, the B. napus C genome was found to have more high F ST signals than the A genome, and we concluded that the C genome may contribute more valuable alleles to generate elite traits. The results of this study indicate that considerable genome variation had been incorporated within rapeseed breeding programs over past decades. These results also contribute to understanding the impact of rapeseed improvement on available genome variation and the potential for dissecting complex agronomic traits."

Classical life history theory predicts that trade-offs between reproductive success and survival should lead to the evolution of an optimal strategy in a given population. However, variation in mating strategies generally persists, and in general, there remains a poor understanding of genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying this variation. One extreme case of this is in the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which can show variation in the age at which they return from their marine migration to spawn (i.e. their 'sea age'). This results in large size differences between strategies, with direct implications for individual fitness. Here, we used an Illumina Infinium SNP array to identify regions of the genome associated with variation in sea age in a large population of Atlantic salmon in Northern Europe, implementing individual-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and population-based FST outlier analyses. We identified several regions of the genome which vary in association with phenotype and/or selection between sea ages, with nearby genes having functions related to muscle development, metabolism, immune response and mate choice. In addition, we found that individuals of different sea ages belong to different, yet sympatric populations in this system, indicating that reproductive isolation may be driven by divergence between stable strategies. Overall, this study demonstrates how genome-wide methodologies can be integrated with samples collected from wild, structured populations to understand their ecology and evolution in a natural context."

To better characterize and assess the genetic potential for increasing aroma quality by breeding, a quantity trait locus (QTL) analysis approach was carried out in an F1 population segregating largely for fruit traits.RESULTS: Linkage maps were constructed using the IPSC peach 9 K Infinium ® II array, rendering dense genetic maps, except in the case of certain chromosomes, probably due to identity-by-descent of those chromosomes in the parental genotypes. The variability in compounds associated with aroma was analyzed by a metabolomic approach based on GC-MS to profile 81 volatiles across the population from two locations. Quality-related traits were also studied to assess possible pleiotropic effects. Correlation-based analysis of the volatile dataset revealed that the peach volatilome is organized into modules formed by compounds from the same biosynthetic origin or which share similar chemical structures. QTL mapping showed clustering of volatile QTL included in the same volatile modules, indicating that some are subjected to joint genetic control. The monoterpene module is controlled by a unique locus at the top of LG4, a locus previously shown to affect the levels of two terpenoid compounds. At the bottom of LG4, a locus controlling several volatiles but also melting/non-melting and maturity-related traits was found, suggesting putative pleiotropic effects. In addition, two novel loci controlling lactones and esters in linkage groups 5 and 6 were discovered.CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here give light on the mode of inheritance of the peach volatilome confirming previously loci controlling the aroma of peach but also identifying novel ones."

Available tools to analyze the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip focus on comparing methylation levels per locus. Other tools combine multiple probes into a range, identifying differential methylated regions (DMRs). These tools all require groups of samples to compare. However, comparison of unique, individual samples is essential in situations where larger sample sizes are not possible.RESULTS: DMRforPairs was designed to compare regional methylation status between unique samples. It identifies probe dense genomic regions and quantifies/tests their (difference in) methylation level between the samples. As a proof of concept, DMRforPairs is applied to public data from four human cell lines: two lymphoblastoid cell lines from healthy individuals and the cancer cell lines A431 and MCF7 (including 2 technical replicates each). DMRforPairs identified an increasing number of DMRs related to the sample phenotype when biological similarity of the samples decreased. DMRs identified by DMRforPairs were related to the biological origin of the cell lines.CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, DMRforPairs is the first tool to identify and visualize relevant and significant differentially methylated regions between unique samples."

The aim of the present study was to address the DNA methylation status of genes relevant in colorectal carcinogenesis and its progression, such as genes frequently mutated in CRC, genes involved in the DNA repair and Wnt signaling pathway.MATERIAL &amp; METHODS: We analyzed methylation status in totally 160 genes in 12 paired colorectal tumors and adjacent healthy mucosal tissues using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip.RESULTS: We found significantly aberrant methylation in 23 genes (NEIL1, NEIL3, DCLRE1C, NHEJ1, GTF2H5, CCNH, CTNNB1, DKK2, DKK3, FZD5 LRP5, TLE3, WNT2, WNT3A, WNT6, TCF7L1, CASP8, EDNRB1, GPC6, KIAA1804, MYO1B, SMAD2 and TTN). External validation by mRNA expression showed a good agreement between hypermethylation in cancer and down-regulated mRNA expression of the genes EDNRB1, GPC6 and SMAD2, and between hypomethylation and up-regulated mRNA expression of the CASP8 and DCLRE1C genes.CONCLUSION: Aberrant methylation of the DCLRE1C and GPC6 genes are presented here for the first time and are therefore of special interest for further validation as novel candidate biomarker genes in CRC, and merit further validation with specific assays."

As such, any tool that speeds up its genetic improvement process, such as marker-assisted breeding is invaluable. Previously, genetic linkage maps based on AFLP, RFLP and SSR markers were developed and QTLs for fatty acid composition and yield components identified. High density genetic maps of crosses of different genetic backgrounds are indispensable tools for investigating oil palm genetics. They are also useful for comparative mapping analyses to identify markers closely linked to traits of interest.RESULTS: A 4.5 K customized oil palm SNP array was developed using the Illumina Infinium platform. The SNPs and 252 SSRs were genotyped on two mapping populations, an intraspecific cross with 87 palms and an interspecific cross with 108 palms. Parental maps with 16 linkage groups (LGs), were constructed for the three fruit forms of E. guineensis (dura, pisifera and tenera). Map resolution was further increased by integrating the dura and pisifera maps into an intraspecific integrated map with 1,331 markers spanning 1,867 cM. We also report the first map of a Colombian E. oleifera, comprising 10 LGs with 65 markers spanning 471 cM. Although not very dense due to the high level of homozygosity in E. oleifera, the LGs were successfully integrated with the LGs of the tenera map. Direct comparison between the parental maps identified 603 transferable markers polymorphic in at least two of the parents. Further analysis revealed a high degree of marker transferability covering 1,075 cM, between the intra- and interspecific integrated maps. The interspecific cross displayed higher segregation distortion than the intraspecific cross. However, inclusion of distorted markers in the genetic maps did not disrupt the marker order and no map expansion was observed.CONCLUSIONS: The high density SNP and SSR-based genetic maps reported in this paper have greatly improved marker density and genome coverage in comparison with the first reference map based on AFLP and SSR markers. Therefore, it is foreseen that they will be more useful for fine mapping of QTLs and whole genome association mapping studies in oil palm."

In this study, we analyzed the genome-wide burden of large CNVs &gt; 100 kb in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), a neurodegenerative disease of the eye that is the largest cause of irreversible blindness.METHODS: Genome-wide analysis of CNVs &gt; 100 kb were analyzed in a total of 1720 individuals, including an Indian cohort (347 POAG cases and 345 controls) and a Caucasian cohort (624 cases and 404 controls). All the CNV data were obtained from experiments performed on Illumina 660W-Quad (infinium) arrays.RESULTS: We observed that for both the populations CNVs &gt; 1 Mb was significantly enriched for gene-rich regions unique to the POAG cases (P &lt; 10(-11)). In the Indian cohort CNVs &gt; 1 Mb (39 calls) in patients influenced 125 genes while in controls 31 such CNVs influenced only 5 genes with no overlap. In both cohorts we observed 1.9-fold gene enrichment in patients for deletions compared to duplications, while such a bias was not observed in controls (0.3-fold). Overall duplications &gt; 1 Mb were more than deletions (Del/Dup = 0.82) confirming that the enrichment of gene-rich deletions in patients was associated with the disease. Of the 39 CNVs &gt; 1 Mb from Indian patients, 28 (72%) also were implicated in other neurodegenerative disorders, like autism, schizophrenia, sensorineural hearing loss, and so forth. We found one large duplication encompassing CNTN4 gene in Indian and Caucasian POAG patients that was absent in the controls.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our study is the first report on large CNV bias for gene-rich regions in glaucomatous neurodegeneration, implicating its impact across populations of contrasting ethnicities. We identified CNTN4 as a novel candidate gene for POAG."

These intrauterine exposures may lead to epigenetic alterations to the DNA during this vulnerable time of fetal development, which may have important lifetime health consequences. In this study we investigated patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip in the umbilical cord blood of neonates exposed to non-medicated maternal depression or anxiety (n = 13), or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy (n = 22), relative to unexposed neonates (n = 23). We identified 42 CpG sites with significantly different DNA methylation levels in neonates exposed to non-medicated depression or anxiety relative to controls. CpG site methylation was not significantly different in neonates exposed to SSRIs relative to the controls, after adjusting for multiple comparisons. In neonates exposed either to non-medicated maternal depression or SSRIs, the vast majority of CpG sites displayed lower DNA methylation relative to the controls, but differences were very small. A gene ontology analysis suggests significant clustering of the top genes associated with non-medicated maternal depression/anxiety, related to regulation of transcription, translation, and cell division processes (e.g., negative regulation of translation in response to oxidative stress, regulation of mRNA export from the nucleus, regulation of stem cell division). While the functional consequences of these findings are yet to be determined, these small DNA methylation differences may suggest a possible role for epigenetic processes in the development of neonates exposed to non-medicated maternal depression/anxiety."

Children with GD have less exposure time to environmental factors and therefore are believed to harbor stronger genetic susceptibility than adults.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify susceptibility loci that predispose to GD in patients with young-age-of-onset (YAO) GD.SETTING AND DESIGN: One hundred six patients with YAO GD (onset &lt;30 y) and 855 healthy subjects were studied. Cases and controls were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium Immunochip, designed to genotype 196,524 polymorphisms. Case control association analyses were performed using the PLINK computer package. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis program (QIAGEN) was used to carry out pathway analyses.RESULTS: Immunochip genetic association analysis identified 30 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in several genes that were significantly associated with YAO GD, including major histocompatibility complex class I and class II genes, BTNL2, NOTCH4, TNFAIP3, and CXCR4. Candidate gene analysis revealed that most of the genes previously shown to be associated with adult-onset GD were also associated with YAO GD. Pathway analysis demonstrated that antigen presentation, T-helper cell differentiation, and B cell development were the major pathways contributing to the pathogenesis of YAO GD.CONCLUSIONS: Genetic analysis identified novel susceptibility loci in YAO GD adding a new dimension to the understanding of GD etiology."

The new biomarker and action mechanisms of chronic benzene poisoning are still required to be explored. Aberrant DNA methylation, which may lead to genomic instability and the altered gene expression, is frequently observed in hematological cancers. To gain an insight into the new biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of chronic benzene poisoning, DNA methylation profiles and mRNA expression pattern from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of four chronic benzene poisoning patients and four health controls that matched age and gender without benzene exposure were performed using the high resolution Infinium 450K methylation array and Gene Chip Human Gene 2.0ST Arrays, respectively. By integrating DNA methylation and mRNA expression data, we identified 3 hypermethylated genes showing concurrent down-regulation (PRKG1, PARD3, EPHA8) and 2 hypomethylated genes showing increased expression (STAT3, IFNGR1). Signal net analysis of differential methylation genes associated with chronic benzene poisoning showed that two key hypomethylated STAT3 and hypermethylated GNAI1 were identified. Further GO analysis and pathway analysis indicated that hypomethylated STAT3 played central roles through regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent, positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, JAK-STAT cascade and adipocytokine signaling pathway, Acute myeloid leukemia, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In conclusion, the aberrant hypomethylated STAT3 might be a potential biomarker of chronic benzene poisoning."

Different concentrations of Activin A affect hESC maintenance and differentiation in different ways. A high concentration favors anterior primitive streak and gives rise to DE if the stimulation persists. hESCs were cultured with and without 10 ng/mL Activin A supplement respectively. The two groups of cells were differentiated into endoderm cells with 100 ng/mL Activin A and other reagents. Microarray-based DNA methylation was analyzed with the Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip on these two groups. There was a significant difference in endoderm differentiation efficiency (average efficiency: 71 vs. 58.5%, P &lt; 0.05). hESCs cultured with Activin A supplement had an increased propensity to form definitive endoderm cells in response to Activin A and Wnt signal. Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) between these two groups were found. DMRs were related to the stem cell maintenance and gene regulation by peroxisome proliferators via PPARα, indicating that hESCs maintained with Activin A supplement had stronger &quot;stemness.&quot;"

We used high-throughput SNP molecular marker assays, flow cytometry, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to characterize a population of putative allohexaploids derived from self-pollination of a hybrid from the novel cross (B. napus × B. carinata) × B. juncea to investigate whether fertile, stable allohexaploid Brassica can be produced. Allelic segregation in the A and C genomes generally followed Mendelian expectations for an F2 population, with minimal nonhomologous chromosome pairing. However, we detected no strong selection for complete 2n = AABBCC chromosome complements, with weak correlations between DNA content and fertility (r(2) = 0.11) and no correlation between missing chromosomes or chromosome segments and fertility. Investigation of next-generation progeny resulting from one highly fertile F2 plant using FISH revealed general maintenance of high chromosome numbers but severe distortions in karyotype, as evidenced by recombinant chromosomes and putative loss/duplication of A- and C-genome chromosome pairs. Our results show promise for the development of meiotically stable allohexaploid lines, but highlight the necessity of selection for 2n = AABBCC karyotypes."

In neoplastic cells, aberrant hypermethylation is well described as a mechanism of allele inactivation of particular genes with a tumor suppressor function. To investigate the role of aberrant hypermethylation in the biology and progression of urothelial cancer, we examined 101 urothelial (transitional cell) carcinomas (UC), broadly representative of the disease at presentation, with no prior immunotherapy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, by Infinium HM27 containing 14,495 genes. The genome-wide signature of aberrant promoter hypermethylation in UC consisted of 729 genes significant by a Wilcoxon test, hypermethylated in a CpG island within 1 kb of the transcriptional start site and unmethylated in normal urothelium from aged individuals. We examined differences in gene methylation between the two main groups of UC: the 75% that are superficial, which often recur but rarely progress, and the 25% with muscle invasion and poor prognosis. We further examined pairwise comparisons of the pathologic subgroups of high or low grade, invasive or non-invasive (pTa), and high grade superficial or low grade superficial UC. Pathways analysis indicated over-representation of genes involved in cell adhesion or metabolism in muscle-invasive UC. Notably, the TET2 epigenetic regulator was one of only two genes more frequently methylated in superficial tumors and the sole gene in low grade UC. Other chromatin remodeling genes, MLL3 and ACTL6B, also showed aberrant hypermethylation. The Infinium methylation value for representative genes was verified by pyrosequencing. An available mRNA expression data set indicated many of the hypermethylated genes of interest to be downregulated in UC. Unsupervised clustering of the most differentially methylated genes distinguished muscle invasive from superficial UC. After filtering, cluster analysis showed a CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP)-like pattern of widespread methylation in 11 (11%) tumors. Nine of these 11 tumors had hypermethylation of TET2. Our analysis provides a basis for further studies of hypermethylation in the development and progression of UC."

CpG islands in NPHP4, IQSEC1 and TCF3 were hypermethylated to a larger extent in subjects with stable kidney function (P-values of 7.8E-05 to 9.5E-05). These genes are involved in pathways known to promote the epithelial to mesenchymal transition and renal fibrosis. Other CKD-related genes that were differentially methylated are NOS3, NFKBIL2, CLU, NFKBIB, TGFB3 and TGFBI, which are involved in oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways (P-values of 4.5E-03 to 0.046).

Our objective was to identify metabolic pathways potentially associated with development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) through an analysis of overrepresented pathways from differentially methylated genes between severely obese men with (MetS+) and without (MetS-) the MetS. Genome-wide quantitative DNA methylation analysis in VAT of severely obese men was carried out using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Differences in methylation levels between MetS+ (n = 7) and MetS- (n = 7) groups were tested. Overrepresented pathways from the list of differentially methylated genes were identified and visualized with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis system. Differential methylation analysis between MetS+ and MetS- groups identified 8,578 methylation probes (3,258 annotated genes) with significant differences in methylation levels (false discovery rate-corrected DiffScore ≥ |13| ∼ P ≤ 0.05). Pathway analysis from differentially methylated genes identified 41 overrepresented (P ≤ 0.05) pathways. The most overrepresented pathways were related to structural components of the cell membrane, inflammation and immunity and cell cycle regulation.

However, there is an incomplete understanding of the interrelationship between these factors and the extent to which they interact to impact disease risk. In the present study, we aimed to gain insight into this relationship by identifying DNA methylation marks that are candidate mediators of ovarian cancer genetic risk.METHODS: We used 214 cases and 214 age-matched controls from the Mayo Clinic Ovarian Cancer Study. Pretreatment, blood-derived DNA was profiled for genome-wide methylation (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, Illumina Infinium HD Human610-Quad BeadArray). The Causal Inference Test (CIT) was implemented to distinguish CpG sites that mediate genetic risk, from those that are consequential or independently acted on by genotype.RESULTS: Controlling for the estimated distribution of immune cells and other key covariates, our initial epigenome-wide association analysis revealed 1,993 significantly differentially methylated CpGs that between cases and controls (FDR, q &lt; 0.05). The relationship between methylation and case-control status for these 1,993 CpGs was found to be highly consistent with the results of previously published, independent study that consisted of peripheral blood DNA methylation signatures in 131 pretreatment cases and 274 controls. Implementation of the CIT test revealed 17 CpG/SNP pairs, comprising 13 unique CpGs and 17 unique SNPs, which represent potential methylation-mediated relationships between genotype and EOC risk. Of these 13 CpGs, several are associated with immune related genes and genes that have been previously shown to exhibit altered expression in the context of cancer.CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide additional insight into EOC etiology and may serve as novel biomarkers for EOC susceptibility."

Confined placental trisomy 16 mosaicism (CPM16) is a genetic abnormality of the placenta that is highly predisposing to preeclampsia. We previously demonstrated widespread alterations in DNA methylation in 3rd trimester placentae associated with chromosomally normal early-onset preeclampsia (EOPET) and questioned whether similar changes would be associated with CPM16, making this condition a potential model for studying EOPET-associated changes early in pregnancy.METHODS: Using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, 3rd trimester CPM16 placental samples (N = 10) were compared to gestational age matched controls, and to 1st trimester trisomy 16 placentae (N = 5).RESULTS: DNA methylation differences associated with CPM16 were identified at 2254 CpGs using stringent criteria (FDR &lt; 0.01, Δβ &gt; 0.15). A subset of these differences (11%; p &lt; 0.0001) overlapped those observed in chromosomally normal EOPET using similarly stringent criteria (FDR &lt; 0.01; Δβ &gt; 0.125). Importantly, the majority of EOPET-associated CpGs were significantly altered (p &lt; 0.05) in CPM16 with a similar Δβ distribution. This was true for CPM16 with (N = 5) and without (N = 5) EOPET, although EOPET cases showed a tendency towards larger changes. Of the shared CPM16/EOPET associated changes, three CpGs near two genes (ARGHEF37 and JUNB) were also altered in 1st trimester trisomy 16 placentae.DISCUSSION: Despite the limited sample size, widespread DNA methylation changes are observed in Trisomy 16 that overlap those seen previously in chromosomally normal EOPET. Hence, Trisomy 16 may provide a model to study the progression of placental changes that occurs in EOPET across different gestational ages."

Epigenetic drugs, such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, are finding their way into clinical practice, although their exact mechanisms of action are unclear. To identify mechanisms associated with HDAC inhibition, we performed microarray analysis on brain and muscle samples treated with the HDAC1/3-targeting inhibitor, HDACi 4b. Pathways analyses of microarray datasets implicate DNA methylation as significantly associated with HDAC inhibition. Further assessment of DNA methylation changes elicited by HDACi 4b in human fibroblasts from normal controls and patients with Huntington's disease (HD) using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip revealed a limited, but overlapping, subset of methylated CpG sites that were altered by HDAC inhibition in both normal and HD cells. Among the altered loci of Y chromosome-linked genes, KDM5D, which encodes Lys (K)-specific demethylase 5D, showed increased methylation at several CpG sites in both normal and HD cells, as well as in DNA isolated from sperm from drug-treated male mice. Further, we demonstrate that first filial generation (F1) offspring from drug-treated male HD transgenic mice show significantly improved HD disease phenotypes compared with F1 offspring from vehicle-treated male HD transgenic mice, in association with increased Kdm5d expression, and decreased histone H3 Lys4 (K4) (H3K4) methylation in the CNS of male offspring. Additionally, we show that overexpression of Kdm5d in mutant HD striatal cells significantly improves metabolic deficits. These findings indicate that HDAC inhibitors can elicit transgenerational effects, via cross-talk between different epigenetic mechanisms, to have an impact on disease phenotypes in a beneficial manner."

Vestibular schwannomas can present unilaterally and sporadically or bilaterally when the tumor is associated with neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) syndrome. The molecular hallmark of the disease is biallelic inactivation of the NF2 gene. The epigenetic signature of schwannomas remains poorly understood and is mostly limited to DNA methylation of the NF2 gene, whose altered expression due to epigenetic factors in this tumor is controversial. In this study, we tested the genomewide DNA methylation pattern of schwannomas to shed light on this epigenetic alteration in these particular tumors. The methodology used includes Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip microarrays in a series of 36 vestibular schwannomas, 4 nonvestibular schwannomas, and 5 healthy nerves. Our results show a trend toward hypomethylation in schwannomas. Furthermore, homeobox (HOX) genes, located at four clusters in the genome, displayed hypomethylation in several CpG sites in the vestibular schwannomas but not in the nonvestibular schwannomas. Several microRNA (miRNA) and protein-coding genes were also found to be hypomethylated at promoter regions and were confirmed as upregulated by expression analysis; including miRNA-21, Met Proto-Oncogene (MET), and PMEPA1. We also detected methylation patterns that might be involved in alternative transcripts of several genes such as NRXN1 or MBP, which would increase the complexity of the methylation and expression patterns. Overall, our results show specific epigenetic signatures in several coding genes and miRNAs that could potentially be used as therapeutic targets."

Here, we examine whether methylation patterns in leukocytes differ in individuals who lost sufficient weight to go from OB to normal weight (NW; successful weight loss maintainers; SWLMs) vs currently OB or NW individuals. This study examined peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) methylation patterns in NW (n=16, current/lifetime BMI 18.5-24.9) and OB individuals (n=16, current body mass index (BMI)⩾30), and SWLM (n=16, current BMI 18.5-24.9, lifetime maximum BMI ⩾30, average weight loss 57.4 lbs) using an Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadArray. No leukocyte population-adjusted epigenome-wide analyses were significant; however, potentially differentially methylated loci across the groups were observed in ryanodine receptor-1 (RYR1; P=1.54E-6), myelin protein zero-like 3 (MPZL3; P=4.70E-6) and alpha 3c tubulin (TUBA3C; P=4.78E-6). In 32 obesity-related candidate genes, differential methylation patterns were found in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; gene-wide P=0.00018). In RYR1, TUBA3C and BDNF, SWLM differed from OB but not NW. In this preliminary investigation, leukocyte SWLM DNA methylation patterns more closely resembled NW than OB individuals in three gene regions.

With methylation data, measured by the Infinium Human Methylation 450 array, from 993 participants (age ranging from 18 to 87 years) in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study, and from Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium, combined with published methylation datasets, we described the methylation pattern of 13 CpG sites within APOE locus, their correlations with gene expression across cell types, and their relationships with age, plasma lipids, and sequence variants. Based on methylation levels and the genetic regions, we categorized the 13 APOE CpG sites into three groups: Group 1 showed hypermethylation (&gt; 50%) and were located in the promoter region, Group 2 exhibited hypomethylation (&lt; 50%) and were located in the first two exons and introns, and Group 3 showed hypermethylation (&gt; 50%) and were located in the exon 4. APOE methylation was negatively correlated with gene expression (minimum r = -0.66, P = 0.004). APOE methylation was significantly associated with age (minimum P = 2.06E-08) and plasma total cholesterol (minimum P = 3.53E-03). Finally, APOE methylation patterns differed across APOE ε variants (minimum P = 3.51E-05) and the promoter variant rs405509 (minimum P = 0.01), which further showed a significant interaction with age (P = 0.03). These findings suggest that methylation may be a potential mechanistic explanation for APOE functions related to aging and call for further molecular mechanistic studies."

Until recently, these methods were only valid for DNA from flash frozen (FF) tissues. Novel techniques for repairing DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues have emerged; however, a direct comparison of FFPE DNA repair methods before analysis on genome-wide methylation array to matched FF tissues has not been conducted.METHODS: We conducted a systematic performance comparison of two DNA repair methods (REPLI-g Ligase vs. Infinium HD Restore Kit) on FFPE-DNA compared with matched FF tissues on the Infinium 450K array. A threshold of discordant methylation between FF-FFPE pairs was set at Δβ &gt; 0.3. The correlations of β-values from FF-FFPE pairs were compared across methods and experimental conditions.RESULTS: The Illumina Restore kit outperformed the REPLI-g ligation method with respect to reproducibility of replicates (R(2) &gt; 0.970), highly correlated β-values between FF-FFPE (R(2) &gt; 0.888), and fewest discordant loci between FF-FFPE (≤0.61%). The performance of the Restore kit was validated in an independent set of 121 FFPE tissues.CONCLUSIONS: The Restore kit outperformed RELPI-g ligation in restoring FFPE-derived DNA before analysis on the Infinium 450K methylation array. Our findings provide critical guidance that may significantly enhance the breadth of diseases that can be studied by methylomic profiling.IMPACT: Epigenomic studies using FFPE tissues should now be considered among cancers that have not been fully characterized from an epigenomic standpoint. These findings promote novel epigenome-wide studies focused on cancer etiology, identification of novel biomarkers, and developing targeted therapies.

In order to map loci controlling variation in tomato marketable and nutritional fruit traits, we used a collection of 96 cultivated genotypes, including Italian, Latin American, and other worldwide-spread landraces and varieties. Phenotyping was carried out by measuring ten quality traits and metabolites in red ripe fruits. In parallel, genotyping was carried out by using the Illumina Infinium SolCAP array, which allows data to be collected from 7,720 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.RESULTS: The Mixed Linear Model used to detect associations between markers and traits allowed population structure and relatedness to be evidenced within our collection, which have been taken into consideration for association analysis. GWAS identified 20 SNPs that were significantly associated with seven out of ten traits considered. In particular, our analysis revealed two markers associated with phenolic compounds, three with ascorbic acid, β-carotene and trans-lycopene, six with titratable acidity, and only one with pH and fresh weight. Co-localization of a group of associated loci with candidate genes/QTLs previously reported in other studies validated the approach. Moreover, 19 putative genes in linkage disequilibrium with markers were found. These genes might be involved in the biosynthetic pathways of the traits analyzed or might be implied in their transcriptional regulation. Finally, favourable allelic combinations between associated loci were identified that could be pyramided to obtain new improved genotypes.CONCLUSIONS: Our results led to the identification of promising candidate loci controlling fruit quality that, in the future, might be transferred into tomato genotypes by Marker Assisted Selection or genetic engineering, and highlighted that intraspecific variability might be still exploited for enhancing tomato fruit quality."

The availability of markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS) of PHS resistance will serve to enhance breeding selection and advancement of lines for cultivar development. The aim of this study was to identify candidate regions and develop molecular markers for PHS resistance in wheat. This was achieved via high density mapping of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from an Illumina 90 K Infinium Custom Beadchip in a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from a RL4452/'AC Domain' cross and subsequent detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for PHS related traits (falling number [FN], germination index [GI] and sprouting index [SI]). SNP marker sequences flanking QTL were used to locate colinear regions in Brachypodium and rice, and identify genic markers associated with PHS resistance that can be utilized for MAS in wheat.RESULTS: A linkage map spanning 2569.4 cM was constructed with a total of 12,201 SNP, simple sequence repeat (SSR), diversity arrays technology (DArT) and expressed sequence tag (EST) markers. QTL analyses using Multiple Interval Mapping (MIM) identified four QTL for PHS resistance traits on chromosomes 3B, 4A, 7B and 7D. Sequences of SNPs flanking these QTL were subject to a BLASTN search on the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) database (http://wheat-urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Seq-Repository). Best survey sequence hits were subject to a BLASTN search on Gramene (www.gramene.org) against both Brachypodium and rice databases, and candidate genes and regions for PHS resistance were identified. A total of 18 SNP flanking sequences on chromosomes 3B, 4A, 7B and 7D were converted to KASP markers and validated with matching genotype calls of Infinium SNP data.CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified candidate genes involved in abscissic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) metabolism, and flowering time in four genomic regions of Brachypodium and rice respectively, in addition to 18 KASP markers for PHS resistance in wheat. These markers can be deployed in future genetic studies of PHS resistance and might also be useful in the evaluation of PHS in germplasm and breeding material."

Profiling DNA methylation across the genome is critical to understanding the influence of epigenetics in normal biology and disease, such as cancer. Genome-wide analyses such as arrays and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been used to assess large fractions of the methylome at a single-base-pair resolution. However, the range of DNA methylation profiling techniques can make selecting the appropriate protocol a challenge. This chapter discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various methylome detection approaches to assess which is appropriate for the question at hand. Here, we focus on four prominent genome-wide approaches: whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS); methyl-binding domain capture sequencing (MBDCap-Seq); reduced-representation-bisulfite-sequencing (RRBS); and Infinium Methylation450 BeadChips (450 K, Illumina). We discuss some of the requirements, merits, and challenges that should be considered when choosing a methylome technology to ensure that it will be informative. In addition, we show how genome-wide methylation detection arrays and high-throughput sequencing have provided immense insight into ovarian cancer-specific methylation signatures that may serve as diagnostic biomarkers or predict patient response to epigenetic therapy."

We aimed to test the association between breast cancer risk and epigenome-wide methylation in DNA from peripheral blood. Nested case-control study within the prospective Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. DNA was extracted from before-diagnosis blood samples (420 incident cases and matched controls). Methylation was measured with the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip array. Odds ratio (OR) for epigenome-wide methylation, quantified as the mean beta values across the CpGs, in relation to breast cancer risk were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Overall, the OR for breast cancer was 0.42 (95% CI 0.20-0.90) for the top versus bottom quartile of epigenome-wide DNA methylation and the OR for a one standard deviation increment was 0.69 (95% CI 0.50-0.95; test for linear trend, p = 0.02). Epigenome-wide DNA methylation of CpGs within functional promoters was associated with an increased risk, whereas epigenome-wide DNA methylation of genomic regions outside promoters was associated with decreased risk (test for heterogeneity, p = 0.0002). The increased risk associated with epigenome-wide DNA methylation in functional promoters did not vary by time between blood collection and diagnosis, whereas the inverse association with epigenome-wide DNA methylation outside functional promoters was strongest when the interval from blood collection to diagnosis was less than 5 years and weakest for the longest interval. Epigenome-wide methylation in DNA extracted from peripheral blood collected before diagnosis may have potential utility as markers of breast cancer risk and for early detection."

Microarray profiling of microRNA expression was performed to define a microRNA signature in a series of mycosis fungoides tumor stage (MFt, n=21) and CD30+ primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (CD30+ cALCL, n=11) samples in comparison with inflammatory dermatoses (ID, n=5). Supervised clustering confirmed a distinctive microRNA profile for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) with respect to ID. A 40 microRNA signature was found in MFt including upregulated onco-microRNAs (miR-146a, miR-142-3p/5p, miR-21, miR-181a/b, and miR-155) and downregulated tumor-suppressor microRNAs (miR-200ab/429 cluster, miR-10b, miR-193b, miR-141/200c, and miR-23b/27b). Regarding CD30+ cALCL, 39 differentially expressed microRNAs were identified. Particularly, overexpression of miR-155, miR-21, or miR-142-3p/5p and downregulation of the miR-141/200c clusters were observed. DNA methylation in microRNA gene promoters, as expression regulatory mechanism for deregulated microRNAs, was analyzed using Infinium 450K array and approximately one-third of the differentially expressed microRNAs showed significant DNA methylation differences. Two different microRNA methylation signatures for MFt and CD30+ cALCL were found. Correlation analysis showed an inverse relationship for microRNA promoter methylation and microRNA expression. These results reveal a subgroup-specific epigenetically regulated microRNA signatures for MFt and CD30+ cALCL patients."

Thus, the female X chromosomes provide a unique opportunity to study euchromatin and heterochromatin of allelic regions within the same nuclear environment. We examined the interplay of DNA methylation (DNAm) with CpG density, transcriptional activity and chromatin state at genes on the X chromosome using over 1800 female samples analysed with the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip. DNAm was used to predict an inactivation status for 63 novel transcription start sites (TSSs) across 27 tissues. There was high concordance of inactivation status across tissues, with 62% of TSSs subject to XCI in all 27 tissues examined, whereas 9% escaped from XCI in all tissues, and the remainder showed variable escape from XCI between females in subsets of tissues. Inter-female and twin data supported a model of predominately cis-acting influences on inactivation status. The level of expression from the inactive X relative to the active X correlated with the amount of female promoter DNAm to a threshold of ∼30%, beyond which genes were consistently subject to inactivation. The inactive X showed lower DNAm than the active X at intragenic and intergenic regions for genes subject to XCI, but not at genes that escape from inactivation. Our categorization of genes that escape from X inactivation provides candidates for sex-specific differences in disease."

Significant genotypic variations in response to B deficiency have been observed among B. napus cultivars. To reveal the genetic basis for B efficiency in B. napus, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the plant growth traits, B uptake traits and the B efficiency coefficient (BEC) were analyzed using a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from a cross between a B-efficient parent, Qingyou 10, and a B-inefficient parent, Westar 10. A high-density genetic map was constructed based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) assayed using Brassica 60 K Infinium BeadChip Array, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). The linkage map covered a total length of 2139.5 cM, with 19 linkage groups (LGs) and an average distance of 1.6 cM between adjacent markers. Based on hydroponic evaluation of six B efficiency traits measured in three separate repeated trials, a total of 52 QTLs were identified, accounting for 6.14-46.27% of the phenotypic variation. A major QTL for BEC, qBEC-A3a, was co-located on A3 with other QTLs for plant growth and B uptake traits under low B stress. Using a subset of substitution lines, qBEC-A3a was validated and narrowed down to the interval between CNU384 and BnGMS436. The results of this study provide a novel major locus located on A3 for B efficiency in B. napus that will be suitable for fine mapping and marker-assisted selection breeding for B efficiency in B. napus."

Oncogenic activation of the ErbB pathway by mutations and focal amplifications have emerged recently as an important predictive marker of the prognosis of CRC patients. However, in contrast to genetic events, little is known about epigenetic alternations of ErbB-associated genes and their impact on gene expression. Genome-wide methylation in sporadic CRCs (n = 12) paired with adjacent normal tissues have been previously analysed by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 (HM27) at 27,578 CpG sites. For confirmation of our initial genome-wide analysis, we used a published HM27 dataset (GSE25062). Subsequently, CpG island methylation of selected ErbB pathway-associated genes was assessed on 233 CRC samples using methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) and analysed along with various genetic factors associated with CRC [epigenotype, BRAF and KRAS mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI)]. Methylation and expression integration was performed using published datasets including 25 pairs of CRC and normal colon tissues (GSE25062 and GSE25070), and confirmed with real-time PCR. Our previous microarray-based genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 12 CRCs revealed that four ErbB-associated genes (PIK3CD, PKCΒ, ERBB4, ) were differentially methylated in CRCs. This was further confirmed by statistical re-analysis of an HM27 dataset (GSE25062). Frequent methylation at these loci in tumours was subsequently confirmed by MS-PCR (63%, 43%, 43% and 92%, respectively). Hypermethylation of PKCΒ associated with KRAS mutation (p = 0.04), whereas hypermethylation of ERBB4 associated with high-methylation epigenotypes (HME), BRAF mutation and MSI (p = 0.001, 0.002 and 0.0002, respectively). One of the four analysed genes (PKCΒ) was significantly downregulated in CRC tissue, as revealed by real-time PCR and re-analysis of the GSE25062 and GSE25070 datasets. After careful re-analysis of published methylation and expression data, we conclude that methylation of ERBB4, PAK7 and PIK3CD has no functional role in CRC carcinogenesis. In contrast, methylation seems to have a potential impact on the biology of colorectal tumours by negatively modulating the expression of PKCΒ. Importantly, the relationship between DNA methylation of PKCΒ and gene expression may warrant further attention in the context of colon cancer chemoprevention and anti-cancer therapy."

We established a gefitinib‑resistant lung cancer cell line, PC9, which was originally gefitinib‑sensitive, by serial long‑term exposure to gefitinib. RNA and DNA were collected from both gefitinib‑sensitive and ‑resistant PC9 cells, and comprehensive DNA methylation and mRNA expression analyses were performed using Infinium HumanMethylation27 Bead Arrays and Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K Array, respectively. DNA methylation was increased in 640 genes in gefitinib‑resistant cells compared to parental cells. Among them, we selected 29 candidate genes that presented a decrease in mRNA expression in resistant PC9. We further studied four of the selected genes (C10orf116, IGFBP3, KL, and S100P) and found that KL or S100P silencing by siRNA induced a decrease in gefitinib sensitivity compared to that in the negative control in PC9. In conclusion, KL and S100P could be potential targets to overcome resistance to EGFR‑TKIs."

For each study, the DNA of 46 obese men and 46 lean men were assayed using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. In the first study (Sample One), samples from obese and lean subjects were examined on separate chips. In the second study (Sample Two), the samples were balanced on the chips by lean/obese status, age group, and census region. We used methylumi, watermelon, and limma R packages, as well as ComBat, to analyze the data. Principal component analysis and linear regression were, respectively, employed to identify the top principal components and to test for their association with the batches and lean/obese status. To identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between obese and lean males at each locus, we used a moderated t-test.RESULTS: Chip effects were effectively removed from Sample Two but not Sample One. In addition, dramatic differences were observed between the two sets of DMP results. After &quot;removing&quot; batch effects with ComBat, Sample One had 94,191 probes differentially methylated at a q-value threshold of 0.05 while Sample Two had zero differentially methylated probes. The disparate results from Sample One and Sample Two likely arise due to the confounding of lean/obese status with chip and row batch effects.CONCLUSION: Even the best possible statistical adjustments for batch effects may not completely remove them. Proper study design is vital for guarding against spurious findings due to such effects."

Since 1996, over 3000 DNA samples from Utah suicide decedents have been collected and banked for research use through the Utah Medical Examiner. In addition, over 12,000 Utah suicides were identified through examination of death certificates back to 1904. By linking this data with the Utah Population Database, we have identified multiple extended pedigrees with increased risk for suicide completion. A number of medical conditions co-occur with suicide, including asthma, and this study was undertaken to identify genetic risk common to asthma and suicide. This study tests the hypothesis that a particular comorbid condition may identify a more homogeneous genetic subgroup, facilitating the identification of specific genetic risk factors in that group. From pedigrees at increased risk for suicide, we identified three pedigrees also at significantly increased familial risk for asthma. Five suicide decedents from each of these pedigrees, plus an additional three decedents not from these pedigrees with diagnosed asthma, and 10 decedents with close relatives with asthma were genotyped. Results were compared with 183 publicly available unaffected control exomes from 1000 Genomes and CEPH (Centre d'etude du polymorphisme humain) samples genotyped on the same platform. A further 432 suicide decedents were also genotyped as non-asthma suicide controls. Genotyping was done using the Infinium HumanExome BeadChip. For analysis, we used the pedigree extension of Variant Annotation, Analysis and Search Tool (pVAAST) to calculate the disease burden of each gene. The Phenotype Driven Variant Ontological Re-ranking tool (Phevor) then re-ranked our pVAAST results in context of the phenotype. Using asthma as a seed phenotype, Phevor traversed biomedical ontologies and identified genes with similar biological properties to those known to result in asthma. Our top associated genes included those related to neurodevelopment or neural signaling (brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (SMPD2), homeobox b2 (HOXB2), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM2), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A0 (HNRNPA0)), inflammation (free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2)) and inflammation with additional evidence of neuronal involvement (oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR1), toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)). Of particular interest, BDNF has been previously implicated in both psychiatric disorders and asthma. Our results demonstrate the utility of combining pedigree and co-occurring phenotypes to identify rare variants associated with suicide risk in conjunction with specific co-occurring conditions."

Patients with a response to dCRT have a better prognosis than those resistant to dCRT while survival benefits for patients with residual tumors are limited. Nevertheless, few molecular markers to predict the response to dCRT are currently available. Here, we aimed to establish a DNA methylation marker to predict the response to dCRT.METHODS: A total of 104 patients were divided into screening (n = 43) and validation (n = 61) sets. A genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Methylation levels were measured by quantitative methylation-specific PCR and normalized by the fraction of cancer cells in a sample.RESULTS: The genome-wide methylation analysis of seven responders and eight non-responders identified 18 genomic regions specifically (un)methylated in the responders. Among these, methylation of the promoter CpG island of ZNF695 was significantly associated with the response to dCRT in the screening set (P = 0.004), and a cutoff value was determined. In the validation set, the association was successfully validated (P = 0.021), and a high specificity (90 %) for the prediction of responders was obtained using the prefixed cutoff value. In addition, a multivariate analysis showed that ZNF695 methylation was an independent predictive factor for the response to dCRT (OR 7.55, 95 % CI 2.12-26.9, P = 0.002).CONCLUSION: ZNF695 methylation was significantly associated with the response to dCRT and is a promising predictive marker for the response to dCRT."

Previous studies have detected associations between sex hormones and asthma, as well as between sex hormones and T helper 2 (Th2) asthma-typical immune responses. Therefore, we hypothesized that exogenous or endogenous sex hormone exposure (represented by oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use and early menarche, respectively) are associated with DNA methylation (DNA-M) of the Th2 transcription factor gene, GATA3, in turn affecting the risk of asthma in girls, possibly in interaction with genetic variants. Blood samples were collected from 245 female participants aged 18 years randomly selected for methylation analysis from the Isle of Wight birth cohort, UK. Information on use of OCPs, age at menarche, and concurrent asthma were assessed by questionnaire. Genome-wide DNA-M was determined using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 beadchip. In a first stage, we tested the interaction between sex hormone exposure and genetic variants on DNA-M of specific cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites. In a second stage, we determined whether these CpG sites interact with genetic variants in GATA3 to explain the risk of asthma.RESULTS: Interactions between OCP use and seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GATA3 were analyzed for 14 CpG sites (stage 1). The interaction between OCP use and SNP rs1269486 was found to be associated with the methylation level of cg17124583 (P = 0.002, false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P = 0.04). DNA-M of this same CpG site was also influenced by the interaction between age at menarche and rs1269486 (P = 0.0017). In stage 2, we found that cg17124583 modified the association of SNP rs422628 with asthma risk at the age of 18 years (P = 0.006, FDR adjusted P = 0.04). Subjects with genotype AG showed an increase in average risk ratio (RR) from 0.31 (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.8) to 11.65 (95% CI: 1.71 to 79.5) when methylation level increased from 0.02 to 0.12, relative to genotype AA.CONCLUSION: A two-stage model consisting of genetic variants in the GATA3 gene, OCP use, age at menarche, and DNA-M may explain how sex hormones in women can increase the asthma prevalence after puberty."

Characterizing the epigenetic effects of drugs is an important step to optimal treatment. We performed comprehensive and gene-specific DNA methylation analyses of quetiapine using human neuroblastoma cells. Human neuroblastoma cells were cultured with quetiapine for 8 days, and DNA methylation analysis was performed using Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. A total of 1173 genes showed altered DNA methylation. Altered DNA methylation predominantly occurred as hypomethylation within the CpG island compared to DNA isolated from non-treated cells. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these genes were related to the cellular process of intracellular protein binding. There was no common effect of quetiapine with three mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine). However, common DNA methylation changes in eight genes, including ADRA1A, which encodes adrenoceptor alpha 1A, were found with quetiapine and lithium treatments.

A total of 473 800 loci, including 391 loci across the 12 core circadian genes, were analyzed to identify methylation markers associated with shift work status using linear regression models adjusted for gender, age, body mass index, race, smoking status and leukocyte cell profile as measured by flow cytometry. Analyses at the level of gene, CpG island and gene region were also conducted. To account for multiple comparisons, we controlled the false discovery rate (FDR ≤0.05). Significant differences between nightshift and dayshift workers were found at 16 135 of 473 800 loci, across 3769 of 20 164 genes, across 7173 of 22 721 CpG islands and across 5508 of 51 843 gene regions. For each significant loci, gene, CpG island or gene region, average methylation was consistently found to be decreased among nightshift workers compared to dayshift workers. Twenty-one loci located in the circadian genes were also found to be significantly hypomethylated among nightshift workers. The largest differences were observed for three loci located in the gene body of PER3. A total of nine significant loci were found in the CSNK1E gene, most of which were located in a CpG island and near the transcription start site of the gene. Methylation changes in these circadian genes may lead to altered expression of these genes which has been associated with cancer in previous studies. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that among the significantly hypomethylated genes, processes related to host defense and immunity were represented. Our results indicate that the health effects of shift work may be mediated by hypomethylation of a wide variety of genes, including those related to circadian rhythms. While these findings need to be followed-up among a considerably expanded group of shift workers, the data generated by this study supports the need for future targeted research into the potential impacts of shift work on specific carcinogenic mechanisms."

However, many SNPs are needed to equal the resolution of a single microsatellite, and reliable large-scale genotyping of SNPs remains a challenge in nonmodel species. Here, we document the creation of a 9K Illumina Infinium BeadChip for polar bears (Ursus maritimus), which will be used to investigate: (i) the fine-scale population structure among Canadian polar bears and (ii) the genomic architecture of phenotypic traits in the Western Hudson Bay subpopulation. To this end, we used restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing from 38 bears across their circumpolar range, as well as blood/fat transcriptome sequencing of 10 individuals from Western Hudson Bay. Six-thousand RAD SNPs and 3000 transcriptomic SNPs were selected for the chip, based primarily on genomic spacing and gene function respectively. Of the 9000 SNPs ordered from Illumina, 8042 were successfully printed, and - after genotyping 1450 polar bears - 5441 of these SNPs were found to be well clustered and polymorphic. Using this array, we show rapid linkage disequilibrium decay among polar bears, we demonstrate that in a subsample of 78 individuals, our SNPs detect known genetic structure more clearly than 24 microsatellites genotyped for the same individuals and that these results are not driven by the SNP ascertainment scheme. Here, we present one of the first large-scale genotyping resources designed for a threatened species."

More data are required especially from the Asian region and to analyse how the epigenome data correlate with the transcriptome. DNA methylation profiling was carried out on 76 fresh frozen primary breast tumour tissues and 25 adjacent non-cancerous breast tissues using the Illumina Infinium(®) HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. Validation of methylation results was performed on 7 genes using either MS-MLPA or MS-qPCR. Gene expression profiling was done on 15 breast tumours and 5 adjacent non-cancerous breast tissues using the Affymetrix GeneChip(®) Human Gene 1.0 ST array. The overlapping genes between DNA methylation and gene expression datasets were further mapped to the KEGG database to identify the molecular pathways that linked these genes together. Supervised hierarchical cluster analysis revealed 1,389 hypermethylated CpG sites and 22 hypomethylated CpG sites in cancer compared to the normal samples. Gene expression microarray analysis using a fold-change of at least 1.5 and a false discovery rate (FDR) at p&gt;0.05 identified 404 upregulated and 463 downregulated genes in cancer samples. Integration of both datasets identified 51 genes with hypermethylation with low expression (negative association) and 13 genes with hypermethylation with high expression (positive association). Most of the overlapping genes belong to the focal adhesion and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction that play important roles in breast carcinogenesis. The present study displayed the value of using multiple datasets in the same set of tissues and how the integrative analysis can create a list of well-focused genes as well as to show the correlation between epigenetic changes and gene expression. These gene signatures can help us understand the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and could be potential targets for therapeutic intervention in the future."

Evidence from past studies suggests that there is a key role for DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. However, all reports have applied technologies that investigate genes in a low throughput. In order to advance in the knowledge of the disease, we analyzed DNA methylation variations associated with gene transcription using a high-throughput assay. Infinium® HumanMethylation450 (Illumina) was performed on gingival samples from 12 periodontitis cases and 11 age-matched healthy individuals. Methylation data of 1,284 immune-related genes and 1,038 cell cycle-related genes from Gene Ontology (GO) and 575 genes from a dataset of stably expressed genes (genes with consistent expression in different physiological states and tissues) were extracted from a microarray dataset and analyzed using bioinformatics tools. DNA methylation variations ranging from -2,000 to +2,000 bp from the transcription start site (TSS) were analyzed, and the results were tested against a differential expression microarray dataset between healthy and periodontitis gingival tissues. Differences were evaluated using tests from the R Statistical Project.RESULTS: The comparison of probes between periodontitis and normal gingival tissues showed that the mean methylation scores and the frequency of methylated probes were significantly lower in genes related to the immune process. In the immune group, these parameters were negatively correlated with gene expression (Mann-Whitney test, p &lt; 2.2e - 16).CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that variations in DNA methylation between healthy and periodontitis cases are higher in genes related to the immune-inflammatory process. Thus, DNA methylation must be modulating chromatin regions and, consequently, modulating the mRNA transcription of immune-inflammatory genes related with periodontitis, impacting the prognosis of disease."

Differentially methylated CpG sites (∼20K) were identified using an F-test in the NOA samples. We identified 20 genes with &gt;30% difference in DNA methylation within the promoter region of men with NOA and fertile controls. Of the aberrantly methylated genes, 10 were hypomethylated and 10 were hypermethylated genes. From the top 10 hypermethylated genes, six genes (MRI1, DCAF12L1, TMEM95, CECR2, DDR1, and NPHS2) were selected for validation because they were shown to be expressed in the testis. Of the six genes expressed in the fibroblasts cultured from testis, DDR1 showed an abnormal gene expression pattern. Three patients (19%) out of the 16 men with NOA for whom gene expression data were available had lower DDR1 expression levels (1.8x fold decrease) than the fertile men, whereas four (25%) men had higher expression levels (2x fold increase) of DDR1 compared with the levels in fertile men. Quantitative analysis by bisulfite clonal sequencing showed that one of the CpG sites (cg13329862) of DDR1 promoter was hypermethylated in NOA patients compared with fertile controls (53% vs. 15%). Immunohistochemical analysis suggests presence of DDR1 within cytoplasm of germ cells and peritubular connective tissue (in men with hypospermatogenesis) and decreased expression of the protein in men with Sertoli-cell only syndrome.CONCLUSION(S: Abnormal gene expression of DDR1 is associated with NOA. The functional relevance of aberrant methylation of DDR1 to expression of DDR1 in men with NOA warrants further investigation."

Among the 12 cases, eight were treated with doxycycline as first-line therapy, and they were divided into two groups according to their response to the treatment (four doxy-responders and four doxy-nonresponders). The differences in the DNA methylation states of 27,578 methylation sites in 14,000 genes were evaluated using Illumina bead assay technology. We also validated the top-ranking differentially methylated genes (DMGs) with bisulfite direct sequencing or pyrosequencing.RESULTS: The Infinium methylation chip assay revealed 180 DMGs in the Cp-positive group (74 hypermethylated genes and 106 hypomethylated genes) compared to the Cp-negative group. Among the 180 DMGs, DUSP22, which had two significantly hypomethylated loci, was validated, and the correlation was significant for one CpG site (Spearman coefficient=0.6478, p=0.0262). Regarding the response to doxycycline treatment, a total of 778 DMGs were revealed (389 hypermethylated genes and 336 hypomethylated genes in the doxy-responder group). In a subsequent replication study for representative hypomethylated (IRAK1) and hypermethylated (CXCL6) genes, the correlation between the bead chip analysis and pyrosequencing was significant (Spearman coefficient=0.8961 and 0.7619, respectively, p&lt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Ocular adnexal EMZL showed distinct methylation patterns according to Cp infection and the response to doxycycline treatment in this genome-wide methylation study. Among the candidate genes, DUSP22 has a methylation status that was likely attributable to Cp infection. Our data also suggest that the methylation statuses of IRAK1 and CXCL6 may reflect the response to doxycycline treatment."

With this pipeline we evaluated the prevalence of CNAs in peripheral blood leukocyte samples from healthy Argentinean Andean women with varying exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water. Arsenic exposure was assessed based on the sum concentrations of metabolites of inorganic arsenic in urine (U-As), which ranged from 10-663 μg L(-1) with a median of 185 μg L(-1). We used linear regression analysis to elucidate the association between U-As and the prevalence of CNAs. We found that increasing arsenic exposure was positively associated with the frequency of CNAs (p = 0.002), possibly in a dose-response relationship. Adjustment of the regression model for age and BMI of the subjects did not significantly change the effect estimate, although both covariates were significant predictors. Our results suggest that exposure to arsenic increases genomic instability in the form of CNAs."

Genetic heterogeneity between pGBM and sGBM has been documented as have differences in the methylation of individual genes. A hypermethylator phenotype in grade IV GBMs is now well documented however there has been little comparison between global methylation profiles of pGBM and sGBM samples or of methylation profiles between paired early and late sGBM samples.METHODS: We performed genome-wide methylation profiling of 20 matched pairs of early and late gliomas using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips to assess methylation at &gt;485,000 cytosine positions within the human genome.RESULTS: Clustering of our data demonstrated a frequent hypermethylator phenotype that associated with IDH1 mutation in sGBM tumors. In 80% of cases, the hypermethylator status was retained in both the early and late tumor of the same patient, indicating limited alterations to genome-wide methylation during progression and that the CIMP phenotype is an early event. Analysis of hypermethylated loci identified 218 genes frequently methylated across grade II, III and IV tumors indicating a possible role in sGBM tumorigenesis. Comparison of our sGBM data with TCGA pGBM data indicate that IDH1 mutated GBM samples have very similar hypermethylator phenotypes, however the methylation profiles of the majority of samples with WT IDH1 that do not demonstrate a hypermethylator phenotype cluster separately from sGBM samples, indicating underlying differences in methylation profiles. We also identified 180 genes that were methylated only in sGBM. Further analysis of these genes may lead to a better understanding of the pathology of sGBM vs pGBM.CONCLUSION: This is the first study to have documented genome-wide methylation changes within paired early/late astrocytic gliomas on such a large CpG probe set, revealing a number of genes that maybe relevant to secondary gliomagenesis."

However, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) have yet to be fully ascertained. In the present study, we performed genome-wide comparative methylome analysis between maternal PBL and placental DNA from pregnancies of first trimester by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) and Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assays. A total of 36 931 DMRs and 45 804 differentially methylated sites (DMSs) covering the whole genome, exclusive of the Y chromosome, were identified via MeDIP-Seq and Infinium 450k array, respectively, of which 3759 sites in 2188 regions were confirmed by both methods. Not only did we find the previously reported potential fetal DNA markers in our identified DMRs/DMSs but also we verified fully the identified DMRs/DMSs in the validation round by MassARRAY EpiTYPER. The screened potential fetal DNA markers may be used for NIPT on aneuploidies and other chromosomal diseases, such as cri du chat syndrome and velo-cardio-facial syndrome. In addition, these potential markers may have application in the early diagnosis of placental dysfunction, such as pre-eclampsia."
"24943962";"Infinium";"Infinium";"BMC Bioinformatics";0;2014;"Non-specific filtering of beta-distributed data.";"BACKGROUND: Non-specific feature selection is a dimension reduction procedure performed prior to cluster analysis of high dimensional molecular data. Not all measured features are expected to show biological variation, so only the most varying are selected for analysis. In DNA methylation studies, DNA methylation is measured as a proportion, bounded between 0 and 1, with variance a function of the mean. Filtering on standard deviation biases the selection of probes to those with mean values near 0.5. We explore the effect this has on clustering, and develop alternate filter methods that utilize a variance stabilizing transformation for Beta distributed data and do not share this bias.RESULTS: We compared results for 11 different non-specific filters on eight Infinium HumanMethylation data sets, selected to span a variety of biological conditions. We found that for data sets having a small fraction of samples showing abnormal methylation of a subset of normally unmethylated CpGs, a characteristic of the CpG island methylator phenotype in cancer, a novel filter statistic that utilized a variance-stabilizing transformation for Beta distributed data outperformed the common filter of using standard deviation of the DNA methylation proportion, or its log-transformed M-value, in its ability to detect the cancer subtype in a cluster analysis. However, the standard deviation filter always performed among the best for distinguishing subgroups of normal tissue. The novel filter and standard deviation filter tended to favour features in different genome contexts; for the same data set, the novel filter always selected more features from CpG island promoters and the standard deviation filter always selected more features from non-CpG island intergenic regions. Interestingly, despite selecting largely non-overlapping sets of features, the two filters did find sample subsets that overlapped for some real data sets.CONCLUSIONS: We found two different filter statistics that tended to prioritize features with different characteristics, each performed well for identifying clusters of cancer and non-cancer tissue, and identifying a cancer CpG island hypermethylation phenotype. Since cluster analysis is for discovery, we would suggest trying both filters on any new data sets, evaluating the overlap of features selected and clusters discovered."

Colonic mucosal epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, can occur in response to the environment and have been implicated in IBD pathology. However, mucosal DNA methylation has not been examined in treatment-naïve patients. We studied DNA methylation in untreated, left sided colonic biopsy specimens using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. We analyzed 22 control (C) patients, 15 untreated Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and 9 untreated ulcerative colitis (UC) patients from two cohorts. Samples obtained at the time of clinical remission from two of the treatment-naïve UC patients were also included into the analysis. UC-specific gene expression was interrogated in a subset of adjacent samples (5 C and 5 UC) using the Affymetrix GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Arrays. Only treatment-naïve UC separated from control. One-hundred-and-twenty genes with significant expression change in UC (&gt; 2-fold, P&lt;0.05) were associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Epigenetically associated gene expression changes (including gene expression changes in the IFITM1, ITGB2, S100A9, SLPI, SAA1, and STAT3 genes) were linked to colonic mucosal immune and defense responses. These findings underscore the relationship between epigenetic changes and inflammation in pediatric treatment-naïve UC and may have potential etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic relevance for IBD."

Specifically, highly predictive mechanisms for early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) are desired, so previous studies have compared DNAm between EOC cases and controls. However, case-control studies are confounded by the distribution of white blood cell types through an immune response induced by the cancer. Rather than determining the distribution of the cell types manually or investigating isolated cell types, an alternative approach involves the use of complete blood count (CBC), which is routinely collected. In the analysis of an EOC case-control study of DNAm, we incorporate CBC measures to adjust for this confounding and compare DNAm between 242 EOC cases and 181 age-matched controls (assayed on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 or HumanMethylation450 Beadchips), at both the individual CpG and CpG island levels. We found that adjustment for leukocyte distribution using CBC measurements dramatically reduced confounding, with 62 single CpG sites found to be associated with EOC status after adjustment (P &lt; 5E-8). Additionally, regional DNAm was assessed by applying principal components analysis to CpG islands. The top associated CpG island (P = 7E-6) was located in the promoter/transcription start site of the human basonuclin 2 gene (BNC2), a known susceptibility gene for EOC risk identified through GWAS. Follow-up studies are necessary to establish the role of BNC2 in blood-based DNA and EOC, including prospective studies to validate this region as a potential biomarker and predictor of EOC susceptibility."

Genetic analysis showed that osms55 was controlled by a single recessive gene. Genome-wide SNP analysis using the high-throughput Illumina Infinium iSelect SNP (50 K) microarray technology indicated that the genetic makeup of osms55 is the same as wild type (WT) HHZ. Using a modified MutMap method, we successfully identified a mutation in the LOC_Os02g40450 (MER3) gene that is co-segregated with the male sterility phenotype. The mutation is located at the intron splice-recognition site, leading to a 15 nucleotide deletion in the fifth exon. Different from the published MutMap method that aligns the mutant pool DNA sequence with the assembled WT genome, the method used in this study was to align the re-sequencing data of the mutant pool DNA and WT HHZ with the Nipponbare reference genome. The resulting SNPs of mutant/Nipponbare and WT HHZ/Nipponbare were further compared to determine the candidate mutant gene. This modified method does not need an assembled WT genome as reference and thus is more cost-effective and widely applicable."

Macaca fascicularis (Cynomolgus macaque) is an important disease model; however, its genome sequence is only recently published, and few tools exist to interrogate the molecular state of Cynomolgus macaque tissues. Although the Infinium 450K is a hybridization array designed to the human genome, the relative conservation between the macaque and human genomes makes its use in macaques feasible. Here, we used the Infinium 450K array to assay DNA methylation in 11 macaque muscle biopsies. We showed that probe hybridization efficiency was related to the degree of sequence identity between the human probes and the macaque genome sequence. Approximately 61% of the Human Infinium 450K probes could be reliably mapped to the Cynomolgus macaque genome and contain a CpG site of interest. We also compared the Infinium 450K data to reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data generated on the same samples and found a high level of concordance between the two independent methodologies, which can be further improved by filtering for probe sequence identity and mismatch location. We conclude that the Infinium 450K array can be used to measure the DNA methylome of Cynomolgus macaque tissues using the provided filters. We also provide a pipeline for validation of the array in other species using a simple BLAST-based sequence identify filter."

Three previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found only one locus associated with EC, suggesting that common variants with large effects may not contribute greatly to EC risk. Alternatively, we hypothesize that rare variants may contribute to EC risk. We conducted an exome-wide association study (EXWAS) of EC using the Infinium HumanExome BeadChip in order to identify rare variants associated with EC risk.

In this study, we utilize the Illumina's Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip platform in an epidemiological cohort, targeting to associate interesting methylation patterns with breast cancer predisposition. The computational framework proposed here extends the--established in transcriptomic microarrays--logarithmic ratio of the methylated versus the unmethylated signal intensities, quoted as M-value. Moreover, intensity-based correction of the M-signal distribution is introduced in order to correct for batch effects and probe-specific errors in intensity measurements. This is accomplished through the estimation of intensity-related error measures from quality control samples included in each chip. Moreover, robust statistical measures exploiting the coefficient variation of DNA methylation measurements between control and case samples alleviate the impact of technical variation. The results presented here are juxtaposed to those derived by applying classical preprocessing and statistical selection methodologies. Overall, in comparison to traditional approaches, the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of technical bias correction, along with its generic character, support its suitability for various microarray technologies."

To evaluate the significance of DNA methylation in each histologic subtype, pyrosequencing assay (PA) was performed on 38 EGCs (18 intestinal-, 12 mixed- and 8 diffuse-type) using 12 genes selected from the screening. Between tumors of the intestinal-type (n=6), and diffuse- (n=4) plus mixed-types (n=2), 169 regions showed significant differences (intensity&gt;3,000, Δβ&gt;0.2) in IIMA. Hierarchical clustering using the 169 DMRs revealed distinct separation between the two groups. In PA using 12 selected genes from the IIMA results, the aberrant methylation statuses of DVL2 (p=0.0186) and ETS1 (p=0.0222) were significantly related to diffuse- and mixed-types rather than the intestinal-type, while C19orf35 (p=0.019) and CNRIP1 (p=0.0473) were related to the diffuse‑type rather than intestinal‑type, and GAL3ST2 (p=0.0158) and ITGA3 (p=0.0273) were related to the mixed-type rather than the other two types. The methylation of other genes, CLIP4, XKR6, CCDC57, MAML3 and SDC2, was related with age, tumor location, or Helicobacter infection rather than the histologic subtype. Aberrant DNA methylation of certain genes may be independently involved in each histologic subtype of EGC. Furthermore, mixed-type EGCs may be a distinctive histologic subtype based on the different subset of DMRs compared to those of other subtypes."

Paired biopsies from patients with inoperable breast cancer were collected both before irradiation (n = 20) and after receiving 10-24 Gray (Gy) (n = 19). DNA methylation analysis was performed by using Illumina Infinium 27K arrays. Fourteen genes were selected for technical validation by pyrosequencing. Eighty-two differentially methylated genes were identified in irradiated (n = 11) versus nonirradiated (n = 19) samples (false discovery rate, FDR = 1.1%).

Tumors samples were also analyzed for the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP); KRAS and BRAF mutations and mismatch repair deficiency status. Functional annotation clustering was performed. We identified 102 CpG sites that showed significant DNA hypermethylation in multiple tumors with respect to the solitary counterparts (difference in β value ≥0.1). Methylight assays validated the results for 4 selected genes (p = 0.0002). Eight out of 12(66.6%) multiple tumors were classified as CIMP-high, as compared to 5 out of 29(17.2%) solitary tumors (p = 0.004). Interestingly, 76 out of the 102 (74.5%) hypermethylated CpG sites found in multiple tumors were also seen in CIMP-high tumors. Functional analysis of hypermethylated genes found in multiple tumors showed enrichment of genes involved in different tumorigenic functions. In conclusion, multiple CRC are associated with a distinct methylation phenotype, with a close association between tumor multiplicity and CIMP-high. Our results may be important to unravel the underlying mechanism of tumor multiplicity."

Recent evidence, primarily at a locus-specific level, suggests that alterations to DNA methylation may also be a relevant mechanism through which vitamin D regulates gene expression. Given the intense interest in vitamin D, particularly as an immune modifier, we sought to examine the impact of vitamin D exposure on the immune cell methylome in vitro. We exposed primary human blood mononuclear cells with up to 100nM calcitriol for up to 120h, and measured genome-scale DNA methylation response using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 beadchip array. We observed that, while the expression of known vitamin D responsive genes was clearly altered by calcitriol exposure, substantial genome-scale changes to DNA methylation were not induced. Our data suggests that, over the exposure period measured, changes to DNA methylation may not be a predominant mechanism through which vitamin D impacts gene expression in human immune cells."

Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) disease is a serious viral disease of winter wheat growing areas worldwide. SBWMV infection can significantly reduce grain yield up to 80 %. Developing resistant wheat cultivars is the only feasible strategy to reduce the losses. In this study, wheat Infinium iSelect Beadchips with 9 K wheat SNPs were used to genotype an association mapping population of 205 wheat accessions. Six new SNPs from two genes were identified to be significantly associated with the gene for SBWMV resistance on chromosome 5D. The SNPs and Xgwm469, an SSR marker that has been reported to be associated with the gene, were mapped close to the gene using F6-derived recombinant inbred lines from the cross between a resistant parent 'Heyne' and a susceptible parent 'Trego'. Two representative SNPs, wsnp_CAP11_c209_198467 and wsnp_JD_c4438_5568170, from the two linked genes in wheat were converted into KBioscience Competitive Allele-Specific Polymerase assays and can be easily used in marker-assisted selection to improve wheat resistance to SBWMV in breeding."

The direct role of the local tissue environment on the post-development human epigenome, however, remains unclear due to limitations in studies of human subjects. Here, we use an isogenic human ileal neobladder surgical model and compare global DNA methylation levels of intestinal epithelial cells pre- and post-neobladder construction using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Our study is the first to quantify the effect of environmental cues on the human epigenome and show that the local tissue environment directly modulates DNA methylation patterns in normal differentiated cells in vivo. In the neobladder, the intestinal epithelial cells lose their tissue-specific epigenetic landscape in a time-dependent manner following the tissue's exposure to a bladder environment. We find that de novo methylation of many intestine-specific enhancers occurs at the rate of 0.41% per month (P &lt; 0.01, Pearson = 0.71), while demethylation of primarily non-intestine-specific transcribed regions occurs at the rate of -0.37% per month (P &lt; 0.01, Pearson = -0.57). The dynamic resetting of the DNA methylome in the neobladder not only implicates local environmental cues in the shaping and maintenance of the epigenome but also illustrates an unexpected cross-talk between the epigenome and the cellular environment."

We sought to characterize genetic determinants of bilirubin elevations using a genome-wide approach among patients with genotype 1 HCV who received combination therapy that included GS-9256, a novel potent inhibitor of HCV NS3 serine protease, as part of a Phase IIb trial.METHODS: Of the 200 patients sampled, 176 had confirmed European ancestry and were included in the analysis. Infinium HumanOmni5BeadChip (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for genotyping. A categorical analysis of low (grade 0-1) versus high (grade 2-4) bilirubin toxicity grade and a quantitative trait locus mapping of peak bilirubin concentrations was performed.RESULTS: A total of 4,466,809 genetic markers were analysed. No single variant showed a statistically significant association with observed bilirubin elevations in this patient population. In a targeted analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes known to be involved in bilirubin transport, no significant differences in allele frequency between high and low bilirubin toxicity grade were observed.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that risk for bilirubin elevation in patients receiving GS-9256 is unlikely to be strongly influenced by common genetic variants with large effects. The current study cannot rule out a role for common variants of weak effect, or a more complex model, including multiple contributing factors, such as rare variants and as yet unidentified environmental influences."

Molecular marker technology has developed rapidly over the last decade, with the introduction of new DNA sequencing methods and the development of high-throughput genotyping methods. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) now dominate applications in modern plant genetic analysis. The reducing cost of DNA sequencing and increasing availability of large sequence data sets permit the mining of this data for large numbers of SNPs. These may then be used in applications such as genetic linkage analysis and trait mapping, diversity analysis, association studies, and marker-assisted selection.

In this study, the RICE6K SNP array was used to genotype a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross between the indica variety, Zhenshan 97, and the japonica variety, Xizang 2. A total of 3324 SNP markers of high quality were identified and were grouped into 1495 recombination bins in the RIL population. A high-density linkage map, consisting of the 1495 bins, was developed, covering 1591.2 cM and with average length of 1.1 cM per bin. Segregation distortions were observed in 24 regions of the 11 chromosomes in the RILs. One half of the distorted regions contained fertility genes that had been previously reported. A total of 23 QTLs were identified for yield. Seven QTLs were firstly detected in this study. The positive alleles from about half of the identified QTLs came from Zhenshan 97 and they had lower phenotypic values than Xizang 2. This indicated that favorable alleles for breeding were dispersed in both parents and pyramiding favorable alleles could develop elite lines.

Several platforms have been developed to study genome-wide DNA methylation. Many investigators in the field have chosen the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation microarray for its ability to reliably assess DNA methylation following sodium bisulfite conversion. Here, we analyzed methylation profiles of 489 adult males and 357 adult females generated by the Infinium HumanMethylation450 microarray. Among the autosomal CpG sites that displayed significant methylation differences between the two sexes, we observed a significant enrichment of cross-reactive probes co-hybridizing to the sex chromosomes with more than 94% sequence identity. This could lead investigators to mistakenly infer the existence of significant autosomal sex-associated methylation. Using sequence identity cutoffs derived from the sex methylation analysis, we concluded that 6% of the array probes can potentially generate spurious signals because of co-hybridization to alternate genomic sequences highly homologous to the intended targets. Additionally, we discovered probes targeting polymorphic CpGs that overlapped SNPs. The methylation levels detected by these probes are simply the reflection of underlying genetic polymorphisms but could be misinterpreted as true signals. The existence of probes that are cross-reactive or of target polymorphic CpGs in the Illumina HumanMethylation microarrays can confound data obtained from such microarrays. Therefore, investigators should exercise caution when significant biological associations are found using these array platforms. A list of all cross-reactive probes and polymorphic CpGs identified by us are annotated in this paper."
"23452981";"Infinium";"Infinium";"Epigenetics Chromatin";38;2013;"Additional annotation enhances potential for biologically-relevant analysis of the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array.";"BACKGROUND: Measurement of genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) has become an important avenue for investigating potential physiologically-relevant epigenetic changes. Illumina Infinium (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) is a commercially available microarray suite used to measure DNAm at many sites throughout the genome. However, it has been suggested that a subset of array probes may give misleading results due to issues related to probe design. To facilitate biologically significant data interpretation, we set out to enhance probe annotation of the newest Infinium array, the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450 k), with &gt;485,000 probes covering 99% of Reference Sequence (RefSeq) genes (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Bethesda, MD, USA). Annotation that was added or expanded on includes: 1) documented SNPs in the probe target, 2) probe binding specificity, 3) CpG classification of target sites and 4) gene feature classification of target sites.RESULTS: Probes with documented SNPs at the target CpG (4.3% of probes) were associated with increased within-tissue variation in DNAm. An example of a probe with a SNP at the target CpG demonstrated how sample genotype can confound the measurement of DNAm. Additionally, 8.6% of probes mapped to multiple locations in silico. Measurements from these non-specific probes likely represent a combination of DNAm from multiple genomic sites. The expanded biological annotation demonstrated that based on DNAm, grouping probes by an alternative high-density and intermediate-density CpG island classification provided a distinctive pattern of DNAm. Finally, variable enrichment for differentially methylated probes was noted across CpG classes and gene feature groups, dependant on the tissues that were compared.CONCLUSION: DNAm arrays offer a high-throughput approach for which careful consideration of probe content should be utilized to better understand the biological processes affected. Probes containing SNPs and non-specific probes may affect the assessment of DNAm using the 450 k array. Additionally, probe classification by CpG enrichment classes and to a lesser extent gene feature groups resulted in distinct patterns of DNAm. Thus, we recommend that compromised probes be removed from analyses and that the genomic context of DNAm is considered in studies deciphering the biological meaning of Illumina 450 k array data."
"23631413";"Infinium";"Infinium";"BMC Genomics";37;2013;"A data-driven approach to preprocessing Illumina 450K methylation array data.";"BACKGROUND: As the most stable and experimentally accessible epigenetic mark, DNA methylation is of great interest to the research community. The landscape of DNA methylation across tissues, through development and in disease pathogenesis is not yet well characterized. Thus there is a need for rapid and cost effective methods for assessing genome-wide levels of DNA methylation. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip is a very useful addition to the available methods for DNA methylation analysis but its complex design, incorporating two different assay methods, requires careful consideration. Accordingly, several normalization schemes have been published. We have taken advantage of known DNA methylation patterns associated with genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), in addition to the performance of SNP genotyping assays present on the array, to derive three independent metrics which we use to test alternative schemes of correction and normalization. These metrics also have potential utility as quality scores for datasets.RESULTS: The standard index of DNA methylation at any specific CpG site is β = M/(M + U + 100) where M and U are methylated and unmethylated signal intensities, respectively. Betas (βs) calculated from raw signal intensities (the default GenomeStudio behavior) perform well, but using 11 methylomic datasets we demonstrate that quantile normalization methods produce marked improvement, even in highly consistent data, by all three metrics. The commonly used procedure of normalizing betas is inferior to the separate normalization of M and U, and it is also advantageous to normalize Type I and Type II assays separately. More elaborate manipulation of quantiles proves to be counterproductive.CONCLUSIONS: Careful selection of preprocessing steps can minimize variance and thus improve statistical power, especially for the detection of the small absolute DNA methylation changes likely associated with complex disease phenotypes. For the convenience of the research community we have created a user-friendly R software package called wateRmelon, downloadable from bioConductor, compatible with the existing methylumi, minfi and IMA packages, that allows others to utilize the same normalization methods and data quality tests on 450K data."

In most human tissues, the vast majority of the genome is highly methylated (&gt;70%). Recently, sequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA (MethylC-seq) has revealed large partially methylated domains (PMDs) in some human cell lines. PMDs cover up to 40% of the genome and are associated with gene repression and inactive chromatin marks. However, to date, only cultured cells and cancers have shown evidence for PMDs. Here, we performed MethylC-seq in full-term human placenta and demonstrate it is the first known normal tissue showing clear evidence of PMDs. We found that PMDs cover 37% of the placental genome, are stable throughout gestation and between individuals, and can be observed with lower sensitivity in Illumina 450K Infinium data. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that genes in PMDs are repressed in placenta. Using a hidden Markov model to map placental PMDs genome-wide and compare them to PMDs in other cell lines, we found that genes within placental PMDs have tissue-specific functions. For regulatory regions, methylation levels in promoter CpG islands are actually higher for genes within placental PMDs, despite the lower overall methylation of surrounding regions. Similar to PMDs, polycomb-regulated regions are hypomethylated but smaller and distinct from PMDs, with some being hypermethylated in placenta compared with other tissues. These results suggest that PMDs are a developmentally dynamic feature of the methylome that are relevant for understanding both normal development and cancer and may be of use as epigenetic biomarkers."

We have uncovered a striking divergence between the DNA methylation profiles of SDH-deficient GIST (n = 24) versus KIT tyrosine kinase pathway-mutated GIST (n = 39). Infinium 450K methylation array analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues disclosed an order of magnitude greater genomic hypermethylation relative to SDH-deficient GIST versus the KIT-mutant group (84.9 K vs. 8.4 K targets). Epigenomic divergence was further found among SDH-mutant paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma (n = 29), a developmentally distinct SDH-deficient tumor system. Comparison of SDH-mutant GIST with isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant glioma, another Krebs cycle-defective tumor type, revealed comparable measures of global hypo- and hypermethylation. These data expose a vital connection between succinate metabolism and genomic DNA methylation during tumorigenesis, and generally implicate the mitochondrial Krebs cycle in nuclear epigenomic maintenance."

The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip is widely used to quantify DNA methylation; nevertheless, the design of an appropriate analysis pipeline faces severe challenges due to the convolution of biological and technical variability and the presence of a signal bias between Infinium I and II probe design types. Despite recent attempts to investigate how to analyze DNA methylation data with such an array design, it has not been possible to perform a comprehensive comparison between different bioinformatics pipelines due to the lack of appropriate data sets having both large sample size and sufficient number of technical replicates. Here we perform such a comparative analysis, targeting the problems of reducing the technical variability, eliminating the probe design bias and reducing the batch effect by exploiting two unpublished data sets, which included technical replicates and were profiled for DNA methylation either on peripheral blood, monocytes or muscle biopsies. We evaluated the performance of different analysis pipelines and demonstrated that: (1) it is critical to correct for the probe design type, since the amplitude of the measured methylation change depends on the underlying chemistry; (2) the effect of different normalization schemes is mixed, and the most effective method in our hands were quantile normalization and Beta Mixture Quantile dilation (BMIQ); (3) it is beneficial to correct for batch effects. In conclusion, our comparative analysis using a comprehensive data set suggests an efficient pipeline for proper identification of differentially methylated CpGs using the Illumina 450K arrays."

However, the extent to which this methodology can accurately predict cell-type proportions based on blood-derived DNA methylation data in a large-scale epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) has yet to be examined. We used publicly available data deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number GSE37008), which consisted of both blood-derived epigenome-wide DNA methylation data assayed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray and complete blood cell (CBC) counts among a community cohort of 94 non-diseased individuals. Constrained projection (CP) was used to obtain predictions of the proportions of lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes for each of the study samples based on their DNA methylation signatures. Our findings demonstrated high consistency between the average CBC-derived and predicted percentage of monocytes and lymphocytes (17.9% and 17.6% for monocytes and 82.1% and 81.4% for lymphocytes), with root mean squared error (rMSE) of 5% and 6%, for monocytes and lymphocytes, respectively. Similarly, there was moderate-high correlation between the CP-predicted and CBC-derived percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes (0.60 and 0.61, respectively), and these results were robust to the number of leukocyte differentially methylated regions (L-DMRs) used for CP prediction. These results serve as further validation of the CP approach and highlight the promise of this technique for EWAS where DNA methylation is profiled using whole-blood genomic DNA."

Animal models, in vitro studies, and human cancer data suggest that arsenic may induce epigenetic alterations, specifically by altering patterns of DNA methylation.OBJECTIVES: In this study we aimed to identify differences in DNA methylation in cord blood samples of infants with in utero, low-level arsenic exposure.METHODS: DNA methylation of cord-blood derived DNA from 134 infants involved in a prospective birth cohort in New Hampshire was profiled using the Illumina Infinium Methylation450K array. In utero arsenic exposure was estimated using maternal urine samples collected at 24-28 weeks gestation. We used a novel cell mixture deconvolution methodology for examining the association between inferred white blood cell mixtures in infant cord blood and in utero arsenic exposure; we also examined the association between methylation at individual CpG loci and arsenic exposure levels.RESULTS: We found an association between urinary inorganic arsenic concentration and the estimated proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes (1.18; 95% CI: 0.12, 2.23). Among the top 100 CpG loci with the lowest p-values based on their association with urinary arsenic levels, there was a statistically significant enrichment of these loci in CpG islands (p = 0.009). Of those in CpG islands (n = 44), most (75%) exhibited higher methylation levels in the highest exposed group compared with the lowest exposed group. Also, several CpG loci exhibited a linear dose-dependent relationship between methylation and arsenic exposure.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in utero exposure to low levels of arsenic may affect the epigenome. Long-term follow-up is planned to determine whether the observed changes are associated with health outcomes."

Although heritability estimates for ASD are high, conventional genetic-based efforts to identify genes involved in ASD have yielded only few reproducible candidate genes that account for only a small proportion of ASDs. There is mounting evidence to suggest environmental and epigenetic factors play a stronger role in the etiology of ASD than previously thought. To begin to understand the contribution of epigenetics to ASD, we have examined DNA methylation (DNAm) in a pilot study of postmortem brain tissue from 19 autism cases and 21 unrelated controls, among three brain regions including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex and cerebellum. We measured over 485,000 CpG loci across a diverse set of functionally relevant genomic regions using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and identified four genome-wide significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using a bump hunting approach and a permutation-based multiple testing correction method. We replicated 3/4 DMRs identified in our genome-wide screen in a different set of samples and across different brain regions. The DMRs identified in this study represent suggestive evidence for commonly altered methylation sites in ASD and provide several promising new candidate genes."

The epigenome differs between cell types and has until now only been characterized for a few human tissues. Environmental factors potentially alter the epigenome. Here we describe the genome-wide pattern of DNA methylation in human adipose tissue from 23 healthy men, with a previous low level of physical activity, before and after a six months exercise intervention. We also investigate the differences in adipose tissue DNA methylation between 31 individuals with or without a family history of type 2 diabetes. DNA methylation was analyzed using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, an array containing 485,577 probes covering 99% RefSeq genes. Global DNA methylation changed and 17,975 individual CpG sites in 7,663 unique genes showed altered levels of DNA methylation after the exercise intervention (q&lt;0.05). Differential mRNA expression was present in 1/3 of gene regions with altered DNA methylation, including RALBP1, HDAC4 and NCOR2 (q&lt;0.05). Using a luciferase assay, we could show that increased DNA methylation in vitro of the RALBP1 promoter suppressed the transcriptional activity (p = 0.03). Moreover, 18 obesity and 21 type 2 diabetes candidate genes had CpG sites with differences in adipose tissue DNA methylation in response to exercise (q&lt;0.05), including TCF7L2 (6 CpG sites) and KCNQ1 (10 CpG sites). A simultaneous change in mRNA expression was seen for 6 of those genes. To understand if genes that exhibit differential DNA methylation and mRNA expression in human adipose tissue in vivo affect adipocyte metabolism, we silenced Hdac4 and Ncor2 respectively in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which resulted in increased lipogenesis both in the basal and insulin stimulated state. In conclusion, exercise induces genome-wide changes in DNA methylation in human adipose tissue, potentially affecting adipocyte metabolism."

These reads were mapped to the soybean whole genome sequence and 209,903 SNPs were identified. After applying several filters, a total of 146,161 of the 209,903 SNPs were determined to be ideal candidates for Illumina Infinium II BeadChip design. To equalize the distance between selected SNPs, increase assay success rate, and minimize the number of SNPs with low minor allele frequency, an iteration algorithm based on a selection index was developed and used to select 60,800 SNPs for Infinium BeadChip design. Of the 60,800 SNPs, 50,701 were targeted to euchromatic regions and 10,000 to heterochromatic regions of the 20 soybean chromosomes. In addition, 99 SNPs were targeted to unanchored sequence scaffolds. Of the 60,800 SNPs, a total of 52,041 passed Illumina's manufacturing phase to produce the SoySNP50K iSelect BeadChip. Validation of the SoySNP50K chip with 96 landrace genotypes, 96 elite cultivars and 96 wild soybean accessions showed that 47,337 SNPs were polymorphic and generated successful SNP allele calls. In addition, 40,841 of the 47,337 SNPs (86%) had minor allele frequencies ≥ 10% among the landraces, elite cultivars and the wild soybean accessions. A total of 620 and 42 candidate regions which may be associated with domestication and recent selection were identified, respectively. The SoySNP50K iSelect SNP beadchip will be a powerful tool for characterizing soybean genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium, and for constructing high resolution linkage maps to improve the soybean whole genome sequence assembly."

Clinically, the overexpression of HOTAIR is a powerful predictor of the tumour progression and overall survival in patients with diverse cancers. The relationship between HOTAIR and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), however, remains unclear. We investigated the role of HOTAIR in the pathogenesis of ESCC.METHODS: We used quantitative real-time PCR to determine the level of HOTAIR in ESCC cell lines and 100 ESCC samples from patients; 56 adjacent non-neoplastic tissues were used as controls. We measured the effect of HOTAIR knockdown and overexpression in ESCC cell lines using colony formation assays, anchorage-independent growth assays, the CCK-8 assay, transwell migration and invasion assays, and Annexin V-binding assays. We analysed the growth of ESCC xenograft tumours in nude mice. Changes in the gene expression and methylation levels in ESCC cell lines were analysed using gene expression microarrays and the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip assay, respectively. results: The levels of HOTAIR were increased in ESCC cell lines and patient samples compared with the controls; the expression levels correlated with the disease stage and survival time. The knockdown of HOTAIR in the KYSE510 and KYSE180 ESCC cell lines using small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) reduced the ability of the cells to form foci, migrate, and invade the extracellular matrix in culture, altered cell cycle progression, and increased the sensitivity of the cells to apoptosis. The HOTAIR knockdown reduced cancer cell metastasis in vivo, and the tumours formed by HOTAIR-silenced ESCC cells were smaller, both in size and weight, than the tumours and metastases formed by the shRNA vector control cells in a mouse xenograft model. The results of the gene microarray study showed that HOTAIR reprogrammed the gene expression profile of ESCC cells, and the gene ontology analysis revealed an enrichment in genes that are important for tumorigenesis, such as genes involved in cell migration and the regulation of the cell cycle. Comparing the gene expression profiles and DNA methylation analysis between the KYSE180 and KYSE180_HOTAIR cells revealed that only a small proportion of the methylation changes were correlated with gene expression changes.CONCLUSION: HOX transcript antisense RNA is upregulated in ESCC cell lines and patient samples, and promotes ESCC cell proliferation and tumour metastasis in mice. The knockdown of HOTAIR resulted in significant changes in gene expression, and data analysis suggested that HOTAIR-mediated gene regulation has a critical role in ESCC progression and is a novel epigenetic molecular target for treating ESCC patients."

We showed that collinearity of the Ae. tauschii genes with Brachypodium distachyon, rice, and sorghum decreased with phylogenetic distance and that structural genome evolution rates have been high across all investigated lineages in subfamily Pooideae, including that of Brachypodieae. We obtained additional information about the evolution of the seven Triticeae chromosomes from 12 ancestral chromosomes and uncovered a pattern of centromere inactivation accompanying nested chromosome insertions in grasses. We showed that the density of noncollinear genes along the Ae. tauschii chromosomes positively correlates with recombination rates, suggested a cause, and showed that new genes, exemplified by disease resistance genes, are preferentially located in high-recombination chromosome regions."

Our approach capitalizes on a new use for the Infinium I design bead types to measure non-specific fluorescence in the colour channel opposite of their design (Cy3/Cy5). This provides tens of thousands of features for measuring background instead of the much smaller number of negative control probes on the platforms (n = 32 for HumanMethylation27 and n = 614 for HumanMethylation450, respectively). We compare the performance of our methods with existing approaches, using technical replicates of both mixture samples and biological samples, and demonstrate that within- and between-platform artefacts can be substantially reduced, with concomitant improvement in sensitivity, by the proposed methods."

We analysed &gt;480 000 CpG sites using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina) in whole blood DNA of 965 participants of a population-based cohort study aged between 50 and 75 years. In an exploratory analysis in 400 individuals, 200 CpG sites with the highest Spearman correlation coefficients for the association between methylation and age were identified. Of these 200 CpGs, 162 were significantly associated with age, which was verified in an independent cohort of 498 individuals using mixed linear regression models adjusted for gender, smoking behaviour, age-related diseases and random batch effect and corrected for multiple testing by Bonferroni. In another independent cohort of 67 individuals without history of major age-related diseases and with a follow-up of 8 years, we observed a gain in methylation at 96% (52%, significant) of the positively age-associated CpGs and a loss at all (89%, significant) of the negatively age-associated CpGs in each individual while getting 8 years older. A regression model for age prediction based on 17 CpGs as predicting variables explained 71% of the variance in age with an average accuracy of 2.6 years. In comparison with cord blood samples obtained from the Ulm Birth Cohort Study, we observed a more than 2-fold change in mean methylation levels from birth to older age at 86 CpGs. We were able to identify 65 novel CpG sites with significant association of methylation with age."

Many bioinformatics pipelines have been developed to call variants from NGS data. The performance of these pipelines depends crucially on the variant caller used and on the calling strategies implemented. We studied the performance of four prevailing callers, SAMtools, GATK, glftools and Atlas2, using single-sample and multiple-sample variant-calling strategies. Using the same aligner, BWA, we built four single-sample and three multiple-sample calling pipelines and applied the pipelines to whole exome sequencing data taken from 20 individuals. We obtained genotypes generated by Illumina Infinium HumanExome v1.1 Beadchip for validation analysis and then used Sanger sequencing as a &quot;gold-standard&quot; method to resolve discrepancies for selected regions of high discordance. Finally, we compared the sensitivity of three of the single-sample calling pipelines using known simulated whole genome sequence data as a gold standard. Overall, for single-sample calling, the called variants were highly consistent across callers and the pairwise overlapping rate was about 0.9. Compared with other callers, GATK had the highest rediscovery rate (0.9969) and specificity (0.99996), and the Ti/Tv ratio out of GATK was closest to the expected value of 3.02. Multiple-sample calling increased the sensitivity. Results from the simulated data suggested that GATK outperformed SAMtools and glfSingle in sensitivity, especially for low coverage data. Further, for the selected discrepant regions evaluated by Sanger sequencing, variant genotypes called by exome sequencing versus the exome array were more accurate, although the average variant sensitivity and overall genotype consistency rate were as high as 95.87% and 99.82%, respectively. In conclusion, GATK showed several advantages over other variant callers for general purpose NGS analyses. The GATK pipelines we developed perform very well."

To test the possible involvement of epigenetic modulation by HPV in HNSCC, we conducted a genome-wide DNA-methylation analysis.METHODS: Using laser-capture microdissection of 42 formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded (FFPE) HNSCCs, we generated DNA-methylation profiles of 18 HPV+ and 14 HPV- samples, using Infinium 450 k BeadArray technology. Methylation data were validated in two sets of independent HPV+/HPV- HNSCC samples (fresh-frozen samples and cell lines) using two independent methods (Infinium 450 k and whole-genome methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq)). For the functional analysis, an HPV- HNSCC cell line was transduced with lentiviral constructs containing the two HPV oncogenes (E6 and E7), and effects on methylation were assayed using the Infinium 450 k technology.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Unsupervised clustering over the methylation variable positions (MVPs) with greatest variation showed that samples segregated in accordance with HPV status, but also that HPV+ tumors are heterogeneous. MVPs were significantly enriched at transcriptional start sites, leading to the identification of a candidate CpG island methylator phenotype in a sub-group of the HPV+ tumors. Supervised analysis identified a strong preponderance (87%) of MVPs towards hypermethylation in HPV+ HNSCC. Meta-analysis of our HNSCC and publicly available methylation data in cervical and lung cancers confirmed the observed DNA-methylation signature to be HPV-specific and tissue-independent. Grouping of MVPs into functionally more significant differentially methylated regions identified 43 hypermethylated promoter DMRs, including for three cadherins of the Polycomb group target genes. Integration with independent expression data showed strong negative correlation, especially for the cadherin gene-family members. Combinatorial ectopic expression of the two HPV oncogenes (E6 and E7) in an HPV- HNSCC cell line partially phenocopied the hypermethylation signature seen in HPV+ HNSCC tumors, and established E6 as the main viral effector gene.CONCLUSIONS: Our data establish that archival FFPE tissue is very suitable for this type of methylome analysis, and suggest that HPV modulates the HNSCC epigenome through hypermethylation of Polycomb repressive complex 2 target genes such as cadherins, which are implicated in tumor progression and metastasis."
"23804401";"Infinium";"Infinium";"Genome Res";16;2013;"Estimating absolute methylation levels at single-CpG resolution from methylation enrichment and restriction enzyme sequencing methods.";"Recent advancements in sequencing-based DNA methylation profiling methods provide an unprecedented opportunity to map complete DNA methylomes. These include whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS, MethylC-seq, or BS-seq), reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and enrichment-based methods such as MeDIP-seq, MBD-seq, and MRE-seq. These methods yield largely comparable results but differ significantly in extent of genomic CpG coverage, resolution, quantitative accuracy, and cost, at least while using current algorithms to interrogate the data. None of these existing methods provides single-CpG resolution, comprehensive genome-wide coverage, and cost feasibility for a typical laboratory. We introduce methylCRF, a novel conditional random fields-based algorithm that integrates methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP-seq) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (MRE-seq) sequencing data to predict DNA methylation levels at single-CpG resolution. Our method is a combined computational and experimental strategy to produce DNA methylomes of all 28 million CpGs in the human genome for a fraction (&lt;10%) of the cost of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing methods. methylCRF was benchmarked for accuracy against Infinium arrays, RRBS, WGBS sequencing, and locus-specific bisulfite sequencing performed on the same human embryonic stem cell line. methylCRF transformation of MeDIP-seq/MRE-seq was equivalent to a biological replicate of WGBS in quantification, coverage, and resolution. We used conventional bisulfite conversion, PCR, cloning, and sequencing to validate loci where our predictions do not agree with whole-genome bisulfite data, and in 11 out of 12 cases, methylCRF predictions of methylation level agree better with validated results than does whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Therefore, methylCRF transformation of MeDIP-seq/MRE-seq data provides an accurate, inexpensive, and widely accessible strategy to create full DNA methylomes."

Previous studies have found local correlation between genetic variants and DNA methylation levels (cis-meQTLs). However, general mechanisms underlying cis-meQTLs are unclear. We conducted a cis-meQTL analysis of the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network data (n = 593). We found that over 80% of genetic variants at CpG sites (meSNPs) are meQTL loci (P-value&lt;10(-9)), and meSNPs account for over two thirds of the strongest meQTL signals (P-value&lt;10(-200)). Beyond direct effects on the methylation of the meSNP site, the CpG-disrupting allele of meSNPs were associated with lowered methylation of CpG sites located within 45 bp. The effect of meSNPs extends to as far as 10 kb and can contribute to the observed meQTL signals in the surrounding region, likely through correlated methylation patterns and linkage disequilibrium. Therefore, meSNPs are behind a large portion of observed meQTL signals and play a crucial role in the biological process linking genetic variation to epigenetic changes."

Genetic relationships between A. tauschii and the wheat D genome are of central importance for the understanding of wheat origin and subsequent evolution. Genetic relationships among 477 A. tauschii and wheat accessions were studied with the A. tauschii 10K Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Aegilops tauschii consists of two lineages (designated 1 and 2) having little genetic contact. Each lineage consists of two closely related sublineages. A population within lineage 2 in the southwestern and southern Caspian appears to be the main source of the wheat D genome. Lineage 1 contributed as little as 0.8% of the wheat D genome. Triticum aestivum is subdivided into the western and Far Eastern populations. The Far Eastern population conserved the genetic make-up of the nascent T. aestivum more than the western population. In wheat, diversity is high in chromosomes 1D and 2D and it correlates in all wheat D-genome and A. tauschii chromosomes with recombination rates. Gene flow from A. tauschii was an important source of wheat genetic diversity and shaped its distribution along the D-genome chromosomes."

Here, we hypothesize that DNA methylation may have an important and potentially independent effect on human metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we conducted what is to the best of our knowledge the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) between DNA methylation and metabolic traits (metabotypes) in human blood. We assess 649 blood metabolic traits from 1814 participants of the Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg (KORA) population study for association with methylation of 457 004 CpG sites, determined on the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform. Using the EWAS approach, we identified two types of methylome-metabotype associations. One type is driven by an underlying genetic effect; the other type is independent of genetic variation and potentially driven by common environmental and life-style-dependent factors. We report eight CpG loci at genome-wide significance that have a genetic variant as confounder (P = 3.9 × 10(-20) to 2.0 × 10(-108), r(2) = 0.036 to 0.221). Seven loci display CpG site-specific associations to metabotypes, but do not exhibit any underlying genetic signals (P = 9.2 × 10(-14) to 2.7 × 10(-27), r(2) = 0.008 to 0.107). We further identify several groups of CpG loci that associate with a same metabotype, such as 4-vinylphenol sulfate and 4-androsten-3-beta,17-beta-diol disulfate. In these cases, the association between CpG-methylation and metabotype is likely the result of a common external environmental factor, including smoking. Our study shows that analysis of EWAS with large numbers of metabolic traits in large population cohorts are, in principle, feasible. Taken together, our data suggest that DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating human metabolism."

A particularly interesting subset of these resources is related to epigenetic regulation, with DNA methylation being the most abundant data type. In this paper, we will focus on the analysis of DNA methylation data and its application to cancer studies. We first briefly review the molecular techniques that generate such data, much of which has been obtained with the use of the most recent version of Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip(®) technology (Illumina, CA, USA). We describe the coverage of the methylome by this technique. Several examples of data mining are provided. However, it should be understood that reliance on a single aspect of epigenetics has its limitations. In the not too distant future, these defects may be rectified, providing scientists with previously unavailable opportunities to explore in detail the role of epigenetics in cancer and other disease states."

Epigenetic marks, DNA methylation (DNA-M) in particular, are considered to add to the explanation of asthma. However, no etiological model has yet been developed that integrates genetic variants and DNA-M. To explore a new model, we focused on one asthma candidate gene, the IL-4 receptor (IL4R). We hypothesized that genetic variants of IL4R in interaction with DNA-M at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites jointly alter the risk of asthma during adolescence. Blood samples were collected at age 18 years from 245 female cohort participants randomly selected for methylation analysis from a birth cohort (n = 1,456, Isle of Wight, UK). Genome-wide DNA-M was assessed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.RESULTS: Thirteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and twelve CpG sites of IL4R gene were analyzed. Based on linkage disequilibrium and association with asthma, eight SNPs and one CpG site were selected for further analyses. Of the twelve CpG sites in the IL4R gene, only methylation levels of cg09791102 showed an association with asthma at age 18 years (Wilcoxon test: P = 0.01). Log-linear models were used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) for asthma adjusting for uncorrelated SNPs within the IL4R gene and covariates. Testing for interaction between the eight SNPs and the methylation levels of cg09791102 on the risk for asthma at age 18 years, we identified the statistically significant interaction term of SNP rs3024685 × methylation levels of cg09791102 (P = 0.002; after adjusting for false discovery rate). A total of 84 participants had methylation levels ≤0.88, 112 participants between 0.89 and 0.90, and 35 between 0.91 and 0.92. For the SNP rs3024685 ('CC' vs. 'TT') at methylation levels of ≤0.85, 0.86, 0.90, 0.91, and 0.92, the RRs were 0.01, 0.04, 4.65, 14.76, 14.90, respectively (interaction effect, P = 0.0003).CONCLUSIONS: Adjusting for multiple testing, our results suggest that DNA-M modulates the risk of asthma related to genetic variants in the IL4R gene. The strong interaction of one SNP and DNA-M is encouraging and provides a novel model of how a joint effect of genetic variants and DNA-M can explain occurrence of asthma."

Here, a 6K SNP array for use with the Illumina Infinium® system was developed for diploid sweet cherry (Prunus avium) and allotetraploid sour cherry (P. cerasus). This effort was led by RosBREED, a community initiative to enable marker-assisted breeding for rosaceous crops. Next-generation sequencing in diverse breeding germplasm provided 25 billion basepairs (Gb) of cherry DNA sequence from which were identified genome-wide SNPs for sweet cherry and for the two sour cherry subgenomes derived from sweet cherry (avium subgenome) and P. fruticosa (fruticosa subgenome). Anchoring to the peach genome sequence, recently released by the International Peach Genome Initiative, predicted relative physical locations of the 1.9 million putative SNPs detected, preliminarily filtered to 368,943 SNPs. Further filtering was guided by results of a 144-SNP subset examined with the Illumina GoldenGate® assay on 160 accessions. A 6K Infinium® II array was designed with SNPs evenly spaced genetically across the sweet and sour cherry genomes. SNPs were developed for each sour cherry subgenome by using minor allele frequency in the sour cherry detection panel to enrich for subgenome-specific SNPs followed by targeting to either subgenome according to alleles observed in sweet cherry. The array was evaluated using panels of sweet (n = 269) and sour (n = 330) cherry breeding germplasm. Approximately one third of array SNPs were informative for each crop. A total of 1825 polymorphic SNPs were verified in sweet cherry, 13% of these originally developed for sour cherry. Allele dosage was resolved for 2058 polymorphic SNPs in sour cherry, one third of these being originally developed for sweet cherry. This publicly available genomics resource represents a significant advance in cherry genome-scanning capability that will accelerate marker-locus-trait association discovery, genome structure investigation, and genetic diversity assessment in this diploid-tetraploid crop group."

We hypothesize that DNA methylation patterns may contribute to variation in diabetes-related risk factors, and this epigenetic variation across the genome can contribute to the missing heritability in T2D and related metabolic traits. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study for fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) among 837 nondiabetic participants in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network study, divided into discovery (N = 544) and replication (N = 293) stages. Cytosine guanine dinucleotide (CpG) methylation at ∼470,000 CpG sites was assayed in CD4(+) T cells using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 Beadchip. We fit a mixed model with the methylation status of each CpG as the dependent variable, adjusting for age, sex, study site, and T-cell purity as fixed-effects and family structure as a random-effect. A Bonferroni corrected P value of 1.1 × 10(-7) was considered significant in the discovery stage. Significant associations were tested in the replication stage using identical models. Methylation of a CpG site in ABCG1 on chromosome 21 was significantly associated with insulin (P = 1.83 × 10(-7)) and HOMA-IR (P = 1.60 × 10(-9)). Another site in the same gene was significant for HOMA-IR and of borderline significance for insulin (P = 1.29 × 10(-7) and P = 3.36 × 10(-6), respectively). Associations with the top two signals replicated for insulin and HOMA-IR (P = 5.75 × 10(-3) and P = 3.35 × 10(-2), respectively). Our findings suggest that methylation of a CpG site within ABCG1 is associated with fasting insulin and merits further evaluation as a novel disease risk marker."

Region detection is more specific than single CpG analysis as it increases the extent of common findings between studies, and is more powerful as it reduces the multiple testing problem inherent in epigenetic whole-genome association studies (EWAS). In addition, results driven by single erroneous probes are removed. We have used multiple publicly available Infinium 450K data sets to generate a consensus list of DMRs for age, supporting the hypothesis that aging is associated with specific epigenetic modifications. The consensus aging DMRs are significantly enriched for muscle biogenesis pathways. We find a massive increase in VMRs with age and in regions of the genome associated with open chromatin and neurotransmission. Old age VMRs are significantly enriched for neurotransmission pathways. EWAS studies should investigate the role of this interindividual variation in DNA methylation, in the age-associated diseases of sarcopenia and dementia."

First, DNA taken from individuals exposed to low and high levels of drinking water arsenic were plated twice on Illumina's Infinium 450 K HumanMethylation Array, once in order of exposure and again following randomization. Second, we conducted simulations in which random CpG sites were drawn from the 450 K array and subjected to pathway analysis using Ingenuity's IPA software.RESULTS: The majority of differentially methylated CpG sites identified in Run One were due to batch effects; few sites were also identified in Run Two. In addition, the pathway analysis software reported many significant associations between our data, randomly drawn from the 450 K array, and various diseases and biological functions.CONCLUSIONS: These analyses illustrate the pitfalls of not properly controlling for chip-specific batch effects as well as using pathway analysis software created for gene expression arrays to analyze DNA methylation array data.IMPACT: We present evidence that (i) chip-specific effects can simulate plausible differential methylation results and (ii) popular pathway analysis software developed for expression arrays can yield spurious results when used in tandem with methylation microarrays."

As increasing evidence indicates that clear-cell ovarian cancer may have unique pathogenesis, further understanding of molecular features may enable us to begin to understand the underlying biology and histology-specific information for improved outcomes. To study epigenetics in clear-cell ovarian cancer, fresh frozen tumor DNA (n = 485) was assayed on Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. We identified a clear-cell ovarian cancer tumor methylation profile (n = 163) which we validated in two independent replication sets (set 1, n = 163; set 2, n = 159), highlighting 22 CpG loci associated with nine genes (VWA1, FOXP1, FGFRL1, LINC00340, KCNH2, ANK1, ATXN2, NDRG21 and SLC16A11). Nearly all of the differentially methylated CpGs showed a propensity toward hypermethylation among clear-cell cases. Several loci methylation inversely correlated with tumor gene expression, most notably KCNH2 (HERG, a potassium channel) (P = 9.5 × 10(-7)), indicating epigenetic silencing. In addition, a predicted methylation class mainly represented by the clear-cell cases (20 clear cell out of 23 cases) had improved survival time. Although these analyses included only 30 clear-cell carcinomas, results suggest that loss of expression of KCNH2 (HERG) by methylation could be a good prognostic marker, given that overexpression of the potassium (K(+)) channel Eag family members promotes increased proliferation and results in poor prognosis. Validation in a bigger cohort of clear-cell tumors of the ovary is warranted."

One major susceptibility factor for arsenic-related toxicity is the efficiency of arsenic metabolism. The efficiency, in turn, is associated with non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the arsenic methyltransferase AS3MT on chromosome 10q24. However, the mechanism of action for these SNPs is not yet clarified. Here, we assessed the influence of genetic variation in AS3MT on DNA methylation and gene expression within 10q24, in people exposed to arsenic in drinking water. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood from women in the Argentinean Andes (N = 103) and from cord blood from new-borns in Bangladesh (N = 127). AS3MT SNPs were analyzed with Sequenom or Taqman assays. Whole genome epigenetic analysis with Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was performed on bisulphite-treated DNA. Whole genome gene expression analysis was performed with Illumina DirectHyb HumanHT-12 v4.0 on RNA from peripheral blood. Arsenic exposure was assessed by HPLC-ICPMS. In the Argentinean women, the major AS3MT haplotype, associated with more efficient arsenic metabolism, showed increased methylation of AS3MT (p = 10(-6)) and also differential methylation of several other genes within about 800 kilobasepairs: CNNM2 (p&lt;10(-16)), NT5C2 (p&lt;10(-16)), C10orf26 (p = 10(-8)), USMG5 (p = 10(-5)), TRIM8 (p = 10(-4)), and CALHM2 (p = 0.038) (adjusted for multiple comparisons). Similar, but weaker, associations between AS3MT haplotype and DNA methylation in 10q24 were observed in cord blood (Bangladesh). The haplotype-associated altered CpG methylation was correlated with reduced expression of AS3MT and CNNM2 (r(s) = -0.22 to -0.54), and with increased expression of NT5C2 and USMG5 (r(s) = 0.25 to 0.58). Taking other possibly influential variables into account in multivariable linear models did only to a minor extent alter the strength of the associations. In conclusion, the AS3MT haplotype status strongly predicted DNA methylation and gene expression of AS3MT as well as several genes in 10q24. This raises the possibility that several genes in this region are important for arsenic metabolism."

Two high-density SNP arrays relying on the Infinium iSelect technology (Illumina) were designed for use in the conifer white spruce (Picea glauca). One array contained 7338 segregating SNPs representative of 2814 genes of various molecular functional classes for main uses in genetic association and population genetics studies. The other one contained 9559 segregating SNPs representative of 9543 genes for main uses in population genetics, linkage mapping of the genome and genomic prediction. The SNPs assayed were discovered from various sources of gene resequencing data. SNPs predicted from high-quality sequences derived from genomic DNA reached a genotyping success rate of 64.7%. Nonsingleton in silico SNPs (i.e. a sequence polymorphism present in at least two reads) predicted from expressed sequenced tags obtained with the Roche 454 technology and Illumina GAII analyser resulted in a similar genotyping success rate of 71.6% when the deepest alignment was used and the most favourable SNP probe per gene was selected. A variable proportion of these SNPs was shared by other nordic and subtropical spruce species from North America and Europe. The number of shared SNPs was inversely proportional to phylogenetic divergence and standing genetic variation in the recipient species, but positively related to allele frequency in P. glauca natural populations. These validated SNP resources should open up new avenues for population genetics and comparative genetic mapping at a genomic scale in spruce species."

While the technology is wide-spread, systematic technical biases are believed to be present in the data. For example, this array incorporates two different chemical assays, i.e., Type I and Type II probes, which exhibit different technical characteristics and potentially complicate the computational and statistical analysis. Several normalization methods have been introduced recently to adjust for possible biases. However, there is considerable debate within the field on which normalization procedure should be used and indeed whether normalization is even necessary. Yet despite the importance of the question, there has been little comprehensive comparison of normalization methods. We sought to systematically compare several popular normalization approaches using the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) methylation data set and the technical replicates analyzed with it as a case study. We assessed both the reproducibility between technical replicates following normalization and the effect of normalization on association analysis. Results indicate that the raw data are already highly reproducible, some normalization approaches can slightly improve reproducibility, but other normalization approaches may introduce more variability into the data. Results also suggest that differences in association analysis after applying different normalizations are not large when the signal is strong, but when the signal is more modest, different normalizations can yield very different numbers of findings that meet a weaker statistical significance threshold. Overall, our work provides useful, objective assessment of the effectiveness of key normalization methods."

Therefore, we postulated that GDM exposure impacts the offspring's methylome and used an epigenomic approach to explore this hypothesis. Placenta and cord blood samples were obtained from 44 newborns, including 30 exposed to GDM. Women were recruited at first trimester of pregnancy and followed until delivery. GDM was assessed after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. DNA methylation was measured at&gt;485,000 CpG sites (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was conducted to identify metabolic pathways epigenetically affected by GDM. Our results showed that 3,271 and 3,758 genes in placenta and cord blood, respectively, were potentially differentially methylated between samples exposed or not to GDM (p-values down to 1 × 10(-06); none reached the genome-wide significance levels), with more than 25% (n = 1,029) being common to both tissues. Mean DNA methylation differences between groups were 5.7 ± 3.2% and 3.4 ± 1.9% for placenta and cord blood, respectively. These genes were likely involved in the metabolic diseases pathway (up to 115 genes (11%), p-values for pathways = 1.9 × 10(-13)&lt;p&lt;4.0 × 10(-03); including diabetes mellitus p = 4.3 × 10(-11)). Among the differentially methylated genes, 326 in placenta and 117 in cord blood were also associated with newborn weight. Our results therefore suggest that GDM has epigenetic effects on genes preferentially involved in the metabolic diseases pathway, with consequences on fetal growth and development, and provide supportive evidence that DNA methylation is involved in fetal metabolic programming."

Our objective was to evaluate associations between prenatal cadmium exposure, DNA methylation and birth weight. In total 127 mother-child pairs from rural Bangladesh were studied. For comparison, we included 56 children at 4.5 y. Cadmium concentrations in mothers' blood (gestational week 14) and children's urine were measured by ICPMS. Global DNA methylation was analyzed by Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip in cord blood and children's blood. Maternal cadmium exposure was associated with cord blood DNA methylation (p-value &lt; 10 (-16) ). The association was markedly sex-specific. In boys, 96% of the top 500 CpG sites showed positive correlations (rS-values &gt; 0.50), whereas most associations in girls were inverse; only 29% were positive (rS &gt; 0.45). In girls we found overrepresentation of methylation changes in genes associated with organ development, morphology and mineralization of bone, whereas changes in boys were found in cell death-related genes. Several individual CpG sites that were positively associated with cadmium were inversely correlated with birth weight, although none statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. The associations were, however, fairly robust in multivariable-adjusted linear regression models. We identified CpG sites that were significantly associated with cadmium exposure in both newborns and 4.5-y-old children. In conclusion, cadmium exposure in early life appears to alter DNA methylation differently in girls and boys. This is consistent with previous findings of sex-specific cadmium toxicity. Cadmium-related changes in methylation were also related to lower birth weight."

Methylated sequence capturing by Methyl Binding Domain (MBD) based enrichment followed by second-generation sequencing provides the best combination of sensitivity and cost-efficiency for genome-wide DNA-methylation profiling. However, existing implementations are numerous, and quality control and optimization require expensive external validation. Therefore, this study has two aims: 1) to identify a best performing kit for MBD-based enrichment using independent validation data, and 2) to evaluate whether quality evaluation can also be performed solely based on the characteristics of the generated sequences. Five commercially available kits for MBD enrichment were combined with Illumina GAIIx sequencing for three cell lines (HCT15, DU145, PC3). Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data (all three cell lines) and publicly available Illumina Infinium BeadChip data (DU145 and PC3) were used for benchmarking. Consistent large-scale differences in yield, sensitivity and specificity between the different kits could be identified, with Diagenode's MethylCap kit as overall best performing kit under the tested conditions. This kit could also be identified with the Fragment CpG-plot, which summarizes the CpG content of the captured fragments, implying that the latter can be used as a tool to monitor data quality. In conclusion, there are major quality differences between kits for MBD-based capturing of methylated DNA, with the MethylCap kit performing best under the used settings. The Fragment CpG-plot is able to monitor data quality based on inherent sequence data characteristics, and is therefore a cost-efficient tool for experimental optimization, but also to monitor quality throughout routine applications."

Such epigenetic variation could be genetic or non-genetic in origin, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) are underway for a wide variety of diseases/phenotypes. However, performing an EWAS is associated with a range of issues not typically encountered in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), such as the tissue to be analyzed. In many EWASs, it is not possible to analyze the target tissue in large numbers of live humans, and consequently surrogate tissues are employed, most commonly blood. But there is as yet no evidence demonstrating that blood is more informative than buccal cells, the other easily accessible tissue. To assess the potential of buccal cells for use in EWASs, we performed a comprehensive analysis of a buccal cell methylome using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Strikingly, a buccal vs. blood comparison reveals&gt;6X as many hypomethylated regions in buccal. These tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) are strongly enriched for DNaseI hotspots. Almost 75% of these tDMRs are not captured by commonly used DNA methylome profiling platforms such as Reduced Representational Bisulfite Sequencing and the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and they also display distinct genomic properties. Buccal hypo-tDMRs show a statistically significant enrichment near SNPs associated to disease identified through GWASs. Finally, we find that, compared with blood, buccal hypo-tDMRs show significantly greater overlap with hypomethylated regions in other tissues. We propose that for non-blood based diseases/phenotypes, buccal will be a more informative tissue for EWASs."

Currently there is an increasingly large number of DNA methylomic data being released in the public domain allowing for an opportunity to investigate the relationships between the DNA methylome, genome function, and human phenotypes. The Illumina450K is one of the most popular platforms for assessing DNA methylation with over 10,000 samples available in the public domain. However, accessing all this data requires downloading each individual experiment and due to inconsistent annotation, accessing the right data can be a challenge.DESCRIPTION: Here we introduce 'Marmal-aid', the first standardised database for DNA methylation (freely available at http://marmal-aid.org). In Marmal-aid, the majority of publicly available Illumina HumanMethylation450 data is incorporated into a single repository allowing for re-processing of data including normalisation and imputation of missing values. The database is accessible in two ways: (1) Using an R package to allow for incorporation into existing analysis pipelines which can then be easily queried to gain insight into the functionality of certain CpG sites. This is aimed at a bioinformatician with experience in R. (2) Using a graphical interface allowing general biologists to query a pre-defined set of tissues (currently 15) providing a reference database of the methylation state in these tissues for the 450,000 CpG sites profiled by the Illumina HumanMethylation450.CONCLUSION: Marmal-aid is the largest publicly available Illumina HumanMethylation450 methylation database combining Illumina HumanMethylation450 data from a number of sources into a single location with a single common annotation format. This allows for automated extraction using the R package and inclusion into existing analysis pipelines. Marmal-aid also provides a easy to use GUI to visualise methylation data in user defined genomic regions for various reference tissues."

Small airways are the primary sites of airflow obstruction in COPD. We sought to determine whether DNA methylation patterns are disrupted in small airway epithelia of patients with COPD, and evaluate whether changes in gene expression are associated with these disruptions. Genome-wide methylation and gene expression analysis were performed on small airway epithelial DNA and RNA obtained from the same patient during bronchoscopy, using Illumina's Infinium HM27 and Affymetrix's Genechip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. To control for known effects of cigarette smoking on DNA methylation, methylation and gene expression profiles were compared between former smokers with and without COPD matched for age, pack-years, and years of smoking cessation. Our results indicate that aberrant DNA methylation is (1) a genome-wide phenomenon in small airways of patients with COPD, and (2) associated with altered expression of genes and pathways important to COPD, such as the NF-E2-related factor 2 oxidative response pathway. DNA methylation is likely an important mechanism contributing to modulation of genes important to COPD pathology. Because these methylation events may underlie disease-specific gene expression changes, their characterization is a critical first step toward the development of epigenetic markers and an opportunity for developing novel epigenetic therapeutic interventions for COPD."

Raw reads from the sunflower line, RHA 464 were assembled de novo to serve as a framework reference genome. About 15.2 Mb of sunflower genome distributed over 42,267 contigs were obtained upon assembly of RHA 464 sequencing data, the contig lengths ranged from 200 to 950 bp with an N50 length of 393 bp. SNP calling was performed by aligning sequencing data from the six sunflower lines to the assembled reference RHA 464. On average, 1 SNP was located every 143 bp of the sunflower genome sequence. Based on several filtering criteria, a final set of 16,467 putative sequence variants with characteristics favorable for Illumina Infinium Genotyping Technology (IGT) were mined from the sequence data generated across six diverse sunflower lines.CONCLUSION: Here we report the molecular and computational methodology involved in SNP development for a complex genome like sunflower lacking reference assembly, offering an attractive tool for molecular breeding purposes in sunflower."

The dendrogram based on the genotype data corresponded well to the breeding types of tomato and wild relatives. The SNPs were classified into six categories according to their positions in the genes predicted on the tomato genome sequence. The genes with SNPs were annotated by homology searches against the nucleotide and protein databases, as well as by domain searches, and they were classified into the functional categories defined by the NCBI's eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOG). To infer the SNPs' effects on the gene functions, the three-dimensional structures of the 843 proteins that were encoded by the genes with SNPs causing missense mutations were constructed by homology modelling, and 200 of these proteins were considered to carry non-synonymous amino acid substitutions in the predicted functional sites. The SNP information obtained in this study is available at the Kazusa Tomato Genomics Database (http://plant1.kazusa.or.jp/tomato/)."

Recent studies have shown that DNA methylation markers in peripheral blood may serve as risk markers for AD. Yet a genome-wide epigenomic approach investigating the role of DNA methylation in AD has yet to be performed. We conducted a population-based, case-control study of genome-wide DNA methylation to determine if alterations in gene-specific methylation were associated with AD in a Chinese population. Using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation27 BeadChip, we assessed gene-specific methylation in over 27 000 CpG sites from DNA isolated from lymphocytes in 63 male AD in-patients and 65 male healthy controls. Using a multi-factorial statistical model, we observed differential methylation between cases and controls at multiple CpG sites with the majority of the methylated CpG sites being hypomethylated. Analyses with the online gene set analysis toolkit WebGestalt revealed that the genes of interest were enriched in multiple biological processes involved in AD development. Gene Ontology function annotation showed that stress, immune response and signal transduction were highly associated with AD. Further analysis by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes revealed associations with multiple pathways involved in metabolism through cytochrome P450, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and calcium signaling. Associations with canonical pathways previously shown to be involved in AD were also observed, such as dehydrogenases 1A (ADH1A), ADH7, aldehyde dehydrogenases 3B2 (ALDH3B2) and cytochrome P450 2A13. We present evidence that alterations in DNA methylation may be associated with AD, which is consistent with epigenetic theory."

Low oxygen tension influences placental function, and is associated with preeclampsia, a condition displaying altered development of placental trophoblast. We hypothesized that oxygen tension affects villous trophoblast by modulation of gene expression through DNA methylation. We used the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array to compare the DNA methylation profile of primary cultures of human cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts under &lt; 1%, 8% and 20% oxygen levels. We found no effect of oxygen tension on average DNA methylation for either cell phenotype, but a set of loci became hypermethylated in cytotrophoblasts exposed for 24 h to &lt; 1% oxygen, as compared with those exposed to 8% or 20% oxygen. Hypermethylation with low oxygen tension was independently confirmed by bisulfite-pyrosequencing in a subset of functionally relevant genes including CD59, CFB, GRAM3 and ZNF217. Intriguingly, 70 out of the 147 CpGs that became hypermethylated in &lt; 1% oxygen overlapped with CpG sites that became hypomethylated upon differentiation of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts. Furthermore, the preponderance of altered sites was located at AP-1 binding sites. We suggest that AP-1 expression is triggered by hypoxia and interacts with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) to target methylation at specific sites in the genome, thus causing suppression of the associated genes that are responsible for differentiation of villous cytotrophoblast to syncytiotrophoblast."

We, therefore, quantified DNA methylation of 70 candidate gene loci in 140 breast tumors and matched normal tissues and determined associations with gene expression and tumor subtype. Using Sequenom's EpiTYPER platform, approximately 1,200 CpGs were interrogated and revealed six DNA methylation patterns in breast tumors relative to matched normal tissue. Differential methylation of several gene loci was observed within all molecular subtypes, while other patterns were subtype-dependent. Methylation of numerous gene loci was inversely correlated with gene expression, and in some cases, this correlation was only observed within specific breast tumor subtypes. Our findings were validated on a larger set of tumors and matched adjacent normal tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, which utilized methylation data derived from both Illumina Infinium 27 and 450 k arrays. These findings highlight the need to control for subtype when interpreting DNA methylation results, and the importance of interrogating multiple CpGs across varied gene regions."

We hypothesized that effects of preterm birth can be mediated through measurable epigenomic changes throughout development. We therefore used a longitudinal birth cohort to measure the epigenetic mark of DNA methylation at birth and 18 years comparing survivors of extremely preterm birth with infants born at term.METHODS: Using 12 extreme preterm birth cases and 12 matched, term controls, we extracted DNA from archived neonatal blood spots and blood collected in a similar way at 18 years of age. DNA methylation was measured at 347,789 autosomal locations throughout the genome using Infinium HM450 arrays. Representative methylation differences were confirmed by Sequenom MassArray EpiTYPER.RESULTS: At birth we found 1,555 sites with significant differences in methylation between term and preterm babies. At 18 years of age, these differences had largely resolved, suggesting that DNA methylation differences at birth are mainly driven by factors relating to gestational age, such as cell composition and/or maturity. Using matched longitudinal samples, we found evidence for an epigenetic legacy associated with preterm birth, identifying persistent methylation differences at ten genomic loci. Longitudinal comparisons of DNA methylation at birth and 18 years uncovered a significant overlap between sites that were differentially-methylated at birth and those that changed with age. However, we note that overlapping sites may either differ in the same (300/1,555) or opposite (431/1,555) direction during gestation and aging respectively.CONCLUSIONS: We present evidence for widespread methylation differences between extreme preterm and term infants at birth that are largely resolved by 18 years of age. These results are consistent with methylation changes associated with blood cell development, cellular composition, immune induction and age at these time points. Finally, we identified ten probes significantly associated with preterm individuals and with greater than 5% methylation discordance at birth and 18 years that may reflect a long term epigenetic legacy of preterm birth."

As compared to field selections performed in conventional breeding programmes, genomics-based genotype screen can potentially reduce number of breeding cycles and more precisely integrate target genes for particular traits into an ideal genetic background. We developed a whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, RICE6K, based on Infinium technology, using representative SNPs selected from more than four million SNPs identified from resequencing data of more than 500 rice landraces. RICE6K contains 5102 SNP and insertion-deletion (InDel) markers, about 4500 of which were of high quality in the tested rice lines producing highly repeatable results. Forty-five functional markers that are located inside 28 characterized genes of important traits can be detected using RICE6K. The SNP markers are evenly distributed on the 12 chromosomes of rice with the average density of 12 SNPs per 1 Mb and can provide information for polymorphisms between indica and japonica subspecies as well as varieties within indica and japonica groups. Application tests of RICE6K showed that the array is suitable for rice germplasm fingerprinting, genotyping bulked segregating pools, seed authenticity check and genetic background selection. These results suggest that RICE6K provides an efficient and reliable genotyping tool for rice genomic breeding."

The DNA methylation signatures of the host genome in normal, precancerous and cervical cancer tissue may indicate tissue-specific perturbation in carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to identify new candidate genes that are differentially methylated in squamous cell carcinoma compared with DNA samples from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) and normal cervical scrapes. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip method identifies genome-wide DNA methylation changes in CpG islands, CpG shores and shelves. Our findings showed an extensive differential methylation signature in cervical cancer compared with the CIN3 or normal cervical tissues. The identified candidate biomarker genes for cervical cancer represent several types of mechanisms in the cellular machinery that are epigenetically deregulated by hypermethylation, such as membrane receptors, intracellular signaling and gene transcription. The results also confirm extensive hypomethylation of genes in the immune system in cancer tissues. These insights into the functional role of DNA methylome alterations in cervical cancer could be clinically applicable in diagnostics and prognostics, and may guide the development of new epigenetic therapies."

The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip(®) (450K), which interrogates over 480,000 CpG sites and is relatively cost effective, has become a popular tool to characterize the DNA methylome. For large-scale studies, minimizing technical variability and potential bias is paramount. The goal of this paper was to evaluate the performance of several existing and novel color channel normalizations designed to reduce technical variability and batch effects in 450K analysis from a large population study. Comparative assessment of 10 normalization procedures included the GenomeStudio(®) Illumina procedure, the lumi smooth quantile approach, and the newly proposed All Sample Mean Normalization (ASMN). We also examined the performance of normalizations in combination with correction for the two types of Infinium chemistry utilized on the 450K array. We observed that the performance of the GenomeStudio(®) normalization procedure was highly variable and dependent on the quality of the first sample analyzed in an experiment, which is used as a reference in this procedure. While the lumi normalization was able to decrease batch variability, it increased variation among technical replicates, potentially reducing biologically meaningful findings. The proposed ASMN procedure performed consistently well, both at reducing batch effects and improving replicate comparability. In summary, the ASMN procedure can improve existing color channel normalization, especially for large epidemiologic studies, and can be successfully implemented to enhance a 450K DNA methylation data pipeline."

Animal studies indicate that bisphenol A (BPA), the monomer used in epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics, may impact health through epigenetic mechanisms, and epidemiological data associate BPA levels with metabolic disorders, behavior changes, and reproductive effects. Thus, we conducted an environmental epidemiology study of BPA exposure and CpG methylation in pre-adolescent girls from Gharbiah, Egypt hypothesizing that methylation profiles exhibit exposure-dependent trends.METHODS: Urinary concentrations of total (free plus conjugated) species of BPA in spot samples were quantified for 60 girls aged 10 to 13. Genome-wide CpG methylation was concurrently measured in bisulfite-converted saliva DNA using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (N = 46). CpG sites from four candidate genes were validated via quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing.RESULTS: CpG methylation varied widely among girls, and higher urinary BPA concentrations were generally associated with less genomic methylation. Based on pathway analyses, genes exhibiting reduced methylation with increasing urinary BPA were involved in immune function, transport activity, metabolism, and caspase activity. In particular, hypomethylation of CpG targets on chromosome X was associated with higher urinary BPA. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, we identified a number of candidate genes in our sample that previously have been associated with BPA-related expression change.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that BPA may affect human health through specific epigenomic modification of genes in relevant pathways. Thus, epigenetic epidemiology holds promise for the identification of biomarkers from previous exposures and the development of epigenetic-based diagnostic strategies."

Using single-CpG resolution Infinium array, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed in 36 samples of normal lung tissue obtained from patients without any primary lung tumor, 145 samples of non-cancerous lung tissue (N) obtained from patients with lung adenocarcinomas, and 145 samples of tumorous tissue (T). Stepwise progression of DNA methylation alterations from normal lung tissue to non-cancerous lung tissue obtained from patients with lung adenocarcinomas, and then tumorous tissue samples, was observed at 3,270 CpG sites, suggesting that non-cancerous lung tissue obtained from patients with lung adenocarcinomas was at precancerous stages with DNA methylation alterations. At CpG sites of 2,083 genes, DNA methylation status in samples of non-cancerous lung tissue obtained from patients with lung adenocarcinomas was significantly correlated with recurrence after establishment of lung adenocarcinomas. Among such recurrence-related genes, 28 genes are normally unmethylated (average β-values based on Infinium assay in normal lung tissue samples was less than 0.2) and their DNA hypermethylation at precancerous stages was strengthened during progression to lung adenocarcinomas (Δβ(T-N)&gt;0.1). Among these 28 genes, we focused on 6 for which implications in transcription regulation, apoptosis or cell adhesion had been reported. DNA hypermethylation of the ADCY5, EVX1, GFRA1, PDE9A, and TBX20 genes resulted in reduced mRNA expression in tumorous tissue samples. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment of lung cancer cell lines restored the mRNA expression levels of these 5 genes. Reduced mRNA expression in tumorous tissue samples was significantly correlated with tumor aggressiveness. These data suggest that DNA methylation alterations at precancerous stages determine tumor aggressiveness and outcome through silencing of specific genes."

Although the coastal and interior varieties of Douglas-fir (vars. menziesii and glauca) are native to North America, the coastal variety is also widely planted for timber production in Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and Chile. Our main goal was to develop a SNP resource large enough to facilitate genomic selection in Douglas-fir breeding programs. To accomplish this, we developed a 454-based reference transcriptome for coastal Douglas-fir, annotated and evaluated the quality of the reference, identified putative SNPs, and then validated a sample of those SNPs using the Illumina Infinium genotyping platform.RESULTS: We assembled a reference transcriptome consisting of 25,002 isogroups (unique gene models) and 102,623 singletons from 2.76 million 454 and Sanger cDNA sequences from coastal Douglas-fir. We identified 278,979 unique SNPs by mapping the 454 and Sanger sequences to the reference, and by mapping four datasets of Illumina cDNA sequences from multiple seed sources, genotypes, and tissues. The Illumina datasets represented coastal Douglas-fir (64.00 and 13.41 million reads), interior Douglas-fir (80.45 million reads), and a Yakima population similar to interior Douglas-fir (8.99 million reads). We assayed 8067 SNPs on 260 trees using an Illumina Infinium SNP genotyping array. Of these SNPs, 5847 (72.5%) were called successfully and were polymorphic.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our validation efficiency, our SNP database may contain as many as ~200,000 true SNPs, and as many as ~69,000 SNPs that could be genotyped at ~20,000 gene loci using an Infinium II array-more SNPs than are needed to use genomic selection in tree breeding programs. Ultimately, these genomic resources will enhance Douglas-fir breeding and allow us to better understand landscape-scale patterns of genetic variation and potential responses to climate change."

Importantly, periconceptual nutritional influences may modulate the establishment of epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation at MEs. Based on these characteristics, we exploited Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip kits in a 2-tissue parallel screen on peripheral blood leukocyte and colonic mucosal DNA from 10 children without identifiable large intestinal disease. This approach led to the delineation of 1776 CpG sites meeting our criteria for MEs, which associated with 1013 genes. The list of ME candidates exhibited overlaps with recently identified human genes (including CYP2E1 and MGMT, where methylation has been associated with Parkinson disease and glioblastoma, respectively) in which perinatal DNA methylation levels where linked to maternal periconceptual nutrition. One hundred 18 (11.6%) of the ME candidates overlapped with genes where DNA methylation correlated (r &gt; 0.871; p &lt; 0.055) with expression in the colon mucosa of 5 independent control children. Genes involved in homophilic cell adhesion (including cadherin-associated genes) and developmental processes were significantly overrepresented in association with MEs. Additional filtering of gene expression-correlated MEs defined 35 genes, associated with 2 or more CpG sites within a 10 kb genomic region, fulfilling the ME criteria. DNA methylation changes at a number of these genes have been linked to various forms of human disease, including cancers, such as asthma and acute myeloid leukemia (ALOX12), gastric cancer (EBF3), breast cancer (NAV1), colon cancer and acute lymphoid leukemia (KCNK15), Wilms tumor (protocadherin gene cluster; PCDHAs) and colorectal cancer (TCERG1L), suggesting a potential etiologic role for MEs in tumorigenesis and underscoring the possible developmental origins of these malignancies. The presented compendium of ME candidates may accelerate our understanding of the epigenetic origins of common human disorders."

We then evaluated this apple and pear Infinium® II 9K SNP array for large-scale genotyping in pear across several species, using both pear and apple SNPs. The segregating populations employed for array validation included a segregating population of European pear ('Old Home'×'Louise Bon Jersey') and four interspecific breeding families derived from Asian (P. pyrifolia Nakai and P. bretschneideri Rehd.) and European pear pedigrees. In total, we mapped 857 polymorphic pear markers to construct the first SNP-based genetic maps for pear, comprising 78% of the total pear SNPs included in the array. In addition, 1031 SNP markers derived from apple (13% of the total apple SNPs included in the array) were polymorphic and were mapped in one or more of the pear populations. These results are the first to demonstrate SNP transferability across the genera Malus and Pyrus. Our construction of high density SNP-based and gene-based genetic maps in pear represents an important step towards the identification of chromosomal regions associated with a range of horticultural characters, such as pest and disease resistance, orchard yield and fruit quality."

DNA methylation, a stable epigenetic modification, is cell type-dependent, and different between cancer and normal cells. Here, we aimed to demonstrate that DNA methylation can be used to estimate the fraction of cancer cells in a tumor DNA sample, using esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) as an example. First, by an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array, we isolated three genomic regions (TFAP2B, ARHGEF4, and RAPGEFL1) i) highly methylated in four ESCC cell lines, ii) hardly methylated in a pooled sample of non-cancerous mucosae, a pooled sample of normal esophageal mucosae, and peripheral leukocytes, and iii) frequently methylated in 28 ESCCs (TFAP2B, 24/28; ARHGEF4, 20/28; and RAPGEFL1, 19/28). Second, using eight pairs of cancer and non-cancer cell samples prepared by laser capture microdissection, we confirmed that at least one of the three regions was almost completely methylated in ESCC cells, and all the three regions were almost completely unmethylated in non-cancer cells. We also confirmed that DNA copy number alterations of the three regions in 15 ESCC samples were rare, and did not affect the estimation of the fraction of cancer cells. Then, the fraction of cancer cells in a tumor DNA sample was defined as the highest methylation level of the three regions, and we confirmed a high correlation between the fraction assessed by the DNA methylation fraction marker and the fraction assessed by a pathologist (r=0.85; p&lt;0.001). Finally, we observed that, by correction of the cancer cell content, CpG islands in promoter regions of tumor-suppressor genes were almost completely methylated. These results demonstrate that DNA methylation can be used to estimate the fraction of cancer cells in a tumor DNA sample."

Additionally, H3F3A K27M substitutions occur in gliomas that arise at midline locations (eg, pons, thalamus, spine); moreover, this substitution occurs mainly in tumors in children and adolescents. Here, we sought to determine the association between H3F3A mutations and adult thalamic glioma.METHODS: Genomic H3F3A was sequenced from 20 separate thalamic gliomas. Additionally, for 14 of the 20 gliomas, 639 genes--including cancer-related genes and chromatin-modifier genes--were sequenced, and the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip was used to examine DNA methylation across the genome.RESULTS: Of the 20 tumors, 18 were high-grade thalamic gliomas, and of these 18, 11 were from patients under 50 years of age (median age, 38 y; range, 17-46), and 7 were from patients over 50 years of age. The H3F3A K27M mutation was present in 10 of the 11 (91%) younger patients and absent from all 7 older patients. Additionally, H3F3A K27M was not detected in the 2 diffuse astrocytomas. Further sequencing revealed recurrent mutations in TP53, ATRX, NF1, and EGFR. Gliomas with H3F3A K27M from pediatric or young adult patients had similar, characteristic DNA methylation profiles. In contrast, thalamic gliomas with wild-type H3F3A had DNA methylation profiles similar to those of hemispheric glioblastomas.CONCLUSION: We found that high-grade thalamic gliomas from young adults, like those from children and adolescents, frequently had H3F3A K27M."

Our work represents the first genome-wide association study to the inherently complex and currently poorly understood genetic architecture of industrially relevant wood traits. Here, we employed an Illumina Infinium 34K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array that generated 29,233 high-quality SNPs in c. 3500 broad-based candidate genes within a population of 334 unrelated Populus trichocarpa individuals to establish genome-wide associations. The analysis revealed 141 significant SNPs (α ≤ 0.05) associated with 16 wood chemistry/ultrastructure traits, individually explaining 3-7% of the phenotypic variance. A large set of associations (41% of all hits) occurred in candidate genes preselected for their suggested a priori involvement with secondary growth. For example, an allelic variant in the FRA8 ortholog explained 21% of the total genetic variance in fiber length, when the trait's heritability estimate was considered. The remaining associations identified SNPs in genes not previously implicated in wood or secondary wall formation. Our findings provide unique insights into wood trait architecture and support efforts for population improvement based on desirable allelic variants."

In polyploid species, SNP data usually contain a new type of information, the allele dosage, which is not used by current methodologies for linkage analysis and QTL mapping. Here we extend existing methodology to use dosage data on SNPs in an autotetraploid mapping population. The SNP dosages are inferred from allele intensity ratios using normal mixture models. The steps of the linkage analysis (testing for distorted segregation, clustering SNPs, calculation of recombination fractions and LOD scores, ordering of SNPs and inference of parental phase) are extended to use the dosage information. For QTL analysis, the probability of each possible offspring genotype is inferred at a grid of locations along the chromosome from the ordered parental genotypes and phases and the offspring dosages. A normal mixture model is then used to relate trait values to the offspring genotypes and to identify the most likely locations for QTLs. These methods are applied to analyse a tetraploid potato mapping population of parents and 190 offspring, genotyped using an Infinium 8300 Potato SNP Array. Linkage maps for each of the 12 chromosomes are constructed. The allele intensity ratios are mapped as quantitative traits to check that their position and phase agrees with that of the corresponding SNP. This analysis confirms most SNP positions, and eliminates some problem SNPs to give high-density maps for each chromosome, with between 74 and 152 SNPs mapped and between 100 and 300 further SNPs allocated to approximate bins. Low numbers of double reduction products were detected. Overall 3839 of the 5378 polymorphic SNPs can be assigned putative genetic locations. This methodology can be applied to construct high-density linkage maps in any autotetraploid species, and could also be extended to higher autopolyploids."

Since glucocorticoids are strongly associated with the programming of long-term health, we assessed DNA methylation of genes involved in cortisol signalling and bioavailability, and hormonal signalling in the placenta of normotensive and hypertensive pregnancies. Candidate genes/CpG sites were selected through analysis of Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array data on control (n = 19) and early onset pre-eclampsia (EOPET; n = 19) placental samples. DNA methylation was further quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing in a larger cohort of control (n = 111) cases, in addition to EOPET (n = 19), late onset pre-eclampsia (LOPET; n = 18) and normotensive intrauterine growth restriction (nIUGR; n = 13) cases. DNA methylation (percentage points) was increased at CpG sites within genes encoding the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1 exon 1D promoter; +8.46%; P&lt;0.01) and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) binding protein (CRHBP intron 3; +9.14%; P&lt;0.05), and decreased within CRH (5' UTR; -4.30%; P = 0.11) in EOPET-associated placentae, but not in LOPET nor nIUGR cases, compared to controls. Differential DNA methylation was not observed among groups at the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD11B2) gene promoter. Significant hypomethylation was observed in pre-eclampsia but not nIUGR placentae for steroidogenic genes, including CYP11A1 (exon1; EOPET; -9.66%; P&lt;0.00001, and LOPET; -5.77%; P&lt;0.001), 3β-hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD3B1 exon 2; EOPET; -12.49%; P&lt;0.00001, and LOPET; -6.88%; P&lt;0.001), TEA domain family member 3 (TEAD3 intron 1; EOPET; -12.56%; P&lt;0.00001) and CYP19 (placental-specific exon 1.1 promoter; EOPET; -10.62%, P&lt;0.0001).

Whether prenatal smoke exposure affects DNA methylation leading to atopic disorders is not clear.OBJECTIVE: As most children suffering from atopic dermatitis (AD) continue to develop asthma later in life, we explored whether prenatal smoke exposure induces cord blood DNA methylation.METHODS: Methylation differences associated with smoke exposure were screened by Illumina Infinium 27K methylation arrays for 14 children from the Taiwan birth panel study cohort initially. Information about development of atopic dermatitis (AD) and risk factors was collected. Cord blood cotinine levels were measured to represent prenatal smoke exposure. CpG loci that demonstrated a statistically significant difference in methylation were validated by methylation-dependent fragment separation (MDFS). Differential methylation in three genes (TSLP, GSTT1, and CYB5R3) was identified through the screen.RESULTS: Among these, only thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) gene displayed significant difference in promoter methylation percentage after being validated by MDFS (p = 0.018). TSLP gene was further investigated in a larger sample of 150 children from the cohort who completed the follow-up study. Methylation status of the TSLP 5'-CpG island (CGI) was found to be significantly associated with prenatal smoke exposure (OR = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.63-6.19) and with AD (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.06-5.11). The degree of TSLP 5'CGI methylation inversely correlated with TSLP protein expression levels (r = -0.45, P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS &amp; CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The effect of prenatal tobacco smoke exposure on the risk for AD may be mediated through DNA methylation."

Differences in gene expression profiles in the populations from various locations with different environmental conditions were repeatedly observed. In this study we compare the methylation profiles in 200 blood samples of children (aged 7-15 years) with and without bronchial asthma from two regions in the Czech Republic with different levels of air pollution (a highly polluted Ostrava region and a control Prachatice region). Samples were collected in March 2010 when the mean concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) measured by stationary monitoring were 10.1±2.4ng/m(3) in Ostrava Bartovice (5.6 times higher than in the control region). Significantly higher concentrations of other pollutants (benzene, NO2, respirable air particles and metals) were also found in Ostrava. We applied the Infinium Methylation Assay, using the Human Methylation 27K BeadChip with 27,578 CpG loci for identification of the DNA methylation pattern in studied groups. Results demonstrate a significant impact of different environmental conditions on the DNA methylation patterns of children from the two regions. We found 9916 CpG sites with significantly different methylation (beta value) between children from Ostrava vs. Prachatice from which 58 CpG sites had differences &gt;10%. The methylation of all these 58 CpG sites was lower in children from polluted Ostrava, which indicates a higher gene expression in comparison with the control Prachatice region. We did not find a difference in DNA methylation patterns between children with and without bronchial asthma in individual locations, but patterns in both asthmatics and healthy children differed between Ostrava and Prachatice. Further, we show differences in DNA methylation pattern depending on gender and urinary cotinine levels. Other factors including length of gestation, birth weight and length of full breastfeeding are suggested as possible factors that can impact the DNA methylation pattern in future life."

Hypokalemia, a subnormal serum potassium ion concentration ([K(+)]), most often occurs as a secondary problem but can occur as a primary problem, such as hypokalaemic periodic paralysis in humans, and as feline hypokalaemic periodic polymyopathy primarily in Burmese. The most characteristic clinical sign of hypokalemia in Burmese is a skeletal muscle weakness that is frequently episodic in nature, either generalized, or sometimes localized to the cervical and thoracic limb girdle muscles. Burmese hypokalemia is suspected to be a single locus autosomal recessive trait. A genome wide case-control study using the illumina Infinium Feline 63K iSelect DNA array was performed using 35 cases and 25 controls from the Burmese breed that identified a locus on chromosome E1 associated with hypokalemia. Within approximately 1.2 Mb of the highest associated SNP, two candidate genes were identified, KCNH4 and WNK4. Direct sequencing of the genes revealed a nonsense mutation, producing a premature stop codon within WNK4 (c.2899C&gt;T), leading to a truncated protein that lacks the C-terminal coiled-coil domain and the highly conserved Akt1/SGK phosphorylation site. All cases were homozygous for the mutation. Although the exact mechanism causing hypokalemia has not been determined, extrapolation from the homologous human and mouse genes suggests the mechanism may involve a potassium-losing nephropathy. A genetic test to screen for the genetic defect within the active breeding population has been developed, which should lead to eradication of the mutation and improved general health within the breed. Moreover, the identified mutation may help clarify the role of the protein in K⁺ regulation and the cat represents the first animal model for WNK4-associated hypokalemia."

The spread of inactivation onto translocated autosomal material allows the study of inactivation without the confounding evolutionary history of the X chromosome. The heterogeneity and reduced extent of silencing on autosomes are evidence for the importance of DNA elements underlying the spread of silencing. We have assessed DNA methylation in six unbalanced X-autosome translocations using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. Two to 42% of translocated autosomal genes showed this mark of silencing, with the highest degree of inactivation observed for trisomic autosomal regions. Generally, the extent of silencing was greatest close to the translocation breakpoint; however, silencing was detected well over 100 kb into the autosomal DNA. Alu elements were found to be enriched at autosomal genes that escaped from inactivation while L1s were enriched at subject genes. In cells without the translocation, there was enrichment of heterochromatic features such as EZH2 and H3K27me3 for those genes that become silenced when translocated, suggesting that underlying chromatin structure predisposes genes towards silencing. Additionally, the analysis of topological domains indicated physical clustering of autosomal genes of common inactivation status. Overall, our analysis indicated a complex interaction between DNA sequence, chromatin features and the three-dimensional structure of the chromosome."

We have studied a patient with multiple anomalies born to a mother with a heterozygous NLRP7 mutation. By array-based CpG methylation analysis of blood DNA from the patient, his parents and 18 normal controls on Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChips we found that the patient had methylation changes (delta ß ≥ 0.3) at many imprinted loci as well as at 87 CpGs associated with 85 genes of unknown imprinting status. Using a pseudoproband (permutation) approach, we found methylation changes at only 7-24 CpGs (mean 15; standard deviation 4.84) in the controls. Thus, the number of abberantly methylated CpGs in the patient is more than 14 standard deviations higher. In order to identify novel imprinted genes among the 85 conspicuous genes in the patient, we selected 19 (mainly hypomethylated) genes for deep bisulfite amplicon sequencing on the ROCHE/454 Genome Sequencer in the patient and at least two additional controls. These controls had not been included in the array analysis and were heterozygous for a single nucleotide polymorphism at the test locus, so that allele-specific DNA methylation patterns could be determined. Apart from FAM50B, which we proved to be imprinted in blood, we did not observe allele-specific DNA methylation at the other 18 loci. We conclude that the patient does not only have methylation defects at imprinted loci but (at least in blood) also an excess of methylation changes at apparently non-imprinted loci."

Whole-genome sequences with 6× to 12× coverage from five genetically diverse S. bicolor genotypes, including three sweet sorghums and two grain sorghums, were aligned to the sorghum reference genome. From over 1 million high-quality SNPs, we selected 2124 Infinium Type II SNPs that were informative in all six source genomes, gave an optimal Assay Design Tool (ADT) score, had allele frequencies of 50% in the six genotypes and were evenly spaced throughout the S. bicolor genome. Furthermore, by phenotype-based pool sequencing, we selected an additional 876 SNPs with a phenotypic association to early-stage chilling tolerance, a key trait for European sorghum breeding. The 3000 attempted bead types were used to populate half of a dual-species Illumina iSelect SNP array. The array was tested using 564 Sorghum spp. genotypes, including offspring from four unrelated recombinant inbred line (RIL) and F2 populations and a genetic diversity collection. A high call rate of over 80% enabled validation of 2620 robust and polymorphic sorghum SNPs, underlining the efficiency of the array development scheme for whole-genome SNP selection and screening, with diverse applications including genetic mapping, genome-wide association studies and genomic selection."

We show that the methylation profiles of tumors and healthy tissue samples can be clearly distinguished from one another and that the main source of methylation variability is associated with disease status. We used different statistical approaches to evaluate the methylation data. In general, at the CpG-site level, we found that common CRC-specific methylation patterns consist of at least 15,667 CpG sites that were significantly different from either adjacent healthy tissue or tissue from cancer-free subjects. Of these sites, 10,342 were hypermethylated in CRC, and 5,325 were hypomethylated. Hypermethylated sites were common in the maximum number of sample pairs and were mostly located in CpG islands, where they were significantly enriched for differentially methylated regions known to be cancer-specific. In contrast, hypomethylated sites were mostly located in CpG shores and were generally sample-specific. Despite the considerable variability in methylation data, we selected a panel of 14 highly robust candidates showing methylation marks in genes SND1, ADHFE1, OPLAH, TLX2, C1orf70, ZFP64, NR5A2, and COL4A. This set was successfully cross-validated using methylation data from 209 CRC samples and 38 healthy tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (AUC = 0.981 [95% CI: 0.9677-0.9939], sensitivity = 100% and specificity = 82%).

Epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence.METHODS: To determine if alterations in gene-specific methylation were associated with alcohol dependence, a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from alcohol-dependent patients and siblings without alcohol dependence as controls. The Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip was used and gene-specific methylation of DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed. Genes ALDH1L2, GAD1, DBH and GABRP were selected to validate beadchip results by pyrosequencing.RESULTS: Compared to normal controls, 865 hypomethylated and 716 hypermethylated CG sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA in alcohol-dependent patients were identified. The most hypomethylated CG site is located in the promoter of SSTR4 (somatostatin receptor 4) and the most hypermethylated CG site is GABRP (gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor). The results from beadchip analysis were consistent with that of pyrosequencing.DISCUSSION: DNA methylation might be associated with alcohol dependence. Genes SSTR4, ALDH1L2, GAD1, DBH and GABRP may participate in the biological process of alcohol dependence."

To investigate whether aberrant hypermethylation is a mechanism of inactivation of these tumor suppressor genes in ccRCC, we sequenced the promoter region within a bona fide CpG island of PBRM1, KDM6A, SETD2 and BAP1 in bisulfite-modified DNA of a representative series of 50 primary ccRCC, 4 normal renal parenchyma specimens and 5 RCC cell lines. We also interrogated the promoter methylation status of KDM5C and ARID1A in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ccRCC Infinium data set. PBRM1, KDM6A, SETD2 and BAP1 were unmethylated in all tumor and normal specimens. KDM5C and ARID1A were unmethylated in the TCGA 219 ccRCC and 119 adjacent normal specimens. Aberrant promoter hypermethylation of PBRM1, BAP1 and the other chromatin-modifying genes examined here is therefore absent or rare in ccRCC."

In addition, TBili is thought to be under strong genetic regulation via the UGT1A gene family, suggesting it may be a heritable CVD risk factor. However, few studies directly relate TBili-associated UGT1A variants to CVD severity or outcome. This study replicated the genetic association for TBili in the Diabetes Heart Study (DHS), and examined the relationships of TBili-associated SNPs with measures of subclinical CVD and mortality.METHODS: This investigation included 1220 self-described European American (EA) individuals from the DHS, a family-based study examining risk for macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Genetic associations with TBili were examined using the Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP Array 5.0 and the Illumina Infinium Human Exome beadchip v1.0. Subsequent analyses assessed the relationships of the top TBili-associated SNPs with measures of vascular calcified plaque and mortality.RESULTS: A genome-wide association study detected 18 SNPs within the UGT1A gene family associated with TBili at p &lt; 5 × 10(-8). The top hit was rs887829 (p = 8.67 × 10(-20)). There was no compelling evidence of association between the top TBili-associated SNPs and vascular calcified plaque (p = 0.05-0.88). There was, however, evidence of association with all-cause mortality (p = 0.0004-0.06), the top hit being rs2741034.CONCLUSION: These findings support a potential role for UGT1A genetic variants in risk for mortality in T2D. Further quantification of the extent of CVD risk conferred by UGT1A gene family variants in a high risk cohort with T2D is still required."

The methylation profile of human samples can be assessed accurately and reproducibly using the HM27 BeadChip (27,578 CpG sites) or its successor, the HM450 BeadChip (482,421 CpG sites). To date no mouse equivalent has been developed, greatly hindering the application of this methodology to the wide range of valuable murine models of disease and development currently in existence. We found 1308 and 13,715 probes from HM27 and HM450 BeadChip respectively, uniquely matched the bisulfite converted reference mouse genome (mm9). We demonstrate reproducible measurements of DNA methylation at these probes in a range of mouse tissue samples and in a murine cell line model of acute myeloid leukaemia. In the absence of a mouse counterpart, the Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip arrays have utility for methylation profiling in non-human species."

Genetic defects have been identified in∼60% of cases, with mutations in ABCC8, KCNJ11 and INS being the most frequent causes of PNDM. Recognition of genetic subtypes strongly impacts on both patients' care and family counseling. This study aimed to identify the genetic aetiology of PNDM in a diabetic girl born of consanguineous parents.METHODS: DNA samples from both the proband and her non-diabetic parents were analyzed for homozygosity mapping, using Illumina Infinium 660K SNP microarrays, focusing on the runs of homozygosity (ROHs) detected only in the patient. Standard Sanger sequencing of candidate genes (MNX1 and GATA6) present in the ROHs was subsequently performed, as well as expression analyses on human embryonic and adult pancreatic islet samples.RESULTS: A putative causal homozygous mutation in the transcription factor gene MNX1 (c.816C&gt;A/p.Phe272Leu) was identified in the PNDM patient, who was clinically diagnosed as a typical case of PNDM with no developmental pancreatic defects or other clinical features. The probable deleterious mutation was located within the MNX1 homeodomain helix 2 that is highly conserved between species. In human embryonic pancreatic islet samples, it has been shown that MNX1 expression is significantly enriched in pancreatic epithelium compared with mesenchyme, suggesting a role for MNX1 in human pancreatic beta-cell development.CONCLUSION: This study found a new putative cause of PNDM in a consanguineous family. Replication in other cohorts would help to clarify the clinical spectrum of MNX1 mutations in PNDM patients."

DNA from this source has been utilised for a number of molecular analyses including genome-wide association studies, but only few studies have tested the feasibility of using it for epigenetic applications, particularly at a genome-wide level.RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate the successful use of DNA isolated from archived dried blood spots for the Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip, along with DNA from matched frozen buffy coats. We obtained high quality and reproducible genome-wide DNA methylation profiles using both sample types. We also report high correlations (r &gt; 0.9907) between DNA obtained from matched dried blood spots and frozen buffy coats, sufficient to distinguish between unrelated individuals.CONCLUSIONS: We, thus, demonstrate that DNA from archived dried blood spots is suitable for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling."
"23379751";"Infinium";"Infinium";"BMC Cancer";4;2013;"Molecular profiling of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and actinic keratoses from organ transplant recipients.";"BACKGROUND: The risk of developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is markedly increased in organ transplant recipients (OTRs) compared to the normal population. Next to sun exposure, the immunosuppressive regimen is an important risk factor for the development of SCC in OTRs. Various gene mutations (e.g. TP53) and genetic alterations (e.g. loss of CDKN2A, amplification of RAS) have been found in SCCs. The aim of this genome-wide study was to identify pathways and genomic alterations that are consistently involved in the formation of SCCs and their precursor lesions, actinic keratoses (AKs).METHODS: To perform the analysis in an isogenic background, RNA and DNA were isolated from SCC, AK and normal (unexposed) epidermis (NS) from each of 13 OTRs. Samples were subjected to genome-wide expression analysis and genome SNP analysis using Illumina's HumanWG-6 BeadChips and Infinium II HumanHap550 Genotyping BeadChips, respectively. mRNA expression results were verified by quantitative PCR.RESULTS: Hierarchical cluster analysis of mRNA expression profiles showed SCC, AK and NS samples to separate into three distinct groups. Several thousand genes were differentially expressed between epidermis, AK and SCC; most upregulated in SCCs were hyperproliferation related genes and stress markers, such as keratin 6 (KRT6), KRT16 and KRT17. Matching to oncogenic pathways revealed activation of downstream targets of RAS and cMYC in SCCs and of NFκB and TNF already in AKs. In contrast to what has been reported previously, genome-wide SNP analysis showed very few copy number variations in AKs and SCCs, and these variations had no apparent relationship with observed changes in mRNA expression profiles.CONCLUSION: Vast differences in gene expression profiles exist between SCC, AK and NS from immunosuppressed OTRs. Moreover, several pathways activated in SCCs were already activated in AKs, confirming the assumption that AKs are the precursor lesions of SCCs. Since the drastic changes in gene expression appeared unlinked to specific genomic gains or losses, the causal events driving SCC development require further investigation. Other molecular mechanisms, such as DNA methylation or miRNA alterations, may affect gene expression in SCCs of OTRs. Further study is required to identify the mechanisms of early activation of NFκB and TNF, and to establish whether these pathways offer a feasible target for preventive intervention among OTRs."

We have identified 12 loci that are differentially methylated in serous ovarian cancers and endometrioid ovarian and endometrial cancers with respect to normal control samples. The strongest signal showed hypermethylation in tumors at a CpG island within the ZNF154 promoter. We show that hypermethylation of this locus is recurrent across solid human epithelial tumor samples for 15 of 16 distinct cancer types from TCGA. Furthermore, ZNF154 hypermethylation is strikingly present across a diverse panel of ENCODE cell lines, but only in those derived from tumor cells. By extending our analysis from the Illumina 27K Infinium platform to the 450K platform, to sequencing of PCR amplicons from bisulfite treated DNA, we demonstrate that hypermethylation extends across the breadth of the ZNF154 CpG island. We have also identified recurrent hypomethylation in two genomic regions associated with CASP8 and VHL. These three genes exhibit significant negative correlation between methylation and gene expression across many cancer types, as well as patterns of DNaseI hypersensitivity and histone marks that reflect different chromatin accessibility in cancer vs. normal cell lines. Our findings emphasize hypermethylation of ZNF154 as a biological marker of relevance for tumor identification. Epigenetic modifications affecting the promoters of ZNF154, CASP8, and VHL are shared across a vast array of tumor types and may therefore be important for understanding the genomic landscape of cancer."
"23996928";"Infinium";"Infinium";"Carcinogenesis";3;2013;"Genome-wide methylation analysis shows similar patterns in Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma.";"Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). To identify novel tumor suppressors involved in esophageal carcinogenesis and potential biomarkers for the malignant progression of BE, we performed a genome-wide methylation profiling of BE and EAC tissues. Using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip microarray, we examined the methylation status of 27 578 CpG sites in 94 normal esophageal (NE), 77 BE and 117 EAC tissue samples. The overall methylation of CpG sites within the CpG islands was higher, but outside of the CpG islands was lower in BE and EAC tissues than in NE tissues. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed an excellent separation of NE tissues from BE and EAC tissues; however, the clustering of BE and EAC tissues was less clear, suggesting that methylation occurs early during the progression of EAC. We confirmed many previously reported hypermethylated genes and identified a large number of novel hypermethylated genes in BE and EAC tissues, particularly genes encoding ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase) peptidase proteins, cadherins and protocadherins, and potassium voltage-gated channels. Pathway analysis showed that a number of channel and transporter activities were enriched for hypermethylated genes. We used pyrosequencing to validate selected candidate genes and found high correlations between the array and pyrosequencing data (rho &gt; 0.8 for each validated gene). The differentially methylated genes and pathways may provide biological insights into the development and progression of BE and become potential biomarkers for the prediction and early detection of EAC."

To investigate the importance of epigenetic events in this tissue in the physiology and pathophysiology of pregnancy, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of human amnion from term (with and without labor) and preterm deliveries. Using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, we identified genes exhibiting differential methylation associated with normal labor and preterm birth. Functional analysis of the differentially methylated genes revealed biologically relevant enriched gene sets. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the promoter region of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene detected two CpG dinucleotides showing significant methylation differences among the three groups of samples. Hypermethylation of the CpG island of the solute carrier family 30 member 3 (SLC30A3) gene in preterm amnion was confirmed by methylation-specific PCR. This work provides preliminary evidence that DNA methylation changes in the amnion may be at least partially involved in the physiological process of labor and the etiology of preterm birth and suggests that DNA methylation profiles, in combination with other biological data, may provide valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying normal and pathological pregnancies."

The aim of this study was to identify, for the first time, the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of human articular chondrocytes from OA cartilage and healthy control cartilage samples.METHODS: DNA methylation profiling was performed using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 in 25 patients with OA and 20 healthy controls. Subsequent validation was performed by genome-wide expression analysis using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST array in an independent cohort of 24 patients with OA. Finally, the most consistent genes in both assays were amplified by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in a validation cohort of 48 patients using microfluidic real-time quantitative PCR. Appropriate bioinformatics analyses were carried out using R bioconductor software packages and qBase plus software from Biogazelle.RESULTS: We found 91 differentially methylated (DM) probes, which permitted us to separate patients with OA from healthy controls. Among the patients with OA, we detected 1357 DM probes that identified a tight cluster of seven patients who were different from the rest. This cluster was also identified by genome-wide expression in which 450 genes were differentially expressed. Further validation of the most consistent genes in an independent cohort of patients with OA permitted us to identify this cluster, which was characterised by increased inflammatory processes.CONCLUSIONS: We were able to identify a tight subgroup of patients with OA, characterised by an increased inflammatory response that could be regulated by epigenetics. The identification and isolation of this subgroup may be critical for the development of effective treatment and disease prevention."

RCC can be divided into several subtypes: conventional RCC (the most common, comprising 75% of all cases), papillary RCC (15%) and chromophobe RCC (5%). Renal oncocytoma is a benign tumor and accounts for 5% of RCC. Cancer and epigenetics are closely associated, with DNA hypermethylation being widely accepted as a feature of many cancers. In this study the DNA methylation profiles of chromophobe RCC and renal oncocytomas were investigated by utilizing the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Cancer-specific hypermethylation was identified in 9.4% and 5.2% of loci in chromophobe RCC and renal oncocytoma samples, respectively, while the majority of the genome was hypomethylated. Thirty (hypermethylated) and 41 (hypomethylated) genes were identified as differentially methylated between chromophobe RCC and renal oncocytomas (p &lt; 0.05). Pathway analysis identified some of the differentially hypermethylated genes to be involved in Wnt (EN2), MAPK (CACNG7) and TGFβ (AMH) signaling, Hippo pathway (NPHP4), and cell death and apoptosis (SPG20, NKX6-2, PAX3 and BAG2). In addition, we analyzed ccRCC and papillary RCC data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas portal to identify differentially methylated loci in chromophobe RCC and renal oncocytoma in relation to the other histological subtypes, providing insight into the pathology of RCC subtypes and classification of renal tumors."
"24367375";"Infinium";"Infinium";"Front Genet";2;2013;"Aberrantly methylated genes in human papillary thyroid cancer and their association with BRAF/RAS mutation.";"Cancer arises through accumulation of epigenetic and genetic alteration. Aberrant promoter methylation is a common epigenetic mechanism of gene silencing in cancer cells. We here performed genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation of promoter regions by Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, using 14 clinical papillary thyroid cancer samples and 10 normal thyroid samples. Among the 14 papillary cancer cases, 11 showed frequent aberrant methylation, but the other three cases showed no aberrant methylation at all. Distribution of the hypermethylation among cancer samples was non-random, which implied existence of a subset of preferentially methylated papillary thyroid cancer. Among 25 frequently methylated genes, methylation status of six genes (HIST1H3J, POU4F2, SHOX2, PHKG2, TLX3, HOXA7) was validated quantitatively by pyrosequencing. Epigenetic silencing of these genes in methylated papillary thyroid cancer cell lines was confirmed by gene re-expression following treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A, and detected by real-time RT-PCR. Methylation of these six genes was validated by analysis of additional 20 papillary thyroid cancer and 10 normal samples. Among the 34 cancer samples in total, 26 cancer samples with preferential methylation were significantly associated with mutation of BRAF/RAS oncogene (P = 0.04, Fisher's exact test). Thus, we identified new genes with frequent epigenetic hypermethylation in papillary thyroid cancer, two subsets of either preferentially methylated or hardly methylated papillary thyroid cancer, with a concomitant occurrence of oncogene mutation and gene methylation. These hypermethylated genes may constitute potential biomarkers for papillary thyroid cancer."

Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. Two functional SNPs, rs20541 and rs1800925, of the IL-13 gene (IL13) have been frequently associated with asthma-related lung functions. However, genetic variation alone does not fully explain asthma risk. DNA-methylation (DNA-M) is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression and can be influenced by both environment and genetic variants. To explore the interplay of prenatal maternal smoking, genetic variants and DNA-M, we used a two-stage model: (1) identifying cytosine phosphate guanine (CpG) sites where DNA-M is influenced by the interaction between genetic variants and maternal smoking during pregnancy (conditional methQTL (methylation quantitative trait loci)); and (2) determining the effect of the interaction between DNA-M of CpG (from stage 1) and SNPs (modifying genetic variants; modGV) on airflow limitation and AR in 245 female participants of the Isle of Wight birth cohort. DNA-M was assessed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.FINDINGS: Six CpG sites were analyzed in stage 1. DNA-M at cg13566430 was influenced by interaction of maternal smoking during pregnancy and rs20541. In stage 2, genotype at rs1800925 interacted with DNA-M at cg13566430 significantly affecting airflow limitation (P = 0.042) and AR (P = 0.01).CONCLUSION: Both genetic variants and environment affect DNA-M. This study supports the proposed two-stage model (methQTL and modGV) to study genetic variants, environment and DNA-M interactions in asthma-related lung function."

Mean methylation levels (β¯) in AsUC and non-AsUC were compared by their ratio (β¯ ratio) and difference (Δβ¯). Associations between site-specific methylation levels in UC and cumulative arsenic exposure were examined.RESULTS: Among 27,578 methylation sites analyzed, 231 sites had β¯ ratio &gt;2 or &lt;0.5 and 45 sites had Δβ¯ &gt;0.2 or &lt;-0.2. There were 13 sites showing statistically significant (q&lt;0.05) differences in β¯ between AsUC and non-AsUC including 12 hypermethylation sites in AsUC and only one hypermethylation site in non-AsUC. Significant associations between cumulative arsenic exposure and DNA methylation levels of 28 patients were observed in nine CpG sites of nine gens including PDGFD (Spearman rank correlation, 0.54), CTNNA2 (0.48), KCNK17 (0.52), PCDHB2 (0.57), ZNF132 (0.48), DCDC2 (0.48), KLK7 (0.48), FBXO39 (0.49), and NPY2R (0.45). These associations remained statistically significant for CpG sites in CTNNA2, KLK7, NPY2R, ZNF132 and KCNK17 in 20 non-smoking women after adjustment for tumor stage and age.CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations between cumulative arsenic exposure and methylation level of CTNNA2, KLK7, NPY2R, ZNF132 and KCNK17 were found in smoking-unrelated urothelial carcinoma. Arsenic exposure may cause urothelial carcinomas through the hypermethylation of genes involved in cell adhesion, proteolysis, transcriptional regulation, neuronal pathway, and ion transport. The findings of this study, which are limited by its small sample size and moderate dose-response relation, remain to be validated by further studies with large sample sizes."
"24204800";"Infinium";"Infinium";"PLoS One";2;2013;"Genome-wide promoter methylome of small renal masses.";"The majority of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is now incidentally detected and presents as small renal masses (SRMs) defined as ≤ 4 cm in size. SRMs are heterogeneous comprising several histological types of RCC each with different biology and behavior, and benign tumors mainly oncocytoma. The varied prognosis of the different types of renal tumor has implications for management options. A key epigenetic alteration involved in the initiation and progression of cancer is aberrant methylation in the promoter region of a gene. The hypermethylation is associated with transcriptional repression and is an important mechanism of inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in neoplastic cells. We have determined the genome-wide promoter methylation profiles of 47 pT1a and 2 pT1b clear cell, papillary or chromophobe RCC, 25 benign renal oncocytoma ≤ 4 cm and 4 normal renal parenchyma specimens by Infinium HumanMethylation27 beadchip technology. We identify gene promoter hypermethylation signatures that distinguish clear cell and papillary from each other, from chromophobe and oncocytoma, and from normal renal cells. Pairwise comparisons revealed genes aberrantly hypermethylated in a tumor type but unmethylated in normal, and often unmethylated in the other renal tumor types. About 0.4% to 1.7% of genes comprised the promoter methylome in SRMs. The Infinium methylation score for representative genes was verified by gold standard technologies. The genes identified as differentially methylated implicate pathways involved in metabolism, tissue response to injury, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), signal transduction and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), cancer, and stem cell regulation in the biology of RCC. Our findings contribute towards an improved understanding of the development of RCC, the different biology and behavior of histological types, and discovery of molecular subtypes. The differential methylation signatures may have utility in early detection and particularly differential diagnosis for prognostic stratification as well as identify novel gene and pathway targets for therapeutic intervention."

Aberrant epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may be important in asthma development. Fetal exposure to maternal asthma during critical periods of in utero development may lead to epigenetic alterations that predispose infants to a greater risk of developing asthma themselves. We investigated alterations in the DNA methylation profile of peripheral blood from infants exposed to maternal asthma during pregnancy.METHODS: Peripheral blood was collected from 12-month-old infants born to women with (n = 25) and without (n = 15) doctor diagnosed asthma during pregnancy. Genomic DNA was extracted, bisulfite converted, and hybridized to Infinium Methylation 27 arrays (Illumina), containing over27,000 CpGs from 14,495 genes. CpG loci in only autosomal genes were classified as differentially methylated at the 99% level (P &lt; 0.01, |DiffScore| &gt; 22 and delta beta &gt;0.06).RESULTS: There were 70 CpG loci, corresponding to 67 genes that were significantly differentially methylated. Twelve CpG loci (11 genes) showed greater than 10% comparative difference in DNA methylation, including hyper-methylated loci of FAM181A, MRI1, PIWIL1, CHFR, DEFA1, MRPL28, AURKA, and hypo-methylated loci of NALP1L5, MAP8KIP3, ACAT2, and PM20D1 in maternal asthma. Methylation of MAPK8IP3 was significantly negatively correlated with maternal blood eosinophils (r = -0.38; P = 0.022), maternal eNO (r = -0.44; P = 0.005), and maternal serum total IgE (r = -0.39, P = 0.015). Methylation of AURKA negatively correlated with maternal hemoglobin (r = -0.43; P = 0.008), infants height (r = -0.51; P &lt; 0.001) and weight (r = -0.36; P = 0.021). Methylation of PM20D1 was lower in infants born to mothers with asthma on inhaled corticosteroid treatment. Methylation of PM20D1 was lower and MRI1 was higher in infants born to atopic mothers without asthma.CONCLUSIONS: In an Australian study population, exposure to maternal asthma during pregnancy is associated with differential methylation profiles of infants' peripheral blood DNA, which may act as risk factors for future asthma development."

To analyze the data of this promising platform, we developed FastDMA which can be used to identify significantly differentially methylated probes. Besides single probe analysis, FastDMA can also do region-based analysis for identifying the differentially methylated region (DMRs). A uniformed statistical model, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), is used to achieve all the analyses in FastDMA. We apply FastDMA on three large-scale DNA methylation datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and find many differentially methylated genomic sites in different types of cancer. On the testing datasets, FastDMA shows much higher computational efficiency than current tools.

Samples of LM from 2,285 Angus cattle were obtained, and concentrations of 7 minerals, including iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and zinc, were quantified. Genomic DNA extracted from the ground beef sample used for mineral composition was genotyped with the Bovine SNP50 Infinium II BeadChip, and effects of SNP on each trait were estimated using the Bayes-Cπ module of GenSel software. Pedigree-based estimates of heritabilities and corresponding genetic variances indicate iron was the only mineral concentration that could be considered a good candidate for manipulation by genomic selection. The amount of variation that could be accounted for by SNP genotypes was concordant with pedigree-based heritabilities and varied from very low for potassium and sodium (&lt;0.09) to medium high (0.37) for iron. Although significant chromosomal regions were identified for all minerals analyzed in this study, further study focused on iron. Seven regions on 6 chromosomes (1, 2, 7, 10, 15, and 28) were identified to have a major effect on the iron content of LM in Angus cattle. The accuracy of direct genomic values (DGV) for iron concentration was estimated using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy. The accuracy of DGV estimated as the genetic correlation between DGV and the phenotype (iron concentration) adjusted for contemporary groups was 0.59. A bivariate animal model was used to estimate genetic correlations between iron concentrations and a reduced set of economically important carcass traits: HCW, rib eye area, calculated USDA yield grade, percent KPH, and marbling score. The genetic correlations between iron concentration and HCW, percentage KPH, marbling score, and rib eye area were small (-0.19 to 0.15) and nonsignificant. Although still weak (0.22), a positive significant genetic correlation was identified between iron content and USDA calculated yield grade. Beef is a major contributor of iron and zinc in the human diet, and this study found that iron content might be effectively manipulated through marker-assisted selection programs, without compromising other carcass and palatability traits."

Although previous studies have revealed that HLA-B*52:01 has an effect on TAK susceptibility, no other genetic determinants have been established so far. Here, we performed genome scanning of 167 TAK cases and 663 healthy controls via Illumina Infinium Human Exome BeadChip arrays, followed by a replication study consisting of 212 TAK cases and 1,322 controls. As a result, we found that the IL12B region on chromosome 5 (rs6871626, overall p = 1.7 × 10(-13), OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.42-2.16) and the MLX region on chromosome 17 (rs665268, overall p = 5.2 × 10(-7), OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.28-1.76) as well as the HLA-B region (rs9263739, a proxy of HLA-B*52:01, overall p = 2.8 × 10(-21), OR = 2.44, 95% CI 2.03-2.93) exhibited significant associations. A significant synergistic effect of rs6871626 and rs9263739 was found with a relative excess risk of 3.45, attributable proportion of 0.58, and synergy index of 3.24 (p ≤ 0.00028) in addition to a suggestive synergistic effect between rs665268 and rs926379 (p ≤ 0.027). We also found that rs6871626 showed a significant association with clinical manifestations of TAK, including increased risk and severity of aortic regurgitation, a representative severe complication of TAK. Detection of these susceptibility loci will provide new insights to the basic mechanisms of TAK pathogenesis. Our findings indicate that IL12B plays a fundamental role on the pathophysiology of TAK in combination with HLA-B(∗)52:01 and that common autoimmune mechanisms underlie the pathology of TAK and other autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases in which IL12B is involved as a genetic predisposing factor."

However, the correct calling of SNP genotypes in divergent polyploid genomes using array technology can be problematic due to paralogy, and to divergence in probe sequences causing changes in probe binding efficiencies. An Illumina Infinium II whole-genome genotyping array was recently developed for the cultivated apple and used to develop a molecular linkage map for an apple rootstock progeny (M432), but a large proportion of segregating SNPs were not mapped in the progeny, due to unexpected genotype clustering patterns. To investigate the causes of this unexpected clustering we performed BLAST analysis of all probe sequences against the 'Golden Delicious' genome sequence and discovered evidence for paralogous annealing sites and probe sequence divergence for a high proportion of probes contained on the array. Following visual re-evaluation of the genotyping data generated for 8,788 SNPs for the M432 progeny using the array, we manually re-scored genotypes at 818 loci and mapped a further 797 markers to the M432 linkage map. The newly mapped markers included the majority of those that could not be mapped previously, as well as loci that were previously scored as monomorphic, but which segregated due to divergence leading to heterozygosity in probe annealing sites. An evaluation of the 8,788 probes in a diverse collection of Malus germplasm showed that more than half the probes returned genotype clustering patterns that were difficult or impossible to interpret reliably, highlighting implications for the use of the array in genome-wide association studies."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent to which the ELD approach reduces the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) in a broiler line, in which 1,091 breeders from 3 generations were used for training and 160 progeny of the third generation for validation. All birds were genotyped with an Illumina Infinium platform HD panel that included 20,541 segregating markers. Two subsets of HD markers, with 377 (ELD-1) or 766 (ELD-2) markers, were selected as ELD panels. The ELD-1 panel was genotyped using KBiosciences KASPar SNP genotyping chemistry, whereas the ELD-2 panel was simulated by adding markers from the HD panel to the ELD-1 panel. The training data set was used for 2 traits: BW at 35 d on both sexes and hen house production (HHP) between wk 28 and 54. Methods Bayes-A, -B, -C and genomic best linear unbiased prediction were used to estimate HD-marker effects. Two scenarios were used: (1) the 160 progeny were ELD-genotyped, and (2) the 160 progeny and their dams (117 birds) were ELD-genotyped. The missing HD genotypes in ELD-genotyped birds were imputed by a Gibbs sampler, capitalizing on linkage within families. In scenario (1), the correlation of GEBV for BW (HHP) of the 160 progeny based on observed HD versus imputed genotypes was greater than 0.94 (0.98) with the ELD-1 panel and greater than 0.97 (0.99) with the ELD-2 panel. In scenario (2), the correlation of GEBV for BW (HHP) was greater than 0.92 (0.96) with the ELD-1 panel and greater than 0.95 (0.98) with the ELD-2 panel. Hence, in a pedigreed population, genomic selection can be implemented by genotyping selection candidates with about 400 ELD markers with less than 6% loss in accuracy. This leads to substantial savings in genotyping costs, with little sacrifice in accuracy."

Despite their economic and scientific significance, limited genomic resources are available for this important group of bivalves, hampering investigations into identifying genes that regulate important pearl quality traits and unique biological characteristics (i.e. biomineralisation). The silver-lipped pearl oyster, Pinctada maxima, is one species where there is interest in understanding genes that regulate commercially important pearl traits, but presently, there is a dearth of genomic information. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a large number of type I genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for P. maxima suitable for high-throughput genotyping. In addition, sequence annotations and Gene Ontology terms were assigned to a large mantle tissue 454 expressed sequence tag assembly (96,794 contigs) and information on known bivalve biomineralisation genes was incorporated into SNP discovery. The SNP discovery effort resulted in the de novo identification of 172,625 SNPs, of which 9,108 were identified as high value [minor allele frequency (MAF)≥ 0.15, read depth  ≥ 8]. Validation of 2,782 of these SNPs using Illumina iSelect Infinium genotyping technology returned some of the highest assay conversion (86.6 %) and validation (59.9 %; mean MAF 0.28) rates observed in aquaculture species to date. Genomic resources presented here will be pivotal to future research investigating the biological mechanisms behind biomineralisation and will form a strong foundation for genetic selective breeding programs in the P. maxima pearling industry."

To a large extent, this variation can be explained by four genes including OVATE. While most varieties with the OVATE mutation bear elongated fruits, some accessions carry round fruit, suggesting the existence of suppressors of OVATE in the germplasm. We developed three intraspecific F2 populations with parents that carried the OVATE mutation but differed in fruit shape. We used a bulk segregant analysis approach and genotyped the extreme classes using a high-throughput genotyping platform, the SolCAP Infinium Assay. The analyses revealed segregation at two quantitative trait loci (QTLs), sov1 and sov2. These loci were confirmed by genotyping and QTL analyses of the entire population. More precise location of those loci using progeny testing confirmed that sov1 on chromosome 10 controlled obovoid and elongated shape, whereas sov2 on chromosome 11 controlled mainly elongated fruit shape. Both loci were located in intervals of &lt;2.4 Mb on their respective chromosomes."

Recently, soft tissue sarcomas have increasingly been classified on the basis of underlying genetic alterations; however, the role of aberrant DNA methylation in these tumors is not well understood and, consequently, the usefulness of methylation-based classification is unclear.RESULTS: We used the Infinium HumanMethylation27 platform to profile DNA methylation in 80 primary, untreated high-grade soft tissue sarcomas, representing eight relevant subtypes, two non-neoplastic fat samples and 14 representative sarcoma cell lines. The primary samples were partitioned into seven stable clusters. A classification algorithm identified 216 CpG sites, mapping to 246 genes, showing different degrees of DNA methylation between these seven groups. The differences between the clusters were best represented by a set of eight CpG sites located in the genes SPEG, NNAT, FBLN2, PYROXD2, ZNF217, COL14A1, DMRT2 and CDKN2A. By integrating DNA methylation and mRNA expression data, we identified 27 genes showing negative and three genes showing positive correlation. Compared with non-neoplastic fat, NNAT showed DNA hypomethylation and inverse gene expression in myxoid liposarcomas, and DNA hypermethylation and inverse gene expression in dedifferentiated and pleomorphic liposarcomas. Recovery of NNAT in a hypermethylated myxoid liposarcoma cell line decreased cell migration and viability.CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis represents the first comprehensive integration of DNA methylation and transcriptional data in primary high-grade soft tissue sarcomas. We propose novel biomarkers and genes relevant for pathogenesis, including NNAT as a potential tumor suppressor in myxoid liposarcomas."

This research is ethically imperative given the ubiquity of folic acid fortified products in the US. Considering that folate is an essential component in the one-carbon metabolism pathway that provides methyl groups for DNA methylation, epigenetic modifications provide a putative molecular mechanism mediating the effect of folic acid supplementation on neonatal and pediatric outcomes.RESULTS: In this study we use a Mendelian Randomization Unnecessary approach to assess the effect of red blood cell (RBC) folate on genome-wide DNA methylation in cord blood. Site-specific CpG methylation within the proximal promoter regions of approximately 14,500 genes was analyzed using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation27 Bead Chip for 50 infants from the Epigenetic Birth Cohort at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Using methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genotype as the instrument, the Mendelian Randomization approach identified 7 CpG loci with a significant (mostly positive) association between RBC folate and methylation level. Among the genes in closest proximity to this significant subset of CpG loci, several enriched biologic processes were involved in nucleic acid transport and metabolic processing. Compared to the standard ordinary least squares regression method, our estimates were demonstrated to be more robust to unmeasured confounding.CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest genome-wide analysis of the effects of folate on methylation pattern, and the first to employ Mendelian Randomization to assess the effects of an exposure on epigenetic modifications. These results can help guide future analyses of the causal effects of periconceptional folate levels on candidate pathways."

However, few studies have investigated the link between reproductive factors and DNA methylation in humans. Genome-wide methylation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 376 healthy women from the prospective EPIC study was investigated using LUminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA). Also, methylation of 458877 CpG sites was additionally investigated in an independent group of 332 participants of the EPIC-Italy sub-cohort, using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip. Multivariate logistic regression and linear models were used to investigate the association between reproductive risk factors and genome wide and CpG-specific DNA methylation, respectively. Menarcheal age was inversely associated with global DNA methylation as measured with LUMA. For each yearly increase in age at menarche, the risk of having genome wide methylation below median level was increased by 32% (OR:1.32, 95%CI:1.14-1.53). When age at menarche was treated as a categorical variable, there was an inverse dose-response relationship with LUMA methylation levels (OR(12-14 vs. ≤11 yrs):1.78, 95%CI:1.01-3.17 and OR(≥15 vs. ≤11 yrs):4.59, 95%CI:2.04-10.33; P for trend&lt;0.0001). However, average levels of global methylation as measured by the Illumina technology were not significantly associated with menarcheal age. In locus by locus comparative analyses, only one CpG site had significantly different methylation depending on the menarcheal age category examined, but this finding was not replicated by pyrosequencing in an independent data set. This study suggests a link between age at menarche and genome wide DNA methylation, and the difference in results between the two arrays suggests that repetitive element methylation has a role in the association. Epigenetic changes may be modulated by menarcheal age, or the association may be a mirror of other important changes in early life that have a detectable effect on both methylation levels and menarcheal age."

All participants completed a baseline clinical interview in which they reported on their loss of control over drinking. A subsample participated in an ethanol (EtOH) infusion experiment (n = 50). DNA was extracted from saliva samples and assayed on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 DNA Analysis BeadChip.RESULTS: We identified significant associations between loss of control over drinking and DNA methylation at multiple CpG sites. In follow-up analyses of one of our top results, a CpG site near the ALDH1A2 gene, we found that methylation was negatively associated with rate of intoxication and self-reported feelings of intoxication, consistent with the view that DNA methylation at ALDH1A2 may be associated with changes in alcohol metabolism.CONCLUSIONS: While these findings require replication, they provide evidence that DNA methylation at multiple CpG sites is associated with loss of control over drinking. It may be useful to examine DNA methylation patterns using several related phenotypes to establish the biological coherence of results and to help prioritize markers for further study."

DNA array-based studies have reported causative copy number variations (CNVs) in 5-30% of patients with epilepsy with or without co-morbidities. The interpretation of many of the detected CNVs remains challenging. In order to identify CNVs carrying epilepsy-related genes we investigated 43 children with various patterns of epileptic seizures, intellectual disability (ID), and minor dysmorphism, using the Illumina® Infinium Human1M-DuoV1 array. In three patients we found likely causative de novo CNVs, i.e. deletions in 1q41q42.12 (3.4 Mb) and 19p13.2 (834 kb), and a mosaic two-segment duplication in 17p13.2 (218 kb) and 17p13.1 (422 kb). In six additional patients there were aberrations (a deletion in one and duplications in five patients) with uncertain clinical consequences. In total, the finding of causative chromosomal micro-rearrangements in 3 out of 43 patients (7%) and potentially causative CNVs in 6 additional patients (14%) with epilepsy and ID but without major malformations confirms the power of DNA arrays for the detection of new disease-related genetic regions."

A total of 94 azoospermic patients were recruited and classified into three groups: 29 patients presented obstructive azoospermia (OA), 26 displayed non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) and successful retrieval of spermatozoa by testicular sperm extraction (TESE+) and 39 displayed NOA and failure to retrieve spermatozoa by TESE (TESE-). An Illumina Infinium Human Methylation27 BeadChip DNA methylation array was used to establish a testicular DNA methylation pattern for each type of azoospermic patient. The OA and NOA groups were compared in terms of the relative M-value (the log2 ratio between methylated and non-methylated probe intensities) for each CpG site. We observed significantly different DNA methylation profiles for the NOA and OA groups, with differences at over 9000 of the 27 578 CpG sites; 212 CpG sites had a relative M-value &gt;3. The results highlighted 14 testis-specific genes. Patient clustering with respect to these 212 CpG sites corresponded closely to the clinical classification. The DNA methylation patterns showed that in the NOA group, 78 of the 212 CpG sites were hypomethylated and 134 were hypermethylated (relative to the OA group). On the basis of these DNA methylation profiles, azoospermic patients could be classified as OA or NOA by considering the 212 CpG sites with the greatest methylation differences. Furthermore, we identified genes that may provide insight into the mechanism of idiopathic NOA."

Identifying tumors with greater malignant potential can have significant clinical value. This validated genome-wide methylation study comparing Grade I with Grade II and III meningiomas aims to discover genes that are aberrantly methylated in atypical meningiomas.METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed meningioma were identified as part of the Ohio Brain Tumor Study. The Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.) was used to interrogate 27,578 CpG sites in 14,000 genes per sample for a discovery set of 33 samples (3 atypical). To verify the results, the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.) was used to interrogate 450,000 cytosines at CpG loci throughout the genome for a verification set containing 7 replicates (3 atypical), as well as 12 independent samples (6 atypical). A nonparametric Wilcoxon exact test was used to test for difference in methylation between benign and atypical meningiomas in both sets. Heat maps were generated for each set. Methylation results were validated for the 2 probes with the largest difference in methylation intensity by performing Western blot analysis on a set of 20 (10 atypical) samples, including 11 replicates.RESULTS: The discovery array identified 95 probes with differential methylation between benign and atypical meningiomas, creating 2 distinguishable groups corresponding to tumor grade when visually examined on a heat map. The validation array evaluated 87 different probes and showed that 9 probes were differentially methylated. On heat map examination the results of this array also suggested the existence of 2 major groups that corresponded to histological grade. IGF2BP1 and PDCD1, 2 proteins that can increase the malignant potential of tumors, were the 2 probes with the largest difference in intensity, and for both of these the atypical meningiomas had a decreased median production of protein, though this was not statistically significant (p = 0.970 for IGF2BP1 and p = 1 for PDCD1).CONCLUSIONS: A genome-wide methylation analysis of benign and atypical meningiomas identified 9 genes that were reliably differentially methylated, with the strongest difference in IGF2BP1 and PDCD1. The mechanism why increased methylation of these sites is associated with an aggressive phenotype is not evident. Future research may investigate this mechanism, as well as the utility of IGF2BP1 as a marker for pathogenicity in otherwise benign-appearing meningiomas."

As the result, within 286 genes 314 CpG-sites that varied significantly in the DNA methylation level between the tissue samples of carotid (in the area of atherosclerotic plaques and nearby macroscopically intact tissues of the vascular wall) and mammary arteries as well saphenous veins have been identified. The most pronounced differences in the methylation level were registered for CpG-sites of homeobox genes HOXA2 and HOXD4 as well as imprinted gene MEST.

Amplicons were sequenced for five candidate genes: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase 1 and 2 (HMG1, HMG2) and 2.3-squalene epoxidase (SQE) of primary metabolism, and solanidine galactosyltransferase (SGT1), and glucosyltransferase (SGT2) of secondary metabolism. SNPs (n = 337) producing 354 variations were detected within 3.7 kb of sequenced DNA. More polymorphisms were found in introns than exons and in genes of secondary compared to primary metabolism. Although no significant deviation from neutrality was found, dN/dS ratios &lt; 1 and negative values of Tajima's D test suggested purifying selection and genetic hitchhiking in the gene fragments. In addition, patterns of dN/dS ratios across the SGA pathway suggested constraint by natural selection. Comparison of nucleotide diversity estimates and dN/dS ratios showed stronger selective constraints for genes of primary rather than secondary metabolism. SNPs (n = 24) with an exclusive genotype for either phu DH (low SGA) or chc 80-1 (high SGA) were identified for HMG2, SQE, SGT1 and SGT2. The SolCAP 8303 Illumina Potato SNP chip genotyping revealed eight informative SNPs on six pseudochromosomes, with homozygous and heterozygous genotypes that discriminated high, intermediate and low levels of SGA accumulation.

By employing DNA methylation profiling using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27, we analyzed the epigenetic characteristics of the sarcomas including CCSK, RTK, and ESFT in comparison with those of the non-neoplastic kidney (NK), and these tumors exhibited distinct DNA methylation profiles in a tumor-type-specific manner. CCSK is the most frequently hypermethylated, but least frequently hypomethylated, at CpG sites among these sarcomas, and exhibited 490 hypermethylated and 46 hypomethylated CpG sites in compared with NK. We further validated the results by MassARRAY, and revealed that a combination of four genes was sufficient for the DNA methylation profile-based differentiation of these tumors by clustering analysis. Furthermore, THBS1 CpG sites were found to be specifically hypermethylated in CCSK and, thus, the DNA methylation status of these THBS1 sites alone was sufficient for the distinction of CCSK from other pediatric renal tumors, including Wilms' tumor and CMN. Moreover, combined bisulfite restriction analysis could be applied for the detection of hypermethylation of a THBS1 CpG site. Besides the biological significance in the pathogenesis, the DNA methylation profile should be useful for the differential diagnosis of pediatric renal tumors."

Although chromosomal errors are observed in &gt;50%, causes of karyotypically normal losses are poorly understood. DNA methylation undergoes reprogramming during development and must be appropriately set to maintain a healthy pregnancy. We hypothesize that aberrant DNA methylation may cause karyotypically normal miscarriage, particularly among women experiencing recurrent miscarriage (RM). DNA methylation in first-trimester chorionic villi was assessed in chromosomally normal miscarriages from women with RM (N = 33) or isolated miscarriage (M; N = 21) and elective terminations (TA; N = 16). Differentially methylated candidate loci were identified using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array. Follow-up bisulfite pyrosequencing at promoter regions showed an increase in methylation in M compared with TA at cytochrome P450, subfamily 1A, polypeptide 2 (CYP1A2; P = 0.002) and RM compared with TA at AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (P = 0.02), and a decrease in RM and M compared with TA at defensin β 1 (DEFB1; P = 0.008). Gene ontology analysis showed an enrichment of imprinted genes (P = 9.53 × 10(-10)) and genes previously associated with RM (P = 9.51 × 10(-6)). An increase of outliers at seven imprinted loci was observed in RM (3.9%) compared with M (0%) and TA (0.9%) (P = 0.02), with increased average methylation at H19/IGF2 ICR1 in M samples (P &lt; 0.0001). Altered DNA methylation in the placenta at specific loci, and global dysregulation in specific cases, may contribute to or be a consequence of poor placental function in karyotypically normal miscarriage."

An Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip was used to analyze DNA methylation alterations in 27,578 CpG loci at three consecutive time points over an 80-day (d) transformation period.RESULTS: The mean β value for semitransformed human mammary epithelial cells CpG loci (0.245) was much greater than for either THMEC-40d (0.055) or THMEC-80d (0.066), indicating a large loss of methylation after neoplastic induction. In addition, 54% of CpG loci were hypermethylated during the THMEC-40d to THMEC-80d transition. We observed that the CpG loci exhibiting DNA methylation changes during early oncogenesis were enriched for biological functions like cellular movement; this was distinctly different than in the later, more progressive stages of the transformation process enriched for processes involving differentiation.CONCLUSION: The timing of major methylomic changes may be important in directing the cell toward a more cancerous phenotype. In addition, gene-specific hypermethylation appears to silence developmentally related genes, leading to dedifferentiation."

HIV-associated lymphomas frequently have features such as extranodal involvement, decreased responses to standard chemotherapy, and high relapse rates, which indicate a poor prognosis. General pathological features do not clearly differentiate HIV-associated lymphomas from non-HIV lymphomas.METHODS: To investigate the features of HIV-associated lymphomas, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of HIV and non-HIV lymphomas using Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I and Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip microarrays. DNA methylation profiles in HIV-associated and non-HIV lymphomas were characterized using unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses.RESULTS: The analyses of promoter regions revealed unique DNA methylation profiles in HIV-associated lymphomas, suggesting profile differences compared with non-HIV lymphomas, which implies specific gene regulation in HIV-associated lymphoma involving DNA methylation. Based on HumanMethylation450 BeadChip data, 2541 target sites were selected as differing significantly in comparisons between HIV-associated and non-HIV-associated lymphomas using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test (P &lt;0.05) and Δβ values more than 0.30. Recurrent cases of HIV-associated lymphoma had different profiles compared with nonrecurrent HIV lymphomas.CONCLUSION: DNA methylation profiling indicated that 2541 target sites differed significantly in HIV-associated lymphoma, which may partly explain the poor prognosis. Our data indicate that the methylation profiles of target genes have potential in elucidating HIV-associated lymphomagenesis and can serve as new prognostic markers."

The distribution of variants within families or populations can facilitate identification of the genetic factors of disease. Illumina's panel of genotyping BeadChips allows investigators to genotype thousands or millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or to analyze other genomic variants, such as copy number, across a large number of DNA samples. These SNPs can be spread throughout the genome or targeted in specific regions in order to maximize potential discovery. The Infinium assay has been optimized to yield high-quality, accurate results quickly. With proper setup, a single technician can process from a few hundred to over a thousand DNA samples per week, depending on the type of array. This assay guides users through every step, starting with genomic DNA and ending with the scanning of the array. Using propriety reagents, samples are amplified, fragmented, precipitated, resuspended, hybridized to the chip, extended by a single base, stained, and scanned on either an iScan or Hi Scan high-resolution optical imaging system. One overnight step is required to amplify the DNA. The DNA is denatured and isothermally amplified by whole-genome amplification; therefore, no PCR is required. Samples are hybridized to the arrays during a second overnight step. By the third day, the samples are ready to be scanned and analyzed. Amplified DNA may be stockpiled in large quantities, allowing bead arrays to be processed every day of the week, thereby maximizing throughput."
"24297551";"Infinium";"Infinium";"Pac Symp Biocomput";0;2013;"Imputation-based assessment of next generation rare exome variant arrays.";"A striking finding from recent large-scale sequencing efforts is that the vast majority of variants in the human genome are rare and found within single populations or lineages. These observations hold important implications for the design of the next round of disease variant discovery efforts-if genetic variants that influence disease risk follow the same trend, then we expect to see population-specific disease associations that require large sample sizes for detection. To address this challenge, and due to the still prohibitive cost of sequencing large cohorts, researchers have developed a new generation of low-cost genotyping arrays that assay rare variation previously identified from large exome sequencing studies. Genotyping approaches rely not only on directly observing variants, but also on phasing and imputation methods that use publicly available reference panels to infer unobserved variants in a study cohort. Rare variant exome arrays are intentionally enriched for variants likely to be disease causing, and here we assay the ability of the first commercially available rare exome variant array (the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip) to also tag other potentially damaging variants not molecularly assayed. Using full sequence data from chromosome 22 from the phase I 1000 Genomes Project, we evaluate three methods for imputation (BEAGLE, MaCH-Admix, and SHAPEIT2/IMPUTE2) with the rare exome variant array under varied study panel sizes, reference panel sizes, and LD structures via population differences. We find that imputation is more accurate across both the genome and exome for common variant arrays than the next generation array for all allele frequencies, including rare alleles. We also find that imputation is the least accurate in African populations, and accuracy is substantially improved for rare variants when the same population is included in the reference panel. Depending on the goals of GWAS researchers, our results will aid budget decisions by helping determine whether money is best spent sequencing the genomes of smaller sample sizes, genotyping larger sample sizes with rare and/or common variant arrays and imputing SNPs, or some combination of the two."

Maternal UPD for chromosome 7 (matUPD7) results in Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) with typical features and growth retardation, but no gene has been conclusively implicated in SRS. In order to identify novel DMRs and putative imprinted genes on chromosome 7, we analyzed eight matUPD7 patients, a segmental matUPD7q31-qter, a rare patUPD7 case and ten controls on the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip with 30 017 CpG methylation probes for chromosome 7. Genome-scale analysis showed highly significant clustering of DMRs only on chromosome 7, including the known imprinted loci GRB10, SGCE/PEG10, and PEG/MEST. We found ten novel DMRs on chromosome 7, two DMRs for the predicted imprinted genes HOXA4 and GLI3 and one for the disputed imprinted gene PON1. Quantitative RT-PCR on blood RNA samples comparing matUPD7, patUPD7, and controls showed differential expression for three genes with novel DMRs, HOXA4, GLI3, and SVOPL. Allele specific expression analysis confirmed maternal only expression of SVOPL and imprinting of HOXA4 was supported by monoallelic expression. These results present the first comprehensive map of parent-of-origin specific DMRs on human chromosome 7, suggesting many new imprinted sites."

However, linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping studies have yet to identify replicated susceptibility loci.METHODS: We analyzed 1,422 LD-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 83 genes to test single-marker and locus-wide evidence of association with bipolar disorder in the NIMH Genetics Initiative bipolar pedigrees and the Portuguese Island Collection (PIC) (N = 1,093 in 528 informative pairs). Both studies previously demonstrated significant evidence of linkage to 6q. SNPs were genotyped using an Illumina iSelect genotyping array which employs the Infinium assay. Evidence of single-marker association was assessed using the generalized disequilibrium test (GDT). Empirical estimates of gene-wide significance were obtained by permutation (via 100,000 gene-dropping simulations) of Fisher's combined test of P-values for each locus.RESULTS: No single variant yielded significant experiment-wide evidence of association, for either the combined sample or in each subsample. Our gene-dropping simulations identified nominally significant gene-wide associations with multiple loci, of which NT5DC1 in the NIMH subsample and CCNC in the PIC were the strongest candidates. However, no one gene consistently exceeded empirical significance criteria in both independent samples or survived Bonferroni correction for the number of genes tested.CONCLUSIONS: Using a gene-based approach to family-based association, we identified gene-wide associations with several genes, though no single locus was significantly associated with bipolar disorder in both cohorts. This suggests that chromosome 6q may harbor multiple susceptibility loci or that complex patterns of LD in this region may confound approaches based on common SNPs. Published 2013.

We aim to investigate the influence of variants and associated methylation in the GSTM gene cluster with changes in lung function growth during adolescence.METHODS: Growth in forced expiratory volume (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and change in FEV1/FVC ratio measures were obtained from children in the Isle of Wight birth cohort at ages 10 and 18. Illumina GoldenGate assays were used to genotype 10 tagging polymorphisms from GSTM2 (rs574344 and rs12024479), GSTM3 (rs1537236, rs7483, and rs10735234), GSTM4 (rs668413, rs560018, and rs506008), and GSTM5 (rs929166 and rs11807) genes. Diplotypes were generated in the software Phase 3.0.2. DNA methylation was measured in over 450,000 CpG sites using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina 450K) in a subsample of 245 18-year olds from the Isle of Wight birth cohort. Gender, age, in utero smoke exposure, secondhand smoke exposure (SHS), and current smoking status were assessed via questionnaire; smoke exposures were validated with urine cotinine. We used linear mixed models to estimate the effect of GSTM diplotypes on lung function across time and examine interactions with tobacco smoke.RESULTS: 1,121 (77%) out of 1,456 children had information on lung function at ages 10 or 18. After adjustment for false discovery rate, one diplotype in GSTM3 had a detrimental effect on changes in FEV1 (p=0.03), and another diplotype in GSTM3 reduced FVC (p=0.02) over time. No significant interactions with smoking were identified. SHS significantly modified the relationship between diplotypes and methylation levels in one GSTM2 CpG site; however, this site did not predict lung function outcomes at age 18. Joint effects of GSTM loci and CpG sites located within these loci on adolescent lung growth were detected.CONCLUSIONS: Diplotypes within GSTM2-5 genes are associated with lung function growth across adolescence, but do not appear to modify the effect of tobacco smoke exposures on adolescent lung growth. Interactions between DNA methylation and diplotypes should be taken into account to gain further understanding on lung function in adolescence."

Some patients experience adverse events, such as BP-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). DNA methylation plays a key role in gene regulation in many tissues, but its involvement in bone homeostasis is not well characterized, and no information is available regarding altered methylation in BRONJ. Using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip assay, we performed an epigenome-wide association study in peripheral blood samples from 68 patients treated with nitrogenous BP, including 35 with BRONJ. Analysis of the estimated cumulative BP exposure distribution indicated that the exposure of the case group to BP was slightly higher than that of the control group; more severely affected cases (i.e., with BRONJ in both mandible and maxilla) were significantly more exposed to BP than were those with BRONJ only in the mandible or maxilla (one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, p=0.002). Logistic regression analysis confirmed the positive association between cumulative bisphosphonates exposure and risk of BRONJ (OR 1.015 per mg of cumulative exposure, 95% CI 1.004-1.032, p=0.036). Although no statistically significant differences were observed between case and control groups, methylation levels of probes mapping on three genes, ERCC8, LEPREL1 and SDC2, were strongly associated with cumulative BP exposure levels (p&lt;1.31E-007). Enrichment analysis, combining differentially methylated genes with genes involved in the mevalonate pathway, showed that BP treatment can affect the methylation pattern of genes involved in extracellular matrix organization and inflammatory responses, leading to more frequent adverse effects such as BRONJ. Differences in DNA methylation induced by BP treatment could be involved in the pathogenesis of the bone lesion."

While loss of imprinting (LOI) has been reported for two genes in prostate cancer (IGF2 and TFPI2), disease-related changes in methylation across all imprinted gene regions has not been investigated.METHODS: Using an Illumina Infinium Methylation Assay, we analyzed methylation of 396 CpG sites in the promoter regions of 56 genes in a pooled sample of 12 pairs of prostate tumor and adjacent normal tissue. Selected LOI identified from the array was validated using the Sequenom EpiTYPER assay for individual samples and further confirmed by expression data from publicly available datasets.RESULTS: Methylation significantly increased in 52 sites and significantly decreased in 17 sites across 28 unique genes (P &lt; 0.05), and the strongest evidence for loss of imprinting was demonstrated in tumor suppressor genes DLK1, PLAGL1, SLC22A18, TP73, and WT1. Differential expression of these five genes in prostate tumor versus normal tissue using array data from a publicly available database were consistent with the observed LOI patterns, and WT1 hypermethylation was confirmed using quantitative DNA methylation analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings suggest a more widespread dysregulation of genetic imprinting in prostate cancer than previously reported and warrant further investigation."

Numerous differences between the extraembryonic tissues with diploid and aneuploid karyotypes were observed. The extraembryonic mesoderm of embryos with trisomy 16 appeared to be less methylated compared to the diploid tissue, whereas the cytotrophoblast of aneuploid embryos was hypermethylated. The presence of the supernumerary chromosome was shown to influence the epigenetic profile of the genome changing the level of methylation of CpG sites of all chromosomes. However, the biggest number of differentially methylated loci was found on the chromosome 16. Besides, more often the epimutations were tissue-specific. The hypomethylated genes in both tissues belong to the groups of genes responsible for different metabolic processes, whereas the hypermethylated genes control the processes of development, cell adhesion, immune response, and response to stimulus."

The methylation status of circulating DNA might serve as a potential biomarker for cancers.METHODS: Six early stage HCC patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and six age-matched healthy controls were selected for genome-scale DNA methylation screening of serum by Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip. The chosen methylation sites were reassessed by bisulfite sequencing in four healthy controls and four early stage HCC patients with chronic HBV infection and were used for bead array screening. Another 27 healthy controls and 31 early stage HCC patients with chronic HBV infection were also chosen for further bisulfite sequencing validation.RESULTS: Whole-genome methylation was significantly lower in serum from HCC patients than in that from healthy controls. After bioinformatics analysis, methylation at DBX2 and Thy-1 membrane glycoprotein (THY1) was reassessed by bisulfite sequencing. The correlation coefficients of DBX2 and THY1 between the Illumina 450 BeadChip and bisulfite sequencing were respectively 0.9145 and 0.8232. Twenty-seven healthy controls and 31 early stage HCC patients with chronic HBV infection were chosen for further validation. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of DBX2 for differentiating healthy controls and early stage HCC were 88.89 and 87.10 % and of THY1 were 85.19 and 80.65 %.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that the 450K BeadChip is a useful tool for whole-genome serum DNA methylation screening of HCC, and some HCC-related DNA methylation sites were screened."

To clarify the potential contribution of altered DNA methylation in the development and/or progression of MCL, we performed genome-wide methylation profiling of a large cohort of primary MCL tumors (n = 132), MCL cell lines (n = 6) and normal lymphoid tissue samples (n = 31), using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. DNA methylation was compared to gene expression, chromosomal alterations and clinicopathological parameters. Primary MCL displayed a heterogeneous methylation pattern dominated by DNA hypomethylation when compared to normal lymphoid samples. A total of 454 hypermethylated and 875 hypomethylated genes were identified as differentially methylated in at least 10% of primary MCL. Annotation analysis of hypermethylated genes recognized WNT pathway inhibitors and several tumor suppressor genes as frequently methylated, and a substantial fraction of these genes (22%) showed a significant downregulation of their transcriptional levels. Furthermore, we identified a subset of tumors with extensive CpG methylation that had an increased proliferation signature, higher number of chromosomal alterations and poor prognosis. Our results suggest that a subset of MCL displays a dysregulation of DNA methylation characterized by the accumulation of CpG hypermethylation highly associated with increased proliferation that may influence the clinical behavior of the tumors."

Two affected individuals underwent three-year follow-ups to analyze the course of the disease. Venous blood was collected from family members and genomic DNA was extracted. A whole genome linkage analysis of 11 family members was performed using an Illumina Infinium Human Linkage-12 panel. All exons and exon-intron boundaries of guanylate cyclase 2D gene (GUCY2D) were sequenced for familial gene mutation.RESULTS: Decreased visual acuity and photophobia usually commenced in early childhood in these patients. The family demonstrated an age-dependent increase in macular abnormalities with progressive development of geographic atrophy. Electrophysiological testing revealed a marked loss of cone function. Initially, a genome-wide linkage analysis mapped the disease to chromosome 17 (1-36 cM), with a maximum LOD score of 1.505. Sequence analysis of the GUCY2D gene in the linkage interval detected a recurrent heterozygous mutation, c.2513G &gt; C (p.R838P). This mutation appeared in all seven patients with ADCRD but did not appear in any of the four unaffected family members.CONCLUSIONS: A missense mutation in the GUCY2D gene caused ADCRD in this family. Clinical follow-up of this family with a typical CRD phenotype revealed disease progression during the time period."

The ring-shaped sSMCs were derived from chromosomes 11, 12 and X as well as a fourth, unidentified chromosome. In interphase nuclei of epithelial cells from the urinary tract and buccal mucosa, the presence of the r(11), r(12) and r(X) was confirmed by FISH. Using Illumina Infinium 317K SNP-arrays, we detected 3 copies of the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes 11, 12 and X. The r(X) was present in 84-89% of cells in the various tissues examined, lacks the XIST gene, but contains FAM123B, a potential dosage-sensitive candidate gene for congenital cardiac abnormalities, and ARHGEF9, a candidate gene for intellectual disability. ARHGEF9 encodes collybistin (CB), which is required for localization of the inhibitory receptor-anchoring protein gephyrin and for formation and maintenance of postsynaptic GABAA and glycine receptors. We propose that the 2-fold increase in dosage of ARHGEF9 disturbs the stoichiometry of CB with its interacting proteins at inhibitory postsynapses. SNP alleles and short tandem repeat markers on the r(11) and r(X) were compatible with a maternal origin of both sSMCs through a meiosis II error. The sSMCs may have resulted from predivision chromatid nondisjunction, leading to anaphase lagging, followed by incomplete degradation of the supernumerary chromosomes."

A preeclampsia genome-wide linkage scan in norwegian families.";"INTRODUCTION: Several maternal susceptibility loci for preeclampsia (PE) have been discovered amongst Icelandic, Australian/New Zealand, Dutch and Finnish family cohorts, implicating locus heterogeneity. Through candidate gene studies, allele-specific heterogeneity in different populations is also evident. It is therefore likely that numerous population specific PE susceptibility variants exist, differing in their effect size. Despite on-going efforts to identify susceptibility genes for PE, the causal genetic variants still remain obscure.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to interrogate the genetic architecture of PE susceptibility by performing a genome-wide linkage scan in a novel familial cohort from Norway.METHODS: A total of 480 DNA samples from The Norwegian PE Family Biobank were genotyped at Genomic Core Facility at NTNU. Genome-wide genotyping was performed with the Infinium HumanExome BeadChip (&gt;240,000 markers) (Illumina, USA) that delivers focused coverage of exonic regions of the human genome.RESULTS: A total of 137 families are represented with 222 women with a valid PE diagnosis (SBP⩾140mmHg DBP⩾90mmHg, ⩾2 measurements at least 4h apart with documented proteinuria at ⩾2 occasions occurring after 20weeks of pregnancy), 44 with self-reported PE and 72 women with a healthy pregnancy. The genotyping has just recently been completed with an average call rate of 99.96%. Data and statistical analysis is now underway using MERLIN, R and SOLAR. A description of the Norwegian PE familial cohort plus preliminary results will be presented at the Congress.CONCLUSION: To our knowledge this is the first SNP-based genome-wide linkage study on PE, and the first performed in a novel Norwegian PE family cohort. By using an approach focusing on functionally relevant markers we anticipate the identification of susceptibility loci that are of substantial importance for disease development."

Plasma β2 -GPI levels have a significant genetic component (heritability of ~ 80%).OBJECTIVES: To present the results of a genome-wide association study for plasma β2 -GPI levels in a set of extended pedigrees from the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia (GAIT) Project.METHODS: A total of 306 individuals for whom β2 -GPI plasma measurements were available were typed for 307,984 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the Infinium 317k Beadchip (Illumina). Association with the β2 -GPI phenotype was investigated through variance component analysis, and the most significant results were followed up for association with coronary artery disease (CAD) in an independent in silico analysis involving 5765 CAD cases from the PROCARDIS Project and 7264 controls from the PROCARDIS Project and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) collection.RESULTS: After correction for multiple testing, three SNPs located in/around two genes (ELF5 and SCUBE2) reached genome-wide significance. Moreover, an SNP in the APOH gene showed suggestive association with the β2 -GPI phenotype. Some of the identified genes are plausible biological candidates, as they are actually or potentially involved in inflammatory processes.CONCLUSIONS: Our results represent a first step towards identifying common variants reflecting the genetic architecture influencing plasma β2 -GPI levels, and warrant further validation by functional experiments, as the functions of some of the discovered loci are still unknown."

Maternal smoking is a major risk factor for multiple adverse health outcomes in children, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear.OBJECTIVE: We investigated epigenome-wide methylation in cord blood of newborns in relation to maternal smoking during pregnancy.METHODS: We examined maternal plasma cotinine (an objective biomarker of smoking) measured during pregnancy in relation to DNA methylation at 473,844 CpG sites (CpGs) in 1,062 newborn cord blood samples from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K).RESULTS: We found differential DNA methylation at epigenome-wide statistical significance (p-value &lt; 1.06 × 10-7) for 26 CpGs mapped to 10 genes. We replicated findings for CpGs in AHRR, CYP1A1, and GFI1 at strict Bonferroni-corrected statistical significance in a U.S. birth cohort. AHRR and CYP1A1 play a key role in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway, which mediates the detoxification of the components of tobacco smoke. GFI1 is involved in diverse developmental processes but has not previously been implicated in responses to tobacco smoke.CONCLUSIONS: We identified a set of genes with methylation changes present at birth in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. This is the first study of differential methylation across the genome in relation to maternal smoking during pregnancy using the 450K platform. Our findings implicate epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of the adverse health outcomes associated with this important in utero exposure."

However, a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that probes come in two different designs, characterized by widely different DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to adjust for the two different probe designs.RESULTS: Here we propose a novel model-based intra-array normalization strategy for 450 k data, called BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation), to adjust the beta-values of type2 design probes into a statistical distribution characteristic of type1 probes. The strategy involves application of a three-state beta-mixture model to assign probes to methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into quantiles and finally a methylation-dependent dilation transformation to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate our method on cell-line data, fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded tumour tissue samples and demonstrate that BMIQ compares favourably with two competing methods. Specifically, we show that BMIQ improves the robustness of the normalization procedure, reduces the technical variation and bias of type2 probe values and successfully eliminates the type1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type2 probes.

The Illumina Infinium(®) Human Methylation 450K BeadChip (Illumina Inc., CA, USA) allows the simultaneous quantitative monitoring of more than 480,000 CpG positions, enabling large-scale epigenotyping studies. However, the assay combines two different assay chemistries, which may cause a bias in the analysis if all signals are merged as a unique source of methylation measurement.MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: We confirm in three 450K data sets that Infinium I signals are more stable and cover a wider dynamic range of methylation values than Infinium II signals. We evaluated the methylation profile of Infinium I and II probes obtained with different normalization protocols and compared these results with the methylation values of a subset of CpGs analyzed by pyrosequencing.RESULTS: We developed a subset quantile normalization approach for the processing of 450K BeadChips. The Infinium I signals were used as 'anchors' to normalize Infinium II signals at the level of probe coverage categories. Our normalization approach outperformed alternative normalization or correction approaches in terms of bias correction and methylation signal estimation. We further implemented a complete preprocessing protocol that solves most of the issues currently raised by 450K array users.CONCLUSION: We developed a complete preprocessing pipeline for 450K BeadChip data using an original subset quantile normalization approach that performs both sample normalization and efficient Infinium I/II shift correction.

Clinical and molecular evidence indicates that lung adenocarcinoma is a heterogeneous disease, which has important implications for treatment. Here we performed genome-scale DNA methylation profiling using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 platform on 59 matched lung adenocarcinoma/non-tumor lung pairs, with genome-scale verification on an independent set of tissues. We identified 766 genes showing altered DNA methylation between tumors and non-tumor lung. By integrating DNA methylation and mRNA expression data, we identified 164 hypermethylated genes showing concurrent down-regulation, and 57 hypomethylated genes showing increased expression. Integrated pathways analysis indicates that these genes are involved in cell differentiation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, RAS and WNT signaling pathways, and cell cycle regulation, among others. Comparison of DNA methylation profiles between lung adenocarcinomas of current and never-smokers showed modest differences, identifying only LGALS4 as significantly hypermethylated and down-regulated in smokers. LGALS4, encoding a galactoside-binding protein involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, was recently shown to be a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer. Unsupervised analysis of the DNA methylation data identified two tumor subgroups, one of which showed increased DNA methylation and was significantly associated with KRAS mutation and to a lesser extent, with smoking. Our analysis lays the groundwork for further molecular studies of lung adenocarcinoma by identifying novel epigenetically deregulated genes potentially involved in lung adenocarcinoma development/progression, and by describing an epigenetic subgroup of lung adenocarcinoma associated with characteristic molecular alterations."

The Illumina GoldenGate® assay was then used to validate a subset of 144 SNPs with a range of characteristics, using a set of 160 apple accessions. This validation assay enabled fine-tuning of the final subset of SNPs for the Illumina Infinium® II system. The set of stringent filtering criteria developed allowed choice of a set of SNPs that not only exhibited an even distribution across the apple genome and a range of minor allele frequencies to ensure utility across germplasm, but also were located in putative exonic regions to maximize genotyping success rate. A total of 7867 apple SNPs was established for the IRSC apple 8K SNP array v1, of which 5554 were polymorphic after evaluation in segregating families and a germplasm collection. This publicly available genomics resource will provide an unprecedented resolution of SNP haplotypes, which will enable marker-locus-trait association discovery, description of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits, investigation of genetic variation (neutral and functional), and genomic selection in apple."

Batsch] and related Prunus species, only a limited number of genetic markers, including simple sequence repeats (SSRs), have been available to date. To address this need, an international consortium (The International Peach SNP Consortium; IPSC) has pursued a coordinated effort to perform genome-scale SNP discovery in peach using next generation sequencing platforms to develop and characterize a high-throughput Illumina Infinium® SNP genotyping array platform. We performed whole genome re-sequencing of 56 peach breeding accessions using the Illumina and Roche/454 sequencing technologies. Polymorphism detection algorithms identified a total of 1,022,354 SNPs. Validation with the Illumina GoldenGate® assay was performed on a subset of the predicted SNPs, verifying ∼75% of genic (exonic and intronic) SNPs, whereas only about a third of intergenic SNPs were verified. Conservative filtering was applied to arrive at a set of 8,144 SNPs that were included on the IPSC peach SNP array v1, distributed over all eight peach chromosomes with an average spacing of 26.7 kb between SNPs. Use of this platform to screen a total of 709 accessions of peach in two separate evaluation panels identified a total of 6,869 (84.3%) polymorphic SNPs.The almost 7,000 SNPs verified as polymorphic through extensive empirical evaluation represent an excellent source of markers for future studies in genetic relatedness, genetic mapping, and dissecting the genetic architecture of complex agricultural traits. The IPSC peach SNP array v1 is commercially available and we expect that it will be used worldwide for genetic studies in peach and related stone fruit and nut species."

The VIVA LA FAMILIA Study was designed to genetically map childhood obesity and associated biological processes in the Hispanic population. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) entailed genotyping 1.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Illumina Infinium technology in 815 children. Measured genotype analysis was performed between genetic markers and obesity-related traits i.e., anthropometry, body composition, growth, metabolites, hormones, inflammation, diet, energy expenditure, substrate utilization and physical activity. Identified genome-wide significant loci: 1) corroborated genes implicated in other studies (MTNR1B, ZNF259/APOA5, XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2), DARC, CCR3, ABO); 2) localized novel genes in plausible biological pathways (PCSK2, ARHGAP11A, CHRNA3); and 3) revealed novel genes with unknown function in obesity pathogenesis (MATK, COL4A1). Salient findings include a nonsynonymous SNP (rs1056513) in INADL (p = 1.2E-07) for weight; an intronic variant in MTNR1B associated with fasting glucose (p = 3.7E-08); variants in the APOA5-ZNF259 region associated with triglycerides (p = 2.5-4.8E-08); an intronic variant in PCSK2 associated with total antioxidants (p = 7.6E-08); a block of 23 SNPs in XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2) associated with serum TSH (p = 5.5E-08 to 1.0E-09); a nonsynonymous SNP (p = 1.3E-21), an intronic SNP (p = 3.6E-13) in DARC identified for MCP-1; an intronic variant in ARHGAP11A associated with sleep duration (p = 5.0E-08); and, after adjusting for body weight, variants in MATK for total energy expenditure (p = 2.7E-08) and in CHRNA3 for sleeping energy expenditure (p = 6.0E-08).

This study investigates human postmortem frontal cortex genome-wide DNA methylation profiles between 12 LOAD and 12 cognitively normal age- and gender-matched subjects. Quantitative DNA methylation is determined at 27,578 CpG sites spanning 14,475 genes via the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray. Data are analyzed using parallel linear models adjusting for age and gender with empirical Bayes standard error methods. Gene-specific technical and functional validation is performed on an additional 13 matched pair samples, encompassing a wider age range. Analysis reveals 948 CpG sites representing 918 unique genes as potentially associated with LOAD disease status pending confirmation in additional study populations. Across these 948 sites the subtle mean methylation difference between cases and controls is 2.9%. The CpG site with a minimum false discovery rate located in the promoter of the gene Transmembrane Protein 59 (TMEM59) is 7.3% hypomethylated in cases. Methylation at this site is functionally associated with tissue RNA and protein levels of the TMEM59 gene product. The TMEM59 gene identified from our discovery approach was recently implicated in amyloid-β protein precursor post-translational processing, supporting a role for epigenetic change in LOAD pathology. This study demonstrates widespread, modest discordant DNA methylation in LOAD-diseased tissue independent from DNA methylation changes with age. Identification of epigenetic biomarkers of LOAD risk may allow for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets."

Recent studies in anaplastic glioma suggest a prognostic value for MGMT methylation. Investigation of pathogenetic and epigenetic features of this intriguingly distinct behavior requires accurate MGMT classification to assess high throughput molecular databases. Promoter methylation-mediated gene silencing is strongly dependent on the location of the methylated CpGs, complicating classification. Using the HumanMethylation450 (HM-450K) BeadChip interrogating 176 CpGs annotated for the MGMT gene, with 14 located in the promoter, two distinct regions in the CpG island of the promoter were identified with high importance for gene silencing and outcome prediction. A logistic regression model (MGMT-STP27) comprising probes cg12434587 [corrected] and cg12981137 provided good classification properties and prognostic value (kappa = 0.85; log-rank p &lt; 0.001) using a training-set of 63 glioblastomas from homogenously treated patients, for whom MGMT methylation was previously shown to be predictive for outcome based on classification by methylation-specific PCR. MGMT-STP27 was successfully validated in an independent cohort of chemo-radiotherapy-treated glioblastoma patients (n = 50; kappa = 0.88; outcome, log-rank p &lt; 0.001). Lower prevalence of MGMT methylation among CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) positive tumors was found in glioblastomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas than in low grade and anaplastic glioma cohorts, while in CIMP-negative gliomas MGMT was classified as methylated in approximately 50 % regardless of tumor grade. The proposed MGMT-STP27 prediction model allows mining of datasets derived on the HM-450K or HM-27K BeadChip to explore effects of distinct epigenetic context of MGMT methylation suspected to modulate treatment resistance in different tumor types."

To this aim, (1) we evaluated the DNA methylation from peripheral leukocytes of 21 female centenarians, their 21 female offspring, 21 offspring of both non-long-lived parents, and 21 young women through ELISA assay, pyrosequencing analysis of Alu sequences, and quantification of methylation in CpG repeats outside CpG islands; (2) we compared the DNA methylation profiles of these populations through Infinium array for genome-wide CpG methylation analysis. We observed an age-related decrease in global DNA methylation and a delay of this process in centenarians' offspring. Interestingly, literature data suggest a link between the loss of DNA methylation observed during aging and the development of age-associated diseases. Genome-wide methylation analysis evidenced DNA methylation profiles specific for aging and longevity: (1) aging-associated DNA hypermethylation occurs predominantly in genes involved in the development of anatomical structures, organs, and multicellular organisms and in the regulation of transcription; (2) genes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis, metabolism, and control of signal transmission are differently methylated between centenarians' offspring and offspring of both non-long-lived parents, hypothesizing a role for these genes in human longevity. Our results suggest that a better preservation of DNA methylation status, a slower cell growing/metabolism, and a better control in signal transmission through epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in the process of human longevity. These data fit well with the observations related to the beneficial effects of mild hypothyroidism and insulin-like growth factor I system impairment on the modulation of human lifespan."

DNA methylation levels at 4830 CpG sites were already altered in N samples compared with C samples. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on DNA methylation levels at the 801 CpG sites, where DNA methylation alterations had occurred in N samples and were inherited by and strengthened in T samples, clustered clear cell RCCs into Cluster A (n = 90) and Cluster B (n = 14). Clinicopathologically aggressive tumors were accumulated in Cluster B, and the cancer-free and overall survival rates of patients in this cluster were significantly lower than those of patients in Cluster A. Clear cell RCCs in Cluster B were characterized by accumulation of DNA hypermethylation on CpG islands and considered to be CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-positive cancers. DNA hypermethylation of the CpG sites on the FAM150A, GRM6, ZNF540, ZFP42, ZNF154, RIMS4, PCDHAC1, KHDRBS2, ASCL2, KCNQ1, PRAC, WNT3A, TRH, FAM78A, ZNF671, SLC13A5 and NKX6-2 genes became hallmarks of CIMP in RCCs. On the other hand, Cluster A was characterized by genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. These data indicated that DNA methylation alterations at precancerous stages may determine tumor aggressiveness and patient outcome. Accumulation of DNA hypermethylation on CpG islands and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation may each underlie distinct pathways of renal carcinogenesis."

The purpose of the current study was to discover novel genome-wide aberrant DNA methylation patterns in HCC tumors that are predominantly HCV-related. Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip arrays were used to examine genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in 66 pairs of HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues. After Bonferroni adjustment, a total of 130,512 CpG sites significantly differed in methylation level in tumor compared with non-tumor tissues, with 28,017 CpG sites hypermethylated and 102,495 hypomethylated in tumor tissues. Absolute tumor/non-tumor methylation differences ≥ 20% were found in 24.9% of the hypermethylated and 43.1% of the hypomethylated CpG sites; almost 10,000 CpG sites have ≥ 30% DNA methylation differences. Most (60.1%) significantly hypermethylated CpG sites are located in CpG islands, with 21.6% in CpG shores and 3.6% in shelves. In contrast, only a small proportion (8.2%) of significantly hypomethylated CpG sites are situated in islands, while most are found in open sea (60.2%), shore (17.3%) or shelf (14.3%) regions. A total of 2,568 significant CpG sites (2,441 hypermethylated and 127 hypomethylated) covering 589 genes are located within 684 differentially methylated regions defined as regions with at least two significant CpG sites displaying &gt; 20% methylation differences in the same direction within 250-bp. The top 500 significant CpG sites can significantly distinguish HCC tumor from adjacent tissues with one misclassification. Within adjacent non-tumor tissues, we also identified 75 CpG sites significantly associated with gender, 228 with HCV infection, 17,207 with cirrhosis, and 56 with both HCV infection and cirrhosis after multiple comparisons adjustment. Aberrant DNA methylation profiles across the genome were identified in tumor tissues from US HCC cases that are predominantly related to HCV infection. These results demonstrate the significance of aberrant DNA methylation in HCC tumorigenesis."

Recently, researchers' attention has turn toward epigenetic markers of aging. Using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip on whole blood DNA from a small cohort of 64 subjects of different ages, we identified 3 regions, the CpG islands of ELOVL2, FHL2, and PENK genes, whose methylation level strongly correlates with age. These results were confirmed by the Sequenom's EpiTYPER assay on a larger cohort of 501 subjects from 9 to 99 years, including 7 cord blood samples. Among the 3 genes, ELOVL2 shows a progressive increase in methylation that begins since the very first stage of life (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.92) and appears to be a very promising biomarker of aging."

To validate the Infinium 8303 Potato Array, we developed linkage maps from two diploid populations (DRH and D84) and compared these maps with the assembled potato genome sequence. Both populations used the doubled monoploid reference genotype DM1-3 516 R44 as the female parent but had different heterozygous diploid male parents (RH89-039-16 and 84SD22). Over 4,400 markers were mapped (1,960 in DRH and 2,454 in D84, 787 in common) resulting in map sizes of 965 (DRH) and 792 (D84) cM, covering 87% (DRH) and 88% (D84) of genome sequence length. Of the mapped markers, 33.5% were in candidate genes selected for the array, 4.5% were markers from existing genetic maps, and 61% were selected based on distribution across the genome. Markers with distorted segregation ratios occurred in blocks in both linkage maps, accounting for 4% (DRH) and 9% (D84) of mapped markers. Markers with distorted segregation ratios were unique to each population with blocks on chromosomes 9 and 12 in DRH and 3, 4, 6 and 8 in D84. Chromosome assignment of markers based on linkage mapping differed from sequence alignment with the Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium (PGSC) pseudomolecules for 1% of the mapped markers with some disconcordant markers attributable to paralogs. In total, 126 (DRH) and 226 (D84) mapped markers were not anchored to the pseudomolecules and provide new scaffold anchoring data to improve the potato genome assembly. The high degree of concordance between the linkage maps and the pseudomolecules demonstrates both the quality of the potato genome sequence and the functionality of the Infinium 8303 Potato Array. The broad genome coverage of the Infinium 8303 Potato Array compared to other marker sets will enable numerous downstream applications."

The underlying molecular mechanisms could involve epigenetics, as recent data show altered DNA methylation of putative type 2 diabetes candidate genes in response to high-fat diets. We examined the effect of a short-term high-fat overfeeding (HFO) diet on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in human skeletal muscle.METHODS: Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from 21 healthy young men after ingestion of a short-term HFO diet and a control diet, in a randomised crossover setting. DNA methylation was measured in 27,578 CpG sites/14,475 genes using Illumina's Infinium Bead Array. Candidate gene expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR.RESULTS: HFO introduced widespread DNA methylation changes affecting 6,508 genes (45%), with a maximum methylation change of 13.0 percentage points. The HFO-induced methylation changes were only partly and non-significantly reversed after 6-8 weeks. Alterations in DNA methylation levels primarily affected genes involved in inflammation, the reproductive system and cancer. Few gene expression changes were observed and these had poor correlation to DNA methylation.INTERPRETATION: The genome-wide DNA methylation changes induced by the short-term HFO diet could have implications for our understanding of transient epigenetic regulation in humans and its contribution to the development of metabolic diseases. The slow reversibility suggests a methylation build-up with HFO, which over time may influence gene expression levels."

The advent of commercial, array-based methods to interrogate DNA methylation has led to a profusion of epigenetic studies in the literature. Array-based methods, such as the popular Illumina GoldenGate and Infinium platforms, estimate the proportion of DNA methylated at single-base resolution for thousands of CpG sites across the genome. These arrays generate enormous amounts of data, but few software resources exist for efficient and flexible analysis of these data. We developed a software package called MethLAB (http://genetics.emory.edu/conneely/MethLAB) using R, an open source statistical language that can be edited to suit the needs of the user. MethLAB features a graphical user interface (GUI) with a menu-driven format designed to efficiently read in and manipulate array-based methylation data in a user-friendly manner. MethLAB tests for association between methylation and relevant phenotypes by fitting a separate linear model for each CpG site. These models can incorporate both continuous and categorical phenotypes and covariates, as well as fixed or random batch or chip effects. MethLAB accounts for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a user-specified level. Standard output includes a spreadsheet-ready text file and an array of publication-quality figures. Considering the growing interest in and availability of DNA methylation data, there is a great need for user-friendly open source analytical tools. With MethLAB, we present a timely resource that will allow users with no programming experience to implement flexible and powerful analyses of DNA methylation data."

Evidence suggests oxidative stress plays a role in the disease. To assess the potential contribution of epigenetic regulation of antioxidant genes relevant to AMD pathogenesis, we evaluated DNA methylation, a tissue-specific genetic modulation that affects gene expression.METHODS: Using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 Illumina platform, we performed DNA bisulfite sequencing to compare the methylation status in postmortem retina pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid between patients with AMD and age-matched controls. Gene expression was assessed with the Affymetrix Exon Array. TaqMan gene expression assays were used for relative quantification (RT-PCR) confirmation of the expression array results: Glutathione S-transferase isoform mu1 (GSTM1) and mu5 (GSTM5) promoter methylation was confirmed by CpG island bisulfite pyrosequencing. To assess protein levels and localization, we used Western analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence with murine and human samples.RESULTS: The mRNA levels of GSTM1 and GSTM5 were significantly reduced in AMD versus age-matched controls in RPE/choroid and neurosensory retina (NSR), which corresponded to hypermethylation of the GSTM1 promoter. mRNA and protein levels were decreased (RPE to a greater extent than NSR) in AMD postmortem samples, irrespective of age. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence confirm the presence of the enzymes in the NSR and RPE.CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of DNA methylation, together with mRNA levels, revealed significant differences between AMD versus normal retinas. The evidence presented suggests that GSTM1 and GSTM5 undergo epigenetic repression in AMD RPE/choroid, which may increase susceptibility to oxidative stress in AMD retinas."

We employed a genome-scale marker discovery method to identify and verify candidate DNA methylation biomarkers for blood-based detection of colorectal cancer.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used DNA methylation data from 711 colorectal tumors, 53 matched adjacent-normal colonic tissue samples, 286 healthy blood samples and 4,201 tumor samples of 15 different cancer types. DNA methylation data were generated by the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 and the HumanMethylation450 platforms, which determine the methylation status of 27,578 and 482,421 CpG sites respectively. We first performed a multistep marker selection to identify candidate markers with high methylation across all colorectal tumors while harboring low methylation in healthy samples and other cancer types. We then used pre-therapeutic plasma and serum samples from 107 colorectal cancer patients and 98 controls without colorectal cancer, confirmed by colonoscopy, to verify candidate markers. We selected two markers for further evaluation: methylated THBD (THBD-M) and methylated C9orf50 (C9orf50-M). When tested on clinical plasma and serum samples these markers outperformed carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum measurement and resulted in a high sensitive and specific test performance for early colorectal cancer detection.SIGNIFICANCE: Our systematic marker discovery and verification study for blood-based DNA methylation markers resulted in two novel colorectal cancer biomarkers, THBD-M and C9orf50-M. THBD-M in particular showed promising performance in clinical samples, justifying its further optimization and clinical testing."

Our study presents the first comparison of two of these techniques - the targeted approach of the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip® with the immunoprecipitation and sequencing-based method, MeDIP-seq. Both methods were initially validated with respect to bisulfite sequencing as the gold standard and then assessed in terms of coverage, resolution and accuracy. The regions of the methylome that can be assayed by both methods and those that can only be assayed by one method were determined and the discovery of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by both techniques was examined. Our results show that the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip® and MeDIP-seq show a good positive correlation (Spearman correlation of 0.68) on a genome-wide scale and can both be used successfully to determine differentially methylated loci in RefSeq genes, CpG islands, shores and shelves. MeDIP-seq however, allows a wider interrogation of methylated regions of the human genome, including thousands of non-RefSeq genes and repetitive elements, all of which may be of importance in disease. In our study MeDIP-seq allowed the detection of 15,709 differentially methylated regions, nearly twice as many as the array-based method (8070), which may result in a more comprehensive study of the methylome."

Although DNA methylation defects are known to be associated with male infertility in mice, their impact on human deficiency of sperm production has yet to be determined. We have assessed the global genomic DNA methylation profiles in human infertile male patients with spermatogenic disorders by using the Infinium Human Methylation27 BeadChip. Three populations were studied: conserved spermatogenesis, spermatogenic failure due to germ cell maturation defects, and Sertoli cell-only syndrome samples. A disease-associated DNA methylation profile, characterized by targeting members of the PIWI-associated RNA (piRNA) processing machinery, was obtained. Bisulfite genomic sequencing and pyrosequencing in a large cohort (n = 46) of samples validated the altered DNA methylation patterns observed in piRNA-processing genes. In particular, male infertility was associated with the promoter hypermethylation-associated silencing of PIWIL2 and TDRD1. The downstream effects mediated by the epigenetic inactivation of the PIWI pathway genes were a defective production of piRNAs and a hypomethylation of the LINE-1 repetitive sequence in the affected patients. Overall, our data suggest that DNA methylation, at least that affecting PIWIL2/TDRD1, has a role in the control of gene expression in spermatogenesis and its imbalance contributes to an unsuccessful germ cell development that might explain a group of male infertility disorders."

We report a three-layer epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) using intestinal biopsies from 10 monozygotic twin pairs (n = 20 individuals) discordant for manifestation of ulcerative colitis (UC). Genome-wide expression scans were generated using Affymetrix UG 133 Plus 2.0 arrays (layer 1). Genome-wide DNAm scans were carried out using Illumina 27k Infinium Bead Arrays to identify methylation variable positions (MVPs, layer 2), and MeDIP-chip on Nimblegen custom 385k Tiling Arrays to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs, layer 3). Identified MVPs and DMRs were validated in two independent patient populations by quantitative real-time PCR and bisulfite-pyrosequencing (n = 185). The EWAS identified 61 disease-associated loci harboring differential DNAm in cis of a differentially expressed transcript. All constitute novel candidate risk loci for UC not previously identified by GWAS. Among them are several that have been functionally implicated in inflammatory processes, e.g., complement factor CFI, the serine protease inhibitor SPINK4, and the adhesion molecule THY1 (also known as CD90). Our study design excludes nondisease inflammation as a cause of the identified changes in DNAm. This study represents the first replicated EWAS of UC integrated with transcriptional signatures in the affected tissue and demonstrates the power of EWAS to uncover unexplained disease risk and molecular events of disease manifestation."

In order to understand the role of epigenetic modulation in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) we have applied MeDIP-seq to the DNA of 12 AML patients and 4 normal bone marrows. This analysis revealed leukemia-associated differentially methylated regions that included gene promoters, gene bodies, CpG islands and CpG island shores. Two genes (SPHKAP and DPP6) with significantly methylated promoters were of interest and further analysis of their expression showed them to be repressed in AML. We also demonstrated considerable cytogenetic subtype specificity in the methylomes affecting different genomic features. Significantly distinct patterns of hypomethylation of certain interspersed repeat elements were associated with cytogenetic subtypes. The methylation patterns of members of the SINE family tightly clustered all leukemic patients with an enrichment of Alu repeats with a high CpG density (P&lt;0.0001). We were able to demonstrate significant inverse correlation between intragenic interspersed repeat sequence methylation and gene expression with SINEs showing the strongest inverse correlation (R(2) = 0.7). We conclude that the alterations in DNA methylation that accompany the development of AML affect not only the promoters, but also the non-promoter genomic features, with significant demethylation of certain interspersed repeat DNA elements being associated with AML cytogenetic subtypes. MeDIP-seq data were validated using bisulfite pyrosequencing and the Infinium array."

This array offers a high-throughput, low cost alternative to more comprehensive sequencing-based methodologies. Here we compare data generated by interrogation of the same seven clinical samples by Infinium 450K and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). This is the largest data set comparing Infinium 450K array to the comprehensive RRBS methodology reported so far. We show good agreement between the two methodologies. A read depth of four or more reads in the RRBS data was sufficient to achieve good agreement with Infinium 450K. However, we observe that intermediate methylation values (20-80%) are more variable between technologies than values at the extremes of the bimodal methylation distribution. We describe careful processing of Infinium 450K data to correct for known limitations and batch effects. Using methodologies proposed by others and newly implemented and combined in this report, agreement of Infinium 450K data with independent techniques can be vastly improved."
"22524302";"Infinium";"Infinium";"BMC Bioinformatics";13;2012;"A comparison of feature selection and classification methods in DNA methylation studies using the Illumina Infinium platform.";"BACKGROUND: The 27k Illumina Infinium Methylation Beadchip is a popular high-throughput technology that allows the methylation state of over 27,000 CpGs to be assayed. While feature selection and classification methods have been comprehensively explored in the context of gene expression data, relatively little is known as to how best to perform feature selection or classification in the context of Illumina Infinium methylation data. Given the rising importance of epigenomics in cancer and other complex genetic diseases, and in view of the upcoming epigenome wide association studies, it is critical to identify the statistical methods that offer improved inference in this novel context.RESULTS: Using a total of 7 large Illumina Infinium 27k Methylation data sets, encompassing over 1,000 samples from a wide range of tissues, we here provide an evaluation of popular feature selection, dimensional reduction and classification methods on DNA methylation data. Specifically, we evaluate the effects of variance filtering, supervised principal components (SPCA) and the choice of DNA methylation quantification measure on downstream statistical inference. We show that for relatively large sample sizes feature selection using test statistics is similar for M and β-values, but that in the limit of small sample sizes, M-values allow more reliable identification of true positives. We also show that the effect of variance filtering on feature selection is study-specific and dependent on the phenotype of interest and tissue type profiled. Specifically, we find that variance filtering improves the detection of true positives in studies with large effect sizes, but that it may lead to worse performance in studies with smaller yet significant effect sizes. In contrast, supervised principal components improves the statistical power, especially in studies with small effect sizes. We also demonstrate that classification using the Elastic Net and Support Vector Machine (SVM) clearly outperforms competing methods like LASSO and SPCA. Finally, in unsupervised modelling of cancer diagnosis, we find that non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) clearly outperforms principal components analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of tailoring the feature selection and classification methodology to the sample size and biological context of the DNA methylation study. The Elastic Net emerges as a powerful classification algorithm for large-scale DNA methylation studies, while NMF does well in the unsupervised context. The insights presented here will be useful to any study embarking on large-scale DNA methylation profiling using Illumina Infinium beadarrays."

Genotypes were from BovineSNP50 (Infinium BeadChip, Illumina, San Diego, CA; 53,692 SNP). Phenotypes included BW collected at birth and ∼205 and 365 d of age, and yearling ultrasound assessment of LM area, percent intramuscular fat, and depth of rib fat. Simultaneous association of SNP windows with phenotype were undertaken with Bayes C analyses, using GenSel software. The SNP windows were ≈ 5 SNP in length. Analyses fitted a mixture model that treated SNP effects as random, with an assumed fraction pi = 0.999 having no effect on phenotype. Bootstrap analyses were used to obtain significance values for the SNP windows with the greatest contribution to observed variation. The SNP windows with P &lt; 0.01 were considered as QTL associated with a trait in which case their location was queried from dbSNP and the presence of a previously reported QTL in that location was checked in CattleQTLdb. For 9 traits, QTL were mapped to 139 regions on 25 chromosomes. Forty-one of these QTL were already described in CattleQTLdb, so 98 are new additions. The SNP windows on chromosomes 1, 3, and 6 were associated with multiple traits (i.e., 205- and 365- d BW, and ADG from birth to 205 and 365 d of age). Several chromosomes harbored regions associated with multiple traits; however, the SNP that comprised the window often varied among traits (i.e., chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22, 24, 28, and 29).

This array offers the prospect of high throughput genotyping and linkage map development for any given Malus progeny. To test the applicability of the array for mapping in diverse Malus genotypes, we applied the array to the construction of a SNP-based linkage map of an apple rootstock progeny.RESULTS: Of the 7,867 Malus SNP markers on the array, 1,823 (23.2%) were heterozygous in one of the two parents of the progeny, 1,007 (12.8%) were heterozygous in both parental genotypes, whilst just 2.8% of the 921 Pyrus SNPs were heterozygous. A linkage map spanning 1,282.2 cM was produced comprising 2,272 SNP markers, 306 SSR markers and the S-locus. The length of the M432 linkage map was increased by 52.7 cM with the addition of the SNP markers, whilst marker density increased from 3.8 cM/marker to 0.5 cM/marker. Just three regions in excess of 10 cM remain where no markers were mapped. We compared the positions of the mapped SNP markers on the M432 map with their predicted positions on the 'Golden Delicious' genome sequence. A total of 311 markers (13.7% of all mapped markers) mapped to positions that conflicted with their predicted positions on the 'Golden Delicious' pseudo-chromosomes, indicating the presence of paralogous genomic regions or mis-assignments of genome sequence contigs during the assembly and anchoring of the genome sequence.CONCLUSIONS: We incorporated data for the 2,272 SNP markers onto the map of the M432 progeny and have presented the most complete and saturated map of the full 17 linkage groups of M. pumila to date. The data were generated rapidly in a high-throughput semi-automated pipeline, permitting significant savings in time and cost over linkage map construction using microsatellites. The application of the array will permit linkage maps to be developed for QTL analyses in a cost-effective manner, and the identification of SNPs that have been assigned erroneous positions on the 'Golden Delicious' reference sequence will assist in the continued improvement of the genome sequence assembly for that variety."

In apple breeding programmes, GS can be used to obtain genomic breeding values (GEBV) for choosing next-generation parents or selections for further testing as potential commercial cultivars at a very early stage. Thus GS has the potential to accelerate breeding efficiency significantly because of decreased generation interval or increased selection intensity. We evaluated the accuracy of GS in a population of 1120 seedlings generated from a factorial mating design of four females and two male parents. All seedlings were genotyped using an Illumina Infinium chip comprising 8,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and were phenotyped for various fruit quality traits. Random-regression best liner unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP) and the Bayesian LASSO method were used to obtain GEBV, and compared using a cross-validation approach for their accuracy to predict unobserved BLUP-BV. Accuracies were very similar for both methods, varying from 0.70 to 0.90 for various fruit quality traits. The selection response per unit time using GS compared with the traditional BLUP-based selection were very high (&gt;100%) especially for low-heritability traits. Genome-wide average estimated linkage disequilibrium (LD) between adjacent SNPs was 0.32, with a relatively slow decay of LD in the long range (r(2) = 0.33 and 0.19 at 100 kb and 1,000 kb respectively), contributing to the higher accuracy of GS. Distribution of estimated SNP effects revealed involvement of large effect genes with likely pleiotropic effects. These results demonstrated that genomic selection is a credible alternative to conventional selection for fruit quality traits."

We investigated the methylation profiles of DNA in peripheral blood cells from 18 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FESZ) and from 15 normal controls. Schizophrenia patients were confined to those at the stage of first-episode psychosis. We analyzed the DNA methylation status of 27,578 CpG sites by means of the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array. Differentially methylated CpG sites, which were particularly abundant within CpG islands, were enriched in genes related to the nuclear lumen, to transcription factor binding, and to nucleotide binding. We also observed differential methylation of the promoters of HTR1E and COMTD1, which are functionally related to genes found to be differentially methylated in schizophrenia patients in previous studies. Our results indicate the site-specific epigenetic alterations in patients with FESZ."
"23071498";"Infinium";"Infinium";"PLoS One";11;2012;"Novel insights into DNA methylation features in spermatozoa: stability and peculiarities.";"Data about the entire sperm DNA methylome are limited to two sperm donors whereas studies dealing with a greater number of subjects focused only on a few genes or were based on low resolution arrays. This implies that information about what we can consider as a normal sperm DNA methylome and whether it is stable among different normozoospermic individuals is still missing. The definition of the DNA methylation profile of normozoospermic men, the entity of inter-individual variability and the epigenetic characterization of quality-fractioned sperm subpopulations in the same subject (intra-individual variability) are relevant for a better understanding of pathological conditions. We addressed these questions by using the high resolution Infinium 450K methylation array and compared normal sperm DNA methylomes against somatic and cancer cells. Our study, based on the largest number of subjects (n = 8) ever considered for such a large number of CpGs (n = 487,517), provided clear evidence for i) a highly conserved DNA methylation profile among normozoospermic subjects; ii) a stable sperm DNA methylation pattern in different quality-fractioned sperm populations of the same individual. The latter finding is particularly relevant if we consider that different quality fractioned sperm subpopulations show differences in their structural features, metabolic and genomic profiles. We demonstrate, for the first time, that DNA methylation in normozoospermic men remains highly uniform regardless the quality of sperm subpopulations. In addition, our analysis provided both confirmatory and novel data concerning the sperm DNA methylome, including its peculiar features in respect to somatic and cancer cells. Our description about a highly polarized sperm DNA methylation profile, the clearly distinct genomic and functional organization of hypo- versus hypermethylated loci as well as the association of histone-enriched hypomethylated loci with embryonic development, which we now extended also to hypomethylated piRNAs-linked genes, provides solid basis for future basic and clinical research."

However, epigenomic profiles at birth and in early childhood remain largely unexplored. The focus of this report is to examine the individual variation and longitudinal pattern of genome-wide DNA methylation levels from birth through the first two years of life in 105 Black children (59 males and 46 females) enrolled at the Boston Medical Center. We performed epigenomic mapping of cord blood at birth and venous blood samples from the same set of children within the first two years of life using Illumina Infinium Humanmethylation27 BeadChip. We observed a wide range of inter-individual variations in genome-wide methylation at each time point including lower levels at CpG islands, TSS200, 5'UTR and 1st Exon locations, but significantly higher levels in CpG shores, shelves, TSS1500, gene body and 3'UTR. We identified CpG sites with significant intra-individual longitudinal changes in the first two years of life throughout the genome. Specifically, we identified 159 CpG sites in males and 149 CpG sites in females with significant longitudinal changes defined by both statistical significance and magnitude of changes. These significant CpG sites appeared to be located within genes with important biological functions including immunity and inflammation. Further studies are needed to replicate our findings, including analysis by specific cell types, and link those individual variations and longitudinal changes with specific health outcomes in early childhood and later life."

Monozygotic (MZ) twin discordance rates and epidemiologic data implicate that environmental changes and epigenetic factors may play a pathogenic role in IBD. DNA methylation (the methylation of cytosines within CpG dinucleotides) is an epigenetic modification, which can respond to environmental influences. We investigated whether DNA methylation might be connected with IBD in peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) DNA by utilizing genome-wide microarrays.METHODS: Two different high-throughput microarray-based methods for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis were employed. First, DNA isolated from MZ twin pairs concordant (CD: 4; UC: 3) and discordant (CD: 4; UC: 7) for IBD was interrogated by a custom-made methylation-specific amplification microarray (MSAM). Second, the recently developed Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays were used on 48 samples of PBL DNA from discordant MZ twin pairs (CD: 3; UC: 3) and treatment-naive pediatric cases of IBD (CD: 14; UC: 8), as well as controls (n = 14). The microarrays were validated with bisulfite pyrosequencing.RESULTS: The MSAMs did not yield significant IBD associations. The Methylation BeadChip approach identified a single DNA methylation association of IBD at TEPP (testis, prostate and placenta-expressed protein) when DNA isolated selectively from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was analyzed (8.6% increase in methylation between CD and control, FDR = 0.0065).CONCLUSIONS: Microarray interrogation of IBD-dependent DNA methylation from PBLs appears to have limited ability to detect significant disease associations. More detailed and/or selective approaches may be useful for the elucidation of connections between the DNA methylome and IBD in the future."

To date, aberrant DNA methylation in SCZ has been reported in several studies. However, no comprehensive studies using medication-free subjects with SCZ have been conducted. In addition, most of these studies have been limited to the analysis of the CpG sites in CpG islands (CGIs) in the gene promoter regions, so little is known about the DNA methylation signatures across the whole genome in SCZ. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling (485,764 CpG sites) of peripheral leukocytes was conducted in the first set of samples (24 medication-free patients with SCZ and 23 non-psychiatric controls) using Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchips. Second, a monozygotic twin study was performed using three pairs of monozygotic twins that were discordant for SCZ. Finally, the data from these two independent cohorts were compared. A total of 234 differentially methylated CpG sites that were common between these two cohorts were identified. Of the 234 CpG sites, 153 sites (65.4 %) were located in the CGIs and in the regions flanking CGIs (CGI: 40.6 %; CGI shore: 13.3 %; CGI shelf: 11.5 %). Of the 95 differently methylated CpG sites in the CGIs, most of them were located in the promoter regions (promoter: 75.8 %; gene body: 14.7 %; 3'-UTR: 2.1 %). Aberrant DNA methylation in SCZ was identified at numerous loci across the whole genome in peripheral leukocytes using two independent sets of samples. These findings support the notion that altered DNA methylation could be involved in the pathophysiology of SCZ."

Previous studies found that downregulation of miRNAs is a common feature observed in solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We employed a genome-wide approach to test the hypothesis that DNA methylation alterations in miRNA host genes may cause deregulated miRNA expression in HCC. We analyzed tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 62 Taiwanese HCC cases using Infinium HumanMethylation27 DNA Analysis BeadChips that include 254 CpG sites covering 110 miRNAs from 64 host genes. Expression levels of three identified miRNAs (miR-10a, miR-10b and miR-196b) were measured in a subset of 37 HCC tumor and non-tumor tissues. After Bonferroni adjustment, a total of 54 CpG sites from 27 host genes significantly differed in DNA methylation levels between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues with 53 sites significantly hypermethylated in tumor tissues. Among the 54 significant CpG sites, 15 sites had more than 2-fold tumor/non-tumor changes, 17 sites had differences &gt; 10%, and 10 sites had both features [including 8 significantly hypermethylated CpG sites in the host genes of miR-10a, miR-10b and miR-196b (HOXB4, HOXD4 and HOXA9, respectively)]. Significant downregulation of miR-10a was observed in tumor compared with non-tumor tissues (0.50 vs. 1.73, p = 0.031). The concordance for HOXB4 methylation alteration and dysregulation of miR-10a was 73.5%. No significant change was observed for miR-10b expression. Unexpectedly, miR-196b was significantly upregulated in tumor compared with non-tumor tissues (p = 0.0001). These data suggest that aberrant DNA methylation may lead to dysregulation of miR-10a in HCC tumor tissues."

Limited information is available for adrenocortical tumors. Abnormal methylation at the IGF2/H19 locus is common in adrenocortical carcinomas. Our aim was to characterize the methylation in adrenocortical carcinomas at a whole-genome scale and to assess its clinical significance and its impact on gene expression.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Methylation patterns of CpG islands in promoter regions of 51 adrenocortical carcinomas and 84 adenomas were studied by the Infinium HumanMethylation27 Beadchip (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Methylation of 33 genes was studied by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in 15 carcinomas. Gene expression data were available for 87 tumors from a previous study (HG-U133Plus2.0 AffymetrixGeneChip; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Clinical information, including patient features and survival, were available for all tumors.RESULTS: Methylation was higher in carcinomas than in adenomas (t test P = 3.1 × 10(-9)). Unsupervised clustering of DNA methylation profiles identified two groups of carcinomas, one with an elevated methylation level, evoking a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). The subgroup of hypermethylated carcinomas was further divided in two subgroups, with different levels of methylation (CIMP-high and CIMP-low). This classification could be confirmed by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Hypermethylation was associated with a poor survival (Cox model P = 0.02). The transcriptome/methylation correlation showed 1741 genes (of 12,250) negatively correlated; among the top genes were H19 and other tumor suppressors (PLAGL-1, G0S2, and NDRG2).CONCLUSIONS: This genome-wide methylation analysis reveals the existence of hypermethylated adrenocortical carcinomas, with a poorer prognosis. Hypermethylation in these tumors is important for silencing specific tumor suppressor genes."

We studied paired (tumor and surrounding healthy) fresh frozen tissue from 86 CRC patients using Illumina's Infinium-based SNP array. This method allowed us to study CIN in CRC, with simultaneous analysis of copy number (CN) and B-allele frequency (BAF)--a representation of allelic composition. These data helped us to detect mono-allelic and bi-allelic amplifications/deletion, copy neutral loss of heterozygosity, and levels of mosaicism for mixed cell populations, some of which can not be assessed with other methods that do not measure BAF. We identified associations between CN abnormalities and different CRC phenotypes (histological diagnosis, location, tumor grade, stage, MSI and presence of lymph node metastasis). We showed commonalities between regions of CN change observed in CRC and the regions reported in previous studies of other solid cancers (e.g. amplifications of 20q, 13q, 8q, 5p and deletions of 18q, 17p and 8p). From Therapeutic Target Database, we identified relevant drugs, targeted to the genes located in these regions with CN changes, approved or in trials for other cancers and common diseases. These drugs may be considered for future therapeutic trials in CRC, based on personalized cytogenetic diagnosis. We also found many regions, harboring genes, which are not currently targeted by any relevant drugs that may be considered for future drug discovery studies. Our study shows the application of high density SNP arrays for cytogenetic study in CRC and its potential utility for personalized treatment."

A goal for clinical research is finding sites that are differentially methylated between groups of samples to act as potential biomarkers for disease outcome. However, clinical samples are often limited in availability, represent a heterogeneous collection of cells or are of uncertain clinical class. Array-based methods for identification of methylation provide a cost-effective method to survey a proportion of the methylome at single base resolution. The Illumina Infinium array has become a popular and reliable high throughput method in this field and are proving useful in the identification of biomarkers for disease. Here, we compare a commonly used statistical test with a new intuitive and flexible computational approach to quickly detect differentially methylated sites. The method rapidly identifies and ranks candidate lists with greatest inter-group variability whilst controlling for intra-group variability. Intuitive and biologically relevant filters can be imposed to quickly identify sites and genes of interest."

While much research has been done identifying DNA methylation signatures in cancer vs. normal etc., we still lack sufficient knowledge of the role that differential methylation plays during normal cellular differentiation and tissue specification. We also need thorough, genome level studies to determine the meaning of methylation of individual CpG dinucleotides in terms of gene expression.RESULTS: In this study, we have used (insert statistical method here) to compile unique DNA methylation signatures from normal human heart, lung, and kidney using the Illumina Infinium 27 K methylation arrays and compared those to gene expression by RNA sequencing. We have identified unique signatures of global DNA methylation for human heart, kidney and liver, and showed that DNA methylation data can be used to correctly classify various tissues. It indicates that DNA methylation reflects tissue specificity and may play an important role in tissue differentiation. The integrative analysis of methylation and RNA-Seq data showed that gene methylation and its transcriptional levels were comprehensively correlated. The location of methylation markers in terms of distance to transcription start site and CpG island showed no effects on the regulation of gene expression by DNA methylation in normal tissues.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that an integrative analysis of methylation array and RNA-Seq data can be utilized to discover the global regulation of gene expression by DNA methylation and suggests that DNA methylation plays an important role in normal tissue differentiation via modulation of gene expression."

The role of DNA methylation in adrenocortical tumorigenesis has not been analyzed in an unbiased, systematic fashion. Using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, the DNA methylation levels of 27,578 CpG sites were investigated in bisulfite-modified DNA from 6 normal adrenocortical tissue samples, 27 adrenocortical adenomas (ACA), and 15 adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC). Genes involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation of known or putative importance in the development of adrenal tumors showed significant and frequent hypermethylation. Such genes included CDKN2A, GATA4, BCL2, DLEC1, HDAC10, PYCARD, and SCGB3A1/HIN1. Comparing benign versus malignant ACT, a total of 212 CpG islands were identified as significantly hypermethylated in ACC. Gene expression studies of selected hypermethylated genes (CDKN2A, GATA4, DLEC1, HDAC10, PYCARD, SCGB3A1/HIN1) in 6 normal and 16 neoplastic adrenocortical tissues (10 ACA and 6 ACC), displayed reduced gene expression in benign and malignant ACT versus normal adrenocortical tissue. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine of adrenocortical cancer H-295R cells increased expression of the hypermethylated genes CDKN2A, GATA4, DLEC1, HDAC10, PYCARD, and SCGB3A1/HIN1. In conclusion, the current study represents the first unbiased, quantitative, genome-wide study of adrenocortical tumor DNA methylation.

This study was conducted to compare the DNA methylome of maternal and fetal monocytes, dMφ, and HC and thereby to determine the immunobiological importance of DNA methylation in pregnancy.METHOD OF STUDY: Paired samples were obtained from normal pregnant women at term not in labor and their neonates. Maternal monocytes (MMo) and fetal monocytes (FMo) were isolated from the peripheral blood of mothers and fetal cord blood, respectively. dMφ and HC were obtained from the decidua of fetal membranes and placentas, respectively. DNA methylation profiling was performed using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation27 BeadChip. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western Blot were performed for validation experiments.RESULTS: (i) Significant differences in DNA methylation were found in each comparison (MMo versus FMo, 65 loci; dMφ versus HC, 266 loci; MMo versus dMφ, 199 loci; FMo versus HC, 1030 loci). (ii) Many of the immune response-related genes were hypermethylated in fetal cells (FMo and HC) compared to maternal cells (MMo and dMφ). (iii) Genes encoding markers of classical macrophage activation were hypermethylated, and genes encoding alternative macrophage activation were hypomethylated in dMφ and HC compared to MMo and FMo, respectively. (iv) mRNA expressions of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B were significantly lower in dMφ than in HC. (v) 5-azacytidine treatment increased expression of INCA1 in dMφ.CONCLUSIONS: The findings herein indicate that DNA methylation patterns change during monocyte-macrophage differentiation at the feto-maternal interface. It is also suggested that DNA methylation is an important component of the biological machinery conferring an anti-inflammatory phenotype to macrophages at the feto-maternal interface."

To evaluate the transferability status of these findings to an ethnically diverse north Indian population, we performed a replication analysis. We investigated the association of 47 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 43 of these genes/loci with RA in a north Indian cohort comprising 983 RA cases and 1007 age and gender matched controls. Genotyping was done using Infinium human 660w-quad. Association analysis by chi-square test implemented in plink was carried out in two steps. Firstly, association of the index or surrogate SNP (r2&gt;0.8, calculated from reference GIH Hap-Map population) was tested. In the second step, evidence for allelic/locus heterogeneity at aforementioned genes/loci was assessed for by testing additional flanking SNPs in linkage equilibrium with index/surrogate marker.Of the 44 European specific index SNPs, neither index nor surrogate SNPs were present for nine SNPs in the genotyping array. Of the remaining 35, associations were replicated at seven genes namely PTPN22 (rs1217407, p = 3×10(-3)); IL2-21 (rs13119723, p = 0.008); HLA-DRB1 (rs660895, p = 2.56×10(-5); rs6457617, p = 1.6×10(-09); rs13192471, p = 6.7×10(-16)); TNFA1P3 (rs9321637, p = 0.03); CCL21 (rs13293020, p = 0.01); IL2RA (rs2104286, p = 1.9×10(-4)) and ZEB1 (rs2793108, p = 0.006). Of the three Asian specific loci tested, rs2977227 in PADI4 showed modest association (p&lt;0.02). Further, of the 140 SNPs (in LE with index/surrogate variant) tested, association was observed at 11 additional genes: PTPRC, AFF3, CD28, CTLA4, PXK, ANKRD55, TAGAP, CCR6, BLK, CD40 and IL2RB. This study indicates limited replication of European and Asian index SNPs and apparent allelic heterogeneity in RA etiology among north Indians warranting independent GWAS in this population. However, replicated associations of HLA-DRB1, PTPN22 (which confer ∼50% of the heritable risk to RA) and IL2RA suggest that cross-ethnicity fine mapping of such loci is apposite for identification of causal variants."

Genome-wide DNAm profiling has been performed successfully on tumor tissue DNA samples. However, the invasive procedure limits the utility of tumor tissue for epidemiological studies. While recent data indicate that cell-free circulating DNAm (cfDNAm) profiles reflect DNAm status in corresponding tumor tissues, no studies have examined the association of cfDNAm with cancer or precursors on a genome-wide scale. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the putative significance of genome-wide cfDNAm profiles in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and Barrett esophagus (BE, EA precursor). We performed genome-wide DNAm profiling in EA tissue DNA (n = 8) and matched serum DNA (n = 8), in serum DNA of BE (n = 10), and in healthy controls (n = 10) using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip that covers 27,578 CpG loci in 14,495 genes. We found that cfDNAm profiles were highly correlated to DNAm profiles in matched tumor tissue DNA (r = 0.92) in patients with EA. We selected the most differentially methylated loci to perform hierarchical clustering analysis. We found that 911 loci can discriminate perfectly between EA and control samples, 554 loci can separate EA from BE samples, and 46 loci can distinguish BE from control samples. These results suggest that genome-wide cfDNAm profiles are highly consistent with DNAm profiles detected in corresponding tumor tissues. Differential cfDNAm profiling may be a useful approach for the noninvasive screening of EA and EA premalignant lesions."

Using an Illumina Infinium Methylation Assay, we analyzed methylation levels of 397 CpG sites in the promoter regions of 56 normally imprinted genes to investigate whether shiftwork is associated with alteration of methylation patterns. Methylation was significantly higher at 20 CpG sites and significantly lower at 30 CpG sites (P &lt; 0.05) in 10 female long-term shiftworkers as compared to 10 female age- and folate intake-matched day workers. The strongest evidence for altered methylation patterns in shiftworkers was observed for DLX5, IGF2AS, and TP73 based on the magnitude of methylation change and consistency in the direction of change across multiple CpG sites, and consistent results were observed using quantitative DNA methylation analysis. We conclude that long-term shiftwork may alter methylation patterns at imprinted genes, which may be an important mechanism by which shiftwork has carcinogenic potential and warrants further investigation."

However, there remains an uncertainty whether the CRC clusters identified in these studies represent compatible phenotypes.METHODS: We carried out comprehensive genome-scale DNA methylation profiling by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 of 21 DNA pools that represent 84 CRC samples divided according to their high-, intermediate-, and low-methylation epigenotypes (HME, IME, and LME, respectively) and 70 normal-adjacent colonic tissues. We have also examined the relationship among 3 epigenotypes and chromosomal gains and deletions (assessed by Comparative Genomic Hybridization) in a group of 100 CRC samples.RESULTS: The HME subgroup showed features associated with CpG island methylator phenotype - high (CIMP-high) including methylation of specific CpG sites (CpGs) as well as significantly lower mean number of chromosomal imbalances when compared with other epigenotypes. The IME subgroup displayed the lowest number of methylated CpGs (717 vs. 2,399 and 2,679 in HME and LME, respectively) and highest mean number of chromosomal imbalances when compared with HME (P, 0.001) and LME (P, 0.004). A comparison between the methylation profiles of 3 epigenotypes revealed more similarities between the HME and LME (1,669 methylated CpGs overlapped) than HME and IME (673 methylated CpGs overlapped).CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that IME and LME CRCs show opposite features to those that have been previously attributed to CIMP-low and CIMP-0 CRCs.IMPACT: These discrepancies should be considered when interpreting the data from a particular epigenotyping method."

Evidence is growing that epigenetic variation, particularly DNA methylation, is associated with autoimmune disease. However, nothing is currently known about the potential role of aberrant DNA methylation in JIA. As a first step to addressing this knowledge gap, we have profiled DNA methylation in purified CD4+ T cells from JIA subjects and controls. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from 14 oligoarticular and polyarticular JIA cases with active disease, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Genome-scale methylation analysis was carried out using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. Methylation data at &gt;25,000 CpGs was compared in a case-control study design.RESULTS: Methylation levels were significantly different (FDR adjusted p&lt;0.1) at 145 loci. Removal of four samples exposed to methotrexate had a striking impact on the outcome of the analysis, reducing the number of differentially methylated loci to 11. The methotrexate-naive analysis identified reduced methylation at the gene encoding the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL32, which was subsequently replicated using a second analysis platform and a second set of case-control pairs.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that differential T cell DNA methylation may be a feature of JIA, and that reduced methylation at IL32 is associated with this disease. Further work in larger prospective and longitudinal sample collections is required to confirm these findings, assess whether the identified differences are causal or consequential of disease, and further investigate the epigenetic modifying properties of therapeutic regimens."

Genotypes were from 53,692 loci on the BovineSNP50 (Infinium Bead Chips, Illumina, San Diego, CA). Yearling heifers were estrous synchronized, bred by AI, and then exposed to natural service breeding. Reproductive ultrasound and DNA-based parentage testing were used to determine if the heifer conceived by AI or natural service, and code for FSC and HPG traits. Success rates for FSC and HPG were 53.3% and 78.0% ± 0.01%, and corresponding heritability estimates were 0.18 ± 0.07 and 0.10 ± 0.06, respectively. The models used in obtaining these heritability estimates and GWAS included fixed effects of year (i.e., 2005 to 2007), birth location, calving season, age of dam, and contemporary group. In GWAS, simultaneous associations of 1 Mb SNP windows with phenotype were undertaken with Bayes C analyses using GenSel software. The 1 Mb windows contained 21.3 ± 1.1 SNP. Analyses fitted a mixture model that treated SNP effects as random, with an assumed fraction pi = 0.9995 having no effect on phenotype. The windows that accounted for 1.0% of genetic variance were considered as QTL associated with FSC or HPG. Eighteen QTL existed on 15 chromosomes for the 2 traits. On average, each QTL accounted for 2.43% ± 0.2% of the genetic variance. Chromosome 8 harbored 2 QTL for FSC and 1 for HPG; however, these regions did not overlap. Chromosomes 3, 15, 16, 19, 24, 26, 27, 29, and X included QTL only for FSC, whereas chromosomes 2, 4, 10, 13, and 20 contained QTL only for HPG. The multitude of QTL detected for FSC and HPG in this GWAS involving Brangus heifers exemplifies the complex regulation of variation in heifer fertility traits of low heritability."

The platform incorporates two different probe types using different assay designs (InfiniumI and InfiniumII). Although this has allowed the assessment of more CpG sites, it has also introduced technical variation between the two probe types, which has complicated the analysis process. Many groups are working on normalization methods and analysis pipelines while many others are struggling to make sense of their new data sets. This motivated the organization of a meeting held at University College London that focused solely on the analysis methods and problems related to this new platform.

L1 and Alu contribute close to 30% of all base pairs in the human genome and transposition of repetitive elements is repressed through DNA methylation. Few studies have investigated whether repetitive element DNA methylation is associated with DNA methylation at other genomic regions, or the biological and technical factors that influence potential associations. Here, we assess L1 and Alu DNA methylation by Pyrosequencing of consensus sequences and using subsets of probes included in the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array. We show that evolutionary age and assay method affect the assessment of repetitive element DNA methylation. Additionally, we compare Pyrosequencing results for repetitive elements to average DNA methylation of CpG islands, as assessed by array probes classified into strong, weak and non-islands. We demonstrate that each of these dispersed sequences exhibits different patterns of tissue-specific DNA methylation. Correlation of DNA methylation suggests an association between L1 and weak CpG island DNA methylation in some of the tissues examined. We caution, however, that L1, Alu and CpG island DNA methylation are distinct measures of dispersed DNA methylation and one should not be used in lieu of another. Analysis of DNA methylation data is complex and assays may be influenced by environment and pathology in different or complementary ways."

The initial association with one of the top differentially methylated loci located in the promoter of the TNNT1 gene was replicated in a cohort of 276 FH subjects using pyrosequencing.RESULTS: According to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, the HDL-C differentially methylated loci identified were significantly associated with pathways related to lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease. TNNT1 DNA methylation levels were positively correlated with mean HDL particle size, HDL-phospholipid, HDL-apolipoprotein AI, HDL-C and TNNT1 expression levels.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that epigenome-wide changes account for interindividual variations in HDL particle metabolism and that TNNT1 is a new candidate gene for dyslipidemia."
"22467913";"Infinium";"Infinium";"Bioinformatics";4;2012;"Penalized logistic regression for high-dimensional DNA methylation data with case-control studies.";"MOTIVATION: DNA methylation is a molecular modification of DNA that plays crucial roles in regulation of gene expression. Particularly, CpG rich regions are frequently hypermethylated in cancer tissues, but not methylated in normal tissues. However, there are not many methodological literatures of case-control association studies for high-dimensional DNA methylation data, compared with those of microarray gene expression. One key feature of DNA methylation data is a grouped structure among CpG sites from a gene that are possibly highly correlated. In this article, we proposed a penalized logistic regression model for correlated DNA methylation CpG sites within genes from high-dimensional array data. Our regularization procedure is based on a combination of the l(1) penalty and squared l(2) penalty on degree-scaled differences of coefficients of CpG sites within one gene, so it induces both sparsity and smoothness with respect to the correlated regression coefficients. We combined the penalized procedure with a stability selection procedure such that a selection probability of each regression coefficient was provided which helps us make a stable and confident selection of methylation CpG sites that are possibly truly associated with the outcome.RESULTS: Using simulation studies we demonstrated that the proposed procedure outperforms existing main-stream regularization methods such as lasso and elastic-net when data is correlated within a group. We also applied our method to identify important CpG sites and corresponding genes for ovarian cancer from over 20 000 CpGs generated from Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27K Beadchip. Some genes identified are potentially associated with cancers."
"22357164";"Infinium";"Infinium";"BMC Res Notes";4;2012;"Interpretation of genome-wide infinium methylation data from ligated DNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded paired tumor and normal tissue.";"BACKGROUND: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples are a highly desirable resource for epigenetic studies, but there is no suitable platform to assay genome-wide methylation in these widely available resources. Recently, Thirlwell et al. (2010) have reported a modified ligation-based DNA repair protocol to prepare FFPE DNA for the Infinium methylation assay. In this study, we have tested the accuracy of methylation data obtained with this modification by comparing paired fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE colon tissue (normal and tumor) from colorectal cancer patients. We report locus-specific correlation and concordance of tumor-specific differentially methylated loci (DML), both of which were not previously assessed.METHODS: We used Illumina's Infinium Methylation 27K chip for 12 pairs of FF and 12 pairs of FFPE tissue from tumor and surrounding healthy tissue from the resected colon of the same individual, after repairing the FFPE DNA using Thirlwell's modified protocol.RESULTS: For both tumor and normal tissue, overall correlation of β values between all loci in paired FF and FFPE was comparable to previous studies. Tissue storage type (FF or FFPE) was found to be the most significant source of variation rather than tissue type (normal or tumor). We found a large number of DML between FF and FFPE DNA. Using ANOVA, we also identified DML in tumor compared to normal tissue in both FF and FFPE samples, and out of the top 50 loci in both groups only 7 were common, indicating poor concordance. Likewise, while looking at the correlation of individual loci between FFPE and FF across the patients, less than 10% of loci showed strong correlation (r ≥ 0.6). Finally, we checked the effect of the ligation-based modification on the Infinium chemistry for SNP genotyping on an independent set of samples, which also showed poor performance.CONCLUSION: Ligation of FFPE DNA prior to the Infinium genome-wide methylation assay may detect a reasonable number of loci, but the numbers of detected loci are much fewer than in FF samples. More importantly, the concordance of DML detected between FF and FFPE DNA is suboptimal, and DML from FFPE tissues should be interpreted with great caution."

Genome wide analysis studies have identified sequence mutations causing loss-of-function that are associated with disease occurrence and severity. Epigenetic modifications, such DNA methylation, have also been implicated in many cancers but have yet to be examined in the East Asian population of colorectal cancer patients.METHODS: Biopsies of tumors and matched non-cancerous tissue types were obtained and genomic DNA was isolated and subjected to the bisulphite conversion method for comparative DNA methylation analysis on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip.RESULTS: Totals of 258 and 74 genes were found to be hyper- and hypo-methylated as compared to the individual's matched control tissue. Interestingly, three genes that exhibited hypermethylation in their promoter regions, CMTM2, ECRG4, and SH3GL3, were shown to be significantly associated with colorectal cancer in previous studies. Using heatmap cluster analysis, eight hypermethylated and 10 hypomethylated genes were identified as significantly differentially methylated genes in the tumour tissues.CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide methylation profiling facilitates rapid and simultaneous analysis of cancerous cells which may help to identify methylation markers with high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and prognosis.

If a genome sequence is not available, an alternative strategy must be used. We previously reported the development of a pipeline (AGSNP) for genome-wide SNP discovery in coding sequences and other single-copy DNA without a complete genome sequence in self-pollinating (autogamous) plants. Here we updated this pipeline for SNP discovery in outcrossing (allogamous) species and demonstrated its efficacy in SNP discovery in walnut (Juglans regia L.).RESULTS: The first step in the original implementation of the AGSNP pipeline was the construction of a reference sequence and the identification of single-copy sequences in it. To identify single-copy sequences, multiple genome equivalents of short SOLiD reads of another individual were mapped to shallow genome coverage of long Sanger or Roche 454 reads making up the reference sequence. The relative depth of SOLiD reads was used to filter out repeated sequences from single-copy sequences in the reference sequence. The second step was a search for SNPs between SOLiD reads and the reference sequence. Polymorphism within the mapped SOLiD reads would have precluded SNP discovery; hence both individuals had to be homozygous. The AGSNP pipeline was updated here for using SOLiD or other type of short reads of a heterozygous individual for these two principal steps. A total of 32.6X walnut genome equivalents of SOLiD reads of vegetatively propagated walnut scion cultivar 'Chandler' were mapped to 48,661 'Chandler' bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences (BESs) produced by Sanger sequencing during the construction of a walnut physical map. A total of 22,799 putative SNPs were initially identified. A total of 6,000 Infinium II type SNPs evenly distributed along the walnut physical map were selected for the construction of an Infinium BeadChip, which was used to genotype a walnut mapping population having 'Chandler' as one of the parents. Genotyping results were used to adjust the filtering parameters of the updated AGSNP pipeline. With the adjusted filtering criteria, 69.6% of SNPs discovered with the updated pipeline were real and could be mapped on the walnut genetic map. A total of 13,439 SNPs were discovered by BES re-sequencing. BESs harboring SNPs were in 677 FPC contigs covering 98% of the physical map of the walnut genome.CONCLUSION: The updated AGSNP pipeline is a versatile SNP discovery tool for a high-throughput, genome-wide SNP discovery in both autogamous and allogamous species. With this pipeline, a large set of SNPs were identified in a single walnut cultivar."

However, other researchers analyzed DNA methylation arrays without performing data normalization considering that current normalizations for methylation data may distort real differences between normal and cancer samples because cancer genomes may be extensively subject to hypomethylation and the total amount of CpG methylation might differ substantially among samples. In this study, using eight datasets by Infinium HumanMethylation27 assay, we systemically analyzed the global distribution of DNA methylation changes in cancer compared to normal control and its effect on data normalization for selecting differentially methylated (DM) genes. We showed more differentially methylated (DM) genes could be found in the Quantile/Lowess-normalized data than in the non-normalized data. We found the DM genes additionally selected in the Quantile/Lowess-normalized data showed significantly consistent methylation states in another independent dataset for the same cancer, indicating these extra DM genes were effective biological signals related to the disease. These results suggested normalization can increase the power of detecting DM genes in the context of diagnostic markers which were usually characterized by relatively large effect sizes. Besides, we evaluated the reproducibility of DM discoveries for a particular cancer type, and we found most of the DM genes additionally detected in one dataset showed the same methylation directions in the other dataset for the same cancer type, indicating that these DM genes were effective biological signals in the other dataset. Furthermore, we showed that some DM genes detected from different studies for a particular cancer type were significantly reproducible at the functional level."

Compared with unmatched case-control studies with high-dimensional genomic or epigenetic data, there have been few variable selection methods for matched sets. In an earlier paper, we proposed the penalized logistic regression model for the analysis of unmatched DNA methylation data using a network-based penalty. However, for popularly applied matched designs in epigenetic studies that compare DNA methylation between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues or between pre-treatment and post-treatment conditions, applying ordinary logistic regression ignoring matching is known to bring serious bias in estimation. In this paper, we developed a penalized conditional logistic model using the network-based penalty that encourages a grouping effect of (1) linked Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites within a gene or (2) linked genes within a genetic pathway for analysis of matched DNA methylation data. In our simulation studies, we demonstrated the superiority of using conditional logistic model over unconditional logistic model in high-dimensional variable selection problems for matched case-control data. We further investigated the benefits of utilizing biological group or graph information for matched case-control data. We applied the proposed method to a genome-wide DNA methylation study on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) where we investigated the DNA methylation levels of tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from HCC patients by using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 Beadchip.

The methods currently used for monitoring CLL and determining conditions for treatment are limited in their ability to predict disease progression, patient survival, and response to therapy. Although clonal diversity and the acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities during the disease course (clonal evolution) have been associated with disease progression, their prognostic potential has been underappreciated because cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies have a restricted ability to detect genomic abnormalities and clonal evolution. We hypothesized that whole genome analysis using high resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays would be useful to detect diversity and infer clonal evolution to offer prognostic information. In this study, we used the Infinium Omni1 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) array for the analysis of genetic variation and percent mosaicism in 25 non-selected CLL patients to explore the prognostic value of the assessment of clonal diversity in patients with CLL. We calculated the percentage of mosaicism for each abnormality by applying a mathematical algorithm to the genotype frequency data and by manual determination using the Simulated DNA Copy Number (SiDCoN) tool, which was developed from a computer model of mosaicism. At least one genetic abnormality was identified in each case, and the SNP data was 98% concordant with FISH results. Clonal diversity, defined as the presence of two or more genetic abnormalities with differing percentages of mosaicism, was observed in 12 patients (48%), and the diversity correlated with the disease stage. Clonal diversity was present in most cases of advanced disease (Rai stages III and IV) or those with previous treatment, whereas 9 of 13 patients without detected clonal diversity were asymptomatic or clinically stable. In conclusion, SNP microarray studies with simultaneous evaluation of genomic alterations and mosaic distribution of clones can be used to assess apparent clonal evolution via analysis of clonal diversity. Since clonal evolution in CLL is strongly correlated with disease progression, whole genome SNP microarray analysis provides a new comprehensive and reliable prognostic tool for CLL patients."

The advances in second generation DNA sequencing provide opportunities to identify very large numbers of SNPs in a range of species. However, SNP identification remains a challenge for large and polyploid genomes due to their size and complexity. We have developed a pipeline for the robust identification of SNPs in large and complex genomes using Illumina second generation DNA sequence data and demonstrated this by the discovery of SNPs in the hexaploid wheat genome. We have developed a SNP discovery pipeline called SGSautoSNP (Second-Generation Sequencing AutoSNP) and applied this to discover more than 800,000 SNPs between four hexaploid wheat cultivars across chromosomes 7A, 7B and 7D. All SNPs are presented for download and viewing within a public GBrowse database. Validation suggests an accuracy of greater than 93% of SNPs represent polymorphisms between wheat cultivars and hence are valuable for detailed diversity analysis, marker assisted selection and genotyping by sequencing.

The influence of in utero exposure to AEDs on fetal DNA methylation was investigated. Genome-wide fetal epigenomic profiles were determined using the Infinium 27K BeadArray from Illumina (San Diego, CA, U.S.A.). The Infinium array measures approximately 27,000 CpG loci associated with 14,496 genes at single-nucleotide resolution. Eighteen cord blood samples (nine samples from babies exposed to AEDs and nine controls) from otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies were compared. Unsupervised hierarchic clustering was used to compare the calculated methylation profiles. A clear distinction between the methylation profiles of samples from babies exposed to AEDs in utero compared with controls was detected. These data provide evidence of an epigenetic effect associated with antenatal AED and high-dose folate supplementation during pregnancy. The differences in fetal DNA methylation of those exposed to AEDs shows that a genome-wide effect of methylation is evident. In addition, the epigenetic changes observed appear to be, in this limited sample, independent of extremes of birth weight centiles. These preliminary data highlight possible mechanisms by which AEDs might influence fetal outcomes and the potential of optimizing AED-specific folate supplementation regimens to offset these effects."

We report the discovery and genetic confirmation of copy number variable regions (CNVRs) in subjects of the San Antonio Family Heart and the San Antonio Family Diabetes Gallbladder Studies, both comprised of multigenerational pedigrees of Mexican American descent. In a discovery group of 1677 participants genotyped using Illumina Infinium Beadchips, we identified 2937 unique CNVRs, some with observation frequencies as low as 0.002, using a process that integrates pedigree information with CNV calls made by PennCNV and/or QuantiSNP. Quantitative copy number values had statistically significant (P ≤ 1.792e-5) heritability estimates ranging from 0.139 to 0.863 for 2776 CNVRs. Additionally, 920 CNVRs showed evidence of linkage to their genomic location, providing strong genetic confirmation. Linked CNVRs were enriched in a set of independently identified CNVRs from a second group of 380 samples, confirming that these CNVRs can be used as predefined CNVRs of high confidence. Interestingly, we identified 765 putatively novel variants that do not overlap with the Database of Genomic Variants. This study is the first to use linkage and heritability in multigenerational pedigrees as a confirmation approach for the discovery of CNVRs, and the largest study to date investigating copy number variation on a genome-wide scale in individuals of Mexican American descent. These results provide insight to the structural variation present in Mexican Americans and show the strength of multigenerational pedigrees to elucidate structural variation in the human genome."

The etiology of hypospadias remains largely unknown despite intensive investigations. Fetal androgens have a crucial role in genital differentiation. Recent studies have suggested that molecular mechanisms that underlie the effects of androgens on the fetus may involve disruption of epigenetic programming of gene expression during development. We assessed whether epigenetic modification of DNA methylation is associated with hypospadias in a case-control study of 12 hypospadias and 8 control subjects.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed on the study subjects using the Illumina Infinium® HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, which enables the direct investigation of methylation status of more than 485,000 individual CpG sites throughout the genome. The methylation level at each CpG site was compared between cases and controls using the t test and logistic regression.RESULTS: We identified 14 CpG sites that were associated with hypospadias with p &lt;0.00001. These CpG sites were in or near the SCARB1, MYBPH, SORBS1, LAMA4, HOXD11, MYO1D, EGFL7, C10orf41, LMAN1L and SULF1 genes. Two CpG sites in SCARB1 and MYBPH genes remained statistically significant after correction for multiple testing (p = 2.61 × 10(-09), p(corrected) = 0.008; p = 3.06 × 10(-08), p(corrected) = 0.02, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate hypospadias using a unique and novel epigenetic approach. Our findings suggest DNA methylation patterns are useful in identifying new genes such as SCARB1 and MYBPH that may be involved in the etiology of hypospadias."

This suggests that pesticides may cause cancer via nonmutagenicity mechanisms. The present study provides evidence to support the hypothesis that pesticide-induced cancer may be mediated in part by epigenetic mechanisms. We examined whether exposure to seven commonly used pesticides (i.e., fonofos, parathion, terbufos, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion, and phorate) induces DNA methylation alterations in vitro. We conducted genome-wide DNA methylation analyses on DNA samples obtained from the human hematopoietic K562 cell line exposed to ethanol (control) and several organophosphate pesticides (OPs) using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. Bayesian-adjusted t-tests were used to identify differentially methylated gene promoter CpG sites. In this report, we present our results on three pesticides (fonofos, parathion, and terbufos) that clustered together based on principle component analysis and hierarchical clustering. These three pesticides induced similar methylation changes in the promoter regions of 712 genes, while also exhibiting their own OP-specific methylation alterations. Functional analysis of methylation changes specific to each OP, or common to all three OPs, revealed that differential methylation was associated with numerous genes that are involved in carcinogenesis-related processes. Our results provide experimental evidence that pesticides may modify gene promoter DNA methylation levels, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to pesticide-induced carcinogenesis. Further studies in other cell types and human samples are required, as well as determining the impact of these methylation changes on gene expression."

Most of the major clinical features correspond to the well-known effects of haploinsufficiency of the MNX1 and SHH genes. In addition, review of the literature suggests an association of the 17p duplication with specific facial dysmorphic features and skeletal anomalies, but also an aggravating effect of the duplication-deletion for severe growth retardation as well as sacral and corpus callosum hypoplasia by one or more genes located on the proximal half of the segmental 17p duplication could be elaborated by comparison with other patients from the literature carrying either the deletion or the duplication found in our patient."

We investigate the application of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to this task, exploring data obtained from both cell lines and primary tissue for which both RNA and DNA profiles are available.RESULTS: We analyze data from two experiments that make use of high-density Illumina Infinium II genotyping arrays to measure ASE. We first preprocess each data set, which involves removal of outlier samples, careful normalization and a two-step filtering procedure to remove SNPs that show no evidence of expression in the samples being analyzed and calls that are clear genotyping errors. We then compare three different tests for detecting ASE, one of which has been previously published and two novel approaches. These tests vary at the level at which they operate (per SNP per individual or per SNP) and in the input data they require. Using SNPs from imprinted genes as true positives for ASE, we observe varying sensitivity for the different testing procedures that improves with increasing sample size. Methods that rely on RNA signal alone were found to perform best across a range of metrics. The top ranked SNPs recovered by all methods appear to be reasonable candidates for ASE.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Analysis was carried out in R (http://www.R-project.org/) using existing functions."

The use of clustering methods either for exploration of these data or to compare to an a priori grouping, e.g., normal versus disease allows assessment of groupings of data without user bias. However no consensus on the methods to use for clustering of methylation array approaches has been reached. To determine the most appropriate clustering method for analysis of illumina array methylation data, a collection of data sets was simulated and used to compare clustering methods. Both hierarchical clustering and non-hierarchical clustering methods (k-means, k-medoids, and fuzzy clustering algorithms) were compared using a range of distance and linkage methods. As no single method consistently outperformed others across different simulations, we propose a method to capture the best clustering outcome based on an additional measure, the silhouette width. This approach produced a consistently higher cluster accuracy compared to using any one method in isolation."

However, association analyses have yet to provide support for any etiologically relevant variants.METHODS: We analyzed 2988 LD-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 327 genes on chromosome 20, to test for association with schizophrenia in 270 Irish high-density families (ISHDSF, N = 270 families, 1408 subjects). These SNPs were genotyped using an Illumina iSelect genotyping array which employs the Infinium assay. Given a previous report of novel linkage with chromosome 20p using latent classes of psychotic illness in this sample, association analysis was also conducted for each of five factor-derived scores based on the Operational Criteria Checklist for Psychotic Illness (delusions, hallucinations, mania, depression, and negative symptoms). Tests of association were conducted using the PDTPHASE and QPDTPHASE packages of UNPHASED. Empirical estimates of gene-wise significance were obtained by adaptive permutation of a) the smallest observed P-value and b) the threshold-truncated product of P-values for each locus.RESULTS: While no single variant was significant after LD-corrected Bonferroni-correction, our gene-dropping analyses identified loci which exceeded empirical significance criteria for both gene-based tests. Namely, R3HDML and C20orf39 are significantly associated with depressive symptoms of schizophrenia (P(emp)&lt;2×10⁻⁵) based on the minimum P-value and truncated-product methods, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Using a gene-based approach to family-based association, R3HDML and C20orf39 were found to be significantly associated with clinical dimensions of schizophrenia. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of gene-based analysis and support previous evidence that chromosome 20 may harbor schizophrenia susceptibility or modifier loci."

It has two main plasma components: protein C and protein S. Individuals with protein C or protein S deficiency present a dramatically increased incidence of thromboembolic disorders. Here, we present the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for protein C and protein S plasma levels in a set of extended pedigrees from the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia (GAIT) Project. A total number of 397 individuals from 21 families were typed for 307,984 SNPs using the Infinium® 317 k Beadchip (Illumina). Protein C and protein S (free, functional and total) plasma levels were determined with biochemical assays for all participants. Association with phenotypes was investigated through variance component analysis. After correcting for multiple testing, two SNPs for protein C plasma levels (rs867186 and rs8119351) and another two for free protein S plasma levels (rs1413885 and rs1570868) remained significant on a genome-wide level, located in and around the PROCR and the DNAJC6 genomic regions respectively. No SNPs were significantly associated with functional or total protein S plasma levels, although rs1413885 from DNAJC6 showed suggestive association with the functional protein S phenotype, possibly indicating that this locus plays an important role in protein S metabolism. Our results provide evidence that PROCR and DNAJC6 might play a role in protein C and free protein S plasma levels in the population studied, warranting further investigation on the role of these loci in the etiology of venous thromboembolism and other thrombotic diseases."

Algorithms to identify CNVs through SNP-array platforms are available. The ability to evaluate well-characterized CNVs such as GSTM1 (1p13.3) deletion provides an important opportunity to assess their performance.RESULTS: 773 cases and 759 controls from the SBC/EPICURO Study were genotyped in the GSTM1 region using TaqMan, Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), and Illumina Infinium 1 M SNP-array platforms. CNV callings provided by TaqMan and MLPA were highly concordant and replicated the association between GSTM1 and bladder cancer. This was not the case when CNVs were called using Illumina 1 M data through available algorithms since no deletion was detected across the study samples. In contrast, when the Log R Ratio (LRR) was used as a continuous measure for the 5 probes contained in this locus, we were able to detect their association with bladder cancer using simple regression models or more sophisticated methods such as the ones implemented in the CNVtools package.CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights an important limitation in the CNV calling from SNP-array data in regions of common aberrations and suggests that there may be added advantage for using LRR as a continuous measure in association tests rather than relying on calling algorithms."

Decidual natural killer cells (dNKs) directly contact with cytotrophoblasts in the early stage of pregnancy. dNKs may affect DNA methylation of extravillous cytotrophoblasts (EVTs) directly or indirectly through their secreted soluble factors.OBJECTIVES: Previously, we showed that EVT outgrowth and migration on collagen gel were restricted by exposure to dNK or dNK-derived conditioned medium (dNK-CM) (ref [1]). The aim of this study was to determine if EVT DNA methylation was altered by treating with dNK or dNK-CM.METHODS: Placental explants collected from 6 first-trimester healthy pregnancy terminations were cultured on a rat collagen gel model. Outgrowth EVTs from each subject were treated with medium or concordant dNK (trapped inside of hollow fibers) or dNK-CM. EVTs were harvested after 96-hour co-culturing and underwent DNA extraction. DNA methylation was quantified using the Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip, which targets over 450,000 CpG sites in the human genome. Differential methylation was defined by having p&lt;0.05 (Student's t-test) and average DNA methylation change &gt;10% before and after treatments. Functional enrichment was assessed by gene ontology analysis with False Discovery Rate &lt;10% defined as significantly enriched.RESULTS: Increased DNA methylation was observed for 360 loci and 572 loci by dNK or dNK-CM respectively, and decreased DNA methylation was shown for 62 loci and 188 loci by dNK or dNK-CM respectively. DNA methylation at 44 loci was altered by both dNK and dNK-CM. The common loci were overrepresented for associations with EVT differentiation, adhesion and migration. Examples of the relevant overlapped loci with increased DNA methylations were MYO15A and PRDM16 (PR domain zinc finger protein 16); and the overlapped loci with reduced DNA methylation were CDH9 and USP29 (ubiquitin specific protein 29). dNK but not dNK-CM reduced IL18 methylation and increased methylation on ITGAL (integrin, alpha L) and ITGB7. dNK-CM but not dNK reduced methylation of ITGAD and PCDH8 (protocadherin 8) and increased methylation of CDH4 and CDH6.CONCLUSION: DNA methylation of EVT was altered by exposure to surrounding dNK and their secreted soluble molecules. These results serve as a basis for further investigations on whether DNA methylation can mediate the changes in protein expression that influence EVT differentiation, adhesion and migration."

Thus far, numerous disease susceptibility loci have been identified for this cancer but definite locus-specific information is not yet established due to the tremendous amount of genetic and disease heterogeneity; additionally, despite high prevalence of prostate cancer amongst African American men, this population has been under represented in genetic studies of prostate cancer.METHODS: In order to identify the susceptible locus (loci) for prostate cancer in African Americans, we have performed linkage analyses on members of 15 large high-risk families. Specifically, these families were recruited from Louisiana and represent a uniquely admixed African American population exclusive to Southern Louisiana. In addition to geographical constraints, these families were clinically homogeneous creating a well-characterized collection of large pedigrees. The families were genotyped with Illumina Infinium II SNP HumanLinkage-12 panel and extensive demographic and clinical information was documented from the hospital pathological reports and family interviews.RESULTS: We identified two novel regions, 12q24 and 2p16, with suggestive evidence of linkage under the dominant model of inheritance.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time that chromosome 12q24 (HLOD = 2.21) and 2p16 (HLOD = 1.97) has been shown to be associated with prostate cancer in high-risk African American families. These results provide insight to prostate cancer in an exceptional, well-characterized African American population, and illustrate the significance of utilizing large unique, but homogenous pedigrees."

Since the implementation of modern high-resolution SNP- and CGH-array techniques more cases have been reported. Here, we present an almost 5-year-old boy with intellectual disability, minor dysmorphisms, febrile seizures, and a de novo deletion of 834.2 kb on 19p13.2 encompassing 32 genes. The deletion was found by the Illumina Infinium HD Human1M-Duo v1 BeadChip SNP-array and confirmed by the NimbleGen Human CGH 2.1M Whole Genome Tiling v2.0D oligonucleotide array. PCR amplification of the junction fragment and subsequent sequencing defined the breakpoints and indicated that formation was mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR).

Recently, a major extension of the previous Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip® (Illumina, Inc. CA, USA), called Infinium HumanMethylation450 (Infinium Methylation 450K; Illumina, Inc. CA, USA) was developed. This upgraded technology is a hybrid of two different chemical assays, the Infinium I and Infinium II assays, allowing (for 12 samples in parallel) assessment of the methylation status of more than 480,000 cytosines distributed over the whole genome. In this article, we evaluate Infinium Methylation 450K on cell lines and tissue samples, highlighting some of its advantages but also some of its limitations. In particular, we compare the methylation values of the Infinium I and Infinium II assays.MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: We used Infinium Methylation 450K to profile: first, the well-characterized HCT116 wild-type and double-knockout cell lines and then, 16 breast tissue samples (including eight normal and eight primary tumor samples). Absolute methylation values (β-values) were extracted with the GenomeStudio™ software and then subjected to detailed analysis.RESULTS: While this technology appeared highly robust as previously shown, we noticed a divergence between the β-values retrieved from the type I and type II Infinium assays. Specifically, the β-values obtained from Infinium II probes were less accurate and reproducible than those obtained from Infinium I probes. This suggests that data from the type I and type II assays should be considered separately in any downstream bioinformatic analysis. To be able to deal with the Infinium I and Infinium II data together, we developed and tested a new correction technique, which we called 'peak-based correction'. The idea was to rescale the Infinium II data on the basis of the Infinium I data. While this technique should be viewed as an approximation method, it significantly improves the quality of Infinium II data.CONCLUSION: Infinium 450K is a powerful technique in terms of reagent costs, time of labor, sample throughput and coverage. It holds great promise for the better understanding of the epigenetic component in health and disease. Yet, due to the nature of its design comprising two different chemical assays, analysis of the whole set of data is not as easy as initially anticipated. Correction strategies, such as the peak-based approach proposed here, are a step towards adequate output data analysis."

Estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumors displayed more hypermethylated loci than estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors. However, the hypermethylated loci in ER-negative tumors were clustered closer to the transcriptional start site compared with ER-positive tumors. An ER-classifier set of CpG loci was identified, which independently partitioned primary tumors into ER subtypes. A total of 40 (32 novel and 8 previously known) CpG loci showed differential methylation specific to either ER-positive or ER-negative tumors. Each of the 40 ER subtype-specific loci was validated in silico, using an independent, publicly available methylome dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, we identified 100 methylated CpG loci that were significantly associated with disease progression; the majority of these loci were informative particularly in ER-negative breast cancer. Overall, the set was highly enriched in homeobox containing genes. This pilot study shows the robustness of the breast cancer methylome and illustrates its potential to stratify and reveal biological differences between ER subtypes of breast cancer. Furthermore, it defines candidate ER-specific markers and identifies potential markers predictive of outcome within ER subgroups."

Environmental insults in utero may lead to changes in epigenetic mechanisms potentially affecting fetal development.OBJECTIVES: We examined associations between in utero exposures, infant growth, and methylation of repetitive elements and gene-associated DNA in human term placenta tissue samples.METHODS: Placental tissues and associated demographic and clinical data were obtained from subjects delivering at Women and Infants Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island (USA). Methylation levels of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) and the Alu element AluYb8 were determined in 380 placental samples from term deliveries using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Genomewide DNA methylation profiles were obtained in a subset of 184 samples using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray. Multiple linear regression, model-based clustering methods, and gene set enrichment analysis examined the association between birth weight percentile, demographic variables, and repetitive element methylation and gene-associated CpG locus methylation.RESULTS: LINE-1 and AluYb8 methylation levels were found to be significantly positively associated with birth weight percentile (p = 0.01 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively) and were found to differ significantly among infants exposed to tobacco smoke and alcohol. Increased placental AluYb8 methylation was positively associated with average methylation among CpG loci found in polycomb group target genes; developmentally related transcription factor binding sites were overrepresented for differentially methylated loci associated with both elements.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that repetitive element methylation markers, most notably AluYb8 methylation, may be susceptible to epigenetic alterations resulting from the intrauterine environment and play a critical role in mediating placenta function, and may ultimately inform on the developmental basis of health and disease."

To deal with these difficulties, an algorithmic framework known as Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA) was recently proposed.RESULTS: Based on the notion that data can be viewed as an interference pattern, reflecting the superposition of independent effects and random noise, we present a modified SVA, called Independent Surrogate Variable Analysis (ISVA), to identify features correlating with a phenotype of interest in the presence of potential confounding factors. Using simulated data, we show that ISVA performs well in identifying confounders as well as outperforming methods which do not adjust for confounding. Using four large-scale Illumina Infinium DNA methylation datasets subject to low signal to noise ratios and substantial confounding by beadchip effects and variable bisulfite conversion efficiency, we show that ISVA improves the identifiability of confounders and that this enables a framework for feature selection that is more robust to model misspecification and heterogeneous phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate similar improvements of ISVA across four mRNA expression datasets. Thus, ISVA should be useful as a feature selection tool in studies that are subject to confounding.AVAILABILITY: An R-package isva is available from www.cran.r-project.org."

In this study, we analyzed functional, genetic and epigenetic sequels of long-term culture in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Already within early passages the fibroblastoid colony-forming unit (CFU-f) frequency and the differentiation potential of MSC declined significantly. Relevant chromosomal aberrations were not detected by karyotyping and SNP-microarrays. Subsequently, we have compared DNA-methylation profiles with the Infinium HumanMethylation27 Bead Array and the profiles differed markedly in MSC derived from adipose tissue and bone marrow. Notably, all MSC revealed highly consistent senescence-associated modifications at specific CpG sites. These DNA-methylation changes correlated with histone marks of previously published data sets, such as trimethylation of H3K9, H3K27 and EZH2 targets. Taken together, culture expansion of MSC has profound functional implications - these are hardly reflected by genomic instability but they are associated with highly reproducible DNA-methylation changes which correlate with repressive histone marks. Therefore replicative senescence seems to be epigenetically controlled."

In continuation of this work, we have now isolated human dermal fibroblasts from young (&lt;23 years) and elderly donors (&gt;60 years) for comparison of their DNA methylation profiles using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 assay. In contrast to MSC, fibroblasts could not be induced towards adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineage and this is reflected by highly significant differences between the two cell types: 766 CpG sites were hyper-methylated and 752 CpG sites were hypo-methylated in fibroblasts in comparison to MSC. Strikingly, global DNA methylation profiles of fibroblasts from the same dermal region clustered closely together indicating that fibroblasts maintain positional memory even after in vitro culture. 75 CpG sites were more than 15% differentially methylated in fibroblasts upon aging. Very high hyper-methylation was observed in the aged group within the INK4A/ARF/INK4b locus and this was validated by pyrosequencing. Age-associated DNA methylation changes were related in fibroblasts and MSC but they were often regulated in opposite directions between the two cell types. In contrast, long-term culture associated changes were very consistent in fibroblasts and MSC. Epigenetic modifications at specific CpG sites support the notion that aging represents a coordinated developmental mechanism that seems to be regulated in a cell type specific manner."

In a search for autosomal sex-specific DNA methylation using this microarray, we discovered autosomal CpG loci showing significant methylation differences between the sexes. However, we found that the majority of these probes cross-reacted with sequences from sex chromosomes. Moreover, we determined that 6-10% of the microarray probes are non-specific and map to highly homologous genomic sequences. Using probes targeting different CpGs that are exact duplicates of each other, we investigated the precision of these repeat measurements and concluded that the overall precision of this microarray is excellent. In addition, we identified a small number of probes targeting CpGs that include single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Overall, our findings address several technical issues associated with the Illumina 27k microarray that, once considered, will enhance the analysis and interpretation of data generated from this platform."

HPV-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) have distinct risk profiles and appreciate a prognostic advantage compared to HPV-negative HNSCC. Promoter hypermethylation is widely recognized as a mechanism in the progression of HNSCC, but the extent to which this mechanism is consistent between HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumors is unknown. To investigate the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in HPV-induced and carcinogen-induced cancers, we examined genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression in HPV(+) and HPV(-) SCC cell lines. We used two platforms: the Illumina Infinium Methylation BeadArray and tiling arrays, and confirmed illustrative examples with pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR. These analyses indicate that HPV(+) cell lines have higher DNA methylation in genic and LINE-1 regions than HPV(-) cell lines. Differentially methylated loci between HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines significantly correlated with HPV-typed HNSCC primary tumor DNA methylation levels. Novel findings include higher promoter methylation of polycomb repressive complex 2 target genes in HPV(+) cells compared to HPV(-) cells and increased expression of DNMT3A in HPV(+) cells. Additionally, CDKN2A and KRT8 were identified as interaction hubs among genes with higher methylation and lower expression in HPV(-) cells. Conversely, RUNX2, IRS-1 and CCNA1 were major hubs with higher methylation and lower expression in HPV(+) cells. Distinct HPV(+) and HPV(-) epigenetic profiles should provide clues to novel targets for development of individualized therapeutic strategies."

Consistent with the previous studies showing that CpG island-containing promoters of genes subject to XCI are approximately 50% methylated in females and unmethylated in males while genes which escape XCI are unmethylated in both sexes; our chromosome-wide (Methylated DNA ImmunoPrecipitation) and promoter-targeted methylation analyses (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 array) showed the largest methylation difference (D = 0.12, p &lt; 2.2 E-16) between male and female blood at X-linked CpG islands promoters. We used the methylation differences between males and females to predict XCI statuses in blood and found that 81% had the same XCI status as previously determined using expression data. Most genes (83%) showed the same XCI status across tissues (blood, fetal: muscle, kidney and nerual); however, the methylation of a subset of genes predicted different XCI statuses in different tissues. Using previously published expression data the effect of transcription on gene-body methylation was investigated and while X-linked introns of highly expressed genes were more methylated than the introns of lowly expressed genes, exonic methylation did not differ based on expression level. We conclude that the XCI status predicted using methylation of X-linked promoters with CpG islands was usually the same as determined by expression analysis and that 12% of X-linked genes examined show tissue-specific XCI whereby a gene has a different XCI status in at least one of the four tissues examined."

The current study examined differential methylation among 14 children raised since birth in institutional care and 14 comparison children raised by their biological parents. Blood samples were taken from children in middle childhood. Analysis of whole-genome methylation patterns was performed using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip assay (Illumina), which contains 27,578 CpG sites, covering approximately 14,000 gene promoters. Group differences were registered, which were characterized primarily by greater methylation in the institutionalized group relative to the comparison group, with most of these differences in genes involved in the control of immune response and cellular signaling systems, including a number of crucial players important for neural communication and brain development and functioning. The findings suggest that patterns of differential methylation seen in nonhuman species with altered maternal care are also characteristic of children who experience early maternal separation."
"22171553";"Infinium";"Infinium";"BMC Med Genomics";25;2011;"Batch effect correction for genome-wide methylation data with Illumina Infinium platform.";"BACKGROUND: Genome-wide methylation profiling has led to more comprehensive insights into gene regulation mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Illumina Human Methylation BeadChip is one of the most commonly used genome-wide methylation platforms. Similar to other microarray experiments, methylation data is susceptible to various technical artifacts, particularly batch effects. To date, little attention has been given to issues related to normalization and batch effect correction for this kind of data.METHODS: We evaluated three common normalization approaches and investigated their performance in batch effect removal using three datasets with different degrees of batch effects generated from HumanMethylation27 platform: quantile normalization at average β value (QNβ); two step quantile normalization at probe signals implemented in &quot;lumi&quot; package of R (lumi); and quantile normalization of A and B signal separately (ABnorm). Subsequent Empirical Bayes (EB) batch adjustment was also evaluated.RESULTS: Each normalization could remove a portion of batch effects and their effectiveness differed depending on the severity of batch effects in a dataset. For the dataset with minor batch effects (Dataset 1), normalization alone appeared adequate and &quot;lumi&quot; showed the best performance. However, all methods left substantial batch effects intact in the datasets with obvious batch effects and further correction was necessary. Without any correction, 50 and 66 percent of CpGs were associated with batch effects in Dataset 2 and 3, respectively. After QNβ, lumi or ABnorm, the number of CpGs associated with batch effects were reduced to 24, 32, and 26 percent for Dataset 2; and 37, 46, and 35 percent for Dataset 3, respectively. Additional EB correction effectively removed such remaining non-biological effects. More importantly, the two-step procedure almost tripled the numbers of CpGs associated with the outcome of interest for the two datasets.CONCLUSION: Genome-wide methylation data from Infinium Methylation BeadChip can be susceptible to batch effects with profound impacts on downstream analyses and conclusions. Normalization can reduce part but not all batch effects. EB correction along with normalization is recommended for effective batch effect removal."

In order to investigate this fully, it is essential to first document temporal changes in epigenetic profile in disease-free individuals as a prelude to defining environmentally mediated changes. Mononuclear cells (MC) were collected longitudinally from a small number of females at birth, 1 year, 2.5 years and 5 years of age and examined for changes in genome-scale DNA methylation profiles using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array platform. MC from two males were included for comparative purposes. Flow cytometry was used to define MC cell populations in each sample in order to exclude this as the major driver of epigenetic change. The data underwent quality control and normalization within the R programming environment. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of samples clearly delineated neonatal MC from all other ages. A further clear distinction was observed between 1 year and 5 year samples, with 2.5 year samples showing a mixed distribution between the 1 and 5 year groups. Gene ontology of probes significantly variable over the neonatal period revealed methylation changes in genes associated with cell surface receptor and signal transduction events. In the postnatal period, methylation changes were mostly associated with the development of effector immune responses and homeostasis. Unlike all other chromosomes tested, a predominantly genetic effect was identified as controlling maintenance of X-chromosome methylation profile in females, largely refractory to change over time. This data suggests that the primary driver of neonatal epigenome is determined in utero, whilst postnatally, multiple genetic and environmental factors are implicated in the development of MC epigenetic profile, particularly between the ages of 1-5 years, when the highest level of inter individual variation is apparent. This supports a model for differential sensitivity of specific individuals to disruption in the developing epigenome during the first years of life. Further studies are now needed to examine evolving epigenetic variations in specific cell populations in relation to environmental exposures, immune phenotype and subsequent disease susceptibility."

The degree to which these processes are coordinated is unclear so we investigated both in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Global methylation was measured using the luminometric methylation assay (LUMA) and pyrosequencing of LINE-1Hs and AluYb8 repetitive elements in a series of 138 tumors. We also measured methylation of more than 27,000 CpG loci with the Illumina HumanMethylation27 Microarray (n = 91).RESULTS: LINE-1 methylation was significantly associated with LUMA and Infinium loci methylation (Spearman's ρ = 0.52/ρ = 0.56, both P &lt; 0.001) but not that of AluYb8. Methylation of LINE-1, AluYb8, and Infinium loci differed by tumor site (each Kruskal-Wallis, P &lt; 0.05). Also, LINE-1 and LUMA methylation were associated with HPV16 E6 serology (each Mann-Whitney, P &lt; 0.05). Comparing LINE-1 methylation to gene-associated methylation, we identified a distinct subset of CpG loci with significant hypermethylation associated with LINE-1 hypomethylation. An investigation of sequence features for these CpG loci revealed that they were significantly less likely to reside in repetitive elements (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, P &lt; 0.02), enriched in CpG islands (P &lt; 0.001) and were proximal to transcription factor-binding sites (P &lt; 0.05). We validated the top CpG loci that had significant hypermethylation associated with LINE-1 hypomethylation (at EVI2A, IFRD1, KLHL6, and PTPRCAP) by pyrosequencing independent tumors.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that global hypomethylation and gene-specific methylation processes are associated in a sequence-dependent manner, and that clinical characteristics and exposures leading to HNSCC may be influencing these processes."

Aberrant promoter methylation accompanies human gastric carcinogenesis, though the contribution of EBV to such somatic methylation changes has not been fully clarified. We analyzed promoter methylation in gastric cancer cases with Illumina's Infinium BeadArray and used hierarchical clustering analysis to classify gastric cancers into 3 subgroups: EBV(-)/low methylation, EBV(-)/high methylation, and EBV(+)/high methylation. The 3 epigenotypes were characterized by 3 groups of genes: genes methylated specifically in the EBV(+) tumors (e.g., CXXC4, TIMP2, and PLXND1), genes methylated both in EBV(+) and EBV(-)/high tumors (e.g., COL9A2, EYA1, and ZNF365), and genes methylated in all of the gastric cancers (e.g., AMPH, SORCS3, and AJAP1). Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) target genes in embryonic stem cells were significantly enriched among EBV(-)/high-methylation genes and commonly methylated gastric cancer genes (P = 2 × 10(-15) and 2 × 10(-34), respectively), but not among EBV(+) tumor-specific methylation genes (P = 0.2), suggesting a different cause for EBV(+)-associated de novo methylation. When recombinant EBV was introduced into the EBV(-)/low-methylation epigenotype gastric cancer cell, MKN7, 3 independently established subclones displayed increases in DNA methylation. The promoters targeted by methylation were mostly shared among the 3 subclones, and the new methylation changes caused gene repression. In summary, DNA methylation profiling classified gastric cancer into 3 epigenotypes, and EBV(+) gastric cancers showed distinct methylation patterns likely attributable to EBV infection."

Recent work has identified changes in the expression of candidate genes, often through epigenetic alteration, which alter the placenta's function and impact fetal growth. In this study, we used the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array to examine genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in 206 term human placentas. Semi-supervised recursively partitioned mixture modeling was implemented to identify specific patterns of placental DNA methylation that could differentially classify intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and small for gestational age (SGA) placentas from appropriate for gestational age (AGA) placentas, and these associations were validated in a masked testing series of samples. Our work demonstrates that patterns of DNA methylation in human placenta are reliably and significantly associated with infant growth and serve as a proof of principle that methylation status in the human term placenta can function as a marker for the intrauterine environment, and could potentially play a critical functional role in fetal development."

Large-scale sequence datasets generated primarily through Sanger Expressed Sequence Tag projects are available from a limited number of potato cultivars and access to next generation sequencing technologies permits rapid generation of sequence data for additional cultivars. When coupled with the advent of high throughput genotyping methods, an opportunity now exists for potato breeders to incorporate considerably more genotypic data into their decision-making.RESULTS: To identify a large number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in elite potato germplasm, we sequenced normalized cDNA prepared from three commercial potato cultivars: 'Atlantic', 'Premier Russet' and 'Snowden'. For each cultivar, we generated 2 Gb of sequence which was assembled into a representative transcriptome of ~28-29 Mb for each cultivar. Using the Maq SNP filter that filters read depth, density, and quality, 575,340 SNPs were identified within these three cultivars. In parallel, 2,358 SNPs were identified within existing Sanger sequences for three additional cultivars, 'Bintje', 'Kennebec', and 'Shepody'. Using a stringent set of filters in conjunction with the potato reference genome, we identified 69,011 high confidence SNPs from these six cultivars for use in genotyping with the Infinium platform. Ninety-six of these SNPs were used with a BeadXpress assay to assess allelic diversity in a germplasm panel of 248 lines; 82 of the SNPs proved sufficiently informative for subsequent analyses. Within diverse North American germplasm, the chip processing market class was most distinct, clearly separated from all other market classes. The round white and russet market classes both include fresh market and processing cultivars. Nevertheless, the russet and round white market classes are more distant from each other than processing are from fresh market types within these two groups.CONCLUSIONS: The genotype data generated in this study, albeit limited in number, has revealed distinct relationships among the market classes of potato. The SNPs identified in this study will enable high-throughput genotyping of germplasm and populations, which in turn will enable more efficient marker-assisted breeding efforts in potato."

We performed a genome-wide analysis of sperm DNA methylation and mRNA content to test for associations with sperm function.METHODS AND RESULTS: Sperm DNA and mRNA were isolated from 21 men with a range of semen parameters presenting to a tertiary male reproductive health clinic. DNA methylation was measured with the Illumina Infinium array at 27,578 CpG loci. Unsupervised clustering of methylation data differentiated the 21 sperm samples by their motility values. Recursively partitioned mixture modeling (RPMM) of methylation data resulted in four distinct methylation profiles that were significantly associated with sperm motility (P = 0.01). Linear models of microarray analysis (LIMMA) was performed based on motility and identified 9,189 CpG loci with significantly altered methylation (Q&lt;0.05) in the low motility samples. In addition, the majority of these disrupted CpG loci (80%) were hypomethylated. Of the aberrantly methylated CpGs, 194 were associated with imprinted genes and were almost equally distributed into hypermethylated (predominantly paternally expressed) and hypomethylated (predominantly maternally expressed) groups. Sperm mRNA was measured with the Human Gene 1.0 ST Affymetrix GeneChip Array. LIMMA analysis identified 20 candidate transcripts as differentially present in low motility sperm, including HDAC1 (NCBI 3065), SIRT3 (NCBI 23410), and DNMT3A (NCBI 1788). There was a trend among altered expression of these epigenetic regulatory genes and RPMM DNA methylation class.CONCLUSIONS: Using integrative genome-wide approaches we identified CpG methylation profiles and mRNA alterations associated with low sperm motility."

We also validated the Illumina Infinium methylation data for top-ranking genes by non-bisulfite conversion q-PCR-based methyl profiler assay in a subset of the same samples. We also carried out integration of genome-wide copy number and expression microarray along with methylation profiling to see the functional effect of methylation. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that among the major &quot;gene sets&quot; that are hypermethylated in CRC are the sets: &quot;inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by G-protein signaling&quot;, &quot;Rac guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity&quot;, &quot;regulation of retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway&quot; and &quot;estrogen receptor activity&quot;. Two-level nested cross validation showed that DML-based predictive models may offer reasonable sensitivity (around 89%), specificity (around 95%), positive predictive value (around 95%) and negative predictive value (around 89%), suggesting that these markers may have potential clinical application.CONCLUSION: Our genome-wide methylation study in CRC clearly supports most of the previous findings; additionally we found a large number of novel DML in CRC tissue. If confirmed in future studies, these findings may lead to identification of genomic markers for potential clinical application."

Aside from large cohorts, GWAS have generally been limited to the study of one or a few diseases or traits. The emergence of biobanks linked to electronic medical records (EMRs) allows the efficient reuse of genetic data to yield meaningful genotype-phenotype associations for multiple phenotypes or traits. Phase I of the electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE-I) Network is a National Human Genome Research Institute-supported consortium composed of five sites to perform various genetic association studies using DNA repositories and EMR systems. Each eMERGE site has developed EMR-based algorithms to comprise a core set of 14 phenotypes for extraction of study samples from each site's DNA repository. Each eMERGE site selected samples for a specific phenotype, and these samples were genotyped at either the Broad Institute or at the Center for Inherited Disease Research using the Illumina Infinium BeadChip technology. In all, approximately 17,000 samples from across the five sites were genotyped. A unified quality control (QC) pipeline was developed by the eMERGE Genomics Working Group and used to ensure thorough cleaning of the data. This process includes examination of sample and marker quality and various batch effects. Upon completion of the genotyping and QC analyses for each site's primary study, eMERGE Coordinating Center merged the datasets from all five sites. This larger merged dataset reentered the established eMERGE QC pipeline. Based on lessons learned during the process, additional analyses and QC checkpoints were added to the pipeline to ensure proper merging. Here, we explore the challenges associated with combining datasets from different genotyping centers and describe the expansion to eMERGE QC pipeline for merged datasets. These additional steps will be useful as the eMERGE project expands to include additional sites in eMERGE-II, and also serve as a starting point for investigators merging multiple genotype datasets accessible through the National Center for Biotechnology Information in the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. Our experience demonstrates that merging multiple datasets after additional QC can be an efficient use of genotype data despite new challenges that appear in the process."

The current pilot study aims to investigate whether epigenetic changes affecting breast cancer risk could be caused by circadian disruption through exposure to light at night. Archived DNA samples extracted from whole blood of 117 female subjects from a prospective cohort conducted in Denmark were included in this study. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method was used for detection of gene-promoter methylation, whereas genome-wide methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation Chip. Long-term shiftwork resulted in the same promoter hypomethylation of CLOCK and hypermethylation of CRY2, as was previously observed in breast cancer case-control studies. Genome-wide methylation analysis further discovered widespread methylation alterations in shiftworkers, including changes in many methylation- and cancer-relevant genes. Pathway analysis of the genes with altered methylation patterns revealed several cancer-related pathways. One of the top three networks generated was designated as &quot;DNA replication, recombination, and repair, gene expression, behavior&quot; with ESR1 (estrogen receptor α) featured most prominently in the network, underscoring the potential breast cancer relevance of the genes differentially methylated in long-term shiftworkers. These results, although exploratory, demonstrate the first evidence of the cancer-relevant epigenetic effects of night shiftwork, which warrant further investigation. Considering there are millions of shiftworkers worldwide, understanding the effects of this exposure may lead to novel strategies for cancer prevention and new policies regulating shiftwork."

Epigenetic mechanisms are attractive targets in the study of complex diseases because they may be altered by environmental factors and dietary interventions. We conducted a population based, case-control study of genome-wide maternal DNA methylation to determine if alterations in gene-specific methylation were associated with CHDs. Using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation27 BeadChip, we assessed maternal gene-specific methylation in over 27,000 CpG sites from DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Our study sample included 180 mothers with non-syndromic CHD-affected pregnancies (cases) and 187 mothers with unaffected pregnancies (controls). Using a multi-factorial statistical model, we observed differential methylation between cases and controls at multiple CpG sites, although no CpG site reached the most stringent level of genome-wide statistical significance. The majority of differentially methylated CpG sites were hypermethylated in cases and located within CpG islands. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that the genes of interest were enriched in multiple biological processes involved in fetal development. Associations with canonical pathways previously shown to be involved in fetal organogenesis were also observed. We present preliminary evidence that alterations in maternal DNA methylation may be associated with CHDs. Our results suggest that further studies involving maternal epigenetic patterns and CHDs are warranted. Multiple candidate processes and pathways for future study have been identified."

This is due to genomic imprinting, an epigenetic mechanism that results in parent-of-origin monoallelic expression of genes regulated by germline-derived allelic methylation. To date, ∼100 imprinted transcripts have been identified in mouse, with approximately two-thirds showing conservation in humans. It is currently unknown how many imprinted genes are present in humans, and to what extent these transcripts exhibit human-specific imprinted expression. This is mainly due to the fact that the majority of screens for imprinted genes have been undertaken in mouse, with subsequent analysis of the human orthologues. Utilizing extremely rare reciprocal genome-wide uniparental disomy samples presenting with Beckwith-Wiedemann and Silver-Russell syndrome-like phenotypes, we analyzed ∼0.1% of CpG dinculeotides present in the human genome for imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using the Illumina Infinium methylation27 BeadChip microarray. This approach identified 15 imprinted DMRs associated with characterized imprinted domains, and confirmed the maternal methylation of the RB1 DMR. In addition, we discovered two novel DMRs, first, one maternally methylated region overlapping the FAM50B promoter CpG island, which results in paternal expression of this retrotransposon. Secondly, we found a paternally methylated, bidirectional repressor located between maternally expressed ZNF597 and NAT15 genes. These three genes are biallelically expressed in mice due to lack of differential methylation, suggesting that these genes have become imprinted after the divergence of mouse and humans."

A fundamental step in any analysis is the processing of raw allele A and allele B intensities from each SNP into genotype calls (AA, AB, BB). Various algorithms which make use of different statistical models are available for this task. We compare four methods (GenCall, Illuminus, GenoSNP and CRLMM) on data where the true genotypes are known in advance and data from a recently published genome-wide association study.RESULTS: In general, differences in accuracy are relatively small between the methods evaluated, although CRLMM and GenoSNP were found to consistently outperform GenCall. The performance of Illuminus is heavily dependent on sample size, with lower no call rates and improved accuracy as the number of samples available increases. For X chromosome SNPs, methods with sex-dependent models (Illuminus, CRLMM) perform better than methods which ignore gender information (GenCall, GenoSNP). We observe that CRLMM and GenoSNP are more accurate at calling SNPs with low minor allele frequency than GenCall or Illuminus. The sample quality metrics from each of the four methods were found to have a high level of agreement at flagging samples with unusual signal characteristics.CONCLUSIONS: CRLMM, GenoSNP and GenCall can be applied with confidence in studies of any size, as their performance was shown to be invariant to the number of samples available. Illuminus on the other hand requires a larger number of samples to achieve comparable levels of accuracy and its use in smaller studies (50 or fewer individuals) is not recommended."

Although previous studies on HCC methylation profiles have focused on liver tissue, studies using isolated hepatocytes are rare. The heterogeneity of liver composition may impact the genuine methylation status of HCC; therefore, it is important to clarify the methylation profile of hepatocytes to aid in understanding the process of tumorigenesis.METHODS AND FINDINGS: The global methylation profile of single hepatocytes isolated from liver tissue of hepatitis B virus (HBV) related HCC (HBHC) was analyzed using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation27 BeadChips, and combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and bisulfite sequencing were used to validate the 20 significant hypermethylated genes identified. In this study, we found many noteworthy differences in the genome-wide methylation profiles of single hepatocytes of HBHC. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis showed that hepatocyte methylation profiles could be classified according to three cell types: hepatocytes of HCC, adjacent hepatocytes and normal hepatocytes. Among the 20 most hypermethylated genes in the hepatocytes of HBHC, 7 novel genes (WNK2, EMILIN2, TLX3, TM6SF1, TRIM58, HIST1H4Fand GRASP) were found to be hypermethylated in HBHC and hypomethylated in paired adjacent liver tissues; these findings have not been reported in previous studies on tissue samples.CONCLUSION: The genome-wide methylation profile of purified single hepatocytes of HBHC was aided in understanding the process of tumorigenesis, and a series of novel methylated genes found in this study have the potential to be biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of HBHC."

User preference toward functional SNPs can also be taken into account as secondary criteria. SNPPicker can also optimize tag SNP selection for a panel tagging multiple populations. SNPPicker can optimize custom genotyping panels including all the assay-specific constraints of Illumina's GoldenGate and Infinium assays.CONCLUSIONS: A new application has been developed to maximize the success of custom multi-population genotyping panels. SNPPicker also takes into account user constraints including options for controlling runtime.

Archived residual dried blood spot (DBS) samples, also known as Guthrie cards, from national newborn screening programs may provide a DNA source for entire populations. Combined with clinical information from medical registries, DBS samples could provide a rich source for productive research. However, the amounts of DNA which can be extracted from these precious samples are minute and may be prohibitive for numerous genotypings. Previously, we demonstrated that DBS DNA can be whole-genome amplified and used for reliable genetic analysis on different platforms, including genome-wide scanning arrays. However, it remains unclear whether this approach is workable on a large sample scale. We examined the robustness of using DBS samples for whole-genome amplification following genome-wide scanning, using arrays from Illumina and Affymetrix.RESULTS: This study is based on 4,641 DBS samples from the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank, extracted for three separate genome-wide association studies. The amount of amplified DNA was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) affected by the year of storage and storage conditions. Nine (0.2%) DBS samples failed whole-genome amplification. A total of 4,586 (98.8%) samples met our criterion of success of a genetic call-rate above 97%. The three studies used different arrays, with mean genotyping call-rates of 99.385% (Illumina Infinium Human610-Quad), 99.722% (Illumina Infinium HD HumanOmni1-Quad), and 99.206% (Affymetrix Axiom Genome-Wide CEU). We observed a concordance rate of 99.997% in the 38 methodological replications, and 99.999% in the 27 technical replications. Handling variables such as time of storage, storage conditions and type of filter paper were shown too significantly (P &lt; 0.05) affect the genotype call-rates in some of the arrays, although the effect was minimal.CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that archived DBS samples from the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank represent a reliable resource of DNA for whole-genome amplification and subsequent genome-wide association studies. With call-rates equivalent to high quality DNA samples, our results point to new opportunities for using the neonatal biobanks available worldwide in the hunt for genetic components of disease."

Researchers can nowadays investigate the potential role of DNA methylation in common disorders by taking advantage of new high-throughput technologies. Among these, Illumina Infinium assays can interrogate the methylation levels of hundreds of thousands of CpG sites, offering an ideal solution for genome-wide methylation profiling. However, like for other high-throughput technologies, the main bottleneck remains at the stage of data analysis rather than data production.FINDINGS: We have developed HumMeth27QCReport, an R package devoted to researchers wanting to quickly analyse their Illumina Infinium methylation arrays. This package automates quality control steps by generating a report including sample-independent and sample-dependent quality plots, and performs primary analysis of raw methylation calls by computing data normalization, statistics, and sample similarities. This package is available at CRAN repository, and can be integrated in any Galaxy instance through the implementation of ad-hoc scripts accessible at Galaxy Tool Shed.CONCLUSIONS: Our package provides users of the Illumina Infinium Methylation assays with a simplified, automated, open-source quality control and primary analysis of their methylation data. Moreover, to enhance its use by experimental researchers, the tool is being distributed along with the scripts necessary for its implementation in the Galaxy workbench. Finally, although it was originally developed for HumanMethylation27, we proved its compatibility with data generated with the HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip."

Follow-up targeted methylation analysis was performed using bisulfite pyrosequencing.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S: Methylation levels at more than 27,000 CpGs genome-wide were compared between groups.RESULT(S: Of the 43 men analyzed, 40 displayed highly concordant methylation patterns; however, two men with abnormal protamine 1/protamine 2 and one abnormal embryogenesis patient displayed significantly altered methylation patterns across a large number of CpGs. Imprinted regions were more prone to deregulation than the genome at large.CONCLUSION(S: We have identified three individuals displaying broad disruption of sperm DNA methylation profiles. Although the sample set analyzed is relatively small, these results indicate that broad disruptions in sperm DNA methylation may be an important signature in some infertile men.

Recently, a meta-analysis on UC revealed several loci, most of which were either previously associated with UC or CD susceptibility in populations of European origin. In this study, we attempted to replicate these findings in an ethnically distinct north Indian UC cohort. 648 UC cases and 850 controls were genotyped using Infinium Human 660W-quad. Out of 59 meta-analysis index SNPs, six were not in the SNP array used in the study. Of the remaining 53 SNPs, four were found monomorphic. Association (p&lt;0.05) at 25 SNPs was observed, of which 15 were CD specific. Only five SNPs namely rs2395185 (HLA-DRA), rs3024505 (IL10), rs6426833 (RNF186), rs3763313 (BTNL2) and rs2066843 (NOD2) retained significance after Bonferroni correction. These results (i) reveal limited replication of Caucasian based meta-analysis results; (ii) reiterate overlapping molecular mechanism(s) in UC and CD; (iii) indicate differences in genetic architecture between populations; and (iv) suggest that resources such as HapMap need to be extended to cover diverse ethnic populations. They also suggest a systematic GWAS in this terrain may be insightful for identifying population specific IBD risk conferring loci and thus enable cross-ethnicity fine mapping of disease loci."

We developed a systematic multi-step biomarker discovery and verification strategy to identify candidate DNA methylation markers for the blood-based detection of ovarian cancer.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used the Illumina Infinium platform to analyze the DNA methylation status of 27,578 CpG sites in 41 ovarian tumors. We employed a marker selection strategy that emphasized sensitivity by requiring consistency of methylation across tumors, while achieving specificity by excluding markers with methylation in control leukocyte or serum DNA. Our verification strategy involved testing the ability of identified markers to monitor disease burden in serially collected serum samples from ovarian cancer patients who had undergone surgical tumor resection compared to CA-125 levels. We identified one marker, IFFO1 promoter methylation (IFFO1-M), that is frequently methylated in ovarian tumors and that is rarely detected in the blood of normal controls. When tested in 127 serially collected sera from ovarian cancer patients, IFFO1-M showed post-resection kinetics significantly correlated with serum CA-125 measurements in six out of 16 patients.SIGNIFICANCE: We implemented an effective marker screening and verification strategy, leading to the identification of IFFO1-M as a blood-based candidate marker for sensitive detection of ovarian cancer. Serum levels of IFFO1-M displayed post-resection kinetics consistent with a reflection of disease burden. We anticipate that IFFO1-M and other candidate markers emerging from this marker development pipeline may provide disease detection capabilities that complement existing biomarkers."

The genetic etiology of POAG is complex and poorly understood. The purpose of this work is to identify genomic regions of interest linked to POAG. This study is the largest genetic linkage study of POAG performed to date: genomic DNA samples from 786 subjects (538 Caucasian ancestry, 248 African ancestry) were genotyped using either the Illumina GoldenGate Linkage 4 Panel or the Illumina Infinium Human Linkage-12 Panel. A total of 5233 SNPs was analyzed in 134 multiplex POAG families (89 Caucasian ancestry, 45 African ancestry). Parametric and non-parametric linkage analyses were performed on the overall dataset and within race-specific datasets (Caucasian ancestry and African ancestry). Ordered subset analysis was used to stratify the data on the basis of age of glaucoma diagnosis. Novel linkage regions were identified on chromosomes 1 and 20, and two previously described loci-GLC1D on chromosome 8 and GLC1I on chromosome 15--were replicated. These data will prove valuable in the context of interpreting results from genome-wide association studies for POAG."

Scores of eye damage were collected at weaning on 858 Angus cattle. SNP genotypes for each animal were obtained from BovineSNP50 Infinium-beadchips. Simultaneous associations of all SNP with IBK phenotype were determined using Bayes-C that treats SNP effects as random with equal variance for an assumed fraction (π=0.999) of SNP having no effect on IBK scores. Bayes-C threshold models were used to estimate SNP effects by classifying IBK into two, three or nine ordered categories. Magnitudes of genetic variances estimated in localized regions across the genome indicated that SNP within the most informative regions accounted for much of the genetic variance of IBK and pointed out some degree of association to IBK. There are many candidate genes in these regions which could include a gene or group of genes associated with bacterial disease in cattle."

DNA was isolated from normal and pathologic parathyroid tissues, bisulphite modified and analyzed using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. Distinct hierarchical clustering of genes with altered DNA methylation profiles in normal and pathologic parathyroid tissue was evident. Comparing normal parathyroid tissue with parathyroid adenomas, 367 genes were significantly altered, while 175 genes significantly differed when comparing parathyroid carcinomas and normal parathyroid tissues. A comparison between parathyroid adenomas and parathyroid carcinomas identified 263 genes with significantly distinct methylation levels. Results were confirmed for certain genes in a validation cohort of 40 parathyroid adenomas by methylation-specific PCR. Genes of known or putative importance in the development of parathyroid tumors showed significant and frequent hypermethylation. DNA hypermethylation of CDKN2B, CDKN2A, WT1, SFRP1, SFRP2, and SFRP4 was associated with reduced gene expression in both benign and malignant parathyroid tumors. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine of primary cell cultures restores expression of hypermethylated genes in benign and malignant parathyroid tumors. In conclusion, the unbiased, genome-wide study of the parathyroid tumor DNA methylome identified a number of genes with altered DNA methylation patterns of putative importance to benign and malignant parathyroid tumorigenesis."

We conducted a genome-wide linkage study to identify loci influencing mammographic breast density (MD).METHODS: Epidemiological data were assembled on 1,415 families from the Australia, Northern California and Ontario sites of the Breast Cancer Family Registry, and additional families recruited in Australia and Ontario. Families consisted of sister pairs with age-matched mammograms and data on factors known to influence MD. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed on 3,952 individuals using the Illumina Infinium 6K linkage panel.RESULTS: Using a variance components method, genome-wide linkage analysis was performed using quantitative traits obtained by adjusting MD measurements for known covariates. Our primary trait was formed by fitting a linear model to the square root of the percentage of the breast area that was dense (PMD), adjusting for age at mammogram, number of live births, menopausal status, weight, height, weight squared, and menopausal hormone therapy. The maximum logarithm of odds (LOD) score from the genome-wide scan was on chromosome 7p14.1-p13 (LOD = 2.69; 63.5 cM) for covariate-adjusted PMD, with a 1-LOD interval spanning 8.6 cM. A similar signal was seen for the covariate adjusted area of the breast that was dense (DA) phenotype. Simulations showed that the complete sample had adequate power to detect LOD scores of 3 or 3.5 for a locus accounting for 20% of phenotypic variance. A modest peak initially seen on chromosome 7q32.3-q34 increased in strength when only the 513 families with at least two sisters below 50 years of age were included in the analysis (LOD 3.2; 140.7 cM, 1-LOD interval spanning 9.6 cM). In a subgroup analysis, we also found a LOD score of 3.3 for DA phenotype on chromosome 12.11.22-q13.11 (60.8 cM, 1-LOD interval spanning 9.3 cM), overlapping a region identified in a previous study.CONCLUSIONS: The suggestive peaks and the larger linkage signal seen in the subset of pedigrees with younger participants highlight regions of interest for further study to identify genes that determine MD, with the goal of understanding mammographic density and its involvement in susceptibility to breast cancer."

This study investigated the association of DAAM2 genetic polymorphism with the clinical outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We selected candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by DNA chip analysis using Illumina Infinium Human-1 microarrays™ on 15 patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT with (N = 7) or without (N = 8) acute graft versus host disease (GvHD). Six SNPs (rs2504787, rs2504086, rs2504082, rs3004067, rs882559, and rs3004070) of DAAM2 were associated with acute GvHD prevalence, and the genotyping was extended to larger population (N = 228). Medical records were reviewed to see the correlation of these SNPs with the clinical outcomes of the patients. In rs2504082 and rs882559, treatment-related mortality was significantly lower in major homozygote than other genotypes (29.3% in AA vs. 44.3% in AG or GG, p = 0.0214; 23.0% in CC vs. 39.9% in CG or GG, p = 0.0072, respectively).

These tissues are the derivatives of trophectoderm and inner cell mass of blastocyst and have substantial differences in dynamics of epigenetic genome reprogramming during early stages of differentiation. The genome of the extraembryonic mesoderm cells has been shown to be more methylated compared to the cytotrophoblast similarly to other mammalian species. Differences in methylation pattern of single CpG-dinucleotides and dinucleotides localized within promoter CpG-islands have been found. It has been shown that the majority of single CpG-dinucleotides in both tissues were methylated whereas promoter CpG-island sites were not. Comparative analysis revealed 202 differentially methylated genes in extraembryonic mesoderm and 40 genes in cytotrophoblast. These genes are responsible for diverse biological processes. However, in the extraembryonic mesoderm the main functional groups included genes responsible for DNA binding and transcriptional factors' activity whereas in the cytotrophoblast--for transport and protein and cytokine secretion."

Wheezing was noted more often in recipients of LAIV and laboratory-confirmed influenza infection was noted more often in recipients of TIV. We sought to determine whether epidemiologic or genetic factors were associated with these outcomes.METHODS: Atopy surveys and DNA collections were performed in trial participants at two United States sites, Nashville, TN and Boston, MA. DNA samples were genotyped on Illumina Infinium 610 or 660-Quad. Standard allelic tests of association were performed.RESULTS: At the Nashville and Boston sites, a total of 99 children completed the trial, 6 (1 TIV, 5 LAIV) developed medically attended wheezing within 42 days following vaccination, and 8 (5 TIV, 3 LAIV) developed laboratory-confirmed influenza during the season. Eighty-one surveys and 70 DNA samples were collected. Family history of asthma (p=0.001) was associated with wheezing after vaccination. Of 468,458 single nucleotide polymorphisms tested in the genome-wide association study (GWAS), none achieved genome-wide significance for either wheezing after vaccination or laboratory-confirmed influenza infection.CONCLUSIONS: Family history of asthma appears to be a risk factor for wheezing after influenza vaccination. Given the limitations of the sample size, our pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of performing a GWAS but was not able to determine genetic polymorphisms associated with wheezing after influenza immunization."

Genomic DNA extracts were bisulfite treated followed by detection with Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip Assays(Illumina, USA). Epigenetic distances between each pair of monozygotic twins and each pair of unrelated individuals of same gender were calculated with Euclidean distance algorithms. Distribution of epigenetic distance in monozygotic twin group was statistically compared with that in unrelated individuals.RESULTS: Difference of epigenetic distance between male and female pairs was not statistically significant in unrelated individual group or in monozygotic twin group (P = 0.0695 and 0.4825, respectively). Epigenetic distance of monozygotic twins was significantly lower than that of unrelated individual pair of same gender (Median: 6.02 vs 7.20, P = 0.0002).

The microarray-based Infinium methylation assay by Illumina is one platform for low-cost high-throughput methylation profiling. Both Beta-value and M-value statistics have been used as metrics to measure methylation levels. However, there are no detailed studies of their relations and their strengths and limitations.RESULTS: We demonstrate that the relationship between the Beta-value and M-value methods is a Logit transformation, and show that the Beta-value method has severe heteroscedasticity for highly methylated or unmethylated CpG sites. In order to evaluate the performance of the Beta-value and M-value methods for identifying differentially methylated CpG sites, we designed a methylation titration experiment. The evaluation results show that the M-value method provides much better performance in terms of Detection Rate (DR) and True Positive Rate (TPR) for both highly methylated and unmethylated CpG sites. Imposing a minimum threshold of difference can improve the performance of the M-value method but not the Beta-value method. We also provide guidance for how to select the threshold of methylation differences.CONCLUSIONS: The Beta-value has a more intuitive biological interpretation, but the M-value is more statistically valid for the differential analysis of methylation levels. Therefore, we recommend using the M-value method for conducting differential methylation analysis and including the Beta-value statistics when reporting the results to investigators."

Several methods have been developed to enrich for genomic regions of interest for targeted sequencing. We have compared three of these methods: Molecular Inversion Probes (MIP), Solution Hybrid Selection (SHS), and Microarray-based Genomic Selection (MGS). Using HapMap DNA samples, we compared each of these methods with respect to their ability to capture an identical set of exons and evolutionarily conserved regions associated with 528 genes (2.61 Mb). For sequence analysis, we developed and used a novel Bayesian genotype-assigning algorithm, Most Probable Genotype (MPG). All three capture methods were effective, but sensitivities (percentage of targeted bases associated with high-quality genotypes) varied for an equivalent amount of pass-filtered sequence: for example, 70% (MIP), 84% (SHS), and 91% (MGS) for 400 Mb. In contrast, all methods yielded similar accuracies of &gt;99.84% when compared to Infinium 1M SNP BeadChip-derived genotypes and &gt;99.998% when compared to 30-fold coverage whole-genome shotgun sequencing data. We also observed a low false-positive rate with all three methods; of the heterozygous positions identified by each of the capture methods, &gt;99.57% agreed with 1M SNP BeadChip, and &gt;98.840% agreed with the whole-genome shotgun data. In addition, we successfully piloted the genomic enrichment of a set of 12 pooled samples via the MGS method using molecular bar codes. We find that these three genomic enrichment methods are highly accurate and practical, with sensitivities comparable to that of 30-fold coverage whole-genome shotgun data."

There is increasing evidence to suggest that dysregulation of the epigenome is involved in diabetic nephropathy. We assessed whether epigenetic modification of DNA methylation is associated with diabetic nephropathy in a case-control study of 192 Irish patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Cases had T1D and nephropathy whereas controls had T1D but no evidence of renal disease.METHODS: We performed DNA methylation profiling in bisulphite converted DNA from cases and controls using the recently developed Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, that enables the direct investigation of 27,578 individual cytosines at CpG loci throughout the genome, which are focused on the promoter regions of 14,495 genes.RESULTS: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis indicated that significant components of DNA methylation variation correlated with patient age, time to onset of diabetic nephropathy, and sex. Adjusting for confounding factors using multivariate Cox-regression analyses, and with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05, we observed 19 CpG sites that demonstrated correlations with time to development of diabetic nephropathy. Of note, this included one CpG site located 18 bp upstream of the transcription start site of UNC13B, a gene in which the first intronic SNP rs13293564 has recently been reported to be associated with diabetic nephropathy.CONCLUSION: This high throughput platform was able to successfully interrogate the methylation state of individual cytosines and identified 19 prospective CpG sites associated with risk of diabetic nephropathy. These differences in DNA methylation are worthy of further follow-up in replication studies using larger cohorts of diabetic patients with and without nephropathy."

In the Australian GWAS, one SNP achieved genomewide significance (p &lt; 5 x 10(-8)) for ND (rs964170 in ARHGAP10 on chromosome 4, p = 4.43 x 10(-8)) and three others for comorbid AD/ND (rs7530302 near MARK1 on chromosome 1 (p = 1.90 x 10(-9)), rs1784300 near DDX6 on chromosome 11 (p = 2.60 x 10(-9)) and rs12882384 in KIAA1409 on chromosome 14 (p = 4.86 x 10(-8))). None of the SNPs achieved genomewide significance in the Australian/Dutch meta-analysis, but a gene network diagram based on the top-results revealed overrepresentation of genes coding for ion-channels and cell adhesion molecules. Further studies will be required before the detailed causes of comorbidity between AD and ND are understood."

Ability to accurately assess the DNA methylation status is therefore of great importance in health and disease. Recently, various platforms for genome-wide analysis of promoter DNA methylation have been developed, including the Illumina Infinium platform. While some of these platforms can be used with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, no protocol has yet been developed for the analysis of FFPE-derived DNA on the Infinium platform using the HumanMethylation27 BeadChip which interrogates 27,578 cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide sites, selected predominantly from the promoter regions of 14,000 annotated genes. As FFPE preservation has been the method of choice for the archiving of clinical samples, the ability to analyse such samples opens the possibility to study large numbers of clinically well annotated samples which can be expected to lead to more powerful and robust data, particularly for rare cancers. Here, we describe a protocol for the analysis of FFPE samples using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip."

This has traditionally been a major impediment in understanding the pathogenesis of this tumor and in developing ways for more effective management. Our aim is to chart DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) and get insight into genetic pathways involved in pGBM. Using the Illumina Infinium Human-1 bead-chip-array (100K single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]), we genotyped 18 pediatric and 6 adult GBMs. Results were compared to BAC-array profiles harvested on 16 of the same pGBM, to an independent data set of 9 pediatric high-grade astrocytomas (HGAs) analyzed on Affymetrix 250K-SNP arrays, and to existing data sets on HGAs. CNAs were additionally validated by real-time qPCR in a set of genes in pGBM. Our results identify with nonrandom clustering of CNAs in several novel, previously not reported, genomic regions, suggesting that alterations in tumor suppressors and genes involved in the regulation of RNA processing and the cell cycle are major events in the pathogenesis of pGBM. Most regions were distinct from CNAs in aGBMs and show an unexpectedly low frequency of genetic amplification and homozygous deletions and a high frequency of loss of heterozygosity for a high-grade I rapidly dividing tumor. This first, complete, high-resolution profiling of the tumor cell genome fills an important gap in studies on pGBM. It ultimately guides the mapping of oncogenic networks unique to pGBM, identification of the related therapeutic predictors and targets, and development of more effective therapies. It further shows that, despite commonalities in a few CNAs, pGBM and aGBMs are two different diseases."

DNA methylation profiling platforms might provide an alternative approach to expression microarrays for accurate breast tumor subtyping. We sought to determine whether the distinction of the inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) phenotype from the non-IBC phenotype by transcriptomics could be sustained by methylomics.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed methylation profiling on a cohort of IBC (N = 19) and non-IBC (N = 43) samples using the Illumina Infinium Methylation Assay. These results were correlated with gene expression profiles. Methylation values allowed separation of breast tumor samples into high and low methylation groups. This separation was significantly related to DNMT3B mRNA levels. The high methylation group was enriched for breast tumor samples from patients with distant metastasis and poor prognosis, as predicted by the 70-gene prognostic signature. Furthermore, this tumor group tended to be enriched for IBC samples (54% vs. 24%) and samples with a high genomic grade index (67% vs. 38%). A set of 16 CpG loci (14 genes) correctly classified 97% of samples into the low or high methylation group. Differentially methylated genes appeared to be mainly related to focal adhesion, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, Wnt signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathways and metabolic processes. Comparison of IBC with non-IBC led to the identification of only four differentially methylated genes (TJP3, MOGAT2, NTSR2 and AGT). A significant correlation between methylation values and gene expression was shown for 4,981 of 6,605 (75%) genes.SIGNIFICANCE: A subset of clinical samples of breast cancer was characterized by high methylation levels, which coincided with increased DNMT3B expression. Furthermore, an association was observed with molecular signatures indicative of poor patient prognosis. The results of the current study also suggest that aberrant DNA methylation is not the main force driving the molecular biology of IBC."

Numerous family studies have confirmed a strong genetic component underlying its etiology. After several decades of frustrating research, the advent and application of affordable genotyping of dense SNP maps in large data sets has ushered in a new era in which rapid progress is being made in our understanding of the genetics underlying many complex traits. For MS, one of the first discoveries to emerge in this new era was the association with rs6897932[T244I] in the interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain (IL7RA) gene (Gregory et al. in Nat Genet 39(9):1083-1091, 2007; International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium in N Engl J Med 357(9):851-862, 2007; Lundmark in Nat Genet 39(9):1108-1113, 2007), a discovery that was accompanied by functional data that suggest this variant is likely to be causative rather than a surrogate proxy (Gregory et al. in Nat Genet 39(9):1083-1091, 2007). We hypothesized that variations in other genes functionally related to IL7RA might also influence MS. We investigated this hypothesis by examining genes in the extended biological pathway related to IL7RA to identify novel associations. We identified 73 genes with putative functional relationships to IL7RA and subsequently genotyped 7,865 SNPs in and around these genes using an Illumina Infinium BeadChip assay. Using 2,961 case-control data sets, two of the gene regions examined, IL7 and SOCS1, had significantly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that further replicated in an independent case-control data set (4,831 samples) with joint p values as high as 8.29 x 10(-6) and 3.48 x 10(-7), respectively, exceeding the threshold for experiment-wise significance. Our results also implicate two additional novel gene regions that are likely to be associated with MS: PRKCE with p values reaching 3.47 x 10(-4), and BCL2 with p values reaching 4.32 x 10(-4). The TYK2 gene, which also emerged in our analysis, has recently been associated with MS (Ban et al. 2009). These results help to further delineate the genetic architecture of MS and validate our pathway approach as an effective method to identify novel associations in a complex disease."

We report the results of a reliability analysis comparing data from 96 pairs of samples processed with CNVpartition, PennCNV, and QuantiSNP for Infinium Illumina Human 1Million probe chip data. We also performed a validity assessment with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) as a reference standard. The number of CNVs per individual varied according to the calling algorithm. Higher numbers of CNVs were detected in saliva than in blood DNA samples regardless of the algorithm used. All algorithms presented low agreement with mean Kappa Index (KI) &lt;66. PennCNV was the most reliable algorithm (KI(w=) 98.96) when assessing the number of copies. The agreement observed in detecting CNV was higher in blood than in saliva samples. When comparing to MLPA, all algorithms identified poorly known copy aberrations (sensitivity = 0.19-0.28). In contrast, specificity was very high (0.97-0.99). Once a CNV was detected, the number of copies was truly assessed (sensitivity &gt;0.62). Our results indicate that the current calling algorithms should be improved for high performance CNV analysis in genome-wide scans. Further refinement is required to assess CNVs as risk factors in complex diseases."
"20885964";"Infinium";"Infinium";"PLoS One";13;2010;"Defining hypo-methylated regions of stem cell-specific promoters in human iPS cells derived from extra-embryonic amnions and lung fibroblasts.";"BACKGROUND: Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are currently used as powerful resources in regenerative medicine. During very early developmental stages, DNA methylation decreases to an overall low level at the blastocyst stage, from which embryonic stem cells are derived. Therefore, pluripotent stem cells, such as ES and iPS cells, are considered to have hypo-methylated status compared to differentiated cells. However, epigenetic mechanisms of &quot;stemness&quot; remain unknown in iPS cells derived from extra-embryonic and embryonic cells.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined genome-wide DNA methylation (24,949 CpG sites covering 1,3862 genes, mostly selected from promoter regions) with six human iPS cell lines derived from human amniotic cells and fetal lung fibroblasts as well as two human ES cell lines, and eight human differentiated cell lines using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation27. A considerable fraction (807 sites) exhibited a distinct difference in the methylation level between the iPS/ES cells and differentiated cells, with 87.6% hyper-methylation seen in iPS/ES cells. However, a limited fraction of CpG sites with hypo-methylation was found in promoters of genes encoding transcription factors. Thus, a group of genes becomes active through a decrease of methylation in their promoters. Twenty-three genes including SOX15, SALL4, TDGF1, PPP1R16B and SOX10 as well as POU5F1 were defined as genes with hypo-methylated SS-DMR (Stem cell-Specific Differentially Methylated Region) and highly expression in iPS/ES cells.SIGNIFICANCE: We show that DNA methylation profile of human amniotic iPS cells as well as fibroblast iPS cells, and defined the SS-DMRs. Knowledge of epigenetic information across iPS cells derived from different cell types can be used as a signature for &quot;stemness&quot; and may allow us to screen for optimum iPS/ES cells and to validate and monitor iPS/ES cell derivatives for human therapeutic applications."

We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling to evaluate whether the DNA methylation state is different in the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status of breast cancer. Twelve ER+/PR+ and 12 ER-/PR- breast cancer tissues were selected from the biorepository of the Seoul Breast Cancer Study for Infinium Methylation Assay. The difference of the DNA methylation state of 27 578 methylation sites in 14 000 genes between two groups was evaluated by Student's t-test. False discovery rate (FDR) was estimated to evaluate the probability of false positive associations. Of the 27 578 sites, 148 sites (0.54%) were significantly different between ER+/PR+ and ER-/PR- breast cancers (P &lt; 0.001); 93 hypermethylated and 55 hypomethylated. Five genes, FAM124B (P = 7.26 × 10(-7)), MANEAL (P = 3.38 × 10(-7)), ST6GALNAC1 (P = 2.85 × 10(-6)), NAV1 (P = 5.94 × 10(-6)) and PER1 (P = 6.45 × 10(-6)) remained significant after correction for multiple tests (FDR &lt; 0.05). In a subsequent replication study for five genes, four of the five genes were validated; FAM124B and ST6GALNAC1 were significantly hypermethylated, and NAV1 and PER1 were significantly hypomethylated in ER+/PR+ breast cancers (P &lt; 0.05). In the first genome-wide DNA methylation profiling according to the receptor status of breast cancer, we found that ER/PR status affects the DNA methylation state of FAM124B, ST6GALNAC1, NAV1 and PER1 in breast cancer."

GWAS require DNA from many thousands of individuals, relying on suitable DNA collections. We recently performed a multiple sclerosis (MS) GWAS where a substantial component of the cases (24%) had DNA derived from saliva. Genotyping was done on the Illumina genotyping platform using the Infinium Hap370CNV DUO microarray. Additionally, we genotyped 10 individuals in duplicate using both saliva- and blood-derived DNA. The performance of blood- versus saliva-derived DNA was compared using genotyping call rate, which reflects both the quantity and quality of genotyping per sample and the &quot;GCScore,&quot; an Illumina genotyping quality score, which is a measure of DNA quality. We also compared genotype calls and GCScores for the 10 sample pairs. Call rates were assessed for each sample individually. For the GWAS samples, we compared data according to source of DNA and center of origin. We observed high concordance in genotyping quality and quantity between the paired samples and minimal loss of quality and quantity of DNA in the saliva samples in the large GWAS sample, with the blood samples showing greater variation between centers of origin. This large data set highlights the usefulness of saliva DNA for genotyping, especially in high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray studies such as GWAS."
"21149341";"Infinium";"Infinium";"Bioinformatics";11;2010;"Genotype calling and mapping of multisite variants using an Atlantic salmon iSelect SNP array.";"MOTIVATION: Due to a genome duplication event in the recent history of salmonids, modern Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) have a mosaic genome with roughly one-third being tetraploid. This is a complicating factor in genotyping and genetic mapping since polymorphisms within duplicated regions (multisite variants; MSVs) are challenging to call and to assign to the correct paralogue. Standard genotyping software offered by Illumina has not been written to interpret MSVs and will either fail or miscall these polymorphisms. For the purpose of mapping, linkage or association studies in non-diploid species, there is a pressing need for software that includes analysis of MSVs in addition to regular single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.RESULTS: A software package is presented for the analysis of partially tetraploid genomes genotyped using Illumina Infinium BeadArrays (Illumina Inc.) that includes pre-processing, clustering, plotting and validation routines. More than 3000 salmon from an aquacultural strain in Norway, distributed among 266 full-sib families, were genotyped on a 15K BeadArray including both SNP- and MSV-markers. A total of 4268 SNPs and 1471 MSVs were identified, with average call accuracies of 0.97 and 0.86, respectively. A total of 150 MSVs polymorphic in both paralogs were dissected and mapped to their respective chromosomes, yielding insights about the salmon genome reversion to diploidy and improving marker genome coverage.

Missense mutation in both alleles of the TH gene is known to cause dopamine-related phenotypes, including dystonia and infantile Parkinsonism. However, it is not clear if single allele mutation in TH modifies the susceptibility to the adult form of Parkinson disease (PD). We reported a novel deletion of entire TH gene in an adult with PD. The deletion was first identified by copy number variation (CNV) analysis in a genome-wide association study using Illumina Infinium BeadChips. After screening 635 cases and 642 controls, the deletion was found in one PD case but not in any control. The deletion was confirmed by multiple quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays. There is no additional exonic single nucleotide variant in the one copy of TH gene of the patient. The patient has an age-at-onset of 54 years, no evidence for dystonia, and was responsive to L-DOPA. This case supports the importance of the TH gene in PD pathogenesis and raises more attention to rare variants in candidate genes being a risk factor for Parkinson disease."

We assessed the genotyping efficiency (GE) and genotyping concordance (GC) of buccal cell DNA samples compared to corresponding blood DNA samples, from 32 Nurses' Health Study (NHS) participants using the Illumina Infinium 660W-Quad platform. We also assessed how GE and GC accuracy varied as a function of DNA concentration using serial dilutions of buccal DNA samples. Finally we determined the nature and genomic distribution of discordant genotypes in buccal DNA samples. The mean GE of undiluted buccal cell DNA samples was high (99.32%), as was the GC between the paired buccal and blood samples (99.29%). GC between the dilutions versus the undiluted buccal DNA was also very high (&gt;97%), though both GE and GC notably declined at DNA concentrations less than 5 ng/mul. Most (&gt;95%) genotype determinations in buccal cell samples were of the &quot;missing call&quot; variety (as opposed to the &quot;alternative genotype call&quot; variety) across the spectrum of buccal DNA concentrations studied. Finally, for buccal DNA concentration above 1.7 ng/ul, discordant genotyping calls did not cluster in any particular chromosome.

We conducted the genotyping using CytoSNP-Infinium HD Ultra genotyping assay on the Illumina platform. Using both log regression and mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium analysis methods, we analyzed the single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping data.RESULTS: Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealed a significant association in regions for chromosomes 1, 3 through 6, 11, 16, 17, and 23. Mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium analysis showed ancestry-associated regions in chromosomes 2, 6, 8, 11, 16, and 20, which may harbor DD susceptibility genes. Both analysis methods revealed loci association in chromosomes 6, 11, and 16.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that chromosomes 6, 11, and 16 may contain the genes for DD and that multiple genes may be involved in DD.

Uncovered and malapposed struts are more common following stenting in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) than in non-ACS lesions.METHODS: All consecutive patients with ACS, treated with the above PES for single native coronary lesions between August 2008 and January 2009, who consented to invasive follow-up with OCT at six months (N=13), were included.RESULTS: At 6 months no patient demonstrated angiographic restenosis. 3180 struts from 20 stents were analyzed, and 91.3% were covered with neointima (NIH 204.8 ± 159.5 μm). Standard statistics and least squares estimates (LSE) derived from a hierarchical ANCOVA model to take into account clustering effects are presented. Rate of uncovered struts was 8.6%, LSE 7.39 (95% CI 3.05-11.73), malapposed struts 2.2%, LSE 1.76 (95% CI 0.05-3.58), and protruding struts 2.9%, LSE 2.8 (95% CI 1.35-4.65). The proportion of uncovered malapposed struts was significantly higher compared to uncovered embedded struts (55.7% vs. 6.8%, p&lt;0.01). In total, 5 (25%) PES were fully covered by neointima. No intracoronary thrombus or clinical events were detected.CONCLUSIONS: Six months after implantation of a specific PES in patients with ACS, most of the stents were only partially covered with neointima, especially at sites of strut malapposition or protrusion. These findings emphasize the need for optimal stent apposition during implantation and for prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy."

In this paper, we explore several data sets which make use of Illumina's GoldenGate BeadArray technology to measure ASE. This platform exploits coding SNPs to obtain relative expression measurements for alleles at approximately 1500 positions in the genome.RESULTS: We analyze data from a mixture experiment where genomic DNA samples from pairs of individuals of known genotypes are pooled to create allelic imbalances at varying levels for the majority of SNPs on the array. We observe that GoldenGate has less sensitivity at detecting subtle allelic imbalances (around 1.3 fold) compared to extreme imbalances, and note the benefit of applying local background correction to the data. Analysis of data from a dye-swap control experiment allowed us to quantify dye-bias, which can be reduced considerably by careful normalization. The need to filter the data before carrying out further downstream analysis to remove non-responding probes, which show either weak, or non-specific signal for each allele, was also demonstrated. Throughout this paper, we find that a linear model analysis of the data from each SNP is a flexible modelling strategy that allows for testing of allelic imbalances in each sample when replicate hybridizations are available.CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that local background correction carried out by Illumina's software, together with quantile normalization of the red and green channels within each array, provides optimal performance in terms of false positive rates.

Replicate pools containing 0%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 90% and 100% of DNA from line A vs. B or line C vs. D were created, for a total of 28 pools. All pools were genotyped for 12,046 SNPs. Three frequency estimation methods proposed in the literature (standard, heterozygote-corrected and normalized) were compared with three alternate methods proposed herein based on mean square error (MSE), bias and variance of estimated vs. true allele frequencies and the fit of regression of estimated on true frequencies. The three new methods had average square root MSE of 4.6%, 4.6% and 4.7% compared to 5.2%, 5.5% and 11.2% for the three literature methods. Average absolute biases of the literature methods were 2.4%, 2.7% and 8.2% compared to 2.4% for all new methods. Standard deviations of estimates were also smaller for the new methods, at 3.1%, 3.2% and 3.2% compared to 3.5%, 4.0% and 5.0% for previously reported methods. In conclusion, intensity data from the Illumina Infinium Assay can be efficiently used to estimate allele frequencies in pools, in particular using any of the new methods proposed herein."

The major limitation of bisulfite-based methods is parallelization. Both array and next-generation sequencing technology are capable of addressing this bottleneck. In this report, we describe the application of Infinium® genotyping technology to analyze bisulfite-converted DNA to simultaneously query the methylation state of over 27,000 CpG sites from promoters of consensus coding sequences (CCDS) genes.MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: We adapted the Infinium genotyping assay to readout an array of over 27,000 pairs of CpG methylation-specific query probes complementary to bisulfite-converted DNA. Two probes were designed to each CpG site: a 'methylated' and an 'unmethylated' query probe. The probe design assumed that all underlying CpG sites were 'in phase' with the queried CpG site due to their close proximity. Bisulfite conversion was performed with a modified version of the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation™ kit.RESULTS: We applied this technology to measuring methylation levels across a panel of 14 different human tissues, four Coriell cell lines and six cancer cell lines. We observed that CpG sites within CpG islands (CGIs) were largely unmethylated across all tissues (~80% sites unmethylated, β &lt; 0.2), whereas CpG sites in non-CGIs were moderately to highly methylated (only ~12% sites unmethylated, β &lt; 0.2). Within CGIs, only approximately 3-6% of the loci were highly methylated; in contrast, outside of CGIs approximately 25-40% of loci were highly methylated. Moreover, tissue-specific methylation (variation in methylation across tissues) was much more prevalent in non-CGIs than within CGIs.CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate a genome-wide scalable array-based methylation readout platform that is both highly reproducible and quantitative. In the near future, this platform should enable the analysis of hundreds of thousands to millions of CpG sites per sample."

In cohorts where the sample size was &gt;100, one hundred randomly chosen samples were used for analysis to minimize the sample size effect, resulting in a total of 1,564 samples. This analysis revealed that the genetic structure of the European population correlates closely with geography. The first two PCs highlight the genetic diversity corresponding to the northwest to southeast gradient and position the populations according to their approximate geographic origin. The resulting genetic map forms a triangular structure with a) Finland, b) the Baltic region, Poland and Western Russia, and c) Italy as its vertexes, and with d) Central- and Western Europe in its centre. Inter- and intra- population genetic differences were quantified by the inflation factor lambda (lambda) (ranging from 1.00 to 4.21), fixation index (F(st)) (ranging from 0.000 to 0.023), and by the number of markers exhibiting significant allele frequency differences in pair-wise population comparisons. The estimated lambda was used to assess the real diminishing impact to association statistics when two distinct populations are merged directly in an analysis. When the PC analysis was confined to the 1,019 Estonian individuals (0.1% of the Estonian population), a fine structure emerged that correlated with the geography of individual counties. With at least two cohorts available from several countries, genetic substructures were investigated in Czech, Finnish, German, Estonian and Italian populations. Together with previously published data, our results allow the creation of a comprehensive European genetic map that will greatly facilitate inter-population genetic studies including genome wide association studies (GWAS)."

All subjects were consecutively recruited from the Greater Philadelphia area from 2006 to 2009. High throughput genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was carried out with the Illumina Infinium II HumanHap550 BeadChip technology.RESULTS: We observed association at the genome-wide significance level with SNP rs987525 at a locus on 8q24, which harbors no characterized genes to date (P = 9.18 x 10(-8); odds ratio = 2.09, 95% confidence interval = 1.59 to 2.76). While searching for a replication cohort, the same genetic determinant was established through a genome-wide association study of NSCL/P in Germany, so this previous report acts as a de novo replication for our independent observation outlined here.CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that a locus on 8q24 is involved in the pathogenesis of NSCL/P."

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have increased our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to IBD. The aim was to test associations of known IBD susceptibility loci and novel &quot;pharmacogenetic&quot; GWAS identified loci with primary nonresponse to anti-TNFalpha in pediatric IBD patients and develop a predictive model of primary nonresponse.METHODS: Primary nonresponse was defined using the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) for Crohn's disease (CD) and partial Mayo score for ulcerative colitis (UC). Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Infinium platform. Chi-square analysis tested associations of phenotype and genotype with primary nonresponse. Genetic associations were identified by testing known IBD susceptibility loci and by performing a GWAS for primary nonresponse. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was performed to build predictive models.RESULTS: Nonresponse occurred in 22 of 94 subjects. Six known susceptibility loci were associated with primary nonresponse (P &lt; 0.05). Only the 21q22.2/BRWDI loci remained significant in the predictive model. The most predictive model included 3 novel &quot;pharmacogenetic&quot; GWAS loci, the previously identified BRWD1, pANCA, and a UC diagnosis (R(2) = 0.82 and area under the curve [AUC] = 0.98%). The relative risk of nonresponse increased 15-fold when number of risk factors increased from 0-2 to &gt; or =3.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of phenotype and genotype is most predictive of primary nonresponse to anti-TNFalpha in pediatric IBD. Defining predictors of response to anti-TNFalpha may allow the identification of patients who will not benefit from this class of therapy."

Briefly, the Infinium WGG assay employs a single tube whole genome amplification reaction to amplify the entire genome; genomic loci of interest are captured on an array by specific hybridization of picomolar concentrations amplified gDNA. After target capture, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are genotyped on the array by a primer extension reaction using hapten-labeled nucleotides. The resultant hapten signal is amplified by immunhistochemical sandwich staining and the array is read out on a high resolution confocal scanner. We have combined this Infinium assay with high-density BeadChips to create the first array platform capable of genotyping over 1 million SNPs per slide. Additionally, the complete Infinium assay is automated using Tecan GenePaint slide processing system. Hybridization, washing, array-based primer extension and staining are performed directly in the Tecan capillary gap Te-Flow Through chambers. This automation process greatly increases assay robustness and throughput while enabling Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) control of sample tracking. Finally, we give several examples of how this advance in genotyping technology is being applied in whole genome association and copy number studies."

Molecular marker technology has developed rapidly over the last decade, with the development of high-throughput genotyping methods. Two forms of sequence-based marker, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), also known as microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) now predominate applications in modern plant genetic analysis, along the anonymous marker systems such as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and diversity array technology (DArT). The reducing cost of DNA sequencing and increasing availability of large sequence data sets permits the mining of this data for large numbers of SSRs and SNPs. These may then be used in applications such as genetic linkage analysis and trait mapping, diversity analysis, association studies and marker-assisted selection. Here, we describe automated methods for the discovery of molecular markers and new technologies for high-throughput, low-cost molecular marker genotyping.

Archived residual dried blood spot samples from national newborn screening programs may provide DNA from entire populations and medical registries the corresponding clinical information. The amount of DNA available in these samples is however rarely sufficient for reliable genome-wide scans, and whole-genome amplification may thus be necessary. This study assess the quality of DNA obtained from different amplification protocols by evaluating fidelity and robustness of the genotyping of 610,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, using the Illumina Infinium HD Human610-Quad BeadChip. Whole-genome amplified DNA from 24 neonatal dried blood spot samples stored between 15 to 25 years was tested, and high-quality genomic DNA from 8 of the same individuals was used as reference.RESULTS: Using 3.2 mm disks from dried blood spot samples the optimal DNA-extraction and amplification protocol resulted in call-rates between 99.15% - 99.73% (mean 99.56%, N = 16), and conflicts with reference DNA in only three per 10,000 genotype calls.CONCLUSION: Whole-genome amplified DNA from archived neonatal dried blood spot samples can be used for reliable genome-wide scans and is a cost-efficient alternative to collecting new samples."

Pooled probe intensity was used to predict mean allele frequency (MAF) for each locus. Individual genotyping was performed using the iPLEX assay in conjunction with the MassARRAY platform (Sequenom).RESULTS: We identified 2870 markers showing substantial differences in MAF (5.0-10.7%) between pools. To initiate validation of these findings, we genotyped 22 high-ranking markers in 462 individuals with ESRD and 470 unaffected control subjects selected from the genome-wide SNP genotyping study sample. We observed the strongest evidence for association between ESRD and rs1749824, located in the ZMIZ1 gene [OR = 1.47 (1.21-1.78) per copy of T allele; P = 8.1 x 10(-5)] and rs9298190, located in the musculin gene [OR = 1.56 (1.28-1.91) per copy of C allele; P = 1.6 x 10(-5)].

A total of 310,881 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with IS, and the most significant signals were replicated in two large European IS sample sets (2,224 cases/2,583 control subjects). Two SNPs, rs2200733 and rs10033464, were tested further in additional European IS samples (2,327 patients and 16,760 control subjects).RESULTS: In the Icelandic samples and the two replication sets combined, rs2200733 associated significantly with cardioembolic stroke (CES) (odds ratio [OR], 1.54; p = 8.05 x 10(-9)). No other variants associated with IS or any of its subtypes. rs2200733 associated significantly with IS in all sample sets combined (OR, 1.26; p = 2.18 x 10(-10)), and both rs2200733 and its neighbour, rs10033464 associated strongly with CES (rs2200733: OR, 1.52; p = 5.8 x 10(-12); rs10033464: OR, 1.27; p = 6.1 x 10(-4)). Interestingly, rs2200733 also showed significant association to IS not classified as CES.INTERPRETATION: We discovered that variants previously shown to associate with atrial fibrillation (AF), rs2200733 and rs10033464, significantly associated with IS, with the strongest risk for CES. The association with noncardiogenic stroke is intriguing and suggests that atrial fibrillation may be underdiagnosed in patients presenting with stroke.

The individuals were collected as control samples and were genotyped with more than 300 000 SNPs in genome-wide association studies using the Illumina Infinium platform. A major East-West gradient from Russian (Moscow) samples to Spanish samples was identified as the first principal component (PC) of the genetic diversity. The second PC identified a North-South gradient from Norway and Sweden to Romania and Spain. Variation of frequencies at markers in three separate genomic regions, surrounding LCT, HLA and HERC2, were strongly associated with this gradient. The next 18 PCs also accounted for a significant proportion of genetic diversity observed in the sample. We present a method to predict the ethnic origin of samples by comparing the sample genotypes with those from a reference set of samples of known origin. These predictions can be performed using just summary information on the known samples, and individual genotype data are not required. We discuss issues raised by these data and analyses for association studies including the matching of case-only cohorts to appropriate pre-collected control samples for genome-wide association studies."

Methods developed for normalization of WGG arrays have mostly focused on diploid, normal samples. However, for cancer samples genomic aberrations may confound normalization and data interpretation. Therefore, we examined the effects of the conventionally used normalization method for Illumina Infinium arrays when applied to cancer samples.RESULTS: We demonstrate an asymmetry in the detection of the two alleles for each SNP, which deleteriously influences both allelic proportions and copy number estimates. The asymmetry is caused by a remaining bias between the two dyes used in the Infinium II assay after using the normalization method in Illumina's proprietary software (BeadStudio). We propose a quantile normalization strategy for correction of this dye bias. We tested the normalization strategy using 535 individual hybridizations from 10 data sets from the analysis of cancer genomes and normal blood samples generated on Illumina Infinium II 300 k version 1 and 2, 370 k and 550 k BeadChips. We show that the proposed normalization strategy successfully removes asymmetry in estimates of both allelic proportions and copy numbers. Additionally, the normalization strategy reduces the technical variation for copy number estimates while retaining the response to copy number alterations.CONCLUSION: The proposed normalization strategy represents a valuable tool that improves the quality of data obtained from Illumina Infinium arrays, in particular when used for LOH and copy number variation studies."

We focused on SNPs recently associated with heart disease by Helgadottir and colleagues and SNPs from the same haplotype block.RESULTS: In analyses both unadjusted and adjusted for stroke risk factors, significant associations with ischemic stroke were observed for SNPs from the same haplotype block previously associated with myocardial infarction. Significant association was also seen between disease and haplotypes involving these SNPs, both with and without adjustment for stroke risk factors (odd ratios: 1.01 to 2.65).CONCLUSIONS: These data are important for 3 reasons: first, they suggest a genetic association for stroke; second, they suggest that this association shares pathogenic mechanisms with heart disease and diabetes; and third, they illustrate, that public release of data can facilitate rapid risk locus discovery."

With an input of as little as 0.5-2.5 ng of human gDNA or a few cells, the product could be close to native DNA in locus representation. The amplicons from 5 and 0.5 ng of DNA faithfully demonstrated all previously known heterozygous segmental duplications and deletions (3 Mb to 18 kb) located on chromosome 22 and even a homozygous deletion smaller than 1 kb with high-resolution chromosome-wide comparative genomic hybridization. With 550k Infinium BeadChip SNP typing, the &gt;99.7% accuracy was compared favorably with results on unamplified DNA. Importantly, underrepresentation of chromosome termini that occurred with GenomiPhi v2 was greatly rescued with the present procedure, and the call rate and accuracy of SNP typing were also improved for the amplicons with a 0.5-ng, partially degraded DNA input. In addition, the amplification proceeded logarithmically in terms of total yield before saturation; the intact cells was amplified &gt;50 times more efficiently than an equivalent amount of extracted DNA; and the locus imbalance for amplicons with 0.1 ng or lower input of DNA was variable, whereas for higher input it was largely reproducible. This procedure facilitates genomic analysis with single cells or other traces of DNA, and generates products suitable for analysis by massively parallel sequencing as well as microarray hybridization."

Recently, CNV associations with human disease have been reported. Many genome-wide association (GWA) studies in complex diseases have been performed with sets of biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but the available CNV methods are still limited. We present a new method (TriTyper) that can infer genotypes in case-control data sets for deletion CNVs, or SNPs with an extra, untyped allele at a high-resolution single SNP level. By accounting for linkage disequilibrium (LD), as well as intensity data, calling accuracy is improved. Analysis of 3102 unrelated individuals with European descent, genotyped with Illumina Infinium BeadChips, resulted in the identification of 1880 SNPs with a common untyped allele, and these SNPs are in strong LD with neighboring biallelic SNPs. Simulations indicate our method has superior power to detect associations compared to biallelic SNPs that are in LD with these SNPs, yet without increasing type I errors, as shown in a GWA analysis in celiac disease. Genotypes for 1204 triallelic SNPs could be fully imputed, with only biallelic-genotype calls, permitting association analysis of these SNPs in many published data sets. We estimate that 682 of the 1655 unique loci reflect deletions; this is on average 99 deletions per individual, four times greater than those detected by other methods. Whereas the identified loci are strongly enriched for known deletions, 61% have not been reported before. Genes overlapping with these loci more often have paralogs (p = 0.006) and biologically interact with fewer genes than expected (p = 0.004)."

In a pair of gDNA and WGA DNA, similar concordance was reproducible on Illumina's Infinium 610 Quad platform as well. Although copy number analysis revealed a total of seven small telomeric regions in six chromosomes with loss of copy number, the estimated genome representation was 99.29%. In conclusion, our study confirms that high-density oligonucleotide array-based genotyping can yield reproducible data and MDA-WGA DNA products can be effectively used for genome-wide SNP genotyping analysis."

The Illumina BeadArray technology offers a flexible platform for such analyses through two assays: GoldenGate, as described in this chapter, and Infinium II. Both assays utilize the BeadArray technology, where targeted regions of DNA are immobilized on beads randomly arranged into arrays, and the SNPs visualized through fluorescent tags, which differentiate among alleles. The platform is scalable such that mid- to high-throughput projects can be designed and completed in either a manual or automated mode. Small amounts of starting material are required, and in the case of GoldenGate, some level of sample degradation can be tolerated. The assays are efficient and reliable giving high pass rates and concordance levels."

Applying the Infinium HumanHap300 BeadChip array and BAC-based FISH we found two new non-contiguous microdeletions in addition to the one detected previously by high resolution G-band analysis. A 360 kb loss in band 6p12.3, containing the genes RHAG, CRISP1, 2, and 3, and PGK2, a 1.15 Mb loss in 6p12.2-p12.1, containing the genes PKHD1, IL17, MCM3, EFHC1, and TRAM2 genes, and an 11.9 Mb loss in region 6q14.3-q16.1, reported previously, were mapped on the rearranged chromosome 6. The latter loss contained the central cannabinoid receptor isoform b (CNR1), which may be involved in brain development and function. Since the maternal SNPs were retained this rearrangement of chromosome 6 is most likely of paternal origin."

We describe the genetic anomalies in 2 monozygotic twins with an X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP; MIM 308240), a rare familial setting of high susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Since early childhood, both twin brothers exhibited a severe chronic active atrophic pangastritis. A germline screening of the SH2D1A (MIM 300490) and BIRC4 (MIM 300079) genes was performed, and also a high-resolution whole-genome SNP profiling (Infinium Sentrix Human-1 Genotyping BeadChip, Illumina). A 3 Megabase deletion in the Xq25 region, encompassing the SH2D1A gene, was defined by SNP array genotyping. Histologic analysis of yearly or twice yearly gastric biopsies in both children showed a Helicobacter pylori-negative, Epstein-Barr virus-negative chronic active atrophic pangastritis, with superficial ulcer formation, foveolar hyperplasia, glandular dilatation and ultimately pseudopyloric and intestinal metaplasia. No such chronic active inflammatory gastric lesions have been reported to date in XLP. The similarities between XLP and common variable immunodeficiency (MIM 240500) underscore the need for early recognition and close monitoring of these gastric lesions, with special regard to their neoplastic potential. No infectious cause was determined. We favor a dysimmune mechanism in the development of this chronic atrophic gastritis, presenting a striking similarity to the recently described atrophic autoimmune pangastritis."

Despite evidence for a role for genetics, no common genetic variants have been unequivocally linked to sporadic ALS. We sought to identify genetic variants associated with an increased or decreased risk for developing ALS in a cohort of American sporadic cases.METHODS: We undertook a genome-wide association study using publicly available samples from 276 patients with sporadic ALS and 271 neurologically normal controls. 555 352 unique SNPs were assayed in each sample using the Illumina Infinium II HumanHap550 SNP chip.FINDINGS: More than 300 million genotypes were produced in 547 participants. These raw genotype data are freely available on the internet and represent the first publicly accessible SNP data for ALS cases. 34 SNPs with a p value less than 0.0001 (two degrees of freedom) were found, although none of these reached significance after Bonferroni correction.INTERPRETATION: We generated publicly available genotype data for sporadic ALS patients and controls.

Although the feasibility of collecting buccal cell samples as an alternative to venous blood samples as a source of genomic DNA has been shown, the validity of using DNA from buccal cells for genome-wide scans has not been assessed. We used 46 paired buffy coat and buccal cell samples to test the feasibility of using DNA from buccal cells for genotyping with the HumanHap300 Bead Chip (v.1.0.0) on the Illumina Infinium II platform. Genotyping was successful in every sample, regardless of DNA yield or sample type. Of the 317,502 genotypes attempted, 315,314 (99.3%) were successfully called. Completion rates were similar for buffy coat and buccal cell samples (99.63% and 99.44%, respectively; P = 0.15). Completion rates &lt;99% were observed in only four samples and did not differ by specimen type. The paired samples showed exceptionally high concordance (99.96%). These results show that buccal cell samples collected and processed under optimal conditions can be used for genome-wide association studies with results comparable to those obtained from DNA extracted from buffy coat."

Several different first-generation genome-wide panels of SNPs have been commercialized. The total amount of common genetic variation is still unknown; however, the coverage of commercial panels can be evaluated against reference population samples genotyped by the International HapMap project. Less information is available about coverage in samples from other populations.RESULTS: In this study we compare four commercial panels: the HumanHap 300 and HumanHap 550 Array Sets from the Illumina Infinium series and the Mapping 100 K and Mapping 500 K Array Sets from the Affymetrix GeneChip series. Tagging performance is compared among HapMap CEPH (CEU), Asian (JPT, CHB) and Yoruba (YRI) population samples. It is also evaluated in an Estonian population sample with more than 1000 individuals genotyped in two 500-kbp ENCODE regions of chromosome 2: ENr112 on 2p16.3 and ENr131 on 2p37.1.CONCLUSION: We found that in a non-reference Caucasian population, commercial SNP panels provide levels of coverage similar to those in the HapMap CEPH population sample. We present the proportions of universal and population-specific SNPs in all the commercial platforms studied."

Her intelligence was in the low normal range. By GTG-banding a deletion of band 15q26 was found. Array-CGH, using a 3783 BAC array, revealed a segmental monosomy of the 15(q26.2--&gt;qter) region, which was narrowed down to a 6.87Mb deletion by using the Illumina Infinium 317 K SNP array system, and subsequently confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis. The deletion appeared to have arisen de novo. The IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and the NR2F2 genes were situated within, but the OCA2 (oculocutaneous albinism II) gene (formerly called the P gene) was located outside the deleted region. Clinical findings in our patient were compared with previously reported cases carrying terminal deletions of 15q26.2. This allowed us to expand the clinical phenotype of terminal 15q26.2 deletions and to indicate candidate genes for several phenotypic features."

Here we describe a patient with BWS who developed a central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT). To our knowledge, despite the known cancer predisposition, this patient is the first described with BWS to develop an AT/RT. Due to the high propensity of these patients to develop childhood tumors, in addition to routine diagnostic tests, analysis of the tumor DNA using the Illumina Infinium whole-genome genotyping 550K Beadchip was performed to investigate a possible common underlying mechanism for his BWS and AT/RT. The only alteration detected was monosomy 22, which was accompanied by a somatic mutation in the INI1 rhabdoid tumor gene. These results suggest that, despite an underlying cancer predisposition, the occurrence of BWS and AT/RT in this patient may be unrelated."
"16899659";"Infinium";"Infinium";"Genome Res";173;2006;"High-resolution genomic profiling of chromosomal aberrations using Infinium whole-genome genotyping.";"Array-CGH is a powerful tool for the detection of chromosomal aberrations. The introduction of high-density SNP genotyping technology to genomic profiling, termed SNP-CGH, represents a further advance, since simultaneous measurement of both signal intensity variations and changes in allelic composition makes it possible to detect both copy number changes and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events. We demonstrate the utility of SNP-CGH with two Infinium whole-genome genotyping BeadChips, assaying 109,000 and 317,000 SNP loci, to detect chromosomal aberrations in samples bearing constitutional aberrations as well tumor samples at sub-100 kb effective resolution. Detected aberrations include homozygous deletions, hemizygous deletions, copy-neutral LOH, duplications, and amplifications. The statistical ability to detect common aberrations was modeled by analysis of an X chromosome titration model system, and sensitivity was modeled by titration of gDNA from a tumor cell with that of its paired normal cell line. Analysis was facilitated by using a genome browser that plots log ratios of normalized intensities and allelic ratios along the chromosomes. We developed two modes of SNP-CGH analysis, a single sample and a paired sample mode. The single sample mode computes log intensity ratios and allelic ratios by referencing to canonical genotype clusters generated from approximately 120 reference samples, whereas the paired sample mode uses a paired normal reference sample from the same individual. Finally, the two analysis modes are compared and contrasted for their utility in analyzing different types of input gDNA: low input amounts, fragmented gDNA, and Phi29 whole-genome pre-amplified DNA."

A single tube whole-genome amplification reaction is used to amplify the genome, and loci of interest are captured by specific hybridization of amplified gDNA to 50-mer probe arrays. After target capture, SNPs are genotyped on the array by a primer extension reaction in the presence of hapten-labeled nucleotides. The resultant signal is amplified during staining and the array is read out on a high-resolution confocal scanner. We have employed our high-density BeadChips supporting up to 288,000 bead types to create an array that can query over 100,000 SNPs using the Infinium assay. In addition, we have developed an automated BeadChip processing platform using Tecan's GenePaint slide processing system. Hybridization, washing, array-based primer extension, and staining are performed directly in Tecan's capillary gap Te-Flow chambers. This automation process increases assay robustness and throughput greatly while enabling laboratory information management system control of sample tracking."

We aimed to determine the feasibility of this approach in a WGA scan in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the validated human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and PTPN22 associations as test loci. A total of 203 269 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the Affymetrix 100K GeneChip and Illumina Infinium microarrays were examined. A new approach to the estimation of allele frequencies from Affymetrix hybridization intensities was developed involving weighting for quality signals from the probe quartets. SNPs were ranked by z-scores, combined from United Kingdom and New Zealand case-control cohorts. Within a 1.7 Mb HLA region, 33 of the 257 SNPs and at PTPN22, 21 of the 45 SNPs, were ranked within the top 100 associated SNPs genome wide. Within PTPN22, individual genotyping of SNP rs1343125 within MAGI3 confirmed association and provided some evidence for association independent of the PTPN22 620W variant (P=0.03). Our results emphasize the feasibility of using genomic DNA pooling for the detection of association with complex disease susceptibility alleles. The results also underscore the importance of the HLA and PTPN22 loci in RA aetiology."

The Infinium system from Illumina and the Affymetrix GeneChips are two systems suitable for whole-genome scoring of variable positions. However, directed candidate-gene approaches are more cost effective and several academic groups and the private sector provide techniques with moderate typing throughput combined with large sample capacity suiting these needs. Recently, whole-genome sequencing platforms based on the sequencing-by-synthesis principle were presented by 454 Life Sciences and Solexa, showing great potential as alternatives to conventional genotyping approaches. In addition to these sequencing initiatives, many efforts are pursuing novel ideas to facilitate fast and cost-effective whole genome sequencing, such as ligation-based sequencing. Reliable methods for routine re-sequencing of human genomes as a tool for personalized medicine, however, remain to be developed."
