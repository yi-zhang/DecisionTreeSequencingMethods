Nevertheless, certain WGA methods, such as SurePlex and subsequent arrayCGH analysis, make it possible to detect copy number alterations (CNAs) at a 10 Mb resolution. A more uniform WGA combined with massive parallel sequencing (MPS), however, could allow detection at higher resolution and lower cost. Recently, MALBAC, a new WGA method, claims unparalleled performance. Here, we compared the well-established SurePlex and MALBAC WGA for their ability to detect CNAs in MPS generated data and, in addition, compared PCR-free MPS library preparation with the standard enrichment PCR library preparation. Results showed that SurePlex amplification led to more uniformity across the genome, allowing for a better CNA detection with less false positives compared to MALBAC amplified samples. An even more uniform coverage was observed in samples following a PCR-free library preparation. In general, the combination of SurePlex and MPS led to the same chromosomal profile compared to a reference arrayCGH from unamplified genomic DNA, underlining the large potential of MPS techniques in CNA detection from a limited number of DNA material."

To date, the amplification bias, amplification uniformity and reproducibility of the three major single cell whole genome amplification methods (GenomePlex WGA4, MDA and MALBAC) have not been systematically investigated using mammalian cells. In this study, we amplified genomic DNA from individual hippocampal neurons using three single-cell DNA amplification methods, and sequenced them at shallow depth. We then systematically evaluated the GC-bias, reproducibility, and copy number variations among individual neurons. Our results showed that single-cell genome sequencing results obtained from the MALBAC and WGA4 methods are highly reproducible and have a high success rate. The MALBAC displays significant biases towards high GC content. We then attempted to correct the GC bias issue by developing a bioinformatics pipeline, which allows us to call CNVs in single cell sequencing data, and chromosome level and sub-chromosomal level CNVs among individual neurons can be detected. We also proposed a metric to determine the CNV detection limits. Overall, MALBAC and WGA4 have better performance than MDA in detecting CNVs."

The key parameters to characterize the performance of these methods are defined, including genome coverage, uniformity, reproducibility, unmappable rates, chimera rates, allele dropout rates, false positive rates for calling single-nucleotide variations, and ability to call copy-number variations. Using these parameters, we compare five commercial WGA kits by performing deep sequencing of multiple single cells. We also discuss several major applications of single-cell genomics, including studies of whole-genome de novo mutation rates, the early evolution of cancer genomes, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), meiotic recombination of germ cells, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), and preimplantation genomic screening (PGS) for in vitro-fertilized embryos.

However, the performance of the current state of the art WGA methods has not been evaluated for sequencing. Using low template DNA (15 pg) and single cells, we showed that the two PCR-based WGA systems SurePlex and MALBAC are superior to the REPLI-g WGA multiple displacement amplification (MDA) system in terms of consistent and reproducible genome coverage and sequence bias across the 24 chromosomes, allowing better normalization of test to reference sequencing data. When copy number variation sequencing (CNV-Seq) was applied to single cell WGA products derived by either SurePlex or MALBAC amplification, we showed that known disease CNVs in the range of 3-15 Mb could be reliably and accurately detected at the correct genomic positions. These findings indicate that our CNV-Seq pipeline incorporating either SurePlex or MALBAC as the key initial WGA step is a powerful methodology for clinical PGD to identify euploid embryos in a patient's cohort for uterine transplantation."

Here, we describe statistical methods to quantitatively assess the amplification bias resulting from whole-genome amplification of single-cell genomic DNA. Analysis of single-cell DNA libraries generated by different technologies revealed universal features of the genome coverage bias predominantly generated at the amplicon level (1-10 kb). The magnitude of coverage bias can be accurately calibrated from low-pass sequencing (∼0.1 × ) to predict the depth-of-coverage yield of single-cell DNA libraries sequenced at arbitrary depths. We further provide a benchmark comparison of single-cell libraries generated by multi-strand displacement amplification (MDA) and multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC). Finally, we develop statistical models to calibrate allelic bias in single-cell whole-genome amplification and demonstrate a census-based strategy for efficient and accurate variant detection from low-input biopsy samples."

Here we adapt MALBAC for single-cell transcriptome amplification, which gives consistently high detection efficiency, accuracy and reproducibility. With this newly developed technique, we successfully amplified and sequenced single cells from 3 germ layers from mouse embryos in the early gastrulation stage, and examined the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program among cells in the mesoderm layer on a single-cell level."

Whole genome amplification (WGA) is a key step in single-cell sequencing workflows and a multitude of methods have been introduced. Here, we compare three state-of-the-art methods on both bulk and single-cell samples of E. coli DNA: Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA), Multiple Annealing and Looping Based Amplification Cycles (MALBAC), and the PicoPLEX single-cell WGA kit (NEB-WGA). We considered the effects of reaction gain on coverage uniformity, error rates and the level of background contamination. We compared the suitability of the different WGA methods for the detection of copy-number variations, for the detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and for de-novo genome assembly. No single method performed best across all criteria and significant differences in characteristics were observed; the choice of which amplifier to use will depend strongly on the details of the type of question being asked in any given experiment."

Whole-genome amplification is crucial to generate sufficient DNA fragments for single-cell sequencing projects. Using sequencing data from single sperms, we quantitatively compare two prevailing amplification methods that extensively applied in single-cell sequencing, multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC). Our results show that MALBAC, as a combination of modified MDA and tweaked PCR, has a higher level of uniformity, specificity and reproducibility."

The results of MALBAC sequencing were compared with the results of CGH and SNP. The chromosomal status and occurrence of the abnormal chromosomes were investigated. The relationship between the embryos' morphology and the euploid state was analyzed.RESULT(S: Among the 23 donated embryos, the MALBAC sequencing results of 18 (78.26%) embryos were identical to those of CGH or SNP, including 8 embryos that had identical results by all three techniques. In terms of euploidy, only 6 of these 23 embryos (26.09%) were diploid. Blastomere abnormality was observed in all autosomes and sex chromosomes. In addition, the frequency of abnormality was different for certain chromosomes.CONCLUSION(S: With sequencing at 0.04× genome depth, MALBAC sequencing has been validated as a satisfactory method for 24-chromosome aneuploidy screening. The proportion of abnormal chromosomes was high in cleavage-stage embryos, and any chromosome could be abnormal."

This device, made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), allows us to monitor the whole process of cell loading and single-cell WGA for sequencing. We show that the genome coverage of MALBAC amplifications is reproducible between chambers on a single chip and between different chips, which enables data normalization using standard samples to accurately identify copy number variations (CNVs). This device provides an easy-to-operate approach to perform single cell sequencing library preparation with minimum hands-on time. It reduces the requirement of manual expertise as well as the risk of contamination, which is essential in future applications especially the medical diagnosis."
"24360273";"MALBAC";"MALBAC";"Cell";21;2013;"Genome analyses of single human oocytes.";"Single-cell genome analyses of human oocytes are important for meiosis research and preimplantation genomic screening. However, the nonuniformity of single-cell whole-genome amplification hindered its use. Here, we demonstrate genome analyses of single human oocytes using multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycle (MALBAC)-based sequencing technology. By sequencing the triads of the first and second polar bodies (PB1 and PB2) and the oocyte pronuclei from same female egg donors, we phase the genomes of these donors with detected SNPs and determine the crossover maps of their oocytes. Our data exhibit an expected crossover interference and indicate a weak chromatid interference. Further, the genome of the oocyte pronucleus, including information regarding aneuploidy and SNPs in disease-associated alleles, can be accurately deduced from the genomes of PB1 and PB2. The MALBAC-based preimplantation genomic screening in in vitro fertilization (IVF) enables accurate and cost-effective selection of normal fertilized eggs for embryo transfer."
"23258894";"MALBAC";"MALBAC";"Science";86;2012;"Genome-wide detection of single-nucleotide and copy-number variations of a single human cell.";"Kindred cells can have different genomes because of dynamic changes in DNA. Single-cell sequencing is needed to characterize these genomic differences but has been hindered by whole-genome amplification bias, resulting in low genome coverage. Here, we report on a new amplification method-multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC)-that offers high uniformity across the genome. Sequencing MALBAC-amplified DNA achieves 93% genome coverage ≥1x for a single human cell at 25x mean sequencing depth. We detected digitized copy-number variations (CNVs) of a single cancer cell. By sequencing three kindred cells, we were able to identify individual single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), with no false positives detected. We directly measured the genome-wide mutation rate of a cancer cell line and found that purine-pyrimidine exchanges occurred unusually frequently among the newly acquired SNVs."
